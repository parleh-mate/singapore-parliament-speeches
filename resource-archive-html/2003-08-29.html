<div align="center"><b>(Strengthening of security measures)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Minister for

Home  Affairs (a) what steps have been taken or  will  be

taken   to  strengthen  security  at  possible  terrorist

targets  such  as major hotels, tourist and other  public

areas;   and  (b)  whether  security  and  other   allied

personnel  will be given more training to  enhance  their

capabilities  to identify and prevent possible  terrorist

attacks.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have increased our security measures

since  September  11th. These have  been  further  raised

following the Bali bombing incident in October 2002.   We

now  conduct 100% security checks on all arriving persons

and  their  belongings at our land and  sea  checkpoints.

All  vehicles  passing our land checkpoints are  checked.

Our  vital installations and high-risk establishments are

guarded  round  the clock. These include Changi  Airport,

Jurong Island and foreign embassies assessed to be  under

threat.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2713</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also hardened the so-called "soft" targets

such   as   hotels,  pubs,  large  entertainment  outlets

frequented  by  foreigners and locals,  as  well  as  key

commercial and shopping areas.  Besides increasing Police

patrols  and  deploying  guards,  road  engineering   and

infrastructure  works  have  also  been  carried  out  to

enhance  security.   While the  public  may  suffer  some

inconvenience,  these  works  are  necessary  to  enhance

security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The community's partnership is important in our

fight  against terrorism.  The Government  cannot  do  it

alone.   While  the Government would do  all  it  can  to

safeguard  the  level of security in Singapore,  business

and  building owners also have to safeguard the  security

of their own buildings.  Each building's management has a

part to play.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has been proactively engaging specific

groups,  such  as  hotel operators and  owners  of  large

commercial buildings to brief them on the current  threat

assessment  and measures that they should take  to  guard

against  a terrorist attack.  For example, following  the

Jakarta's  Marriott Hotel bombing on  5th  August,  hotel

operators  and owners of large commercial buildings  were

briefed by the Ministry of Home Affairs the very next day

on  security  measures  to take.   This  had  a  positive

impact.   I am sure Members would have read the newspaper

reports of a visible increase in the security measures of

hotels and other public places.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, much more can be done. The Deputy Prime

Minister  and  Coordinating  Minister  for  Security  and

Defence, Dr Tony Tan and myself, will be meeting the  top

management of hotel operators, shopping centres, property

holding  and management companies, to impress  upon  them

the  need  to  work  in  partnership  with  the  security

agencies  to further enhance security measures for  their

buildings. The briefing will be held on 2nd September.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dealing with the current security situation requires

the collective efforts of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2714</b></font><br><br>

community,  the  private sector and  the  security  guard

agencies. The Police has put in place the National Skills

Recognition Scheme (NSRS), an accreditation scheme  where

private  security  agencies will be rated  based  on  the

training and capabilities of their security guards.  This

grading  exercise should motivate security guard agencies

to  enhance  the  training  of their  guards  beyond  the

minimal  level imposed by the Police. The grading  system

will  also  provide the customers with better information

in their selection of security guard agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides encouraging private security agencies to

upgrade  their skills, the training provided  would  also

upgrade  the  skills and competency level of the  private

security   agencies.   One  of  the   core   competencies

identified  under  the  scheme is the  handling  of  bomb

threats.  This will ensure that security guards  deployed

at  commercial buildings are equipped with the  necessary

skills to deal with the terrorist threat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security is now everyone's responsibility. Only

through  working together can we weather this  period  of

uncertainty to ensure better security in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, I would like

to  ask  the  Minister  how many security  agencies  have

actually  come  forward  to subscribe  to  the  NSRS  for

security   guards,  and  if  there  are  any   plans   to

incentivise  these security agencies to come  forward  to

submit themselves to the NSRS training.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> For any security guard agency to

continue  to  hold a licence, they will need  to  certify

their  guards.   A grading system will be  given  to  the

guard agencies according to the percentage of guards that

they   have   trained  under  the  skills   certification

programme. The information will be available to all users

who  want  to  hire security guards from  such  agencies.

They  will  then have a better idea on who,  among  them,

have  better-trained or more trained staff to  deal  with

the issues that they have in hand.

<div align="center"><b>FLEXIBLE WAGE SYSTEM</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Implementation by the private sector)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Acting Minister

for  Manpower (a) what are the main reasons cited by  the

private  sector  for not implementing the  flexible  wage

system;  and  (b) what steps have the Ministry  taken  or

will  be taking to encourage more companies to adopt  the

flexible wage system.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi (Parliamentary Secretary to the Acting Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Acting Minister for Manpower (Mr Hawazi Daipi) (for the Acting Minister for Manpower):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, wage reform has been carried

out  since  1986  when  the then  Wage  Reform  Committee

recommended  that  our wage system should  be  made  more

responsive to changing business conditions and  hence,  a

flexible wage system should be implemented.  The flexible

wage  system should include an Annual Variable  Component

(AVC)  constituting 20% of total wages linked to  company

performance.  Since then, more than 85% of companies have

implemented  some  form  of flexible  wage  system.   The

average AVC varied from year to year, ranging from 13% to

16%  of total wages, depending on economic conditions and

profitability of firms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further enhance the flexibility of our wage

system, the NWC in 1999 recommended the implementation of

the Monthly Variable Component (MVC) to form 10% of total

wages.    The  recommended  flexible  wage  system   thus

comprises 70% fixed basic wages, 20% AVC and 10% MVC.  On

the  implementation of MVC, progress has been made in the

unionised  sector.  As at December 2002, 39% of unionised

companies  have  implemented  the  MVC.   This   compares

favourably with 11% in 1999, 29% in 2000 and 34% in 2001.

In  the non-unionised sector, however, the implementation

rate of MVC is significantly lower, registering only 3.9%

of   non-unionised   companies   surveyed,   a   marginal

improvement from 3.4% in 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on feedback from employers, one of the reasons

for the slow implemen-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2716</b></font><br><br>

tation  of MVC was the economic downturn in recent years,

which  saw  many  companies granting little  or  no  wage

increases.  As MVC was originally recommended to be built

up  from future wage increases, many companies which  did

not  pay  wage  increases were not able to implement  the

component.  The concern that MVC could only be cut  in  a

business  loss situation also discouraged companies  from

implementing it.  Other reasons inhibiting companies from

implementing   MVC   include   the   concern   that   the

introduction  of  MVC would make wage administration  too

complex.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to our seniority-based wage system, individual

performance  and  contribution are  also  not  adequately

recognised  and  rewarded.  Changes  should  be  made  to

replace   the   seniority-based  wage   system   with   a

performance-based wage system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help expedite the implementation of a wage system

which   could   link  rewards  closely  to  company   and

individual  performance,  the  Ministry  has  set  up   a

Tripartite  Taskforce  to  study  the  issues  and   make

recommendations.    It  is  headed   by   the   Permanent

Secretary,  Ministry  of Manpower,  with  representatives

from  employers  and  trade unions and  its  studies  are

expected to be completed by the end of the year.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Parliamentary Secretary on whether the civil  service  is

already  fully on a flexible wage system.  Assuming  that

it is, considering that the civil service is largely used

as  a  barometer  of our wage levels,  because  GLCs  and

statutory  boards largely follow them,  how  is  it,  for

instance,  from  the PERC's survey, we are  perceived  to

have  very  high  wage  levels  in  comparison  to  other

countries?

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, the civil service is already

implementing the flexible wage system.  If you  study  it

carefully, the civil service gives the variable component

either  at  the end of the year or in the middle  of  the

year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2717</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total wage comprises many forms. It can be the

basic wage, the variable component, overtime pay, and  so

on.  The Member is talking about our wage level which may

be  higher compared to other countries, and that is  what

we are concerned with and we are looking into it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, implementing the

flexible wage system is supposed to help us adjust to the

economic  situation.  So if we are on the  flexible  wage

system and 85% of the companies are on the flexible  wage

system,  how  is  it  that  our  wage  levels  are  still

considered high?

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, it is because we are not fully

flexible  yet.  Yes,  we  have  practised  some  form  of

flexible  wage  system based on the 1986 recommendations.

However,  we  find that we are still not  fully  flexible

yet.  That  is  why  we have formed a special  Tripartite

Taskforce  to  study how we can propose to  companies  to

implement  a  flexible wage system so that companies  can

adjust  their  costs of operation according  to  economic

conditions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Acting

Minister for Manpower (a) whether there is an increase in

the  number  of  manufacturing firms  turning  to  labour

supply  agencies  to fulfill their manpower  requirement;

(b)  if there is, what is the breakdown figures over  the

last  five  years; and (c) whether there is any statutory

protection given to these workers employed by the  labour

supply agencies for these firms.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (for the Acting Minister for Manpower):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while the Ministry does not

have the historical data over the last five years on  the

number of manufacturing firms turning to labour suppliers

or  employment  agencies, we have information  for  2002.

Findings of our survey on private

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2718</b></font><br><br>

sector  establishments with at least 25 employees, showed

that  some  12% of manufacturing firms had  made  use  of

workers   who  were  employed  and  supplied  by   labour

suppliers or employment agencies in 2002.  The number  of

workers  involved  was  about 16,000,  which  constituted

nearly  two-thirds of the total of about  25,000  workers

who were employed and supplied by the agencies to all the

firms surveyed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of whether there is any statutory

protection given to workers employed by labour  suppliers

or  employment  agencies, the labour  laws  protect  such

workers  as  they  are employees of labour  suppliers  or

employment  agencies.   If  workers  employed  by  labour

suppliers  or  employment  agencies  are  not  given  the

benefits  as  stipulated  in the  labour  laws,  such  as

statutory   benefits  in  the  Employment  Act   or   CPF

contribution, the person should approach the Ministry  of

Manpower for advice and assistance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir , if a worker is employed through the

labour supply agency and is injured while working at  the

premises  of  the  contracting manufacturing  firm,  what

course  of  action can the worker take  to  claim  damage

against that manufacturing firm?

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, it depends very much on

whether  the worker is employed by the company  or  whose

service is used by the company, and not as an employee of

the company.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> If he is employed by the

labour supply agency to work for the company and, in  the

process, he is injured, can he proceed to sue the company

for the injury?

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> He can claim for workmen's

compensation because he is insured under it.

<div align="center"><b>(Update)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Ms Penny Low asked the Minister for Transport

(a)  if  he  will  give an update of the  land  transport

development  in the Punggol 21 area; and (b) whether  the

Ministry  feels  that the current bus  service  and  road

networks meet the needs of the growing population in that

area.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan (Minister of State for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Transport (Dr Balaji Sadasivan) (for the Minister for Transport):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  Punggol  New  Town was designed to  incorporate  an

integrated  transportation network from  the  start.   In

tandem   with  the  development  of  Punggol  Town,   the

transportation  system  in the area  has  been  built  up

steadily  to  meet  the  needs of its  rising  number  of

residents.



<br><br><i>Public transportation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start with developments in public

transportation. With the opening of the North  East  Line

(NEL)  in  June this year, Punggol residents now  have  a

fast and direct access to the city.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bus network has been keeping up with the

development of Punggol. Since the opening of NEL, a trunk

bus  service (Service No. 83) has been extended to  bring

residents  to the Punggol MRT station.  This bus  service

also  brings residents to Sengkang bus interchange  where

they can transfer to other bus services.  Two other trunk

bus  services (Services 136 and 82) connect residents  to

other towns such as Hougang, Serangoon and Ang Mo Kio.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ongoing projects to further improve public transport

services in Punggol Town include the construction of  the

Punggol  LRT,  and  a  temporary  bus  interchange  (near

Punggol   MRT   station).   When   completed,   the   bus

interchange will allow the operator to introduce more bus

services as the town grows.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me talk about the road network. Within

Punggol Town itself, roads are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2720</b></font><br><br>

being  built by HDB in tandem with the planned completion

of  developments  there.  This is no different  from  how

roads are provided for in other new towns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Penny Low has been feeding back to us the

concerns  of  residents in Punggol about  the  inadequate

road  access into Punggol.  We share her concerns.   This

is  why  we had earlier brought forward road projects  to

improve  the road access into Punggol Town.  As a result,

the  Land  Transport Authority (LTA)  has  been  able  to

recently  open  a new slip road from Tampines  Expressway

(TPE)  eastbound to Punggol Road.  This is  part  of  the

proposed  TPE/Sengkang  East  Road  Interchange  project,

which  will  be fully completed by the end of this  year.

LTA  has  progressively opened the various slip roads  at

this   interchange  to  allow  motorists  to  familiarise

themselves with the new traffic layouts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another project, the TPE/Sengkang East Drive

Flyover, is also under construction, and it will  provide

a  new access link between Punggol and Sengkang New Towns

by the end of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These projects are proceeding on schedule. When

completed,  they  would provide two important  additional

road accesses into Punggol Town, and help to relieve  the

current traffic congestion on Punggol Road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road network will receive a further boost in

2007,  when  the  completion of  the  Kallang/Paya  Lebar

Expressway  will  provide  Punggol  Town  with  a  direct

expressway connection to the city.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operator, the Public Transport Council (PTC) and

LTA  will continue to obtain feedback from residents  and

monitor  the  quality  of public transport  services  and

traffic  conditions.  They will take appropriate measures

to  improve  the situation where required.  For  example,

following discussions with Ms Low and her residents,  the

operator  has  proposed changes to three  bus  routes  to

better link Punggol residents to NEL and other key towns.

The operator has just submitted

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2721</b></font><br><br>

these  proposals  to PTC.  I am sure  the  operator  will

continue  to  refine and improve the bus system  in  line

with the development and growth of Punggol Town.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir-Ris Punggol):</b> Sir, when will

the  temporary interchange be ready and operational?  And

when  it  is  operational, what would  it  offer  to  the

residents?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> We expect the interchange to be

ready  by next year.  And when the interchange is  ready,

as  the population of Punggol Town increases, there  will

be the ability to start new bus services.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> I have also, at various times, fed

back  to  LTA  on  the  lack  of  lighting  at  temporary

shelters.  I understand that this is something  that  SBS

and other authorities could not do except the LTA.  I  am

wondering whether the Minister of State has an update  on

this matter.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> The LTA has obtained this

feedback  on  the  lighting, and they  will  improve  the

lighting at the temporary bus stops.  This is part of the

ongoing  improvement of services on the ground in Punggol

as   a  result  of  obtaining  feedback  from  grassroots

organisations and their advisers.

<div align="center"><b>BUS AND TRAIN FARES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Subsidy)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for

Transport  whether bus and train fares will be subsidised

to  lower the transport cost of workers if employer's CPF

contribution rate is reduced by 6%.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Transport (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir,

the   Government   already  heavily   subsidises   public

transport  by building and paying for the infrastructure,

such as MRT stations and lines, bus interchanges and  bus

stops.   For instance, the Government has spent over  $10

billion to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2722</b></font><br><br>

put  in  place  the current MRT infrastructure.   Without

such  subsidies, public transport fares would have to  be

much higher than what they are today.  However, we do not

subsidise  the  day-to-day operation of public  transport

services.    This   is  to  instil  prudence,   financial

discipline and efficiency in the operators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With over one billion trips made on public transport

every  year,  it  would  cost taxpayers  more  than  $100

million a year, if the Government were to subsidise fares

by  a  mere  10 cents per trip.  This is not sustainable.

Besides, not every commuter requires this subsidy.  It is

better  that we directly help those who are in real  need

through  the public assistance scheme and other community

financial support programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, the Public Transport Council and the

transport  operators are all aware that public  transport

fares  need  to  be kept affordable, particularly  during

tough  times.   This is why there was no across-the-board

fare  revision this year.  Also, arising from the  Public

Transport  Council's efforts to moderate fares  over  the

last 16 years since the Council's formation, overall fare

increases   have   lagged   significantly   behind   wage

increases.  Over the 15-year period from 1987 to the  end

of last year, fares for an 8 km trip on the bus increased

by  14%  (from  90 cents to $1.03 cents) while  the  same

distance  trip  on the train increased by  30%  (from  80

cents to $1.04 cents).  In comparison, wages increased by

almost 140% over the same period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members that the Government will

continue  to  review  measures to help  companies  reduce

their  overall costs.  In fact, one such measure will  be

announced by the DPM shortly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, does the Minister

agree  with  me  that  the Government  can  show  greater

appreciation for the workers' cooperation to the CPF  cut

by  subsidising transport cost for the workers?  Just  as

the  workers are asked to tighten their belts, would  the

Minister agree with me that the Government also needs  to

do its part by helping

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2723</b></font><br><br>

to look into reducing the transport cost of the workers?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, as I have said just now, in

fact,  we  have  done a lot to ensure that the  transport

cost over the years has been kept under control.  And  as

I  mentioned just now, wages increased by 140%, bus fares

increased  by  14% and MRT fares only increased  by  30%.

So,  we  have done a very good job of ensuring  that  the

fare increases are far below the wage increases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the Government is concerned about the impact of

the  CPF cut.  But, as we have mentioned, the CPF cut  is

to ensure that we are able to restructure the economy and

help  create  jobs.   This  is  the  best  way  for   the

Government to help the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of support, yes, the Government is looking

into  ways  to provide additional support to the  people.

And if Mr Chia is patient, he will get news of this later

on.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, does the Minister

agree with me that looking from a group perspective,  the

transport companies  -  SBS Transit and SMRT  -   do  not

need the high fares on the NEL and the trains to survive,

but  that they do need high fares to continue to  produce

good profits for its shareholders?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I think any analyst looking

at  the profits of the two transport operators will  tell

us  that their profits are not astronomical.  In fact, if

we  look at their return on capital applied, we will find

that  the return on capital is actually not high at  all.

In fact, it is very low.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> While there may be a low

return on capital, would the Minister then agree with  me

that there is still profit?  And if we are to change  the

transport  operators and make them private as a  not-for-profit  company, the operators can then run  their  buses

and  train  lines for years without having to  raise  any

future fares?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2724</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, companies are set up to be

viable.   Even if the Government runs a company, we  have

to  make sure that it is viable.   Because if it  is  not

viable,  who  is going to bear the cost of  running  that

company?  It must be the taxpayers.  Do we want  that  in

Singapore?  The answer is no.  It is better to  leave  it

to  the  private  sector.  They will  run  the  companies

properly  and  ensure  that the  commuters  have  a  good

service at a very affordable fare.  We went through  this

last  year when we debated the bus fare increase  and  we

have shown that the transport cost in Singapore, for  the

quality  of service that we are getting, is actually  low

compared to many other cities elsewhere.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, the Minister just now

said that if we subsidise 10 cents per trip, it will cost

about  $100  million  a year.  Can  I  clarify  with  the

Minister  whether the LTA is making big money for  having

awarded a $324 million 15-year contract to an advertising

firm  to  run  advertisement space in the 3,000-over  bus

stops and taxi shelters, whether this revenue can be used

to  subsidise  transport companies, and  where  does  the

money go to?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, where does the money to

build  roads that Mr Chia travel come from?  It  is  from

taxpayers  and from the other revenues that  LTA  raises.

The  money  goes to paying for the building and repairing

of  roads,  the street lights that we get  from  dusk  to

dawn, the building of the MRT system.  That is where  the

money  the  LTA  gets goes into.  It  does  not  go  into

anybody's pocket.  Eventually, it goes to better the life

of  Singaporeans by providing them with a very good  land

transport infrastructure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on the Prime

Minister's Statement [28th August, 2003].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br>1.49 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, in his National Day Rally speech, the Prime

Minister said humorously that he must have suffered  from

amnesia.   I  want  to tell the Prime  Minister  that  he

indeed  has amnesia.  In fact, the whole PAP is suffering

from  serious amnesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last election, the PAP shouted the slogan,

"Support  the PAP for a secure future."  Yet, merely  two

years after the General Election, the PAP  has apparently

forgotten its commitment to the people of Singapore.   It

has forgotten its promise to the people of Singapore that

they will continue to keep their jobs and continue to  be

looking  forward  to a good future.  While  the  PAP  has

suffered from amnesia, the hopes of 75% of the voters are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2726</b></font><br><br>

shattered.   They placed their trust on the PAP,  yet  in

return  their income has been declining. Their rice  bowl

is  still not secure.  Many workers are helpless  to  see

that  the Government is doing nothing to intervene,  even

when those companies who are doing well are adopting "pre-emptive"  retrenchment measure.  Where  is  the  security

that  the PAP was talking about during the election,  can

they recall?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as late as this year's Budget debate, the

Government still pledged in all sincerity and seriousness

that  the CPF contribution rate would be restored to 40%.

Yet,  merely  a  few months later, we are  faced  with  a

further reduction in the CPF contribution rate.  What has

happened?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What puzzled me is that: Unexpectedly, the PAP

Government is like the hare in the fable of "The tortoise

and  the  hare".  Not knowing for how long  it  has  been

sleeping,  it  suddenly wakes up to find that  the  whole

world  has changed - the tortoise has overtaken the hare.

It was as if only yesterday that the workers in Malaysia,

China  and  India were drawing salaries lower than  ours.

Overnight,  we find our competitiveness lost.  Therefore,

our  CPF  contribution and salaries have  to  be  slashed

immediately, otherwise we will not be able to retain  our

rice-bowls.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government can choose not to tell the people

when  it  woke up.  But it has the obligation to tell  us

why  the  workers in the other countries are willing  and

able to accept salaries lower than ours for the same job,

but we cannot.  Why is it that the premiums commanded  by

our  workers as claimed by the Government all  along  can

disappear overnight?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government compares the Singapore workers'

salaries  to  the salaries of workers in other  countries

and comes to the conclusion that our salaries are far too

high and not competitive, therefore our salaries have  to

be  cut.  Why does the Government not compare Singapore's

cost  of living to that of the other countries?  Why does

it not compare

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2727</b></font><br><br>

Singapore  Ministers' salaries to  the  salaries  of  the

Ministers in the other countries?  The Government  claims

that  it  costs much less to maintain the PAP  Government

than  it  costs  in the developed countries  to  maintain

their  governments.  But, how  does  it  compare  to  the

developing countries?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has boasted that every single public

service  it  provides  is aiming to  attain  world  class

standard, such as a world-class transport system,  world-class healthcare system, etc.  Of course, the charges are

of  world-class  standard,  or  even  exceed  world-class

standard,   too!    Now   that   we   have    lost    our

competitiveness,  our workers have to  draw  salaries  of

third world level, yet the charges they have to pay  here

are still of world-class standard.  Is this fair to them?

Their salaries were reduced again and again, yet for  365

days  in  a  year,  from cradle to grave, they and  their

family  have  to  pay  the  ever  increasing   Goods  and

Services Tax (GST). Do not tell me that this is the  kind

of better future that the PAP has guaranteed!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP Government claims that there are jobs

aplenty  in the labour market.  It blames the people  for

not willing to take menial jobs, refusing to accept lower

salaries,  or  not willing to travel a long distance  for

their  jobs.   Please do not put all  the  blame  on  the

people.  Has the PAP Government considered the burden  of

the  people?    Does it know what kind of an  income  the

workers must have to maintain a basic standard of  living

in Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me talk about the CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF system has been in existence before the PAP

became  the  Government.  Its original objective  was  to

ensure that the workers would have some savings for their

old  age  upon  retirement.   Then,  later  on,  the  PAP

Government expanded the functions of the CPF, linking  it

up  with public services, such as housing and healthcare.

As  the  PAP  Government is one  that  is  very  firm  in

resisting the idea of a welfare state, the CPF  has  thus

taken the role of a social safety net, provided by the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2728</b></font><br><br>

people  for themselves.  It has also become a key  pillar

supporting a world renowned public housing programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, changes that the PAP Government made to

the  CPF  system have some shortcomings, the most harmful

of which is that the CPF system has become a tool for the

PAP  Government to evaluate the purchasing power  of  the

people  in setting the charges of public services.   They

use  the savings of the people in their CPF account as  a

yardstick to determine the affordability of our people in

paying for the public services.  The prices of HDB  flats

kept going up when times were good because the Government

said that the people had a lot of CPF and could therefore

well afford them.   When healthcare charges went up,  the

PAP  Government said that the people have enough Medisave

in their accounts, so the medical fees were "affordable".

University  fees went up because the PAP Government  said

that  the people could use their CPF savings to  pay  for

them, and they were again "affordable".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This system has also led to a wrong perception among

the  people.   They  thought that  the  CPF  was  like  a

security for their living and they could always  use  the

CPF  for  their  housing and healthcare.   To  them,  CPF

saving  is  something  which  is  beyond  their  control,

something which they can see yet cannot touch.  So,  even

with  the  charges going up, they are not  so  concerned,

this  eventually  turned  into a mentality  of  accepting

every increase without resistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, the CPF system was used by the

Government as a tool for macro-economic control when  the

economy  is in recession.  Our CPF contribution rate,  at

one  time,  was  as high as 50%.  But when  there  was  a

recession, the Government began to change it.  So at this

time  when  the  people are having problems  making  ends

meet,  they  also  have to face the  impact  of  the  CPF

reduction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that Singapore is faced with competition from

the other low cost countries, to a so-called far-sighted

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2729</b></font><br><br>

Government that claims to have created economic miracles,

this  challenge proves too arduous for their  creativity,

thus  once again the CPF has become the sacrificial  lamb

of the PAP Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any changes to the CPF policy would have far-reaching repercussion on the cost of living of the

Singapore  people.  Their choices of housing,  healthcare

services,   retirement  plans  and  even  the  children's

university education were to a large extent dependent  on

the  amount of CPF they have in their account.  Once  the

Government  resorts  to the use of  CPF  as  an  economic

management tool, a fluctuating CPF rate has become a trap

to  many people, caught them off guard in their financial

planning at the time of change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, the Government wants the people to

be  responsible  for  their own  financial  planning  and

retirement  plans; on the other hand, they  keep  raising

the  aspirations of the people and making use of the  CPF

as  a  tool  in  managing the economy,  thus  introducing

uncertainties in people's financial plan and  the  people

are  perplexed .  For example, many people have  believed

the  PAP Government's propaganda for "asset enhancement".

So,  they spent all their CPF savings on the purchase  of

properties.   Now  that  the  CPF  contribution  rate  is

reduced  all  of  a  sudden,  they  would  have  problems

servicing  their loan and be locked in a predicament.  Is

this  the right way for a Government to treat its people?

Those  who  have blind faith in the PAP's myth  of  asset

enhancement are the biggest victims of these  changes  of

CPF policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently the Government has run out of ideas in

coping with the current difficulties and has to resort to

cutting the wages and CPF of our workers, time and again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with a new global economic landscape of

intense  competition from developing economies, it  is  a

well known fact that our high land cost is the biggest

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2730</b></font><br><br>

culprit contributing to our high business costs, but  the

Government  seems  to be "sparing the rats  to  save  the

dishes".  It dares not significantly bring down the  land

cost  for fear that it would seriously affect the  assets

of  the  people and they would have to pay a  very  heavy

political price for that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, currency devaluation is another means

that  would create a significant and immediate effect  in

bringing  down  our business cost, but the Government  is

again  not  prepared  to  do so  for  fear  of  political

consequences.   Taking  the  lesser  of  the   evils   in

protecting  their political interest, the PAP could  only

choose to cut our CPF.  However, from the perspective  of

long term interest of the nation and the people, what are

the  pros  and cons of such an option? But the point  is:

even  when  the CPF is reduced to 30%, can you  guarantee

that it would be effective?  If it is not, what would  be

the  next  move?  Will it be a continuous  reduction?   I

think the Government should give us a clear indication so

that our people can be psychologically prepared.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the actual situation now. Many

companies  are  still  making profits  despite  the  poor

economy.   But  the Government is adopting a  one-for-all

scheme whereby all the companies are entitled to a 3% cut

in  the  CPF  contribution.  This hurts the  interest  of

those   employees   of  profit-making   companies.    The

Government  urges these profitable companies to  pass  on

the  savings  to  the  workers in the  form  of  bonuses.

However, the Singapore National Employers' Federation has

clearly  indicated  that they do  not  encourage  such  a

practice.   The  Government should clearly  indicate  its

stand  in protecting the interest of our workers in  this

aspect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Government might even derive some

fiscal  benefits from these changes too.  It  could  gain

from  the savings from the CPF cut of the civil servants.

On top of this, companies may turn profitable or increase

their  profit because of these CPF savings, in this case,

the Government will be able to collect

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2731</b></font><br><br>

more  income  tax.    Is this not a  case  of  indirectly

transferring  the  cut  in the  people's  income  to  the

Government's coffers?  What is the Government going to do

with  this income? Is the Government prepared to give  it

back  to  our  people just like what they  encourage  the

companies which are doing well to do so?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the CPF contribution rate, as early as 1994,

after  analysing the problem of the 1985  recession,  the

Workers'  Party had stated very clearly in our  manifesto

that  the  CPF rate should be fixed at 35%, with employer

and  employee  contributing half each.   Today,  I  still

believe  that  35%  should be our long-term  target.   We

should not raise the CPF contribution rate above 35% when

the  economy is healthy, in order not to repeat all these

problems again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should use the 35% as a fixed

assumption   in   analysing  our   business   costs   and

competitiveness,  and  examine  the   effect   of   other

variables  such  as  the scale of the  Government,  other

costs  which are introduced by the regulatory control  of

the  Government  and land cost, etc,  and  cutting  them.

Together with restructuring the wage system and increased

productivity,    we   can  then  aim   to   enhance   our

competitiveness.  By doing this, we can avoid  disturbing

the CPF and the financial planning of our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, most people in Singapore are using

almost  all  of their CPF money to pay for their  housing

loans and the increasing medical charges.  The balance in

their  CPF  account is not enough to cater for their  old

age needs. If we fix the CPF rate at 35%, it would have a

better  basis  for  our people to plan  their  retirement

plans,  and  strengthen our policy in  preparing  for  an

aging population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the older workers, the Workers' Party in its

manifesto  has stated that workers above 55 years  should

be  allowed to decide themselves whether to contribute to

CPF.   In  this way, it would help them to have a  better

chance of further employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, following the CPF cut, it is even

more important now to seek

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2732</b></font><br><br>

higher  return  in  investing  the  money.   The  current

practice  of lending the money to HDB so that  HDB  could

lend  to  the  people, thereby earning  some  very  small

interest,  should  be revisited.  The  Government  should

consider  setting up a centralised CPF investment  agency

to  look  into ways and means of  earning higher returns.

We  have yet to see any Government action in this aspect.

The  Government should make known their plan.  Of course,

there will be risks in any investment.  But we should let

the people choose among various investment plans, ranging

from high risk high returns, to low risk low returns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it takes more than one cold day for

the river to freeze three feet deep.  The predicament  of

Singaporeans facing both the cuts in wages and CPF  of  a

loss-loss  situation could have been  brewing  for  quite

some  time.  The problem could have rooted  way  back  in

1986.   The PAP Government has all along been very  proud

of     this    Government-employer-employee    tripartite

establishment.  It used to boast of the tripartite system

being  a  triple win situation.  But as it turns out,  we

all  know  that there is only a sole loser - the workers.

They  are  being sacrificed whenever there is an economic

recession.   Even though the Government is confident that

our economy will recover, if it is a jobless recovery, if

the reduction in our business costs is still not able  to

stop  companies from relocating, if the people are facing

prolonged unemployment, should not the Government re-look

into  the  possibility of setting up some sort of  social

safety net?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP has been thinking of themselves too highly

when  faced with an intense global competition.  The  PAP

Government has been saying all the time that Singapore is

enjoying  a  premium of a good, effective  and  efficient

Government, as well as our first class infrastructure, we

are  far better than our competitors in many aspects  and

are  holding many world's No. 1 trump cards. It is not  a

problem  in competing with other low cost economies  even

though  our costs are high.  When the people complain  of

high  business  costs and high cost of  living,  the  PAP

always alleges that people are crying

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2733</b></font><br><br>

"wolf".   Then,  all of a sudden, we find many  companies

relocating  to  other countries resulting  in  waves  and

waves   of  retrenchments,  we  see  the  major  shipping

companies  moving to a Malaysian port.  Only then the PAP

woke  up,  panicked  and  started talking  about  cutting

business costs as a life and death matter.  But  when  it

comes  to cost cutting, it is the workers' salaries  that

are  being  cut.   To  add more burden  to  our  workers,

charges in public services, utilities, transportation and

education  fees are increased at the time of salary  cut.

People  are suffering, in so far as these are the results

of an arrogant and headstrong Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the election, the PAP painted a rosy

picture  and committed to restoring the CPF rate back  to

40%,  they even put money in the people's pockets.   Once

the  election was over, they cannot wait any  further  to

take this money back through an immediate increase in the

GST  rate.  Now they are asking the people to forget  the

PAP's  promise  of  the restoration of  CPF  contribution

rate,  in  a  light tone.  The PAP Government  has  acted

perfidiously,  has broken faith with the people  and  let

down the people.  They should apologise to the people  of

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in  this  debate, Members have  raised  many  valid

issues and concerns.  I would like to comment on some  of

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On entrepreneurship, like Members, I was

considerably cheered by the Prime Minister  who  said  in

his  National  Day  Rally speech  that,  henceforth,  the

Government  would set its default key  at  "Yes"  in  its

dealings with business.  I met an analyst, shortly  after

the National Day Rally speech, and he asked me, "What  is

the  "big deal", because several people had been involved

in  the  entrepreneurship movement and held this position

for  quite some time."  But this is a "big deal"  because

Mr  Goh  Chok Tong is the Prime Minister.  And as we  all

know when the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2734</b></font><br><br>

Prime  Minister makes a pronouncement, it has a wonderful

effect  of  concentrating  people's  minds  and  speeding

things up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Members will be happy to know that the winds of

change are already blowing.  It may not be as fast or  as

hard  as some would like it but it is beginning to  shift

old mindsets.  Increasingly, our regulators are taking  a

pro-enterprise approach in their dealings with  business.

One out of two suggestions received by the Pro-Enterprise

Panel is accepted.  The Government takes cutting red tape

so  seriously that it has now set up a dedicated  website

to do this - www.cutredtape.gov.sg.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am optimistic about this entrepreneurship movement

that  we  are  embarking on.  This  is  because  societal

attitudes  towards entrepreneurs are changing.  Recently,

I  was  at the NTU's Technopreneurship Centre and  I  was

told  that  close  to  half of the 49  graduates  of  its

inaugural  batch in the Technopreneurship and  Innovation

Programme  had  chosen to start up their own  businesses.

Many  of these graduates had several job offers but  they

chose the road less travelled.  So we are rekindling this

spirit  of enterprise in our people.  These young  people

from  NTU  give  us  hope  for the  future  as  they  are

practising, what I call, the Nike strategy towards  life:

"Just do it."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have also argued that to keep costs

competitive,  it  should not be confined  to  wage  costs

alone.   I fully agree.  It stands to reason that  if  we

ask  Singaporeans to take a cut in their CPF contribution

rates, that they have a right to expect that other  costs

would be kept down too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been doing and will continue to

do  its part.  We are getting rid of unnecessary licences

and  rules,  putting them on-line and reducing Government

fees  and  charges  as a matter of  priority.   URA,  for

instance, recently announced significantly lower  charges

for  businesses that wish to change their trades or alter

their premises.  The Registry of Companies and Businesses

has reduced business registration fees by half.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2735</b></font><br><br>

And  HDB  now  allows entrepreneurs  to  start  up  small

businesses in their own homes, thereby reducing  start-up

costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these ongoing efforts, the Government is

seeking to keep industrial rents competitive through  its

industrial    land   sales   programme.    For    greater

flexibility, JTC introduced shorter-tenure land  in  2002

to  lower start-up costs.  JTC also allows the conversion

of  existing fixed rate leases to floating rates with  an

escalation  cap  to moderate business costs  and  provide

more certainty to business planning.  Since 2001, JTC has

offered  rebates of up to 20%, amounting  to  savings  of

$1.1 billion for some 7,000 companies until December this

year.   JTC  also conducts regular reviews of  industrial

rentals  and  prices  to  ensure  that  they  match   the

prevailing market conditions.  The two reviews in January

and  July this year have resulted in an average reduction

of  4%  for land rentals and 11% for ready-built rentals.

For the industrial property market as a whole, prices  of

industrial  space  have slid about 25%  since  2001,  and

rentals    of    industrial   facilities   have    fallen

approximately  13% over the same period.  Going  forward,

the  Government  will also be looking into  international

benchmarking   to  ensure  that  industrial   rents   are

competitive against alternative locations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I agree with Members that we have to keep

reviewing  Government  services, keep  looking  for  more

efficient ways of doing things so as to reduce costs, and

trim  charges  wherever it is possible  to  do  so  while

recovering costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what we should not do is for the Government to

come  in and subsidise certain public consumption  items,

such  as  utilities.   I have no doubts  whatsoever  that

there  are people with genuine problems paying for  their

utilities because they have been retrenched or  for  some

other  reasons.  I meet them every week at  my  Meet-the-People  sessions.  But the way to help them is by  direct

financial   assistance  rather  than   to   provide   for

subsidised utility supplies for all consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do that, our utility companies cannot recover

costs and will not make

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2736</b></font><br><br>

new  investments in the system.  Without new  investments

to match new demand, we run major risks of having to take

turns to have our electricity blacked out.  This, indeed,

has  been  the experience of countries that subsidise  in

one   way   or   another   to  keep  electricity   prices

artificially low.  In 2001, the price caps in  California

that  forced  their utility companies to sell  at  a  low

price  to  consumers  brought  the  companies  there   to

bankruptcies.   Consequently,  there  were  blackouts  in

California  until prices rose to prevent the lights  from

going  off indefinitely.  In short, Californians suffered

both  blackouts  and  higher  prices.   No  jurisdiction,

including Singapore, is immune to this if we distort  the

market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that, in times of economic stress, there is a

great  temptation to say that just this once, we make  an

exception  to the principle that we will not distort  the

consumption of utilities.  But you know a principle  once

breached is often impossible to resurrect.  If we go  for

short-term  palliative, we would end up with a  long-term

headache.  So we should stick to our approach of  helping

people  in  need  by  subsidising the  users  directly  - through utilities rebate and direct financial assistance,

such  as the Rent and Utilities Assistance Scheme (RUAS),

rather  than  subsidising  the service  or  product  they

consume.   This ensures that the overall public  interest

is  safeguarded by a competitive utilities market and  at

the same time caters to those in need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this leads me to my next point that

we  need to constantly review how best we can help  those

displaced   by  economic  restructuring   to   make   the

transition successful.  This is so because whilst  it  is

true  that labour markets work best when they are allowed

to  behave  just like any other market, there is  a  huge

difference  in  human terms.  An unsold  commodity  is  a

nuisance and an unemployed worker is a tragedy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all the more so as we are now living in a

different world.  Globalisation has compressed space  and

accelerated time.  It has become one world, whether

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2737</b></font><br><br>

we  are  ready  or not.  Some Members, for instance,  are

quite right to point out that the issue is not just about

costs  alone.   After all, China and India,  for  a  long

time, have much lower costs than us.  But they were not a

competitive  challenge then.  What has  changed  is  that

they  are  now  opening  up, part  of  WTO  and  in  this

globalised world, they are competing with everyone  else,

including  Singapore,  for  the  consumer  and   investor

dollar.   So, our costs cannot be seriously out  of  line

with our competitors or we will simply be bypassed.   But

what is going to give us the sustainable edge must be the

quality  of our people.  This is why we invest so heavily

in education and continual skills upgrading.  Despite the

economic slowdown, education accounted for almost 22%  of

our  total public expenditure in FY 2003 as against about

12.7%,  on  average,  in the OECD  countries.   The  OECD

figures  are 1999 figures, the latest I could find.   The

Skills Development Fund has increased from $88 million to

$115  million in the last five years.  In an age of rapid

technological  changes and porous borders,  job  security

comes  not  from putting up the shutters and bolting  the

doors  from  the world, but from picking  up  new  skills

through  lifelong learning.  So Mr Low is wrong  when  he

said  that the Government has been asleep all this while,

as  the  Government has been saying this all  along.   In

fact,  many of you would have heard this before, even  ad

nauseam, but I make no apologies for this, as it  is  the

honest truth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our job is not to shield workers from this reality

but  to  empower them to deal with it and to assure  them

that  they do not have to fight this battle on their own.

We  are  a community and not a collection of individuals.

And  just as we share our prosperity in good times -  CPF

Top-ups, New Singapore Shares and more HDB upgrading - so

too  must  we  collectively help shoulder the  burden  of

adjustment of those dislocated during tough times.  Thus,

the   Manpower   Ministry,  the  National  Trades   Union

Congress, the Community Development Councils and  various

other organisations are making

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2738</b></font><br><br>

common  cause with those affected to help them make  this

transition.   And  we stand open and  ready  to  consider

views  from all who proffer them, such as that by Straits

Times'  columnist,  Chua Mui Hoong, who  argued  that  we

should  look at revising our workers' assistance  schemes

to an employee- rather than an employer-based one.  It is

a valid point.  We have taken some steps here by allowing

the  jobless  to  benefit from subsidised training  under

various schemes.  And we will do more as we shift from  a

world  where workers seek security in lifetime employment

to   that   of  lifelong  employability.   The  Workforce

Development Agency and the Home Ownership Plus  Education

programme  (HOPE)  are  the latest  initiatives  in  this

direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, even as we focus on the big picture - to

generate   growth   by   embracing   globalisation    and

liberalisation - it is vital that we pay heed to  develop

equally  effective adjustment measures to facilitate  the

transition and cushion the worst of its effects for those

displaced.  For whilst the benefits of globalisation  are

often  long term in nature, its adverse effects  on those

displaced   are  immediate.   And  unless  we   do   this

effectively,  we  would not have the  national  consensus

necessary  to  successfully  see  through  this  economic

transformation.  That is the challenge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have every confidence that Singaporeans will

rise to the occasion.  Already, initial business feedback

is positive because they see us as united, responsive and

committed  to  the need to be competitive.  Bob  Johnson,

the  President and CEO of Honeywell Aerospace, which  has

just announced its decision to set up a key international

procurement  office  in  Singapore,  had  this  to   say:

"Singapore's highly skilled workforce, strategic location

and world-class infrastructure are compelling reasons for

Honeywell  to  have  a significant  presence  here."   He

believes   that  the  measures  taken  by  the  Singapore

Government to help companies operating in Singapore  will

benefit them in the long term.  Wong Ngit Liong, Managing

Director  of Venture Corporation Limited feels  that  the

CPF

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2739</b></font><br><br>

reduction,  coupled  with continued  efforts  to  improve

capabilities and skills, would give a boost to attracting

more businesses and investments to Singapore.  So we  are

on  the  right  track.  If we work together  as  we  have

always done before, then Singapore will continue to  hold

its  own  in the First World.  And we would have built  a

better future for ourselves and our children.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  Mr  Low Thia Khiang  said  that  the  PAP

Government  is  having amnesia. I think the  one  who  is

suffering from amnesia is not the Government, but Mr  Low

himself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past 38 years, the PAP Government has

transformed  Singapore from a third world  country  to  a

first  world  country.   The  PAP  Government  has    not

forgotten  its commitments to the people.   What  we  are

doing  now,  such  as  this debate on  CPF  retuning,  is

precisely because the  PAP Government knows the needs  of

the  people.  It  is  taking these  painful  measures  to

protect  their  jobs, and even to create  more  jobs  for

them.  Therefore, Mr Low should go to seek medical advice

about his amnesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wage reform is one of the important links in the

endeavour to  reduce business costs.  Prime Minister  Goh

has announced the reduction in CPF rates and the lowering

of  salary ceiling for CPF contribution. This is a  clear

signal to the market that the Government is committed  to

reforming  our economy and implementing wage  reform.   I

fully support the Government in this endeavour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise some observations on the CPF

retuning exercise.  I hope the Government can determine a

clear  and specific CPF contribution rate, rather than  a

range of rates.  This is good for workers as well as  for

companies.  Business people would like to have  certainty

and  stability.  If the Government does not have a  fixed

rate,  be  it 30% or 36%, they would wonder: "When  would

the  Government be raising the CPF rate again?"  To  play

safe, the business would budget and plan,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2740</b></font><br><br>

based  on the assumption that the CPF rate would  be  the

upper end of the range.  This would defeat the purpose of

our CPF cut exercise.  If this is not certain, the would-be  investors  may fear that the employer's  contribution

rate  may  move back to 36% or even higher, and therefore

put away their intention to invest here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that a cut in CPF rate is never a good

mechanism  in the  lowering of wage cost.  The Government

should  not  make use of CPF as a means of  intervention.

Businessmen  and  the market should have  the   means  to

adjust their wage level.  The Government should not micromanage  the  wage system.  The CPF is a long-term  safety

net for the people.  Therefore, there should be stability

and  certainty in a long-term objective. In this way, CPF

members will be better able to plan for their retirement,

their choice of housing and healthcare needs.  There is a

saying that managing a state is like frying a fish  in  a

wok.  If we try to stir-fry the fish in the wok, then  it

would  turn  out to be awful-looking and not presentable.

Therefore, I hope the Government will set a specific long-term rate for CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should make use of this opportunity to take

proactive  measures to promote the flexi-wage system,  so

that businessmen can adjust their wage cost according  to

the  market  situation in a more sensitive and responsive

manner.   The rate has been lowered by 3%, and this  will

result   in  total  savings  of  $1.3  billion  for   the

employers.  Maybe some of them do not need these savings.

The  Government should encourage, or even by legislation,

companies  which are doing well to make use  of  this  3%

saving  to  reward  the employees by way  of  performance

bonus.   On this basis, the companies can increase  their

MVC  component  to  reward their employees  according  to

their performance.  In this way, we will be able to allow

employers  to use this flexi-wage system to  obviate  the

need to revise the CPF rate again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the salary ceiling for CPF

contribution,  there seems to be a lack  of  flexibility.

Every  retiree  has different needs,  and  we  have  been

encouraging

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2741</b></font><br><br>

people  to  depend less on the Government.   Can  we  not

allow  them greater autonomy in managing their  financial

affairs?   A  retiree  may have very  low  income  before

retirement, and to ask that he should have $120,000 as  a

Minimum  Sum in the CPF, I think, is too drastic.   While

others may have other retirement benefits, do we want  to

force  them  to leave behind such a high Minimum  Sum  of

$120,000?   Therefore, I think the amount of Minimum  Sum

should  be  determined  by the last-drawn  salary  before

retirement   and  whether  there  are  other   retirement

benefits, such as pension.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, with the lowering of CPF rate, our people's

savings  in the CPF will be less.  I would like  to  make

two  suggestions on how to increase their savings in  the

CPF.   Firstly,  we should raise the rate  of  return  on

their  CPF.  Secondly, extend their retirement  age.   At

present,  the rate for CPF is 2.5%.  This is  similar  to

the rate for treasury bonds.  I think this is too low for

any  retirement  plan.   The CPF Board  should  help  its

members earn a higher rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give some examples. For a member who has

worked  for  37  years, ie, from age 25 to  62,  and  the

average  contribution per year is $6,000, if the rate  is

2.5%, the return will be $358,000 after 37 years.  If the

rate is 3%, he will be getting $397,000.  If the rate  is

5%,  he  will be getting $610,000, which is almost double

what is being given now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the total amount of CPF is concerned, the

members'  total  savings in the CPF as of  December  last

year, amounted to $96 billion.  If we can raise by 1%  on

the  rate of return, we will be able to get $960  million

for  them, which compensates almost as much as  the  $1.3

billion  cut  in CPF contributions.  Therefore,  I  agree

fully with the Deputy Speaker, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, that the

funds should be managed by qualified fund managers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second suggestion is that we should remove the

present retirement age

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2742</b></font><br><br>

of  workers.  As long as they are healthy, they should be

allowed  to work, so as to ensure that they are  healthy,

mentally  and physically.  The lifespan of our people  is

80  years.  The  Prime Minister said that they  are  even

likely to live to 100.  The present legal retirement  age

of  62  years  will mean that they still  have  at  least

another 20 years after retirement.  We should allow  them

to  continue  working.  Many jobs do  not  need  physical

strength.  Age is no longer a hindrance to work.  In this

way,  they  will  need less resources  after  retirement.

They  will  continue  to contribute to  the  society  and

depend less on the State.  This will lessen the financial

burden  on  the  society  and  our  reliance  on  foreign

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me focus on the short-term impact. There was a

Lianhe  Zaobao  reader [Huang Shan Chang] who  said  that

clothing, food, housing, transport and healthcare are our

daily  necessities. How do we tighten our belts  to  cope

with  these needs?  The former two should depend  on  the

individual,  but  the latter three  will  depend  on  the

Government.  We should work with the Government  to  cope

with the new situation.  It is inevitable that there will

be  lower  wages and lower CPF contributions.  Therefore,

our  people should make the necessary adjustments.  There

is  a saying in Cantonese: "Eat according to the food  on

the table."  We have to look at the amount of food on the

table  to see how much we can eat, so that there will  be

enough to go round. Therefore, we, the people, should  be

flexible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when I was young, there was a time when

my  father  lost his job. He had to work  as  an  odd-job

worker and as a hawker to support the family. We switched

from  the  Thai  fragrant rice to the cheaper  rice  from

China.  When we ran out of even the Chinese rice, we  had

to contend with broken rice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand that when the people are making

such adjustments, they hope that the Government will also

take corresponding measures.  They hope that the savings,

as  a result of the lowering of CPF and wages, should  be

used to help the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2743</b></font><br><br>

people,  to  lower education charges, transport  charges,

road  tax,  petrol  and diesel tax.  Transport  companies

should also pass on such savings to the commuters.   Cost

of housing, rentals and property tax should be lowered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said "no fish, prawns also can".

If  we  are  determined to reform our  economy  to  lower

business cost and to reform our wage system, we should be

able  to raise our competitiveness in the global economy,

and attract more investors here to create more and better

jobs  for  our  people.  By then, we will not  only  have

ordinary prawns, but tiger prawns or even lobsters!   And

we can then say, "No fish, we will go for good prawns."

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng (Minister, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Lim Boon Heng):</b> Sir, the CPF changes are fundamental and have

long-term   impact  and  benefits.   They  affect   every

employee, which means almost everybody in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, trade unions have been bearing the heaviest

duty of explaining the changes to the ground.  After  the

Prime Minister's National Day Rally speech, 38 of our  64

unions have held discussions by yesterday.  My colleagues

from  the  unions have mentioned the ground  feedback  in

Parliament  yesterday, and more will do so.  I  will  not

repeat  what  they  say.   Rather,  I  will  address  the

question whether our wages are out of line.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short term, two groups of people would appear

to  feel  the impact more.  They would say they  are  hit

harder.   One group are the employees in the 50-55  years

age  group.   The other are the middle-income  employees.

Yet  the  changes  are  aimed at helping  them.   Let  me

explain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have watched retrenchments carefully over 22

years.   My  conclusion is that older  workers  are  more

vulnerable to retrenchments.  They take longer to find  a

new  job.   When they do, they took substantial  cuts  in

pay.   Data  from the Ministry of Manpower clearly  shows

this.  I have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2744</b></font><br><br>

asked  the  Clerk of Parliament to circulate some  tables

and charts, which I believe Members now have before them.

[Copies   of  tables  and  charts  distributed  to   hon.

Members.]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Labour Force Survey of June 2002, those in

the  50-59  years  age  group have the  highest  rate  of

retrenchment at about 29 per 1,000.  They took almost  22

weeks to find a new job, and three-quarters of them  took

pay cuts.  The charts clearly show that this group is the

hardest hit of all the groups that suffered retrenchment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the years, manufacturing has borne the

brunt  of  retrenchments. The restructuring is still  on-going  and it will continue in the future in any  dynamic

economy.     We   become   uncompetitive   in   lower-end

manufacturing and these are relocated.  But the  pace  of

relocation  has  gone up.  Until recently,  most  of  the

relocations  were  to neighbouring countries,  especially

Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the data obtained from unionised companies, in

1999,  out of 7,635 jobs lost, 21% or 1,636 were  due  to

relocation.  This is taken purely from our unions.  36 of

these jobs went to China, but 1,392 went to Malaysia.  So

in   1999,  when  companies  relocated,  they   went   to

neighbouring countries, particularly Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture changed dramatically in 2002. Job

losses due to relocation rose to 30%, from 21% up to 30%.

Out  of 2,343 jobs lost due to relocation, 1,060 went  to

China and only 221 to Malaysia.  Therefore, the preferred

location  now  is  China because of the more  competitive

operating  environment there due to lower wage costs  and

lower land costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, retrenchments in services have

risen.  This  is  most marked in the  financial  services

sector.    Jobs   were  lost  because  of   mergers   and

acquisitions,  deletion  of  jobs  through  the  use   of

technology, and outsourcing of work to cheaper locations.

The  mergers  arose from consolidation of  our  banks  in

preparation  for  the  liberalisation  of  the  financial

services

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2745</b></font><br><br>

sector because of global multi-lateral discussions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there has also been a significant increase

in  retrenchment  of professional, managerial,  executive

and  technical  staff.  About 20% of those retrenched  in

the  past  five years are diploma or degree holders.  The

proportion   is  much  higher  in  recent  quarters,   as

highlighted by the Prime Minister yesterday, as  much  as

43%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we make of these separate pieces of

information?  Are our wages too high?  Our GDP per capita

matches those of developed countries, indicating that our

wage  levels  are at or near their levels.  I  have  also

circulated  a  chart on the per capita GDP  of  different

countries.   You would see from the chart  that  we  rank

among the developed countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But our wage costs in manufacturing are not high

compared  to the United States and Australia.   According

to the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2003, the total

hourly compensation for manufacturing workers is US$20.32

for  the  US  and US$13.82 for Australia.  Ours  is  only

US$7.78.  So for manufacturing, our wage costs are  lower

than United States and Australia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the US and Australia do different kinds of

manufacturing.  They are of higher value added.  Much  of

our  manufacturing work is lower value added compared  to

theirs.  Because of their own high cost environment, they

shifted  these  factories  to other  countries  that  are

cheaper,  including  Singapore, and we  have  been  doing

those.  But just as we do lower value added manufacturing

activities   compared  to  US,  so  do  our  neighbouring

countries, those that are lower value added, compared  to

ours, because their wage costs are lower. For example, in

Malaysia, the hourly rate is US$2.78 and in China, it  is

US$0.59.   But  one  thing that has happened,  in  recent

years,  is that our neighbours have been catching  up  on

skills and ability and,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2746</b></font><br><br>

therefore,  they attract lower value added  manufacturing

from us far more quickly.  They can do it efficiently and

at  lower  cost.   Hence,  the  relocations.   We  cannot

compete  with Malaysia or China in lower wage costs,  nor

do  we  wish to.  We do not want to earn those  kinds  of

wages.   But  we  do have workers now in  relatively  low

value  added  manufacturing  jobs.   If  these  factories

relocate,  what would our workers do? They are our  older

workers.   There are two ways.  One, move up the  ladder.

Two,  move sideways into another job.  The CPF  cut  will

keep  the factories here a little longer, giving us  more

time to adjust.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we move up to higher value added activities, we

need  more  skilled  workers.   You  take,  for  example,

Philips.   Philips used to employ thousands of production

workers  in  Toa  Payoh.   Today, Philips  still  employs

thousands,  but  the  production workers  are  mostly  in

Batam.  At Toa Payoh, the majority are engineers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can our workers retrenched from the manufacturing

sector be converted to engineers?  The sad truth is,  no,

most  of  them  cannot.   So we buy  some  time,  through

trimming  our  wage costs, and all other costs.   And  we

have  to  retrain  them  for other  jobs.   That  is  why

retraining is so important.  As my colleague, Mr  Raymond

Lim,  said  earlier, this is something that we have  been

stressing  on year after year, and have been  doing  more

and  more each year.  So far from being asleep,  we  have

been  very  much  awake, alive to the  dangers  that  our

workers  face.  Many of the jobs that retrenched  workers

will  have  to  take  will  be those  that  are  occupied

currently  by foreign workers.  I hope that  our  workers

will  consider  them.   Other jobs  will  come  from  new

manufacturing  investments, because  one-third  of  those

jobs require lower skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in order to match those looking for work and

employers looking for workers, we have to bridge a gap of

expectations.   On  the  one hand, workers  have  certain

expectations of wages.  They also have family needs  that

have to be taken into account.  On the other hand, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2747</b></font><br><br>

employers expect workers to fit into production patterns.

I  think that the gap really is in these specific  areas.

So,  we have to make a special effort to bridge this gap.

The  NTUC and the Ministry of Manpower are doing  so.   I

would  urge Members of this House, if they can play their

part  to  match these retrenched workers into jobs,  they

would be doing them a far greater service than by arguing

against any cuts or adjustments in CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we move up in manufacturing, we compete against

the  developed  countries.  How  does  the  cost  of  our

engineers   here  compare  with  engineers  in  developed

countries?   According  to the IMD World  Competitiveness

Yearbook  2003, annual wages of our engineers are  higher

than  many developed countries.  Let me cite just a  few:

Singapore,   US$80,000;  Australia,  US$55,000;   France,

US$77,000;   Netherlands,  US$67,000;   United   Kingdom,

US$75,000;  and  United  States,  US$92,000.    Ours   is

US$80,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the wages of our engineers are higher than most

developed  countries.  Not only are they well within  the

top  20%  of wage earners in Singapore, they are  drawing

first  world wages.  I think it would take some time  for

people to absorb this fact because many people, including

Members  of Parliament, were wondering whether  the  80th

percentile  wage  in  Singapore of $3,700  per  month  is

correct.   Those  who asked me, I referred  them  to  the

CPF's  annual  report. They made their  calculations  and

they  found  that the Prime Minister's figure was  indeed

correct, and that many people who thought themselves poor

belonged   to   the   top  20%  of  Singaporeans.    Many

Singaporeans,  who can relate to these  wages,  will  now

know  that they are not earning third world wages -  they

are earning first world wages!  Today, with this kind  of

wages,  we have to compete with the first world, as  well

as the third world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the message here is: we have to attract higher

value added activities here.  To do that, we will need to

do  many other things, and there must be more reasons for

them to find it worth their while to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2748</b></font><br><br>

invest here in Singapore.  But, at the same time, we have

to  recognise that our wages cannot be so out of line and

that  is why if the CPF changes appear to fall harder  on

the higher middle income, this is one good reason why  it

should  be so, because we cannot price ourselves  out  of

the  world  market.  I do not know how the PERC  obtained

its  figures.  But looking at the data that was  provided

by  the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2003, I think,

perhaps, PERC was looking at the types of activities that

they think Singapore is most suited for, and where do  we

stand  in  global  competition to attract  them  here  to

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to services. This sector has been

growing  faster  than  manufacturing.   But  we  have  to

contend with at least two factors - competition from  the

region and competition from developed countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear that back-end work will

increasingly be outsourced.  Let me cite an example.   On

17th  December  2002, Neptune Orient Lines  announced  an

eight-year contract with Accenture Consulting.  Accenture

Consulting  would take over responsibility  for  the  NOL

Group's   accounts  payable,  accounts   receivable   and

accounts  reconciliation  processes.   Accenture  has   a

sizeable   practice   in  Singapore.    Now   comes   the

interesting part.  What they would do for NOL  would  not

be done in Singapore, but in Shanghai.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, for lower level work in services, we cannot

compete with China, India or the Philippines.  So we have

to  go up to higher value added services.  It means  that

we  will  have to do the kind of services that  developed

countries  do.  Here,  our wage  levels  are  similar  to

Australia,  New Zealand and Ireland.  I am talking  about

wages   in   services.   The  IMD  World  Competitiveness

Yearbook 2003 shows that the annual wages of a department

manager are $37,100 for Singapore, $38,600 for Australia,

$34,200  for  New Zealand, and $44,900 for Ireland.   All

these,  again, in US dollars.  So, our wage level  for  a

department manager is of a similar level as some of these

developed countries.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2749</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those in the US at US$69,000 and the United Kingdom

at US$47,000, they earn more.  But our productivity level

in services is significantly lower.  Our productivity per

person  in  services is only US$36,100.  It is comparable

to  those of Australia at about US$39,300, but it is much

lower  than the United States at US$73,900 or the  United

Kingdom at US$50,300.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, clearly, if we hope to grow the services sector,

we will have to improve our productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many factors in productivity, but the key

factor  is a higher volume of business.  In other  words,

we  have  to  look at the revenue part of  the  equation.

That   is   what  the  economic  strategy  of  Government

addresses.  There is a lot more outlined in the  Economic

Review Committee's recommendations that many commentators

have  given  credit for.  It is now for the employers  to

show  that they are doing their part.  As Heng  Chee  How

said  yesterday, employers have a lot to do, and  workers

want  to  see  them  doing it.  They  want  to  see,  for

example,  the Singapore Business Federation and  business

Chambers going out to get business, and bringing in  more

investments.  As Raymond Lim says, there are some signals

that  what  the  CPF changes are meant for  are  working.

Because  some  companies  say  that  they  will  stay  in

Singapore, some companies say that they will expand their

business in Singapore, and some companies say that  there

will be new investments in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we need to do a lot more and workers will feel a

lot  more  comforted if they can see not just Government,

unions  and workers playing their part but also employers

doing  a lot more to show that they are bringing  in  the

business, and raising the productivity of each sector, be

it  manufacturing or in services.  In services, by making

ourselves competitive, the business will come.   And  for

that, the CPF changes play an important part  -  a signal

that in the long term, Singapore,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2750</b></font><br><br>

its workers and its unions are prepared to make sure that

the  wage  levels  are commensurate  with  the  level  of

economic activity.  Then they will come.  Then there will

be  more  revenue.  And if the employers also show  their

part to be seen bringing in business, then Singapore will

thrive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, what we do is to stem the outflow

of  jobs  in both manufacturing and services by  tackling

our costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the measures.

<br><br><!-- Dr Gan See Khem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Gan See Khem (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Singapore  business  sector  strongly  supports  the

Government's   proposal  to  begin  this  business   cost

reduction  process by restructuring the CPF scheme.   The

business sector also appreciates the effort made  by  the

leaders in the union movement in explaining the need  for

wage  restructuring  to  their members,  and  the  sector

recognises  the  sacrifices  required  of  the  Singapore

workforce in this changed process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the local enterprises and the multi-national

business  community in Singapore whom I  have  spoken  to

have  expressed  strong support for the Prime  Minister's

proposal  for  the  changes  in  the  CPF  structure  and

contribution  rates.   Although the business  sector  had

hoped for a straight 6% cut in the CPF contribution rate,

it  does  however  appreciate the fine balance  that  the

Government needs to make to take into consideration  both

the  economic need of the business sector to reduce costs

and  the  social  need of taking care  of  the  financial

commitment and livelihood of the Singaporean employee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many of the multi-national companies operating

in Singapore, they believe that Singapore is an excellent

place for their businesses to operate in.  They value the

high  quality  of labour, the outstanding infrastructure,

the  excellent transportation services and the supportive

Government  and legal structure.  However,  the  relative

costs of running businesses

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2751</b></font><br><br>

in  Singapore have become very high and for many of these

companies,  costs  now outweigh these  other  advantages.

Therefore,  many of these companies are being  forced  to

reduce  the  level of their operations in  Singapore  and

shift them to other countries with more competitive  cost

levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore cannot and should not compete with these

countries  for  the  lower tiered production  operations.

However,   we   believe  a  full  range  of  productivity

improvements  and cost reductions including CPF,  overall

wage  packages, taxes, fees, utilities, vehicle operating

costs  and  real estate are required in order  to  assure

that  our companies can continue to base their key  high-value operations in Singapore at competitive cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with these changes proposed in the CPF, we must

recognise   that   existing  local   and   multi-national

companies  will continue to shift their local  operations

out  of  Singapore just as they have been doing for  many

years.    Therefore,  it  is  also  important  that   the

Government accelerates its efforts to create the economic

and  social  climate  necessary to  encourage  the  rapid

development  of  more  innovative  driven  industries  in

Singapore.    Our  highly  educated,  well  trained   and

productive  workforce  offers significant  advantages  to

innovative companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have some specific comments that

I  wish to make with regard to the CPF changes.  The  CPF

is  an  integral part of the Singapore system.  It forces

employees  to  focus on the long term and drive  them  to

pursue  active  employment and work  in  order  to  build

retirement  income, unlike the tax based social  security

systems  in many other countries.  The CPF scheme reduces

the  social burden on the State and enables companies and

citizens  to enjoy lower tax rates.  The CPF  scheme  has

provided  citizens with good affordable housing, provided

for  adequate  medical security and  it  is  designed  to

support  strong family responsibilities and is  also  tax

efficient for the recipient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, over recent years, citizens have moved

substantial portions of their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2752</b></font><br><br>

savings into housing.  This contributed to the rapid rise

in  housing  prices a few years ago,  and  has  left  CPF

accounts  significantly  depleted  as  the  more   recent

declines  in  property prices have stripped away  values.

Also, the increasing life expectancy of Singaporeans, the

smaller   family  sizes  and  the  ability  to   withdraw

significant funds at age 55 have reduced CPF's value as a

retirement fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business sector supports the plan that the CPF

be restructured to focus on the retirement aspects of the

plan  in a way that assures long-term financial resources

for  the retired worker and also reduces overall cost  to

the  employers.   We endorse plans to lower  the  ceiling

income  levels  for  contribution and  believe  that  the

reduction  of  the  contribution rate by  employers  will

significantly   reduce  business  cost   while   ensuring

adequate retirement savings for the vast majority of  the

workers.    This   action,  coupled  with   the   further

restrictions on early withdrawals, will enhance the long-term security of the CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An immediate reduction in employer contribution rate

by  3%  is  necessary to send the appropriate message  to

companies and workers about the urgency of cost  reforms,

and to provide quick short-term savings to the employers.

However, in the long term, the business sector's view  is

that  monthly  contribution level  should  be  made  more

flexible and more new options should be considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the life expectancy increasing and the

increasing  cost of living and medical care, the  current

CPF Minimum Sum to be set aside for retirement may not be

adequate  to serve the needs of the retiree.  A  possible

scenario is that a wider range of private retirement plan

options  should be encouraged.  The CPF should  focus  on

the  basic and essential levels of income security  while

employers  and employees should be encouraged to  develop

individualised  programmes to  provide  for  more  robust

retirement savings subject to their individual  financial

needs  and  abilities.   Thus,  the  CPF  can  allow  the

flexibility to require a minimum total contribution at,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2753</b></font><br><br>

say,  a range of 20-25% that could be established in  the

CPF account to assure that the basic housing, medical and

retirement  costs are covered.  Additional  contributions

of  a  further  rate  of 10-16% can  be  indexed  through

relevant performance matrix or can be negotiated as  part

of   the  annual  wage  package  to  be  set  aside   for

subscription to a private retirement plan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to link compensation and employer cost to

company  and  economic  performance,  contribution  rates

could  be  lower for fixed monthly salary components  and

higher  for  the variable components.  It is  conceivable

that  when the company performs well beyond expectations,

such    contributions   would   exceed   the    statutory

requirements  and  vice  versa  for  years  of   economic

slowdown.   This sharing of risk and reward  between  the

company  and  its employees will bring added benefits  of

fostering the strong loyalty and bond between the two.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move forward, Mr Speaker, Sir, a rising trend

for  the  new  economy  is  that companies  in  different

sectors  would increasingly rely heavily on part-time  or

casual  workers who will work on a project on a part-time

basis.  Different industry sectors and new flexible  work

arrangements  need  flexibility in the  handling  of  CPF

contributions.  The business sector would like to request

the  Government to further review the provision  of  more

flexibility  for  employers  to  increase  the  take-home

portion  for  the contract remuneration and to  negotiate

lower  or  no  CPF contribution for part-time  or  casual

employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar flexibility will also be a necessity as the

economy tries to attract more SMEs to focus on innovation

and the creation of new businesses.  These new firms will

need  to  start with absolute minimum payroll  cost  and,

instead,  offer larger potential downstream  payouts  for

successful business.  The fixed-rate CPF system will be a

significant  disincentive to this necessary new  business

segment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2754</b></font><br><br>

in  the  Singapore economy.  For the younger well-endowed

part of the Singapore workforce, such flexibility may  be

challenging,  as  the  risks and rewards  will  spur  the

entrepreneurial spirit amongst them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPF reform is only part of the equation to increase

Singapore's  business competitiveness.   Other  wage  and

cost  reforms that were announced by the Government  need

further  reinforcement.  For example, the NWC outline  to

provide more flexibility in pay structures and to replace

seniority-based  systems with performance  based  systems

are   an   absolutely  necessary  programme  to   restore

competitiveness.  This should be aggressively pursued  by

companies  and  supported  by  labour  unions   and   the

Government.   The  key to this reform is in  implementing

structures  with  compensation  packages  based  on   the

relative  value  of  the work being  performed  and  that

provides flexibility to adjust pay rates as economic  and

business  performance fluctuates.  Relative  productivity

of  Singapore  operations  is also  a  critical  part  in

establishing compensation levels.  As noted  recently  in

the  press and earlier by Mr Lim Boon Heng, the  nation's

overall  productivity versus labour costs is amongst  the

lowest  in  the world.  Productivity must improve  before

wages can again increase.  Unions and employers must work

together   to   address   the   fundamental   issues   of

productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other operating costs continue to be high in

comparison  to  competitive markets.  This is  especially

important for foreign firms evaluating their continued or

new   investments  in  Singapore.   For  example,  office

rentals, utilities and other operating costs need further

evaluation as Singapore seeks to attract more innovation-driven companies to set up business in our shores.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I was most moved by the vivid and

simple  language used by my Parliamentary  colleague,  Mr

Nithiah  Nandan, yesterday, when he voiced his,  and  the

labour  movement's, support for the need for wage reform.

At the same time, he urged the business leaders to do

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2755</b></font><br><br>

their  part  in  terms  of  better  management  of  their

businesses to ensure the competitiveness and viability of

the   Singapore  enterprise.   I  fully  agree  that  the

Singapore  business sector and their leaders should  take

up the challenge, both in terms of wage reform as well as

improving the business competitiveness and performance of

our companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message sent by the Government and the Prime

Minister  yesterday  for the CPF reform  sends  a  strong

signal that both the Government and labour are willing to

make   significant  sacrifices  and  changes   to   these

statutory costs borne by the business sector.  The labour

movement  recognises  that  without  these  changes   the

negative impact on the Singapore economy is likely to  be

much  greater as the shift of company operations  out  of

Singapore accelerates over the coming months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, Mr Lim Boon Heng challenges the Singapore

Business Federation and the other business chambers to go

out and bring more business to Singapore.  As a member of

both  the Singapore Business Federation and the Singapore

Chinese  Chamber  of  Commerce, I would  most  definitely

bring the views expressed by Mr Lim Boon Heng to the next

meeting and I assure Mr Lim that the SBF and the business

chambers will rise to his challenge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this note, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the

Government's move to retune the CPF.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  there  is  little  disagreement  that  we  need  to

urgently  address  the  problem  of  our  wage  cost   in

Singapore  and  that  the  CPF retuning  that  the  Prime

Minister  just  announced  yesterday  will  go  some  way

towards this.  It is also clear that wage costs are  only

one component of total business costs and that many other

significant  components need also to  be  addressed  with

equal  urgency, if we are to achieve the desired  outcome

to grow the economy, to safeguard and indeed to grow jobs

for Singaporeans.  Many of my

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2756</b></font><br><br>

colleagues  in the House have already spoken  on  various

aspects of this and I will not repeat their points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for a package to help Singaporeans affected

by  the  CPF changes in the immediate and short-term  has

also  been  brought up, and I am sure that the  DPM  will

address  many  of these concerns later  today.   I  would

like,   however,  to  draw  attention  to  a  longer-term

perspective, and highlight that, while appreciating  that

the  subject currently in debate very necessarily focused

on  immediate and urgent matters, we do not lose track in

the  process  of  the  longer-term  retirement  needs  of

Singaporeans.    The  huge  challenge   of   our   ageing

demographics  that prompted the formation of  the  Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Ageing Population,  not  too

many  years  ago,  still  looms ahead.   And  the  issues

identified,  in  particular, in  the  area  of  financial

security, stand very much at risk in the current scenario

of the impending diminished contributions to CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At $252 or even $378 a month, our senior citizens

will  be hard-put to make ends meet.  Worse still,  there

are  significant numbers of older people right  now,  and

into the foreseeable future, who will not manage to reach

the  targeted  Minimum Sum at retirement on  which  these

calculations are based.  For too long, Singaporeans  have

grown  up  and grown old thinking that their CPF  savings

would    take    care   of   their   retirement    needs.

Unfortunately, along the way we have been led into  using

the  scheme  to achieve other objectives,  such  as  home

ownership  and healthcare financing, leaving insufficient

cash  for  the original and primary objective.   So  many

needs  and  requirements have been intertwined  into  the

whole  scheme that we can see, even though with  so  many

powerful minds that we have in the Cabinet, it is proving

very  difficult to implement changes to achieve  one  end

without doing severe injury to other parts of the whole - a  clear illustration of the teachings in Economics  101,

as  they say, that you should use one instrument for  one

objective.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2757</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that CPF alone is not enough and

Government  must look at what can be done  to  supplement

CPF  as  the  only source of retirement income  on  which

people  rely  on  their old age.  An analogy  I  recently

heard likens it to drinking from only one well.  If  that

well   runs  dry,  it  is  a  disaster.   I  would  like,

therefore,   to  urge  that  in  our  new  and   evolving

circumstances, we rethink to consider a system  where  we

can  draw from many other wells, including some  such  as

minimum  pension benefits, social security-type  systems,

insurance-based instruments, private retirement plans, as

my  colleague,  Dr  Gan  has just  mentioned,  and  other

schemes that financial and economic experts can design.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know we have always in the past responded

negatively   to   any   such   suggestions.    But    the

circumstances  have  changed from our  heady  high-growth

full-employment  days  when we  could,  with  confidence,

sweepingly dismiss those who do not put enough aside  for

their  own  old age as perhaps people who are not  trying

hard  enough  and who should not be encouraged  in  their

grasshopper  ways.  I believe it is time  to  pause,  and

after  this quick action, to respond to immediate  needs,

to  do  a  thorough review of how we need to  drill  more

wells  for a more robust system for the retirement  needs

of  our population, not just for the top 20% but for  the

majority, into the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just concerned that we will see a repetition of

a  situation  similar  to what we are  experiencing  with

structural  unemployment.   We  had  actually  identified

structural unemployment as a concern many years ago,  and

I  remember serving on more than one committee, where the

subject  was discussed.  But because the problem did  not

seem  imminent at that time, we just did not  pay  enough

attention to pushing hard enough for solutions and now we

find  ourselves unprepared, smack in the  middle  of  the

problem.  Let us not be caught similarly unprepared  with

the  retirement needs of older Singaporeans when the  day

comes that the over-65s

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2758</b></font><br><br>

form 20% of our population.  At that time, there will  be

too  many for us to take that case-by-case approach  that

our Ministers favour currently when we bring up issues of

needs of various segments of the population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, before I end, I would like to pick up one

point  for  a  specific group, and that is  homemakers  - housewives  who  are  dependent on  their  husbands,  and

subsequently   their  children,  for  financial   support

because  they are not in the workforce.  They  would,  of

course, not have a CPF account, and if they do, it  would

generally  be  an inactive one with a minuscule  balance.

They  have totally no say in what their spouses  do  with

their  own  CPF  balances  and, particularly,  after  the

withdrawal  age of 55.  I am happy, therefore,  that  the

Minimum  Sum will need in future to be topped  up  before

withdrawal  is  allowed so that at least that  amount  of

money  is  not unthinkingly spent on pursuit of immediate

gratifications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the problem remains that a spouse could

will  away  his CPF balance, leaving his widow without  a

cent.   I,  and many other colleagues in the House,  past

and  present,  have broached the subject before,  without

success,  of  splitting or sharing the CPF account  of  a

person   with   a  non-working  spouse.    As   part   of

Government's  review  of  the  system,  may  I  bring  an

alternative  solution,  namely,  to  require   that   the

endorsement  of the spouse is required for nomination  of

beneficiaries  to  CPF accounts and  for  any  subsequent

changes to the nominees.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, I rise in

support  of the policies that had been announced  by  the

Prime  Minister to retune the CPF system.  Sir,  for  the

longest  time  the  CPF  system  has  fostered   a   high

compulsory  saving  regime  in  Singapore,  probably  the

highest  in the world and this policy adjustment that  we

are going through now, while it is difficult and comes at

a  time  when  we  could do without it at the  individual

level,  I think it is an opportunity for us at the system

level to recalibrate and reposition for the long term.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2759</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question I wanted to address was what

signal this set of measures has sent out to the market in

general.   It  is quite clear that the Government's  move

from  a 40% contribution rate to a 36% contribution  rate

has  been  unambiguously understood and received  by  the

market.   Businesses see this as a clear signal from  the

Government  that it recognises the competitive  pressures

that   businesses  are  under  in  Singapore   and   they

appreciate  the readiness of the Government to  undertake

some  painful  and  tough measures in  order  to  sustain

competitiveness.    At  the  level  of   the   individual

Singaporean and the worker, that move from 40% to 36% has

also   communicated  the  radically  different   economic

environment we are in and the need to moderate  our  wage

expectations, and with it, in a sense to recalibrate  our

lifestyles.   So that move from the 40% to 36%  has  been

communicated and received with relative clarity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the 33% peg for the revised contribution

rate  and the range the Prime Minister has announced from

30-36% has given rise to some mixed signals.  In the case

of  the  business community, some preliminary feedback  I

get  is that while they appreciate the 3% reduction  they

see  this  as a short-term reduction in cost because  the

Government  has  retained  the  option  to  go  up  to  a

statutory  rate  of  as high as 36%.   So  for  long-term

business planning purposes, they will continue to use the

36%  number  as their reference point.  So if our  intent

was  to  signal to businesses there is a lower  rate  and

that  should  affect  their  business  decisions  in  the

margin,  then  this  may not have  been  convincingly  or

clearly  conveyed.   At  the same  time,  for  individual

workers, I think our intent was to say we need to adjust,

we  need  to refocus on the basics of how we can compete.

That being the case, clearly we did not want them to have

an  expectation or build their lifestyle on a higher rate

of  CPF contribution.  But the focus now is that, yes, we

are  at  33% today but, when times are good, it  will  go

back  to  36%.  And I think that might have an unintended

effect in the way they plan their decisions or make their

decisions.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2760</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this approach of defining a range for CPF

contribution also reinforces the perception of CPF  as  a

tool  of  economic  policy for  the  Government.   As  Dr

Jennifer Lee and others have pointed out, the CPF  scheme

has been loaded with many objectives, superannuation, the

core, and then home ownership, medical benefits.  And  it

has also been used as a tool to reduce business costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new scheme varies the contribution rate from 30%

to  36%,  and that variation will depend on the  business

cycle.    Yet,  our  CPF  scheme  is  designed  to   help

Singaporeans  cope  with  long-term  requirements,   like

retirement, housing where you may take 25-30-year  loans,

and  medical  costs  in the long  run.   So  there  is  a

mismatch  in  tenure because, in that timeframe,  you  go

through many business cycles, at least three or four.  So

there  is  going to be this variation in the contribution

rate  and  it  is  going to create uncertainty.   So  the

question  is  of  course  why  the  Government  did   not

prescribe  one long-term CPF contribution rate  based  on

its   assessment  of  current  economic  environment  and

competitive challenges.  I know this is not an easy task,

given  the  dynamic environment we live in and  certainly

Opposition  Members,  like Mr Low, would  make  political

capital out of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this Government has never shied away from making

tough  decisions, and particularly on this one, I thought

the  benefit  of coming out with a clear reference  point

for  CPF  contribution would give a lot of  certainty  to

employers  and businesses, on the one hand,  and  also  a

clear  signal  to our workforce, in terms  of  what  they

should be expecting.  This would also allow us to take  a

very  definitive position on constraining the CPF to  its

core purposes - superannuation, medical benefits and only

the  residual  should be used for housing and  allow  the

adjustments, if any, according to the business cycle,  to

be  from  variable wages and discretionary  savings  that

individuals  have.   So I did feel  that  the  Government

could  have  been more specific in its recommendation  of

the long-term CPF contribution rate and hope

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2761</b></font><br><br>

that  we  will  get some clarification on  the  rationale

behind the range approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also this question of trust. Has the

people's  trust  in the Government been lost  because  of

this  exercise?   And I heard Mr Low  Thia  Khiang  speak

earlier  that  this  is  a breach.   I  tend  to  take  a

different point of view and this is not hypothetical.  It

is  based  on  empirical data.   Last  night,  I  met  an

individual who works two jobs.  He works part time  in  a

printing company and he earns $500 there.  He works as  a

car  park  attendant and he earns another $500 there.   I

happened to bump into him in the car park and he said  to

me,  "I  heard the Prime Minister's speech  and  I  fully

support  it.  Because I know that when the Prime Minister

and the Government do this, they are thinking of the long-term interests of the country and they are trying to look

after  us."  And it is not just one individual's comment,

it also came from a dialogue I had chaired two nights ago

where  the issue was not so much a lack of confidence  in

the  Government or loss of trust, but it was more  about,

after  this,  what  else can we do in  order  to  achieve

growth and bring back the jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is really the quid pro quo that Singaporeans

are looking at.  They are prepared to take the sacrifice.

They  are  prepared to absorb the pain.  But, in  return,

they  would  like to know when would the jobs come  back.

How  would they be created?  And what else would be  done

to lower the business costs so that more businesses would

stay  in  Singapore or come to Singapore.   For  example,

will  the  reduction be passed through the civil  service

system to achieve lower costs or charges, or will  it  be

passed  on  as well to civil servants so that  they  have

their pay increase in order to compensate for the loss of

the CPF contribution?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, ultimately, the trade-off here that we are

looking  for is also jobs and, in the meantime,  measures

to  help  them  ride through the difficulty.   The  Prime

Minister said that these are extraordinary times

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2762</b></font><br><br>

that  require extraordinary measures, and I  agree.   And

the review of one of the core policies, like CPF, clearly

indicates the gravity of the situation.  But I think this

is  also a time for us to review some other core policies

or  philosophies  that underpin our  policy  approach  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example is our attitude towards financial

assistance to individuals.  Our philosophy has,  for  the

longest time, been underpinned by the desire not to breed

a  crutch  mentality among Singaporeans, not to have  the

welfare state, and to focus instead very tightly on those

who  are  in real need.  So our criteria have  been  very

tightly  defined,  the  processes have  been  stringently

administered so that Singaporeans have to try  very  hard

before  they  can  achieve some level of  relief  through

these measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in a situation today where I think a review

of  our  approach and a broadening of the group  that  we

seek  to help is justified.  For example, we have a class

of  Singaporeans, older but less educated,  who  are  not

likely   to  be  re-employed  easily  when  the   economy

recovers.   They  are the structurally  unemployable,  or

unemployed.  Yet, these are the individuals who made many

sacrifices in the early years in building up the  country

but they may have little savings, both in the CPF and  in

the  discretionary accounts.  Another group  is  the  so-called  sandwiched group whose incomes are too  high  for

welfare  but  too  low to be able to  absorb  the  shocks

through  discretionary savings.  They are  the  ones  who

probably may be earning just over $1,500 a month so  that

they  cannot participate or benefit from the HOPE scheme.

They  are  the ones who may be earning more than  $800  a

month so they cannot rent an HDB flat.  They are the ones

who  live  in  4-room flats with two  children  going  to

school who, on a month-to-month cashflow basis, are  just

barely meeting it so that one adjustment like this  would

cost them considerable adjustment pains.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are not recalcitrants looking for a free

ride, people who come with their cap in hand at the first

sign of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2763</b></font><br><br>

trouble.  They are honourable Singaporeans.  Many  of  us

have  seen them at our meet-the-people sessions and other

contacts.   They  believe in hard work and  they  swallow

their  pride when they come and ask for help, not because

their  work ethic has been eroded but because  they  have

fallen on hard times, and it is beyond their control  and

they are unable to manage the consequences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Government must be prepared in this

context  to come out with both short-term measures  aimed

at  those who need relief during this cyclical period  so

that  they  can withstand the pain and when the  recovery

comes, benefit from it.  At the same time, the Government

must  set  in  place  measures to help  the  structurally

unemployed  or  those  who are going  to  have  long-term

issues adjusting to the economy, as it comes out of  this

downturn.  I think DPM's speech later today would  be  an

important one in that regard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also the issue of another core policy,

housing.   We have always espoused the goal of  universal

home ownership, and I think about 90% of Singaporeans own

their  homes.  The question is whether this policy  tends

to   result  in  an  over-consumption  of  housing  among

Singaporeans.   Do  we put too much of  our  wealth  into

housing?  Do we seek to continue to invest in housing  as

a form of upgrading?  And to what extent is this a result

of  our  general  policy  to promote  home  ownership  in

Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the goal of universal home ownership is

valid.   It  gives  a stake in Singapore  and  we  should

continue to hold that close to our heart.  But how we get

there and how we facilitate that is an entirely different

question.  For example, should Government housing  really

be  focused  in  providing 4-room and  especially  5-room

housing?  Should we not just focus Government housing  at

the  entry  level, or even slightly below for  those  who

cannot  afford it, so that we focus on 4-room  for  those

who  can afford to buy it and review the issue of 1-,  2- and 3-room flats?  The need for rental housing is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2764</b></font><br><br>

growing, not just because of an economic downturn, but  I

think there will be those who may not want to lock up  so

much  of their wealth in a house.  But the rental  market

is   relatively  tight  because  of  the   supply   being

relatively  small.   Can  we  look  at  freeing  up  that

component  of  HDB  housing so that  more  can  make  the

choice, instead of buying, to rent?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tied to that is the issue of whether Government

should revisit its policy of not building any further 1-,

2-  and 3-room flats.  I think we need to calibrate this.

Obviously,   we  do  not  want  to  have  an  over-supply

situation  for 1-, 2- and 3-room flats when  the  economy

recovers.   But  we  need  to  look  at  the  longer-term

position,  in  terms  of what percentage  of  the  public

housing  market should really be at this level of  rental

and 3-room type housing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope the Government would use this opportunity,

not  just  to  stop at the CPF system, but  also  to  re-examine  some  of  these other core policies  which  have

guided  us  over  the last 38 years but,  going  forward,

would  need  to  be  re-examined  and,  where  necessary,

fundamentally  repositioned.   And  I  hope  this  is  an

opportunity that the Government will seize.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore

economy  has still not fully recovered from the  slowdown

in  the  first half of this year.  The Iraq war  and  the

SARS  outbreak  have  taken a  significant  toll  on  the

economy.  MTI now expects it to grow by between 0% and 1%

for the whole of 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF changes are an important step to make

ourselves  more  competitive.   It  makes  a  significant

difference to employers, especially those in the  labour-intensive  industries.  In the short term, the lower  CPF

rate, together with wage restructuring efforts, will help

to save jobs.  It buys time for businesses to restructure

and for Singaporeans to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2766</b></font><br><br>

upgrade  their capabilities to retrain and  reskill.   In

the long term, a lower CPF rate will mean a more flexible

wage system.  And the changes to the withdrawal rules  at

55  will make sure that Singaporeans set aside enough for

their old age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as many MPs have pointed out, while we make

these  strategic changes to the economy,  we  should  not

forget the more immediate worries of Singaporeans.   Some

are  finding  it  hard to service their mortgages.   Low-income  families  are  worried about  making  ends  meet.

Workers  are afraid of losing their jobs, and people  who

have  been retrenched are anxious to find new jobs. These

are  real worries.  The CPF changes come on top of  them,

and will affect nearly every Singaporean.  The Government

will  therefore  implement  a  package  of  measures   to

preserve   jobs,   help   individual   Singaporeans   and

businesses, and promote new business activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures fall into six categories:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Help with mortgage payments;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) HDB policy changes;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Help for Singaporeans;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Help for businesses;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Acceleration of infrastructure projects; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Government cost cutting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures will benefit Singaporeans, especially

lower income earners and the unemployed.  Businesses will

also gain, especially the SMEs. Let me elaborate on them,

starting with mortgage payments.



<br><br><b><i>Help with mortgage payments</i></b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand that many homeowners are concerned

about  the  impact of the CPF changes on  their  mortgage

payments.   Nobody welcomes lower CPF contributions,  and

some  homeowners  will have genuine  difficulties  making

ends meet.  Several MPs - Mr Zainul Abidin,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2767</b></font><br><br>

Mr  Nithiah  Nandan, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua - have raised  this

concern.  Let me assure the House that the great majority

of  homeowners can cope with the CPF changes,  either  on

their own, or perhaps with a little bit of help from  the

Government.  We have encountered and dealt with this same

problem  before.  In 1999, when we  cut  the  CPF  by  10

percentage  points, we accompanied the cut with  measures

to help people who would not have enough to service their

mortgages.   Very  few people actually needed  the  extra

help,  but  the  schemes gave comfort and reassurance  to

many.   This time, the problem should be smaller, as  the

cut  is  only three percentage points.  Nevertheless,  we

will  make  sure that help is available to  everyone  who

needs it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have studied how many homeowners with mortgages

will  be affected. There are 577,000 CPF members who  use

their  CPF to pay mortgages.  Of these, currently 218,000

(38%)  experience  shortfalls,  which  means  that  their

monthly  CPF  contributions are less than  their  monthly

mortgage  payments.  So, they are paying their  mortgages

partly  out  of the CPF and partly out of cash  or  other

sources.  With the CPF changes, the number will go up  to

294,000  (51%),  ie, about 76,000 (13%) more.   In  other

words, right now, about one-third of the people using CPF

for mortgages from other sources.  After the CPF changes,

slightly  more than half will need to top up  from  other

sources.    So,  there  are  going  to  be  76,000   more

homeowners  who need to top up.  Most of them  will  have

quite small shortfalls - less than $200 per month.  It is

those  in  the  higher income group who have  the  larger

shortfalls,  because their contributions to the  Ordinary

Account (OA) are limited by the CPF salary ceiling.   So,

the  lower  income  groups  will  in  fact  have  smaller

shortfalls,  because  the 3% of CPF  will  add  up  to  a

smaller absolute amount.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a shortfall does not necessarily mean a

problem.   Many members with shortfalls will be  able  to

cope, because their monthly contribution to the OA is not

their  only  source of funding.  They may  top  up  their

mortgage payments using their personal savings, from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2768</b></font><br><br>

their  take-home pay or by dipping into their accumulated

OA  balances.  And that is what 218,000 CPF  members  now

do.   After  the  CPF cut, this number will  increase  to

294,000, but most of these members have sizeable balances

in  their  CPF OA, especially the older ones.   In  fact,

about  two-thirds of these people will have  OA  balances

which can cover their shortfalls for two years or longer.

So,  the  first  source of fall back is the  OA  balances

which  people  have  built  up,  and  the  older  members

generally  have built up bigger OA balances  and  so  can

last longer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, unavoidably, a small proportion of homeowners

will  not have enough in their OA and may not have enough

cash incomes to make up the shortfall.  So, we are taking

several steps to help this minority group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, in designing the CPF changes, we have made

adjustments  to lessen the impact on borrowers.   As  the

Prime   Minister  explained  yesterday,  with  the  lower

overall  contribution rate, and the change in  withdrawal

rules  at 55, we have lowered our targets for the Special

Account  (SA)  and  Medisave  Account  (MA)  contribution

rates,  so  that  there  is more left  for  the  OA  and,

therefore,  a smaller impact on their ability to  service

their mortgages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, three-quarters (76%) of CPF members who

experience shortfalls borrow from HDB.  All they need  is

for  the  loan  to  be restructured slightly,  either  by

extending the loan period to lower their monthly mortgage

payment, or by working out a ballooning scheme with  HDB,

if  they need to.  HDB will assist these mortgagors,  and

exercise  flexibility on a case-by-case basis.  In  cases

where  homeowners are already in financial  difficulties,

HDB  allows them to pay their arrears by instalments,  or

to  defer payments temporarily.  And the HDB has  a  long

menu  of  other arrangements to help.  MPs know that  the

HDB, if anything, is forbearing to a fault.  The Minister

for   National  Development  will  elaborate   on   these

arrangements later on.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2769</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the CPF has measures to help from its end.

CPF  members can use their SA to top-up the shortfall  in

their  CPF  mortgage payments, to the extent  that  these

payments  are  affected  by the CPF  changes.   In  other

words,  if your OA is cut by 3% and therefore you do  not

have  enough  in your OA, then you can take out  that  3%

from  your Special Account to pay your mortgage.  Because

you have already committed to the mortgage, I think it is

unfair for us to change the rules on you midstream.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF will also extend bridging loans to those

facing shortfalls in mortgage payments resulting from the

CPF  changes.  If you need to tide over a certain period,

we  will give you a bridging loan.  I do not expect  many

to  need bridging loans.  The last time we did this, when

we  cut the CPF in 1999, only 125 people signed up in the

whole  of  Singapore, and they only needed  to  borrow  a

total of $227,000.  And so far, 45 have already paid back

fully.  So while the scheme is available, it is really  a

final and last resort, in case all the other arrangements

are not sufficient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also glad to read in the papers today that the

commercial  banks  are  also  exercising  flexibility  to

restructure their mortgage loans to help borrowers  cope.

All  these  measures will ensure that very few homeowners

will   experience  difficulty  servicing  their  mortgage

payments as a result of the CPF changes.

<br><br><b><i>HDB Policy Changes</i></b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we are going to make significant HDB

policy  changes.   A main objective  of  the  CPF  is  to

provide  a  steady and sufficient income for Singaporeans

in  old age.  In the CPF scheme, savings for old age  are

intimately  linked with savings for home  ownership.   On

the   one  hand,  an  HDB  flat  is  the  most  important

investment and most important asset of most families.  It

is  an  investment  which should  help  provide  for  the

members' old age.  On the other hand, the flat absorbs  a

large part of the members' savings, leaving

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2770</b></font><br><br>

many  members with only enough cash in their  CPF  for  a

modest  monthly  sum in retirement, barely  adequate  for

their  basic  needs.  Even with the new  Minimum  Sum  of

$120,000,  half of which can be in a housing  pledge  and

half  of  which is in cash, the cash portion  of  $60,000

will  yield a monthly payment of only $378, if the  money

is  to  last until the member is 80 years old.   So,  the

conclusion   is,  we  need  to  find  better   ways   for

Singaporeans  to  benefit from the  value  of  their  HDB

flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB flat is not a dead asset. A retiree should

be  able to use it to supplement the monthly amount  from

his  CPF, either by downgrading to a smaller flat, or  by

renting  it out and collecting rent, and moving  in  with

his  children  or  his  children's in-laws  or  even  his

grandchildren.   However,  our  rules  on  subletting  of

entire  HDB  flats are quite restrictive.   For  example,

until  quite  recently,  the  owner  had  to  be  working

overseas.   And Members will know that many  Singaporeans

tried to get around this by the device of locking up  one

room  -  the body is gone, the spirit is still  somewhere

inside there!  So, in January this year, HDB relaxed  the

rules  to  allow  an  owner to sublet  his  entire  flat,

provided  he  had  not  enjoyed any housing  or  mortgage

subsidy on his flat, had lived in it for 10 years and did

not  have  an outstanding loan from the HDB.  So,  it  is

quite  a  stringent rule: no housing subsidy, no mortgage

subsidy, 10 years living in it, no outstanding loan.  But

only a handful have taken up this scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will now relax the subletting rules further.

From  1st  October 2003, flat owners who  have  lived  in

their  flat for at least 15 years can sublet their entire

flat, regardless of whether the flat had been bought with

a subsidy, and even if they still have an outstanding HDB

loan.  If the flat owner does not have an outstanding HDB

loan,  then he can sublet his entire flat after occupying

it for only 10 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this relaxation, about 250,000 HDB flat owners

will  become eligible to sublet their flats.   This  will

provide  them with a source of income for old age.   From

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2771</b></font><br><br>

perspective  of  people looking for  housing,  this  will

enlarge  the  HDB's  flat  rental  market  and  offer  an

additional   option   to  young   couples   and   budding

entrepreneurs, and others who are not ready  or  not  yet

willing to commit to a house purchase.



<br><br><i>Maintaining home ownership policy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add that encouraging home ownership remains a

fundamental objective of the Government's public  housing

policy  and  a  key purpose of the CPF.   Home  ownership

promotes  rootedness  and  a  sense  of  belonging  among

Singaporeans.  The HDB will price its flats such that 90%

of  Singaporean households can still afford at least a 3-room flat, even at the lower CPF contribution rates.   If

we need to adjust the prices, we will do so. We have done

our  sums  and  we  know  that  even  at  the  lower  CPF

contribution  rates,  at least 90%  of  Singaporeans  can

afford  to buy their own 3-room flats.  HDB will continue

to  help  low-income  families to  buy  flats  under  its

Special Housing Assistance Programme.



<br><br><i>Extending the Public Rental Scheme</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Warren Lee and others yesterday asked if the

Government  could  offer other housing  alternatives  for

Singaporeans.  Minister Mah Bow Tan repeatedly counselled

them  to be patient.  But I am sure that Dr Lee would  be

happy  to  know that HDB will relax its rules  on  rental

flats, but within the overall framework of promoting home

ownership.   Currently, the household income  ceiling  to

rent  1-  and 2-room flats under the HDB's Public  Rental

Scheme  is  $800 per month.  In other words, a  household

with  a maximum income of $800 can rent a flat from  HDB.

Many  MPs have asked for this to be raised. We have  been

reluctant to do so because we prefer to give more help to

low-income  families to buy flats and  become  homeowners

rather  than  to  have them become permanent  tenants  in

rental flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as our economy restructures, some

households earning more than $800

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2772</b></font><br><br>

a  month  will have difficulty sustaining home ownership.

No  matter  how  easy we make it for  households  to  buy

flats,  there will still be some at the margins  who  are

either  not  ready to buy flats, and who need  affordable

rental  housing on a temporary basis, perhaps for a  year

or  two,  until conditions have stabilised and  they  can

commit  to  a  flat.   To help them, we  will  raise  the

household income ceiling for rental flats under the HDB's

Public Rental Scheme from $800 to $1,500 per month.  This

will  cover about one-quarter of the households. However,

households earning more than $800 a month will  receive a

lower  subsidy  on their flat rentals than those  earning

less  than $800.  They will thus pay higher rents, though

it  will  still  be subsidised and very affordable.  This

will  encourage them to purchase their own flats as  soon

as they are able to do so.



<br><br><b><i>Help for Singaporeans</i></b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Government will implement measures to help

Singaporeans  cope  with the slow  economy  and  the  CPF

changes.  We  have done many such measures since  1998  - successive   packages,  successive  schemes,  variations,

alternatives, enhancements, improvements, etc.  Over  six

years since the Asian crisis, we have had quite a lot  of

experience  helping people where it is most needed.  Last

year, we staggered the increase in the GST rate, from  3%

to  5%  over two years, instead of doing it in one  step.

But  we  still  paid  out the full amount  of  the  first

tranche  of  the Economic Restructuring Shares.   So,  we

have  more  than  offset the GST increase  last  January.

This  year's  Budget also included further assistance  to

households to help pay utilities, service and conservancy

charges and housing rentals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs have urged the Government to do more to

lessen  the  cost burden on Singaporeans.  The Government

agreed and we will do so.



<br><br><i>Utilities-Save Scheme</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will provide more help for low-income

families. We will do so by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2773</b></font><br><br>

expanding  the  Utilities-Save scheme.  We  have  already

given  Utilities-Save  rebates  for  households  in  this

year's  Budget.  The Government will now give  a  further

once-off rebate of $200 for those living in 1- and 2-room

HDB  flats, $100 for those in 3-room flats, $50 for those

in  4-room  flats and $30 for those in 5-room flats.   So

Utilities-Save is weighted towards those in the  smallest

flats and the poorer families.  The rebates for the 1-, 2- and  3-room flats will be paid in December this year  and

also in February next year, while the rebates for the  4- and  5-room  flats  will be paid in December  this  year.

These rebates cost $54 million.



<br><br><i>Setting up public transport funds</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, public transport. Mr Yeo Guat Kwang

yesterday  asked  if the transport operators  could  give

vouchers to needy families to help them buy their monthly

tickets.   This is a practical idea, although  I  am  not

sure  that the transport companies want to set up welfare

departments to administer the scheme.  But there are ways

that  it can be done.  The Land Transport Authority (LTA)

has  been discussing with the public transport operators.

SBS Transit and SMRT are working with the NTUC to set  up

a  fund,  to help the families of needy union members  to

top  up ez-link cards or purchase season cards.  The CDCs

have also got together to set up a similar fund with  the

transport operators, so that non-union members will  also

be covered.  This will help to keep public transport cost

affordable  for Singaporeans.  I believe that  the  NTUC,

the  CDCs  and the transport companies will announce  the

details soon.  I urge Members to be patient.



<br><br><i>Containing healthcare costs</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Ministry of Health is getting its

hospitals to go all out to save money for their patients.

The  Cluster CEOs are personally championing this  drive.

There are many ways to treat the same illness.  There  is

a  range of drugs, implants, medical devices that we  can

use,   at  very  different  prices,  often  with  similar

clinical

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2774</b></font><br><br>

outcome.   By  standardising surgical supplies,  such  as

gloves, we save money for hospitals and for our patients.

By centralising purchases of drugs, we get bulk discounts

and  gain bargaining power.  By coordinating better  when

transferring patients between hospitals and  clinics,  we

cut  out  unnecessary X-rays, laboratory tests  and  even

repeat  prescriptions.   If we take  this  economy  drive

seriously,  at every level, there are countless  ways  to

cut out costs without affecting clinical outcome. This is

why  MOH will be publishing hospital bill sizes of common

illnesses so that hospitals can learn from one another on

how  to  render  good reliable medical  services  at  the

lowest possible cost.



<br><br><i>People-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, older workers will need extra help,

especially those who have lost their jobs. These  workers

are  more  likely  to  be retrenched,  and  have  greater

difficulty  finding new jobs.  We are  lowering  the  CPF

contribution rate for workers aged 50-55 to address  this

problem.  However, despite this, older workers will leave

their  jobs from time to time, and will often need  extra

help to make the transition to another job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Older workers have found it difficult to persuade

employers  to hire them, especially in this  current  job

market,  and if they have no track record in a  different

industry.   Mr  Nithiah Nandan argued  passionately  that

besides feeling for older workers, the Government  should

take concrete actions to address their problems. This  is

precisely what we have been doing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme (or PJTP)

gives  financial support and incentives to employers,  to

help  local workers in their 40s or older to make  career

transitions.    Employers  are   expected   to   set   up

traineeship  or  mentorship arrangements  for  their  new

workers, besides providing suitable job opportunities  to

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, 5,000 companies are registered on this

PJTP programme.  12,000

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2775</b></font><br><br>

older  workers, mostly with only secondary  education  or

below,  have  been placed in jobs.  44% of  them,  nearly

half, have stayed on with their employers, even after the

salary  support  ended.  This shows that the  scheme  has

been  effective in helping the older workers to find  new

jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the success of the PJTP programme, the

Government  will  extend the programme for  another  year

until  31st  December 2004, and will commit  another  $36

million to finance it.



<br><br><i>Work Assistance Programme</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, we will do more to help the unemployed.

Unemployment numbers may go up for the next  six  months,

even  though  the economy is showing signs  of  recovery.

Beyond that, unemployment should start to come down,  but

with  restructuring continuing, we cannot  expect  to  go

back  to  the 1% unemployment rate that we used to  enjoy

before  the 1997 Asian financial crisis, at a  time  when

our  economy  was growing rapidly, and restructuring  was

not  yet  a  problem and, if I may add, when our  workers

were all much younger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng suggested a $2,000 unemployment

benefit.  I am sure unemployed workers will welcome this,

but  the  danger of course is that even employed  workers

will  welcome this because surely, it will encourage many

more  people to become unemployed to collect the  $2,000!

We  have seen it happened repeatedly, most recently  with

our  Economic Downturn Relief Scheme.  If there is  money

being  distributed, people will queue  up  for  it.   The

Government  has  to take a different and  more  practical

approach: we will go the extra mile to help you, but  you

have  to  be prepared to help yourself to get a  job  and

improve your skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been providing help through the Community

Development Councils (CDCs). The CDCs provide  short-term

relief to individuals and families in temporary hardship,

such  as when their sole breadwinner is retrenched.  They

administer an interim financial assistance

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2776</b></font><br><br>

scheme  which has been quite successful - it is flexible,

it  is  targeted, it is sensitive.  The CDCs  can  assess

whether  a  case  is  deserving, whether  he  is  helping

himself,  whether he bought a big screen TV to watch  the

World Cup, or whether he is struggling because he is  out

of  a  job  and really needs to provide for his children.

And the CDCs can adjust their assistance correspondingly.

They  have  the sensitivity and flexibility to  customise

their assistance and personalise it and distinguish those

who  really  need help from those who should be  able  to

fend for themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last financial year, the CDCs together spent

$3.3  million  helping  some  10,000  people  under  this

scheme.    Within six months, 97% of the people who  were

helped no longer needed assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen their efforts to help the unemployed,

the  CDCs  will  launch a new programme called  the  Work

Assistance  Programme (WAP). This will provide  financial

assistance  to unemployed Singaporeans and  at  the  same

time  help them to find jobs.  So there are two connected

limbs - financial assistance on the one hand and help  to

find job on the other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Work Assistance Programme will integrate

employment assistance with the current interim assistance

scheme  administered by the CDCs. It will  focus  on  low

income  individuals who are fit to work.  The  amount  of

assistance   will  vary  depending  on  each  applicant's

circumstance,  but  generally will not  exceed  $400  per

month.    Besides  cash,  the  family  may  also  receive

targeted  support, for example, schooling assistance  for

children or a utilities grant. Such targeted support will

address the most pressing needs of the family, and ensure

that  the  assistance  is put to good  use.   This  is  a

practical problem.  If you take a purist approach, when I

give  you help, I should give you money because it is  up

to  you what to do with the money, and you must know what

you are doing.  But MPs know that in real life, that does

not  always work because if we give money to him, he  may

have a party and tomorrow, he will queue up

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2777</b></font><br><br>

again.   It happens.  You can give it to his wife  or  to

his  children, but you really do not want to get involved

in  his  family's  life.   So we will  give,  in  effect,

vouchers,  either  for  transport, school  textbooks,  or

medical  treatment,  to make sure that  the  most  urgent

family needs are seen to first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In return for the assistance, beneficiaries will

have  to  fulfil specific conditions.  They must actively

seek  work.  They must attend all job interviews arranged

for  them,  undergo training to acquire  new  skills  and

accept  any reasonable job offer.  If they fail to secure

jobs within three months, then we will assign them a case

manager,   who   will  provide  more   intensive   career

counselling  and  help them overcome any  impediments  to

securing a job. The financial help will last for three to

six  months,  because  within that time  most  recipients

should be able to get back to work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes an individual may fulfil his obligations

and  cooperate with his case manager and try his best and

yet not find a job.  For such exceptional cases, the CDCs

may  consider extending the assistance beyond six months.

We  need  to focus our help on those who are doing  their

best  to  help  themselves, and not allow the  scheme  to

become an automatic handout from the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some Singaporeans who are unfit to work

because  of illnesses or disability.  The CDCs will  also

continue to give them assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If unemployment goes up over the next few months,

which  is  possible, more unemployed  workers  will  need

help.   Therefore the Government will help  the  CDCs  to

expand their Work Assistance Programme.  We will allocate

$40   million  for  this  purpose.   However,  the   most

important thing is for those who find themselves out of a

job not to lose heart, but to try to get back to work  as

quickly as possible.  The longer a worker is out of work,

the harder it will be to get restarted again.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2778</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Training for Employment Scheme</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, to provide further help for unemployed

Singaporeans,  the Government will pilot a  new  Training

for  Employment  Scheme to facilitate the employment  and

training  of  local  workers.   Under  this  scheme,  the

Singapore  Workforce  Development  Agency   -   the   new

statutory  board which MOM is setting up   -   will  help

companies which have 20 or more job vacancies recruit and

train local workers.  This way, companies will be able to

deploy  workers to the job more quickly and  the  workers

will be better-trained for the job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will set aside $2 million for the

scheme,  which  will run for one year  from  1st  October

2003.   This  will be used to absorb 80% of the  training

cost  of  the workers.  As a partner in this scheme,  the

Singapore  National Employers Federation  will  absorb  a

further 10% of the training cost for its members, so that

the  employer  only pays 10%.  We must  have  that  small

employer  contribution because if  the  employer  is  not

prepared to pay to train their workers, it will  feel  no

obligation  to employ the workers.  And in  three  months

the workers would have forgotten what they learnt and the

training  would go down the drain.  So we must have  that

commitment from the worker and also from the employer.



<br><br><i>More for older workers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventh, we will look after the older workers. Mr

Nithiah  Nandan  does  not like the  phrase.   Perhaps  I

should say we will look after those aged around 50-55 and

thereabouts,  but it will include him.  The restructuring

of  the  economy,  and especially the CPF  changes,  will

affect older workers the most.  Wage restructuring  often

means  lowering wages for older workers, who are  at  the

top  of  their  salary scales.  They will experience  the

steepest CPF cuts to help them hold on to their jobs.  We

are  cushioning  the impact on them  by  phasing  in  the

reduction  in  their CPF rates for them over  two  years.

Nevertheless, it is still going to be difficult for these

workers.   And I think these are the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2779</b></font><br><br>

workers who are the most concerned, because they so often

have the heaviest family obligations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to proceed with the changes, but we will not

forget  the older workers who are hardest hit by economic

restructuring  and who have made a very big  contribution

to bringing us where we are today.  So, the next time the

Government  implements surplus sharing schemes,  we  will

especially remember this group of older workers, and will

give them something extra.



<br><br><b><i>Help for businesses</i></b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, besides helping individuals, we will also do

more  to  help  businesses.  Two sectors especially  need

assistance:   first,   the   small   and   medium   local

enterprises,  and,  secondly, the tourism  and  transport

sectors.



<br><br><i>Assistance to local enterprises</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small and medium local enterprises form a

significant part of the economy.  They employ  more  than

half the workforce and make up more than 90% of the total

number  of  enterprises.  We will help  them  to  upgrade

their capabilities and cope with the current slowdown.



<br><br><i>International Enterprise Incentive Scheme</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chee How rightly pointed out that besides

cutting costs, companies must pursue the right strategies

to grow their businesses and so create more jobs.  If you

are  just  a  cost cutter, you are not going to  grow  an

empire.  You need to watch your costs, but you also  need

to  grow your business and seize new opportunities.   You

need to move ahead and then your business will grow.   So

we  have  to  see the rise of the regional economies  not

only  as  a  major  challenge, but also  as  an  enormous

opportunity.   Our  companies  should  respond  to   this

opportunity by venturing abroad to ride on the growth  of

our  neighbours, such as China and India.  The Government

will step up its efforts to help companies to do so.  The

Trade

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2780</b></font><br><br>

Development   Incentive   Scheme   has   therefore   been

relaunched  and  we  will make it  as  the  International

Enterprise Incentive Scheme with a budget of $90  million

over  three  years,  from  FY2003  to  FY2005.  The   new

International  Enterprise  Incentive  Scheme  will   help

companies develop new markets, build internationalisation

capabilities,  and  encourage  Singapore   companies   to

venture abroad as a cluster.



<br><br><i>Domestic Sector Productivity (DSP) Fund</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we have set up a $45 million Domestic Sector

Productivity  Fund  to help industries  like  retail  and

construction     upgrade    their    productivity     and

competitiveness.  These sectors lag significantly  behind

the  developed countries in productivity.  And it is  one

reason  why  they  cannot pay as well and  therefore  are

unable to attract Singaporean workers.  So we will set up

a  Domestic  Sector  Productivity Fund,  administered  by

SPRING  Singapore, to co-fund industry-wide  projects  to

catalyse  improvements in business strategies, operations

and   practices.   The  aim  is  to  encourage   domestic

industries  to  exploit economies  of  scale,  adopt  new

technologies, and improve inter-organisational efficiency

through standardisation.



<br><br><i>Second Tranche of Loan Insurance Scheme</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems that SMEs face is access to

financing.   Last  year, we piloted  the  Loan  Insurance

Scheme    (LIS)   with   six   participating    financial

institutions.   Under the scheme, the  Government  shares

the  cost  of the insurance premium against loan default.

The  scheme  has been well received and has  helped  many

SMEs.   To  date,  the scheme has helped  to  insure  $16

million  worth of loans.  We will launch a second tranche

of  the  Loan  Insurance Scheme.  This will involve  more

financial  institutions and should be able to  facilitate

about $500 million in loans to SMEs over five years.   It

will cost the Government $8 million.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2781</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Local Enterprise Finance Scheme</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, we have progressively enhanced the

Local Enterprise Finance Scheme (LEFS) to help SMEs  cope

with  the  challenging economic conditions.  The  changes

include  increasing  the  default  risk  borne   by   the

Government  from 50% to 80% and reducing the  LEFS  fixed

interest  rates.   In  view  of  the  continued  economic

weakness,  we  will  extend  the  LEFS  enhancements  for

another  year  till 30th June 2004.  This will  cost  the

Government $25 million.



<br><br><i>Bridging Loan Programme for all SMEs</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the SARS outbreak, we introduced a Bridging

Loan  Programme  under  LEFS  for  tourism-related  SMEs.

Under  this  scheme,  each  SME  in  the  tourism-related

sectors  can  borrow up to S$100,000 of working  capital.

As  other  SMEs may also find this programme  useful,  we

will now open up the Bridging Loan Programme to all SMEs,

and this will cost the Government $5 million.



<br><br><i>Helping the tourism and transport sectors</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second group of businesses that need help are

those  in  the  tourism and transport  sectors.   Tourist

arrivals  have rebounded strongly since the  low  in  the

second  quarter  of  this year.  By the  end  of  August,

tourist  volumes should be about 85% of pre-SARS  levels.

But  this is partly because the affected industries  have

cut   hotel   room   rates  and  airfares  significantly.

Additional help from the Government will help to speed up

the full recovery of the tourism and transport sectors.



<br><br><i>Tourism Recovery Fund</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will set aside $100 million for a

Tourism Recovery Fund.  This includes the $50 million for

the  Global  Recovery  Programme that  Singapore  Tourism

Board  announced in June 2003 to bring tourists  back  to

Singapore through confidence building programmes,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2782</b></font><br><br>

overseas   travel   promotions  and  global   advertising

campaign.   Another $50 million will be used  to  develop

four  key  tourism  segments:  leisure  travel,  business

travel  and  MICE (meetings, incentives, conventions  and

exhibitions), healthcare and education services.



<br><br><i>Rebates for non-gazetted hotels</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the SARS relief package, we provided a

higher additional property tax rebate of $2,000 plus  30%

of  the  balance  of  property tax payable  in  2003  for

gazetted  tourist hotels.  We did not extend it  to  non-gazetted  hotels  because  they  do  not  take  so   many

tourists,  and we thought they will be okay since  it  is

Singaporeans  who  visit  the non-gazetted  hotels.   But

Singaporeans also did not visit the non-gazetted  hotels.

So,  we will extend the rebate on television licence fees

and  property tax rebates to the non-gazetted  hotels  as

well.   These two extensions will be back-dated and  will

save the non-gazetted hotels $1 million.



<br><br><i>Statutory life spans of omnibuses and taxis</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bus and taxi companies were also badly hit by the

SARS crisis.  One practical way to help them is to extend

the  life  of their fleets and to ease their depreciation

costs.  The current statutory life span for omnibuses  is

15  years,  and  7  years for taxis.   With  advances  in

vehicle  engineering,  stricter  inspections  and  better

maintenance,  these vehicles can stay roadworthy  longer.

We  will  therefore extend the statutory  life  spans  of

omnibuses from 15 to 17 years, and for taxis from 7 to  8

years,  with effect from 1st September 2003.   This  will

apply to both existing and new omnibuses and taxis.   Bus

and  taxi companies are expected to save about $7 million

and  $10  million  a  year respectively  in  depreciation

expense, at no cost to the Government.



<br><br><i>Diesel tax rebate for taxis</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diesel tax is imposed on taxis to close the gap

between the fuel cost of diesel-powered taxis and petrol-powered private

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2783</b></font><br><br>

cars.   As  part  of the off-budget package  in  2001,  I

reduced  the diesel tax for taxis from $5,100 to  $4,700.

In  the  Budget  Statement  this  year,  I  extended  the

reduction  by six months, till the end of 2003.   I  will

now  extend  this reduction by another six  months,  till

30th  June 2004.  This will cost the Government about  $4

million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a $2,000 diesel tax rebate which was

granted as part of the SARS relief package, but this will

not  be  extended beyond 31st December 2003, because  the

earnings of taxi drivers are now practically back to pre-SARS levels.



<br><br><i>Taxi operator licence fee</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the SARS relief package, the taxi

operator licence fee of $25 per taxi per month was waived

till  31st  December  2003.  LTA has since  reviewed  the

regulatory  requirements.  To reduce the burden  on  taxi

companies  to the lowest possible level, LTA will  absorb

most of its regulatory costs rather than pass them on  to

taxi  companies.  Nevertheless, it still needs to  charge

taxi companies a small licence fee.  The revised fee will

be  0.1%  of the taxi company's annual revenue from  taxi

operations.  This works out to only about $2.80 per  taxi

per month, a small fraction of the original $25 fee.  The

revised  licence fee will take effect from January  2004.

This  is  just  a  small example of how  we  are  keeping

Government rates and fees as low as possible.  It is also

as  an  example  of  how  we are sensitive  to  feedback.

Before  we announced the SARS package and suspended  this

fee,  we held a dialogue with the taxi drivers.  I  think

it was Khaw Boon Wan who did it and the taxi drivers gave

him  a  real earful on this issue.  They said,  "You  are

taking  $25 per month from me in order to measure me  and

punish me."  We thought that they did have a point and so

reviewed the fee.  So we will change the rate and we also

changed  the basis of charging.  We will charge based  on

turnover, rather than size of the taxi fleet.

<br><br><b><i>Acceleration of infrastructure projects</i></b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next programme that we will be proceeding with

is acceleration of our infrastructure projects.  The last

few   years  have  been  especially  wrenching  for   the

construction   industry.    It   has   experienced   nine

consecutive   quarters  of  decline.   In   1997,   total

contracts  awarded were worth $24 billion.  By  2002,  it

had dropped to $14 billion, nearly half.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This adjustment was inevitable because the

construction industry had to resize and consolidate after

the  excesses  of the property boom in  the  1990s.   The

Government has not tried to boost the construction sector

with   massive  public  works  programmes.   It  is   not

realistic  to try to sustain the old levels of  activity.

Also  pump-priming will not work in our  small  and  open

economy.  However,  it  is worthwhile  to  bring  forward

infrastructure  projects  that  we  intend  to  undertake

anyway  within the few years, provided we can afford  it.

This  will  not only help to create some jobs,  but  will

also  let us take advantage of the current low prices  to

get better value for our money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government agencies have identified more than 60

public   sector  infrastructure  projects  that  can   be

advanced.   In  total, contracts amounting to  more  than

$600  million will be brought forward and awarded in this

financial  year and the next financial year.   These  are

projects  worthy  in themselves, such as development  and

improvement  works for roads, schools,  community  clubs,

parks,  and drainage and sewerage systems.  Most  of  the

projects  are  small, and so are likely to benefit  local

contractors and create spin-offs for their suppliers.  Mr

Mah  Bow  Tan  will  elaborate on the  measures  for  the

construction industry later.



<br><br><b><i>Government's cost-cutting initiatives</i></b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs have asked the Government to do its part to

cut  fees and charges, and not to rely solely on wage and

CPF  cuts  to  reduce the cost of business.   This  is  a

legitimate request.  The public sector is always  looking

for ways to cut costs, espe-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2785</b></font><br><br>

cially the Ministry of Finance.  My Ministry has launched

a  civil  service-wide Economy Drive, to review  all  our

discretionary  expenditure.  Everything from  development

projects   to  expenditure  on  manpower  to   day-to-day

expenses  is  placed  under scrutiny.   We  are  not  yet

wielding  the  axe  but, we have already  taken  out  the

microscope.   The  idea is not so  much  to  cut  overall

Government expenditure, but to effect savings  which  can

be  redirected  to  new initiatives and  higher  priority

areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One measure which we should be finalising in the

next  two  months is the review of civil service salaries

for  new  recruits and in-service officers to bring  them

more in line with the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Indranee Rajah and Mrs Fang Ai Lian have called

for  a pro-business civil service, one that operates with

more  `common sense'.  May I assure all Members, and  the

two  ladies in particular, that common sense  is  not  so

uncommon  in  the civil service.  There is a  reason  why

many  civil  servants enforce rules so strictly.   It  is

because,   at  the  operational  level,  flexibility   to

exercise  discretion can tempt officers to offer favours.

So strict and transparent rules are by design a trademark

of our honest and clean Government.  You say what you are

going  to  do,  you publish it, and you do  according  to

that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members want civil servants to exercise discretion

in  their  constituents' favour, but they also  want  the

rules  to  be transparent.  It is hard to have  both.   I

have  had  constituents come to me, and I  am  sure  many

Members have too, and asked for special favours.  I said,

"It  cannot  be done.  This is against the  rule."   They

said, "gao tai qui shou" - All you have to do is to raise

your  hand.  I said, "If I do it for you, I will have  to

do  it  for everybody else."  They said, "Just do it  for

me.   Do  not  tell anybody."  So that  is  why  we  have

transparency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting that it is good for our civil

servants to be rigid bureaucrats.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2786</b></font><br><br>

We  have to make a bigger effort to operate more flexibly

and  cut  red tape.  We need to increase convenience  and

reduce costs to businesses and to the general public.  We

have  had  some successes, eg, 57 (33%) of  all  the  173

statutory declaration requirements by the Government will

be  removed by the end of this financial year.   We  have

173  different types of statutory declarations and we are

going  to chop off one-third of them, and I am sure there

will  be  more to go the next time we look at  the  list.

There  is a Pro-Enterprise Panel (PEP) whose task  is  to

follow  up  on suggestions and complaints from businesses

to  change  or  remove rules.  Out of a  total  of  1,011

suggestions  received thus far, nearly  half  (46%)  have

been  accepted.  So we are quietly making progress,  even

though  perhaps  not  quickly  enough  for  MPs.   But  I

encourage  MPs to write in with their cases and  to  take

good  cases up with the Ministers, with me, or the  Prime

Minister.   There are many cases which are routine.   MPs

can handle 30-40 cases in one long evening.  You may have

seen  all  these problems before.  But out of 20-30,  one

has a unique problem and is a case which you really ought

to  fight,  and you should do something about it.   Every

time I do an MPS, I encounter such cases.  Maybe the more

difficult  ones come to look for me, but you have  to  be

alert  to  spot it and stick a red spot on that case  and

raise the matter in a non-routine way, and we can get  it

fixed and get the costs reduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to change the mindset of a big

organisation  like the civil service overnight.   But  by

driving this effort right from the top, we send a  signal

across  the  service and, over time, this  approach  will

percolate  down  the  ranks  and  we  will  slowly,   but

steadily, clear the red tape away.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs have called for greater economy and less

waste  in  the  civil  service.   Given  that  the   Pro-Enterprise  Panel  has  been  quite  successful,  I  have

decided  to set up another group, which I will  call  the

Cut  Waste  Panel.  We have decided to  call  a  spade  a

spade,    because    otherwise   it    will    lead    to

misunderstandings.  It will include members from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2787</b></font><br><br>

the  private  and  people sectors.   The  Panel  will  be

chaired by the Head of Civil Service, who also chairs the

PEP.   Anyone  who  has  any  suggestion  of  where   the

Government  can cut waste or remove frills is welcome  to

put  the idea to the Cut Waste Panel.  By cutting  waste,

the civil service will reduce its cost of operations, and

the  lower the cost of operations, the lower the fees can

be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cut Waste Panel cannot cut everything to bare

bones,  least  of all cut off limbs.  There was  recently

one  newspaper columnist who outdid himself by suggesting

that  we should just reduce the size of the civil service

by  30%,  and therefore no longer need to reduce the  CPF

rate.   This was a particularly absurd proposal, even  by

quite  high  standards.  But the Panel  can  demand  that

unnecessary  costs be cut, unnecessary rules be  removed,

unnecessary  programmes be stopped, and unnecessary  fees

and charges be reviewed.  I encourage MPs and members  of

the public to contribute actively to both the PEP and the

Cut  Waste Panel, and the more proposals we get, the more

effective we can be.



<br><br><b><i>Goods and Services Tax</i></b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PM announced yesterday that the one percent

point  increase  in GST scheduled to take  place  on  1st

January 2004 will proceed as planned.  Let me explain why

we cannot delay this increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GST increase is to raise revenue to compensate

for  the  cuts  in  the company and personal  income  tax

rates.   The  Ministry of Finance planned the income  tax

cuts  on the basis that GST would be raised to 5% on  1st

January 2003, that means last January.  The phasing in of

the  GST  increase  has  already  created  a  significant

revenue  shortfall.  A 4% GST rate will not be enough  to

offset  the lower income tax collections, and we need  to

remedy this as soon as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our budget this year is very tight. We are likely

to  run  a  much  bigger deficit this year  than  we  had

planned.  Revenues have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2788</b></font><br><br>

come  down  in  the first half of this  year  because  of

income  tax  cuts,  slower  economic  growth  and   SARS.

Because  with  SARS,  people stayed home,  they  did  not

spend,  and  revenues  dropped.   In  the  Straits  Times

yesterday, one letter writer asked how the Government  is

going to spend its savings arising from the CPF changes - already  looking for hong baos.  To put  the  numbers  in

perspective, the Government is saving about $175  million

a  year  from the CPF changes.  This year, in the  Budget

Statement,  I  had already projected a  deficit  of  $1.2

billion.    Now,   with   lower  tax   revenues,   higher

expenditures because of SARS, and this new help  package,

even  if  we  take into account the CPF savings,  we  are

still  going to run a deficit of $2.3 billion this  year.

Next  year,  we  are projecting an even  larger  deficit.

Deferring the GST will make the deficits even worse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the visceral reaction of Singaporeans

to  any tax increase, and especially to any GST increase.

At  this  time, any additional burden must be  unwelcome.

However,   we  should  try  to  understand  the   problem

rationally.  Deferring the GST increase is, in fact,  the

least  effective way to help low income Singaporeans.  If

your  objective is to help low income Singaporeans,  then

the  last thing you want to do is to cut the GST or defer

the  increase.  Why do I say that?  Because,  by  design,

the  GST  covers almost all types of goods  and  services

consumed by all income groups - whether it is an  airline

ticket, a car, food, a haircut, or lawyer's fees -  every

service, every good is taxed the same rate.  And most  of

the  tax  is paid by the higher income group.  So,  if  I

have  a  lower GST, I am giving most of my money back  to

the  higher income group who do not need it, and  only  a

very  small proportion is going to go to the lower income

group, the unemployed, or the older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you look at it rationally, it is far better to

proceed with the GST increase so that the Government will

have  the  money  and the resources, and  can  use  these

resources  to target the deserving groups and render  the

help where it is most needed.  Therefore, we will proceed

with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2789</b></font><br><br>

the  GST increase and we will give out the second tranche

of ERS shares on 1st January 2004 as planned, to help the

low-income families with the transition.  The ERS  shares

this time will be $900 million compared to the extra $650

million that we will collect in GST in 2004.  So pressing

on will make nearly all households better off in 2004.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures I have set out will help ease the pain

for  Singaporeans to make the transition, lower the costs

for  businesses,  help companies build  capabilities  and

stimulate demand for the domestic sector.  The Ministries

will  be providing further details of the measures  under

their charge over the next few weeks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The help package to Singaporeans and businesses

amounts to about $1 billion.  May I ask the Clerk now  to

distribute   a  list  (Cols.  2847-50)  summarising   the

measures.   [Copies of list distributed to hon. Members.]

This  package will help Singaporeans and businesses  tide

over the downturn and ride the path to recovery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will allow me, having laid

out  what we are doing formally, I would like to  explain

how I see the CPF issue which this House has been dealing

with  for many years.  The latest package of CPF  changes

is a very difficult decision to make, but it is the right

step forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I entered politics in 1985, my first political

fight was about the CPF.  It was a year of recession  and

the  CPF rate then was 50%.  We were in the old Chambers.

And  Dr Toh Chin Chye used to sit where Mr Seng Han Thong

now  is,  roughly,  and  he made a  very  fierce  speech,

opening fire on all aspects of the Government's policies.

He was far better than any Opposition MPs.  The next day,

I  stood  up  and  fired back.  It was one  of  my  first

speeches.  I was young, and I took issue with him on  the

CPF,  amongst other things.  I will read to  you  what  I

said:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2790</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is an overhead? CPF - is that an overhead?

Is  that  something which the Government takes away  from

the  workers?  Or is it something which is  part  of  the

salary, which belongs to the workers, something which the

workers  use to spend for Medisave, for a house  and  for

old  age?  CPF is part of the worker's earnings,  and  we

are proud that we are able to have such a large amount of

savings put aside for a house to live in and for old age.

Very few countries can do this."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I won the argument and we proceeded on

that basis, cutting all other rates and charges, but  not

disturbing  the CPF because it is workers'  wages.   But,

over  the  course of the year, as the recession  deepened

and  as  we discussed the issues in depth at the Economic

Committee, I got educated.  People persuaded me  that  we

had  to  do something about the CPF.  It was an overhead,

and  a  cost  to  businesses.  Yes, it is wages,  but  it

cannot be helped.  So we changed.  The Economic Committee

recommended that we cut the CPF to 35%, from  50%.   That

is  a  15  percentage point cut.  Today, we  are  talking

about  a  3  percentage point adjustment.  The Government

accepted the proposal.  We sold it to the workers and the

unions,  with a lot of help from Mr Ong Teng Cheong,  who

was  then the Secretary-General of the NTUC and also from

Mr  Lim  Boon  Heng,  who was then the Deputy  Secretary-General  of the NTUC.  We had some quite fierce meetings,

some closed-doors, some not.  I am sure some of the union

members  will  remember.  But eventually we  sold  it  to

them, they were persuaded and the medicine worked.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 1985, we gradually built the CPF back to 40%.

We said that this is the long-term target rate and we got

there after 6-7 years.  We maintained it at 40% for quite

a long time.  Then came 1998, the Asian financial crisis,

and  we  cut the rate from 40% overnight to 30%.  It  was

not a hard decision either to make or to sell even though

it  was  a  big  cut,  because the urgency  was  obvious.

Everybody  could  see  it.  From July,  when  I  was  not

convinced about a CPF cut, to November when I had to make

the statement to announce a CPF cut, everybody saw the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2791</b></font><br><br>

contagion  spreading and Indonesia running  into  serious

trouble.  We had to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We thought then that because the crisis was sharp

and  we  reacted promptly, once the storm had  passed  we

could  go back to 40% quickly.  We did not want  to  take

six  or seven years, so we made the public commitment  to

go back to 40% quickly.  But we could not do it.  We went

up  to  36%  when we had a good year in 2000,  then  came

9/11,  SARS  and  so  many other  things.   We  now  find

ourselves in a different situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Economic Review Committee met. One

of  the items on our agenda was the CPF.  We started  off

discussing  this.   I told Dr Lee Boon  Yang  we  had  to

review the CPF.  Dr Lee said, "Well, we just take a look.

If we have to change, we have to change."  Neither he nor

I  was persuaded that it was necessary for us to turn the

system  upside down.  We thought we could look at it  and

there  could be some improvements, and that was it.   But

as  we  discussed  it  at length, and  as  the  situation

unfolded, we began to understand that we actually  needed

to  make quite significant changes to the rules on  using

CPF  for  housing, to the salary ceiling,  to  the  older

workers'  contribution rate, and we  had  some  difficult

decisions  on  our  hands.  And  one  of  the  issues  we

considered  was  the  40%  contribution  rate,  could  we

sustain  it?   The  Government  had  made  a  commitment.

Should the ERC recommend turning back on that commitment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had two choices, either we abandon the commitment

or  we go up slowly but carefully.  And we know that even

if  we reached 40%, one day we may have to come back down

again.  We did not want to give up so lightly what we had

promised.  We had a long discussion with the ERC members,

with  the  union Members of Parliament, and with  Mr  Lim

Boon Heng.  Finally, we agreed to maintain the 40% target

but to delay the restoration.  Sustaining 40% was at that

time not an immediate problem, but as a long-term problem

which we could do

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2792</b></font><br><br>

something  about  later.  Further, we already  had  major

changes  needing to be done, such as the salary  ceiling,

the rules on using CPF for housing, contribution rate for

older  workers.  So we thought that the changes  we  were

making  were already very drastic, and we should do  what

we could, and take another step later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time we were preparing the ERC's final

report,  which  was February 2003, we were  getting  more

concerned.   The Sub-Committees, including the  CPF  one,

have  all  released their reports. We  were  putting  the

pieces together to get the shape of the whole package  of

recommendation.  We asked ourselves:  Have  we  gone  far

enough?  Do we need to make further adjustments?  The CPF

question  popped  up again.  Should  we  change  the  40%

target?   Again, we thought, let us wait.  The  situation

was still changing, but let's not make precipitately a U-turn.  Changing the 40% target would take time, we needed

to study all the implications and prepare the ground.  So

we  decided to freeze 36% for two years, and decide  what

to do next.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even that took a lot of discussions before all ERC

members  accepted it.  That was February this year.   Now

post-SARS, we have to re-evaluate our position again.  If

you look back over the last 12 months, circumstances have

changed significantly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Singapore economy is recovering much more

slowly.  We expected it to pick up end of last year.  But

it did not.  Now we are hoping for recovery in the second

half of this year.  We hope it does.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, SARS was a further setback. No question

about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the landscape has changed. If you look at

America,  they have not been growing so well.   They  are

neither  in  a recession nor booming.  They have  growth,

but  no  jobs are created.  It is a jobless  growth.   It

impacts us directly because we are not exporting as  much

to  America.  But also indirectly, are we going  to  have

jobless growth too?  And, finally,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2793</b></font><br><br>

you  see the trend of migration of white collar jobs from

America  and  Europe, to China and  India  -  not  bottle

washers,  but  doctors, computer programmers,  designers,

accountants.  That is a different phenomenon  and  it  is

beginning  to  happen  to us, and  much  faster  than  we

expect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, after SARS, we re-evaluated our position

and  decided  that  although we  had  been  reluctant  to

change, let us change now.  We have to respond.  We  have

to  send the right signals, then investors will know that

we are moving.  And I think we have successfully done so.

We  made the statement yesterday, and in the Wall  Street

Journal  today, there is a long report on page 3  on  our

CPF  changes.   It  is  a factual report,  but  with  one

significant  paragraph.   It  says,  "While  the   widely

expected  changes  are painful and  could  hurt  consumer

spending   in  the  housing  sector,  they   signal   the

Government's  intention to help companies better  compete

against rivals in China and India."  That is exactly what

we  are  trying  to do, and what we must convince  people

that we are trying to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we are moving now to reposition the CPF to be

sustainable over the long term.  What rate, we cannot  be

sure.  Is it 30%?  Is it 36%?  I do not want to lock in a

rate  because  the conditions are too unpredictable,  too

uncertain,  too changeable.  But somewhere in there  will

be  an appropriate rate and we may have to change it from

time  to time, not every year, but when conditions change

and  we  have  to  respond. But we cannot promise  people

anything fixed.   Mr Low Thia Khiang said, " Why are  you

not  promising a rice bowl?"  I was disappointed  he  did

not  ask why we are not promising an iron rice bowl.  But

he knows even in China there are no iron rice bowls.  And

if he has one in Singapore, we will buy it from him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the right path forward. From 40% to 33% is

a  big  move  and  so we studied it very  carefully.   We

started studying this in March, immediately after the ERC

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2794</b></font><br><br>

Report,  because I was worried that we would not be  able

to  hold the position for very long.  We were not certain

if we were going to do anything, but I was convinced that

we  had better study it.  If we had to do something, then

at  least  we  would know what would be the implications.

How  low  could the contribution go?  How much  would  be

needed for housing, for retirement, for medical expenses?

So by the time we decided we needed to do something, some

ground work had already been done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when we announced a target range of 30%-36%, we are confident that, at 30%, the majority can

still get by, provided we change the withdrawal rules  at

55.   If  you take money out at 55, whether it is  for  a

good  cause, like for your children's overseas education,

or  for  fun like starting a new home in Batam, we cannot

afford  it anymore.  If Singaporeans take out that amount

at 55, they will not have enough to see them through from

62 to 80, or as PM says, to maybe even 100.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going from a 40% target to 33% actual contribution

rate is not such a small move.  Of course, some employers

prefer  to  cut to 30%.  Some workers prefer to  stay  at

36%.   There are a few who suggested going back  to  40%,

but not that many.  But we have to make a judgement.  You

cannot  calculate this.  It is not a matter of  right  or

wrong.  It is a feel - how far do you need to go, how far

can  you  go,  where do the benefits tail  off,  and  the

negatives and the problems, such as the impact on housing

affordability and on confidence, come on.  And we decided

on  33%.   It  is a collective judgement.  It  is  not  a

unanimous view.  But it is where we have decided to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even after we do this, our wages are still going to

be  many multiples of the Chinese and Indian wages.   You

have  heard the figures PM cited - we are 15 times China,

18  times  India, and so on.  But this is not an exercise

to  match Chinese or Indian wages.  They are trying their

best  to  come up and we are trying our best to stay  up.

And if we are too far out of line, we have to adjust.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2795</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We always work on the basis that our workers need to

be paid more, ought to be paid more and can be paid more,

provided our value-added, our efficiency and productivity

are  there, and our Government is there to generate extra

value  in Singapore.  By putting all the pieces together,

we  can  justify  our higher wages.  So although  we  are

making   these   CPF  adjustments  it  is   the   overall

competitiveness that we have to watch closely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will cut the statutory burden, but we will take

it one step at a time.  We will not become a boiled frog.

For  those who have not heard of the boiled frog, let  me

explain  the story.  This is a scientific fact.   If  you

take a pot of boiling water and you drop a live frog into

it, it will say "Ouch!", it jumps out, and lives.  If you

take a pot of cold water and you put a live frog into it,

it  swims around.  You turn up the fire, the water  warms

up, it adapts, it continues to swim around.  You turn  up

the  fire  a bit higher, it adapts, it swims around  some

more, until it is cooked alive.  So that is what it means

to be a boiled frog.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to us in 1998 was the first scenario.

Boiling water, sudden crisis, we were in it and we jumped

out.  We cut CPF contribution rate from 40% to 30%.  What

is happening now is that we are in warm water and we have

to decide what we are going to do.  I can tell you we are

not  going to be boiled, but we have to judge the  moment

to   jump  out.   In  the  meantime,  we  have  made  one

adjustment  to  33%.  And if we have to, we  will  do  it

again.  Because we have to watch the situation closely as

it  changes, month to month, year to year, and  calibrate

ourselves  so  that  we neither over  react,  nor  become

inured and insensitive to the changes in the environment,

and then end up boiled alive.  I wanted to contribute  to

the  Fabric of a Nation a piece with a green frog on  it,

but I was told it was too late.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we may well change further. There is no

going  back  to 40%.  We are also making other  important

changes  -  the  withdrawal rule at 55 is  a  very  major

change.  All the CPF changes are going to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2796</b></font><br><br>

lead  to  savings of $1.3 billion per year for employers,

or  about  1%  of GDP.  Each employer may not  save  that

much,  but  for the economy as a whole, it is  a  lot  of

money and it will make a significant difference.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen yesterday made a good speech,

asking  about the Government's money.  He said  that  our

electoral cycle does not coincide with the property cycle

and  does not coincide with the business cycle.  So  when

the  market  is up, we sell our land.  When  we  have  an

election,  we lock up the money.  After the election,  we

have  a  problem.   This  is a  real  issue  but  a  very

complicated one which we are taking some time  to  study.

We  will see what, if anything, needs to be done.  But it

does  not  affect  our  immediate policy  decisions.   As

Finance  Minister, my approach is to set the  appropriate

fiscal  policy   -  tax levels, spending  levels,  budget

surplus or deficit - such that it is appropriate  to  the

state  of the economy.  If it needs to be stimulated,  we

will  stimulate  it.  If it needs to be cooled  down,  we

will  cool  it down.  And if we have to draw on reserves,

so be it.  If I have to ask the President for approval, I

will have to make the case and the President will have to

decide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are prepared to run deficits in a downturn. Our

public expenditure has been counter-cyclical.  Last  year

was  a  slow year and we ran a small deficit.  This year,

we  are  going to run a much bigger deficit.  As  I  told

you,  it  is going to be more than $2 billion.   We  will

probably run an even bigger deficit next year in FY 2004.

And  if  we have to go to the President, I think  we  can

make  a  good  case.   I  think  he  will  listen  to  it

rationally and, hopefully, sympathetically.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we cannot draw on reserves to put off essential

structural changes.  If our economy is out of kilter,  if

our  wage structure is wrong, if our CPF system is wrong,

we  cannot  leave  things be and just live  on  our  past

savings.   We have to take a long view, look  beyond  the

present and set our policies so that it will work in  the

long term.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2797</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not mind if we run a big deficit this year or

next year.  My concern is: can we balance our books after

the  economy has recovered?  It is very easy to say  this

is  a transient problem, which is part and parcel of  the

automatic  stabiliser  at work.  But  when  the  economic

conditions improve and our fiscal situation is  stuck  in

the  wrong  position,  then we  will  have  a  structural

deficit and a big problem.  Hong Kong has a deficit  that

is  7% of their GDP, which is a serious matter.  If  that

happens  to  us,  investors  will  lose  confidence,  the

Singapore  dollar will depreciate, and our  savings  will

lose  value.   Mr Low Thia Khiang said just now  that  we

dare  not  depreciate  the  Singapore  dollar,  and   are

therefore  cutting the CPF.  I think he is  quite  right.

Would  he dare to depreciate the Singapore dollar  if  he

can  do  so?   To depreciate the Singapore  dollar  means

inflation  will  go up, workers' savings  will  be  worth

less, confidence will go down, interest rates will go up,

and  many  consequences  which I  think  any  responsible

government  will  have  to think  very  carefully  before

doing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if we need to spend now, we will spend.

But  we will make sure that when we get back on track and

the  economy  is growing, our budget is back in  balance.

And  that is one of the reasons why we cannot put off the

GST increase further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me talk about the CPF changes. Some

people   are   asking  if  these  will   make   Singapore

competitive. Will they work?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF changes are only part of our strategy. We

have tackled many other components of our business costs.

Our  income  tax rates are now one of the lowest  in  the

world.    Our   utilities   charges,   despite   people's

complaints,  are  low  compared to other  countries.   In

other  countries,  where  the  electricity  industry   is

protected, once a plant is built, it is guaranteed a rate

of return.  If the plant

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2798</b></font><br><br>

cannot  fetch the target rate of return, the tariffs  are

raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we have opened up our market,

which  used  to comprise steam plants.  Then  gas  became

available.  A gas plant produces electricity much cheaper

than  a  steam plant.  But we did not keep  out  the  gas

plants  in order to guarantee the steam plants a rate  of

return.  We proceeded to build the gas plants, bought the

gas,  and now the steam plants are "stranded".  In  other

words,   their  value  has  gone  down.   The  price   of

electricity can no longer cover the full cost to  operate

a  steam  plant.  It is the wrong thing  to  do  for  the

Government as a shareholder of the steam plants,  but  we

did  it because that is a sensible thing for the economy.

We  write-off the value of the steam plants, move to gas,

and  everybody benefits from cheaper electricity  prices,

and  the Government's loss as shareholder is the people's

gain.   Not all Members knew or understood what  we  did.

From  time to time, we get requests - why not just reduce

the  utility charges?  It is not so simple.  But what  we

have done has been significant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our land cost and rentals have also come down. I

have  a  table  (Cols. 2851-2).  May I ask the  Clerk  to

distribute  it?  [Copies  of Table  distributed  to  hon.

Members.]

<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030829/20030829-HA-0762851.pdf"">Table - Changes in property and land prices (1994-2003)</a><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had this argument twice with Mr Inderjit Singh.

He  is  not here today, so Mr Low Thia Khiang took it  up

for  him. But let me show you what the real numbers  look

like.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land prices have come down in Singapore

significantly.   If we look back 10 years,  to  just  the

beginning  of the property upturn in 1994, and index  the

property  prices then as 100.  Today, 10 years  down  the

road, JTC flatted factories have gone down to 67, ie, one-third down.  JTC industrial land has gone down to 75, ie,

one-quarter down.  Private industrial factories have gone

down to 78 or one-fifth down.  Office, to 59 - about  40%

down.   Shops  have gone down to 68, ie, one-third  down.

Residential has gone down to 76, ie, a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2799</b></font><br><br>

quarter  down.  And if you look at the chart  below,  you

will  see  that  the trend has been  down.   And  if  you

compare  the decline not from 1994 but from the  peak  at

around 1996/1997, the decline has been even sharper.   So

to  say,  "Let  us bring land prices down",  is  to  make

statements without looking at the facts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to judge Singapore on our overall

competitiveness.  Wages are important, but they are  part

of  our overall competitiveness.  The newspapers reported

Dr  Tony  Tan's statement.  Over the weekend, he  made  a

speech,  I  think at a Sembawang National Day  observance

ceremony,  and pointed out that a PERC report  said  that

Singapore  wages appeared to be higher than that  in  the

US, which is a serious matter.  But that is only one part

of  the picture.  We also have to look at the rest of the

picture to complete the perspective.  If we look  at  the

PERC  report  which was published on 2nd July  2003,  for

Singapore, it says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Still competitive compared to Asia's more developed

economies,  but  expensive compared  to  most  developing

ones."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a spectrum of economies. If we are a

properly developed economy, we are okay.  If we are not a

developed  country,  we have a problem.   We  are  almost

developed.  But, compared to the developing economies, we

have  to  watch our competitiveness.  The report  further

explained that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Singapore Government has historically done a

very  good  job  of holding down the rate  of  inflation.

This  year is no exception.  It has allowed labour  costs

to  increase fairly rapidly during boom times, but it has

also  allowed them to fall during difficult periods, such

as  the  island is currently experiencing.  Consequently,

although  consumer prices have risen slightly this  year,

labour  costs  have held steady or even  fallen,  helping

companies hold the line on costs."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, overall, we are not wildly out of line. We need

to  adjust,  but the water is not boiling yet.   We  just

have  to  adjust the thermostat.  The report goes  on  to

say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Office and housing rents in Singapore are where the

island  has  held  a  big  advantage  over  Asia's  other

developed economies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large proportion of the population lives in public

housing, much larger than in Hong Kong.  This has  helped

to hold down demand for private sector

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2800</b></font><br><br>

premises.   Rents  are  still  high  compared   to   most

developing economies in the region, but not compared with

the  developed  economies of Asia,  or  even  with  major

Chinese cities like Shanghai or Beijing."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So our rents are high compared to developing

economies,  but  not so when compared  to  the  developed

economies or even Shanghai and Beijing.  If we  take  the

whole  picture in perspective, there is no need to panic.

But  we know we have to adjust, that is what we are doing

and  we  are  sending  the right  signals  to  investors,

creating the right investment environment.  With that  we

are able to create jobs for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we can do this together is an enormous plus.

That  we  are  here  seriously discussing  these  issues,

debating  them, and have everybody understand what  needs

to  be  done - is a plus.  Even Mr Low Thia Khiang, after

quite  a fierce speech, at the end said why not just  fix

the  CPF  rate at 35%. That showed a recognition  of  the

reality.   We  are sitting here debating, not  out  there

joining a million-man demonstration in Parliament Square.

That would be a totally different kind of Singapore.  But

what we do requires the trust of Singaporeans, requires a

Government  which  is resolved to make  vital  structural

changes  and then, together, we take the pain and  adjust

together.   Then we would have not just a partnership  in

good  times, but a bond that will hold even in bad times,

and it is because of this that we have confidence that we

can tackle the future. [Applause.]

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  support  the  proposal  by  the  Prime

Minister and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2801</b></font><br><br>

Deputy  Prime  Minister to reduce  the  CPF  contribution

rate.   After  the announcement by the Prime Minister  on

the CPF reduction, I spoke to some grassroots leaders and

my  friends  in the business community.  They  have  some

comments on the CPF cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his National Day Rally speech, the Prime Minister

gave  an indication of the direction that we were  going.

So  many  people guessed that it would be a 6% reduction.

But,  after  giving  much  thought  to  the  matter,  the

Government  decided that the cut would be  3%.   I  think

that  it  is a very rational decision and it also  proves

that the Government is one that cares about the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the Deputy Prime Minister has proposed a

comprehensive    programme    to    help    Singaporeans,

particularly  the lower income and the  older  people  in

Singapore.   The whole package shows that the  Government

does  not  take  this CPF retuning exercise  lightly.   I

fully  support this reform by the Government, but I would

like to make some suggestions.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.25 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation. In fact, some five years ago, we

thought  that the pace would not be so fast and that  the

emergence of China and India would not be that fast.  But

we  now realise that the whole impact is more much severe

than  we thought it would be.  We have to adapt ourselves

to  this environment, as it is a case of "survival of the

fittest".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Goh has said that we have only two

choices:  either we go on a drastic reform, or just  keep

to  our  old ways and gradually go downhill.   The  Prime

Minister  has  picked the first method, ie, to  undertake

drastic reform to our system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about competition, we have to, first of all,

talk about cost competitiveness,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2802</b></font><br><br>

secondly, on efficiency and competitiveness and, thirdly,

competition in our living environment, ie, to be  one  of

the  best places to live, work and play.  We want to make

our talented people in Singapore feel that Singapore is a

good place to live in and we also want to attract foreign

talents to come and work and live here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last two days, we have been talking about

cost  competitiveness, and two Ministers have given us  a

very clear picture of the situation.  Yes, we want to cut

cost,  but  it  does  not  mean that  we  want  to  bring

ourselves down to the level of China or India.   In  this

competition,  yes, we want to tighten our belts,  but  it

does  not  mean  that  we want to drastically  lower  our

standard  of living.  Perhaps, some people's standard  of

living  may have stagnated, and some of them may continue

to  go higher and some may go lower.  But economists  who

have  studied  the  matter advised that  if  we  were  to

purchase   the  cheaper  products  from  the   developing

countries and adjust our lifestyle a little, then perhaps

our standard of living would not go down so fast.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an unavoidable fact before us, ie, we would

have to face these three types of situation in Singapore.

Some people's standard of living may be stagnated at  the

present  level; some people may be affected.  We have  to

be  psychologically prepared that we will not be able  to

grow  so  fast  like in the past.  We  need  to  do  some

adjustments  to our choice of housing, the  car  we  use,

and  our consumption pattern.  A number of Ministers have

mentioned that in some developed countries, even  in  the

United  States,  the standard of living of  some  of  the

people  is  affected.  In some less developed  countries,

maybe  China  and India, we can see that the standard  of

living   has  been  going  up.   But  in  the   developed

countries, many people's standard of living has  actually

gone down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Minister Lim Boon Heng and Deputy Prime

Minister  Lee had mentioned about what the CDCs could  do

to help.  I am very glad to report to our colleagues

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2803</b></font><br><br>

here  that  in  the  past one year, we  have  been  quite

successful in our efforts to help our residents  who  are

affected by the recession to look for jobs. We have  made

use  of some of the packages introduced by MOM.  We  have

also gone down to the factories. We have trained some  of

the workers to upgrade their skills or to retrain them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July, there were 4,800 unemployed who have

registered  themselves with our South West CDC.  We  have

successfully secured interview opportunities for  60%  of

the  job-seekers.  A total of 1,235 actually took up  the

jobs that were given to them, among whom 588 are 40 years

and  above. So the older workers were also able  to  find

jobs  so  long  as they are willing to be more  flexible.

Out of 1,235 jobs, 374 or about 29% were lower-paid ones,

and our local residents were prepared to take these jobs.

So  long  as we give them some encouragement,  give  them

some  skills training and some guidance, we can  persuade

them to take the jobs available to them.  For example, we

cooperated  with the hospitals to train the older  female

workers  to  do some cleaning work in the hospitals.   We

brought  them  to Alexandra Hospital and KK Hospital  and

the success rate was quite high.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we had not held their hands and encouraged them

and  just  told them to go to KK Hospital or  the  mental

hospital, they would be worried and may not even turn  up

for  interview.  But when we bring them to the hospitals,

have  tea  with  them  there and explained  to  them  the

situation,  they will be more receptive  and  willing  to

work  there.   We  even brought them to  the  handicapped

children's homes.  At first, they were not willing to go.

But  if you hold their hands, arrange to have people from

the  hospitals to explain the job requirements  to  them,

they would respond positively. We discovered that many of

them  who  went to the home for the handicapped children,

felt  that the children were very appreciative  of  their

attendance  there and they cultivated a  love  for  these

children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as a CDC, we will help to cooperate with MOM and

the employers to arrange

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2804</b></font><br><br>

for  training, particularly for the older workers, and  I

can see that we are getting better results nowadays.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the cost factor, yesterday, we talked only

about  CPF.  But  today, the Deputy  Prime  Minister  had

introduced  various packages to help the  people.   I  am

sure  that  both the employers and workers would  welcome

these  packages.  But some people I spoke  to  feel  that

companies  which  are not linked to   globalisation,  for

example,   our  energy  companies,  utilities  companies,

public  transport companies, and are not affected by  the

global  competition, are also enjoying the 3% savings  on

CPF.   These companies should share the benefit of  these

savings with their customers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would also like to see how the Government could

cut  down on all those bureaucratic red tapes.  Recently,

the  Government introduced "e-Government" which is a very

good   initiative.   We  can  now  provide  the   foreign

investors  with a "one-stop" service.  I feel  that  this

one-stop service should not be confined to the MNCs.   We

should  extend this one-stop service to all the  services

and the various industries, including the local SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of one old lady in our constituency who works

on  a  sewing  machine in the market and she  offers  the

service  of  clothing alteration for her  customers.   It

took  me  10  years to get her a licence to run  a  small

stall  at  the  market place.  Over the  years,  all  her

applications  were  rejected because the  officials  said

that there was no such precedent, and clothing alteration

was  not one of the skills specified in their manual  for

approval  of  a  vocation licence.  I  think  if  one  is

prepared  to  be  self-reliant, we should  make  it  more

convenient  and even encourage one to earn  a  living  by

using  one's skills, so long as it is legal,  proper  and

cause  no harm to the country.  We do not want retrenched

people  to  queue  up for handouts.  We should  encourage

these people, make it more convenient for them to earn  a

living

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2805</b></font><br><br>

with  their skills or special talents so that they  could

earn  enough  to support themselves.  I think  we  should

encourage  them to take up these jobs as  well  as  micro

enterprise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also a lot of small and medium enterprises

(SMEs)  in Singapore. When we talk about SMEs, it usually

means  those with a paid-up capital of $1 million, or  at

least  $500,000.   But there are some older  workers  who

have no means to start a business of that size, and it is

very  difficult for them to be trained or  re-skilled.  I

think we should encourage them to do some small trades so

that  these  people can earn a living for themselves.   I

think  SPRING Singapore should consider encouraging  this

sort of small businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some developed countries, like the United States,

they  have  also  promoted this  type  of  small  trades.

Capital loans of $10,000 or so are readily available  for

the older folks to start their small businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to mention is that in our South

West  CDC, we promised our residents that no child  would

be deprived of the opportunity to be placed in childcare,

kindergarten, student care and be educated simply because

his  or  her  parents  have  financial  difficulties.   A

Children's Fund has been set up to see to it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister mentioned the Home Ownership Plus

Education (HOPE) Scheme.  We hope that we would  be  able

to promote this scheme to the families who have financial

difficulties so that the children would not  be  deprived

of  the opportunity to be educated.  We should give  this

assurance  to the residents that their children  will  be

looked after.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, DPM had also mentioned that he hoped that

the  HDB  could relax their rules.  I think Minister  Mah

and  his  ministry officials are very active  people.  We

have  taken up quite a bit of issues concerning HDB rules

to them, and these

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2806</b></font><br><br>

issues were settled expeditiously through the efforts  of

Minister  Mah and his officials.  I hope in this  aspect,

we   could  accelerate  the  exercise  to  simplify   the

procedures so that it would be easier for the residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long term, we cannot just depend on wage

cuts.   Minister Lim Boon Heng had recalled several  wage

reforms that we have undertaken over the years.  And just

now,  Parliamentary Secretary, Mr Hawazi had also  talked

about  companies where the employees are  not  unionised,

less  than  10% of these employers have adopted  flexible

wage system.  We, the labour MPs, have been advocating  a

flexible  wage system for the past 18 years, and  yet  so

few  of  these  employers have  heeded  our  advice.   So

perhaps,  I  should offer two suggestions to improve  the

situation.  One is to grant some tax incentives to  those

who  adopt a flexible wage system.  Maybe it is too  late

for  this round of CPF cut.  But I hope that there  would

never   be  another  round  of  CPF  cut.   But  in   the

unfortunate event that this happens again, I think  those

companies which do not have a flexible wage system should

not  be  allowed  to  enjoy  any  reduction  in  the  CPF

contribution. This way, we can encourage these  companies

to quickly adopt a flexible wage system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, I visited a company known as Ameron. I

was  told that the company has been making profits  every

year  since  1998.   This  year, they  have  enjoyed  the

highest profits ever.  So originally, in my speech, I was

supposed to tell their workers to tighten their belts and

to exercise wage reform.  But when I heard their results,

I held back and asked the CEO how did they manage to have

profits  every  year despite the economic  downturn.   He

told  me  that  they make sure everybody in the  company,

from   the   senior  mangers  to  the  factory   workers,

understands  the  competition they are facing,  and  they

have therefore to adapt to changes.  Everyone should make

a  contribution at his own level and, if necessary,  make

sacrifices too.  The company guarantees that its products

must  be 100% accurate - because their products are  used

in deep seas for oil exploration - there should not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2807</b></font><br><br>

be  any  defects in the quality.  Another factor  is  the

speed.  The products must be able to deliver on time.  He

said  that  his  company  was very  happy  to  invest  in

Singapore  and that the workers here were good.   But  he

commented that the younger workers normally do  not  stay

in  their job for long.  They would work for one  or  two

months and resign.  But the older workers have worked for

more  than  10  years  because they know  that  when  the

company makes money, they will be given bonuses and a lot

of  benefits, but the younger workers work for one or two

months and they quit, because the working hours are long.

So,  I  think we should not just be concerned  with  wage

cuts.  We should help ourselves by upgrading ourselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been retrenchments in some big companies

like  PSA  Corp.   We know that PSA Corp  aims  to  be  a

globalised group of companies.  It ranks very high up  in

the  world.   It is one of the best ports in  the  world.

Recently, we also visited the Keppel Offshore and  Marine

Company.   The company has invested heavily  in  research

and  development.   They  are the  world  leader  in  the

manufacturing of jack-up rigs.  In fact, some 60% of  all

the jack-up cranes in the world were constructed by them.

So  we should not feel depressed.  If we have a long-term

plan,  we will still be able to maintain our standard  of

living or even enjoy a better standard of living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the issue of training, I still have some

reservations.   Some  20  years  ago,  Dr  Tay  Eng  Soon

promoted  the WISE and BEST programmes, but the  response

was not too good.  Even now, many workers in the 40s have

difficulty undergoing training because of their  lack  of

linguistic and mathematical aptitude.  Twenty years  ago,

when  these programmes were launched, these workers  were

about 25 years old.  Twenty years later, they are now  45

years  old. There are real problems in training them.  We

should  sit down and study where the problem is.   Is  it

because the workers refuse to be trained or the employers

are  not proactive in wanting to train them?  So, for  20

years, this generation of people are already moving into

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2808</b></font><br><br>

middle age.  I hope that for those who are 25 years  old,

we  do  not  have  the same problem  20  years  later  in

Parliament.   So I think we should really  sit  down  and

systematically analyse this problem as to how to  enhance

our competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, I mentioned about PSA. I asked them how

we could further improve the productivity of our workers.

They  told  me that they do not have a problem  with  the

facilities.    They  have  the  capital   to   meet   the

requirements.  The problem is how to let our workers work

in  a wiser manner.  They are hardworking, but how do  we

train  them  so  that they can work smart and  provide  a

higher level of service.  This would involve training and

equipping    them   with   proficiency   in    languages,

mathematics, and the use of computers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Prime Minister mentioned that many

office jobs have been relocated to other places.  I think

this  is  a  serious  problem.  We should  sit  down  and

conduct some in-depth studies and analyse the situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to talk about our fighting

spirit.   The  Prime Minister had mentioned that  in  the

past,  Singapore  was  able to counter  all  difficulties

because our people had the fighting spirit and the spirit

of  unity.   I hope that our people should not  be  down-hearted.   Our basic infrastructure is good.  Our  system

of  government, strong reserves and transparency  in  our

system  are our forte.  So, the most important  thing  is

that  we must lift up our fighting spirit like what Mayor

Heng Chee How had mentioned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of my residents said that I was speaking for

the  employers.  I said, "No, we are speaking for all the

people  of  Singapore."  Maybe the employers  should  say

more.   It seems that all the time, it was the Government

and the trade union leaders who are speaking up.  I think

the  employers themselves should also speak up.   We  are

speaking  for the general good of the people so  that  we

can  break through this present economic dark cloud.

<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker, we have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2809</b></font><br><br>

often heard that a large number of potential jobs may  be

lost  in  Singapore as more companies contemplate  moving

their  operations  to countries that  have  lower  labour

costs.  This, I believe, is unavoidable.  Among the ASEAN

countries, the attraction of lower labour costs, such  as

in  Indonesia, Malaysia and other neighbouring countries,

is irresistible to investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many businesses in Singapore, whether local or

foreign,  have  been and are still producing  traditional

goods  and services that provide employment for  a  large

number of people.  Their products are of high quality and

some  may  even have the potential of expanding  overseas

with  their products.  However, they are currently facing

heavy competition from overseas companies with lower cost

of  operations,  and  especially those  that  are  labour

intensive  may  be  forced to cease  operations  here  if

nothing is done about the cost of labour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that the Government recognises

this  problem and that the Prime Minister is  now  taking

action  to remove one of the financial obstacles  in  the

path  of  businesses, and that is the high statutory  CPF

contribution  rate for employers.  The  current  rate  of

employer's  contribution  rate  of  16%  has   not   been

sustainable  for a long period of time, and has  been  an

inflexible  reward  instrument for employers  to  use  in

managing their payroll.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flexibility has now been brought into the formula by

the  Prime  Minister  to make CPF  contribution  move  in

tandem with the economic climate.  This move, I note,  is

a  significant signal to employers that the Government is

serious about creating a robust economy.  And the  relief

measures   that  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  has   just

announced  will further make our economy more nimble  and

aggressive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister of State Raymond Lim has also acknowledged

today that competition in many industries -  and it is  a

common

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2810</b></font><br><br>

trend  now   -   has forced prices down and  margins  are

under  tremendous pressure as fixed overhead cost remains

high.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the lowering of the CPF rate from 16% to 13%

for   employer's   contribution,  overheads   will   drop

tremendously for companies, and especially so  for  those

that  are labour intensive, allowing them to match  lower

prices  and  keep  the business going and  thus  preserve

jobs.   In  fact, some of the savings in CPF contribution

will  be  a  saving grace for companies that  are  facing

losses.   For  those  companies that will  enjoy  greater

margin  in their profit statements, staff bonuses  should

be encouraged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saving jobs in an economic downturn is the

Government's   primary  objective  and   attracting   new

investments and creating a conducive business environment

for  business  to  trade will be on top  of  the  agenda.

Without  jobs, there will be no CPF contribution for  the

workers.  Therefore, as Government adapts to the changing

environment to save jobs, so must the people.  This  will

include a mindset change as to how we perceive the amount

that should be in the retirement fund.  A fair amount  of

savings  has  to be set aside for the future.   But  with

inflation, CPF savings will not be sufficient to meet old

age  requirements when a person retires.  So what  future

quantum  should  this  fair  amount  be?   Should  it  be

$120,000  as the Minimum Sum or more?  It all depends  on

the  standard of living that one desires.  It may not  be

attainable but whatever the amount is, the future rate of

savings  in  the CPF should be an affordable  amount  for

both the employers and employees, that should be flexible

enough to move in line with economic trends prevailing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The range of employer's contribution stated by the

Prime  Minister  lies  between  10%  and  16%.   This,  I

believe, should be a comfortable band for most businesses

to work within.  However, if the employees need to top it

up,  and  it  is possible for them to do so, they  should

resort  to using other financial tools such as instrument

products to supplement retirement savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers should also be encouraged to set up a

second source of retirement fund to reward employees, and

build  up a second pillar of savings in addition to their

CPF savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another mindset change for employers would be for

them  to  recognise that total pay package  includes  the

quantum  of employer's contribution to CPF.  This portion

should not be regarded as a benefit on top of the salary,

but  an  amount earned through the course of  employment.

So,  if  a  person earns $30,000 a year,  his  total  pay

package  will be $33,900, inclusive of the 13% employer's

contribution.   The  additional  $3,900  should  not   be

regarded as an employee benefit but as part of his  gross

salary for the year.  Any additional amounts of CPF  paid

through  performance  bonuses are  benefits  accrued.   A

distinction  between  the  two will  help  employers  and

employees better plan the use of CPF as an incentive tool

to increase productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feedback I received from the ground is that a

reduction  in  employer's CPF contribution is  tolerable,

but a pay cut is not.  But if it is necessary to do so, I

would not advocate that salary levels be cut down to that

comparable  to, say, China, for us to remain competitive.

We  must,  however, structure our salary scales inclusive

of  employer's contribution to a level comparable to  our

productivity.  In this way, we get to enjoy a  reasonable

standard of living and still be competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Business Times reported on Monday, 25th August

2003,  that  despite far higher labour cost  here,  total

business  overheads  in Singapore may  be  only  slightly

higher  than almost comparable wage levels in China,  the

much  vaunted cheap workbench of the world, according  to

consulting  firm Political and Economic Risk  Consultancy

(PERC).   Assuming  that  this  report  is  correct   and

Singapore  reduces its cost of labour and thus  overheads

further,  we should then be able to compete for a  bigger

share of the economic pie internationally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Prime Minister's

call for retuning of the CPF.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2812</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Ser Miang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Ser Miang (Nominated Member):</b> Madam, many

businessmen  that I have spoken to fully  appreciate  and

support the decision of the Government to retune the CPF,

cut  contribution  rate to 33% from 1st  October  and  to

bring  the  range of CPF contributions to 30-36%.   I  am

sure  Singaporeans and businesses alike also welcome  the

package  of  measures announced by DPM Lee earlier,  with

about  $900  million  going  to  support  businesses  and

another $132 million that will go to support Singaporeans

in need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies in Singapore have, in the past years,

survived  in extremely difficult economic conditions  and

tougher  and tougher competitions.  Even when we  thought

that  we  were  turning the corner, we were  hit  by  the

impact  of  the Iraqi war and SARS.  I can say that  most

companies  have  tried  all they could  to  reduce  cost,

increase  productivity, retain and redeploy workers,  and

as a last resort, some had to retrench workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the Government's decision to retune

CPF  is  also a recognition that companies have done  all

they  could to reduce cost and a more fundamental  change

to wage structure has to take place to ensure that we can

compete globally.  The cut from 36% to 33% will save $1.3

billion a year on employers' wage bill.  While the extent

of  savings will differ from company to company, it could

mean the difference between profit and loss, survival  or

failure  and, ultimately, translating into job  retention

and  creation  or  job  loss.  It would  also  mean  that

Singapore will be more attractive to foreign investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several MPs have urged companies, which will enjoy a

windfall, to share the CPF cut with the workers.  I fully

support  this notion.  Companies that do not  look  after

their  workers cannot enjoy their loyalty and are  doomed

to  failure.  However, I would like to put in a  word  of

caution,  lest  we  raise unrealistic  expectation.   The

retuning  of  CPF is necessary to help reduce  costs  and

make our companies more competitive.  Companies will  use

this to lower their costs and make

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2813</b></font><br><br>

their  products  and services cheaper or better  so  that

they  can  compete better and remain viable and,  in  the

long  run,  help to retain jobs or even to  create  jobs.

They  will  have,  in their own way,  to  make  the  most

efficient  use  of  this saving, while  competition  with

China, India and the rest of the world will continue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not certain that many will enjoy a real

windfall from this CPF cut.  Let me illustrate.   In  the

Straits Times' article dated 21st August, it was reported

that big firms stand to save millions if CPF is cut.   It

said  that  if there was a cut of employer's contribution

from  16%  to  10%, then, for example,  SIA's  after  tax

saving  could be as high as $46 million.  Since there  is

only  a  3% cut, the assumed saving would be half or  $23

million.  Will Singapore Airlines make enough money  this

year  so  that it can share the saving from the  CPF  cut

with their workers?  I am not certain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at it in perspective, Singapore Airlines

had announced on 30th July that it had suffered a loss of

$312 million as compared with a profit of $478 million in

the first quarter of last year.  The savings from CPF cut

will  definitely  help  SIA  to  reduce  cost,  while  it

continues its efforts to increase traffic and revenue and

to  contain costs.  Even then, it will be an uphill  task

for  Singapore  Airlines to match last  year's  financial

profit  of  about $1 billion.  As we can  see  from  this

example, companies like SIA may not be able to share  its

savings from CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those companies that are profitable, and the CPF

cut  represents a real windfall, I fully agree that  they

should  share  the  savings with  their  workers  through

bonuses,  performance  linked  incentives  and   so   on.

Perhaps we can even encourage these companies to continue

to  pay the 16% CPF with the Government giving incentives

to  them such as double tax relief on this extra 3%.  The

cut  of  3% will help companies to some extent,  but  not

sufficiently to really bring down business costs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2814</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with several of the Members who spoke before

me  that  we need to look at other ways to lower business

costs,  such  as fees, rates, rents, land  and  transport

costs.  I believe these have been sufficiently dealt with

by DPM Lee and Minister of State Mr Raymond Lim earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point is really on the return on CPF

balance.    Currently,  interest  paid  on  the  Ordinary

Account  is 2.5%, and 4% on other accounts.   Can  we  do

better than the 2.5%?  I am quite confident that this  is

possible.   I  would, therefore, urge the  Government  to

look  at better ways of managing the CPF fund and to give

a  better return to CPF members.  And, if we are able  to

do so, then it will certainly help to mitigate the cut in

CPF rates of our workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual members have tried through various

schemes to improve the return on their CPF balances,  but

not  all achieved the same desirable results.  At the end

of  31st December 2002, three million CPF members have  a

total of $89.1 billion in their CPF balances.  I believe,

with this huge sum of money, the CPF Board has the skill,

and  is  in a better position, to achieve better  returns

than  individual members themselves.  So I  believe  that

this  is  possibly  one way to increase  or  enhance  the

returns on members' CPF balances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the measures.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,

thank  you for allowing me to participate in this debate.

During  the  Budget  debate this year,  I  spoke  of  the

several  "R"  words that had dominated our  vocabulary  - Restructuring,  Remaking,  Refreshing,  Revitalising  and

Renewal  -  all in the effort at preventing Retrenchment.

Yesterday,  PM  Goh  introduced  two  more  "R"  words  - Retuning   and   Restrategising  -  two  more   important

processes  we  have  to undergo as  our  economy  remains

relevant  and effectively responsive to the ever-changing

global  scene.   Perhaps another  "R"  word  we  have  to

emphasise to Singaporeans is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2815</b></font><br><br>

"Reality".  There are several realities that I would like

to focus on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reality 1: We are at the mercy of our environment.

CPF  has  been touted as one of Singapore's  most  sacred

cows.   So  when a sacred cow is not spared, Singaporeans

must wake up and appreciate the gravity of the situation.

No  one can predict what else is going to happen in other

parts of the world.  No one will know when the next  bomb

will explode or when SARS will reappear.  But the reality

is,  unless we prepare ourselves for whatever may happen,

we  will  be  caught off-guard and we will  have  to  pay

dearly for the consequences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reality 2: We are no longer leading far ahead in

the  economic race.  One of the motivations  of  the  CPF

change is the realisation that Singaporeans are just  too

expensive to employ.  We used to be way ahead in the race

and  thus  we command good wages because we are  able  to

provide  goods  and services that are  of  more  superior

quality   compared   to  our  competitors.    But   these

competitors are catching up and the reality is that  what

we can do today, they can do just as well, if not better.

If  we  do  not  find the competitive edge,  we  will  be

overtaken and left behind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reality 3: Gone are the old jobs and get prepared

for  the  new jobs.  We have been talking much about  the

need  for  Singaporeans to understand that the  old  jobs

that  they are comfortable doing are gone and will  never

be  back.  Changes in the CPF rates promise to save  jobs

and  bring  in more jobs.  But no amount of  CPF  cut  is

going to help if Singaporeans do not realise the need for

them  to  do their part and be skilled for the jobs  that

will  come.  The jobs will come and they will go  if  the

workers are not prepared and ready for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reality 4: Is money really not enough? - The need

to  lower expectations and aspirations.  The decision  of

the  Government  to establish a range of  30-36%  as  the

target for the CPF contribution sends a strong message to

Singaporeans that they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2816</b></font><br><br>

have  to  be flexible and nimble all the time.   Although

the  changes will not happen every year, it may and  will

happen under circumstances of great economic uncertainty.

We  have  heard  the  laments of many  Singaporeans,  and

voiced  by many Members of the House, about the  increase

in the cost of living.  In not so many words, increase in

cost of living translates to "money not enough".  But  is

it really not enough?  Madam, the data from the Household

Expenditure  Survey of 1997/98 showed  that  the  average

household expenditure exceeds household income for  those

in  the less than $2,000 income group.  For example,  the

average  household  expenditure for those  earning  below

$1,000   was   about   $1,300.   The  average   household

expenditure for those earning between $1,000  and  $1,500

was about $1,600.  But a closer look at the data leads to

an  interesting interpretation.  For those earning  below

$1,000,  about  half  spent less  than  $1,000  in  their

household  expenditure, ie, spending within their  means,

perhaps.   For those earning between $1,000  and  $1,500,

about 57% spent equal or below their income levels.  From

a  strength  perspective, this  suggests  that  some  low

income  Singaporeans are capable of living  within  their

means, while some are not.  The issue is complex and will

be  compounded by variables like the household  size  and

the  number of dependants in the household.  The question

then is: are we really living within our means and can we

continue  to  live  within our means in  times  when  our

incomes  are  reduced?   Can  we  make  the  choices   of

prioritising our expenditures such that we  are  able  to

make  do  without some, ie, are we able to  differentiate

between our needs and our wants?  Or are the needs really

beyond our means?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, a related question is: are we being fair to

Singaporeans,  having  given them so  much  promises  and

having them increased their aspirations, we now tell them

they have to be realistic and lower their aspiration.  We

encourage homeownership and we take pride in that 90%  of

Singaporeans are home-owners, even when we know some  are

struggling to keep up with their payments.  We  encourage

them to upgrade, but when

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2817</b></font><br><br>

the lightning strikes, we must be there to help those who

are  hurt.   It is more than just extending the  mortgage

repayment periods, more than just the ERS to cushion  the

GST  increases.   It  is how we walk side  by  side  with

Singaporeans  as they overcome their difficulties.   Some

of these difficulties are compounded by our own policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, last night some of the banks came out proudly

announcing their willingness to help Singaporeans who are

affected  by  the proposed changes.  But these  are  only

cases that already have existing loans with them.  I  see

many  residents  are severely affected  by  the  economic

downturn,  feel depressed and dejected when their  effort

at  securing a bank loan is rejected.  They need to  sell

their  flats  and downgrade for they cannot afford  their

flats  anymore.   They  have huge  debts  to  settle  and

because  of their poor credit standing, no bank wants  to

lend  them  money.   Yes,  you  can  say  that  they  are

responsible for their own actions but, Madam, I think  we

are  also  responsible for encouraging them to dream  and

aspire.   Now that they have woken up from the dream  and

are facing reality, we must be there to support them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I am glad to hear the support mechanism

announced by DPM Lee a while ago to help families who are

affected.  I only have one appeal to make on the  revised

HDB  rental  policy.   I laud the move  to  increase  the

salary  eligibility  criterion to $1,500  and  to  charge

higher  rentals  for  those  who  earn  more  than  $800.

However,  I  urge  HDB to assess the  households  on  per

capita  income when deciding on the rent to charge  these

families.   I would also urge HDB to periodically  review

the  tenancy period such that those who can really afford

it should be asked to purchase their flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reality 5: Unemployment is a real possibility.

While   the  proposed  changes  are  aimed  at   ensuring

Singaporeans keep their jobs and more jobs would be  made

available, they do not negate the possibility  that  jobs

continue to be threatened.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2818</b></font><br><br>

The  threat is as real as SARS coming back every  winter.

The  shorter economic cycle necessitates that we  prepare

Singaporeans  for  impending  unemployment.   Madam,  the

crisis has shown many Singaporeans that they cannot  take

their  job,  nor  their  lifestyle  for  granted.    Many

Singaporeans are caught unprepared.  I think the  changes

in  the CPF fall short of preparing Singaporeans for  the

eventuality  of the next economic crisis when  they  lose

their  job again.  When the crisis struck, many were  not

prepared, as they did not have sufficient savings to pull

them  through.   They scrambled around  looking  for  the

safety  nets.  The Government also scrambled in  knitting

the net and throwing it at them.  We cannot allow this to

happen again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, anecdotal evidence suggests that apart from

the  compulsory  savings  of CPF,  Singaporeans  are  not

saving  enough.  In fact, many are indebted.   With  many

spending  more than their incomes, one wonders  how  they

can  possibly  save.   We  have read  about  bankruptcies

heading  for  an 18-year high.  A paper entitled  "Wealth

and  Liabilities of Singapore Households",  published  by

the  DOS  in  March this year, noted that  the  ratio  of

outstanding loans to the personal disposable  income  and

GDP of Singapore is the highest amongst several developed

countries, like the US, Japan, UK and France.   Madam,  I

think one mindset that we have to change is that we  save

only for retirement and thus, with CPF, it would be fine.

In  reality,  CPF  will not guarantee a good  retirement,

thus  the  need for us to radically change  some  of  its

features.    Recognising   this   too,   the   Government

introduced the Supplementary Retirement Scheme  (SRS)  to

enhance  Singaporeans' savings mechanism for  retirement.

But  while we may save for retirement, I believe we  need

to also save for potential unemployment.  While we may be

at  the crossroads and taking the path of the CPF changes

that  may lead us back to the sunny island, the road  may

be  bumpy, with thunderstorms and lightning.  We need  to

encourage  Singaporeans to be prepared  for  these  rainy

days.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2819</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rainy Day Account. Madam, I propose that the

Government    introduce   a   scheme   that    encourages

Singaporeans  to  save  for  unemployment.   I   am   not

advocating unemployment insurance for there are too  many

negative  social implications to it.  I am  proposing  an

opt-in    savings   programme   that   can    incentivise

Singaporeans to participate.  Such a scheme subscribes to

the  philosophy of self-reliance that we advocate in  the

people.   The key feature of this programme is  that  the

amount  of  benefits available upon unemployment  depends

largely  on one's own employment history, last-drawn  pay

and  how  much he has saved in the account.  The benefits

available from the scheme are based, first, on  what  has

been   accumulated  in  the  account  and,  second,  upon

registering  with  the  Singapore  Workforce  Development

Agency  and  deemed  to  be  actively  seeking  work  and

engaging in training, a line of credit may be extended to

him  after  he has exhausted the balance in his  account.

He  will continue to contribute to the account and  repay

the loan once he is gainfully employed again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we must make Singaporeans understand that

such  savings must be one of the items that they work  on

in  their  monthly budgets.  I am working  on  the  final

details of the proposal and will be pleased to submit  it

to the Government for consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, this is the second debate on the CPF in as

many   years.    Last  year  we  debated  it,   following

recommendations by the ERC.  We have been doing  so  much

in   the   past  years  to  grapple  with  this  economic

situation.   Each  time we see a ray of  hope,  something

happens.  While we continue to give Singaporeans hope, we

must  moderate their expectations.  We must come to terms

with  the  realities.   Madam,  I  support  the  proposed

changes  and  hope  that by the end of this  debate  and,

further into the future, in times of economic crisis like

this,  CPF will be remembered by Singaporeans as creating

a promising future and not cutting pay first.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2820</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Madam, I would

like  to  thank the DPM for the comprehensive  and  well-designed assistance schemes that he has announced,  which

would  help  workers affected by the  CPF  changes.   But

despite  the generous relief package announced,  the  CPF

measures announced will still mean pain for workers and I

would  like to highlight the far-reaching effects of  two

changes  in particular, and ask that the Government  pays

special attention to these aspects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the change to make the CPF rates more

flexible.  With the change, the CPF rate will go  up  and

down  within the 30-36% range, depending on the  economic

situation.   Madam, this change will come on top  of  on-going  efforts to make wages more flexible and  the  wage

cuts that workers are already taking.  The result is that

a  larger  portion of their wages, plus CPF, will  become

variable  and less reliable as a steady source of  funds.

A  smaller amount of their wages will now be fixed.   The

variable portion can fluctuate, depending on the economic

situation.   And  we  know  that, increasingly,  economic

cycles are getting shorter and more volatile.  This means

that  workers would have to factor in a greater level  of

uncertainty in their plans for the future.   It  will  be

harder  for  them to plan with confidence  and  to  chase

their  Singapore Dream.  For instance, they should  think

long  and hard, in fact, longer and harder before  buying

the  biggest  flat  they can afford  at  that  particular

moment.   They must now factor in a big enough buffer  in

case   their  CPF  and  their  variable  wages  are   cut

drastically,  unexpectedly  as  well.   This  requires  a

drastic mindset change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also requires a special will to resist housing

agents who do their sums for buyers on the basis of their

prevailing  salaries and prevailing  CPF  rates  and  who

insist to buyers that they can afford it, never mind what

the future holds.  I have met too many workers living  in

bigger  flats  who  now  regret bitterly  going  for  the

biggest  flats they could afford a few years back.   And,

now,  they  are having a hard time trying to  sell  their

flats even if they want to downgrade.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2821</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, recently, I had a dialogue with the union

representing  the public daily-rated workers.   They  are

basically  the  bottom earners in Singapore.   I  am  the

union adviser.  One of them, an electrician, lives in a 5-room flat and has nothing in his CPF balance, ie, 0.   He

is  52 years old and earns about $1,000 a month in gross.

He  takes  home about $800-plus a month and  he  supports

three  school-going children.  He has nothing in his  CPF

because all has been used up to buy his 5-room flat.  His

wife  and  his son also contribute their CPF towards  the

flat.    But  when  we think about it, we  cannot  really

blame  them  for  upgrading to a 5-room  flat  years  ago

because, going by the CPF rate and the salaries  at  that

time,  they  could afford the flat.  They  had  dutifully

done their sums.  HDB did not discourage them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the flexible CPF rates coming on top of their

other  uncertainties and worries can  be  psychologically

quite  hard on Singaporeans.  A moving CPF target may  be

an  easy  escape route for the Government and  employers.

But  for individuals, especially the lower income  living

from  hand  to  mouth, it can be a trap.  I would  rather

that  the  Government  just leave  the  CPF  at  a  fixed

sustainable rate, say, 33%, or, if necessary,  just  30%,

than  to  have  it fluctuate between 30% and  36%.   When

times  are good, it should return the cut to the  workers

via  CPF top-ups and wage bonuses, rather than raise  the

rate.   When times are bad, the companies affected should

just  shave  3%  off the variable part of the  wages,  if

necessary,  rather  than cut the CPF across-the-board  by

another three points to 30%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for this to work, employers must take wage

reforms  seriously.   However, as  we  have  heard,  many

employers  continue  to drag their feet  on  this.   And,

indeed,  when  the labour movement called for  profitable

companies  to return the savings from CPF cut to  workers

via  special cash bonuses, some companies said that their

salary  structure does not allow for this.   It  is  that

rigid.  Such a state of affairs is quite unacceptable  to

workers who have been asked, time and time again, to take

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2822</b></font><br><br>

CPF  and  wage cuts quickly and flexibly for the  greater

good.   Employers should take the extra  effort  to  also

reform  their wage system and to reward workers  just  as

quickly and as flexibly so as to be fair to the workers - if not for the greater good, then for their own good.  If

workers   see  their  employers  just  distributing   the

windfall  from  the CPF cut to shareholders  with  little

improvement  in the employment situation,  they  will  be

less  inclined  to  support CPF cut  so  readily  in  the

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF should not be seen as part of the variable

wages.   It should be seen as a fixed part of the  wages.

It  is important to keep a steady fixed stream of savings

for  retirement purposes.  I worry that as  long  as  the

Government allows CPF to be flexible, employers  will  be

reluctant and slow to implement wage reforms to make  the

wages  more flexible.  And I do not think this is in  the

interest of workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the second difficult change for workers

involves  the  raising  of the  Minimum  Sum.   By  2013,

workers  must  set aside $120,000 in their CPF,  half  in

property, and $25,000 in their Medisave, before they  can

withdraw  their CPF balances at age 55.  I am  glad  that

this is being introduced in phases.  But, still, it would

be hard for workers, especially the lower skilled and the

lower  income.  Take the example of a daily-rated cleaner

that  I  know,  who is 41 years old.  She  is  supporting

three  school-going children.  She will  be  affected  by

this  change.  She earns about $800 a month,  takes  home

about  $600-plus after deducting CPF.  She now has  about

$20,000  in her CPF savings, and even if she works  night

and  day,  for another 10 years, she will never build  up

the  required CPF Minimum Sum of $120,000.  So what  does

retirement hold for her?  More back-breaking work?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, one important consequence of this Minimum

Sum requirement is that it will force workers, especially

the lower income, to just keep working, whatever the work

is, till at least 62 years old, or else they will find it

hard to survive.  They cannot withdraw from their CPF  at

age 55 as they cannot meet the Minimum Sum

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2823</b></font><br><br>

requirement  and  they  have  little,  if  any,  personal

savings to rely on.  Indeed, woe to the workers who  lose

their  jobs after 55 years old for reasons out  of  their

control,  such  as  the jobs disappearing  to  a  cheaper

location  or their company restructuring.  They  will  be

caught  in the twilight zone, unable to get a job because

of  the skills mismatch and the job market preference for

younger  workers, and unable to draw on their CPF savings

because  of the higher Minimum Sum rule.  They will  have

little, if any, savings to rely on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, if we do not pay attention to this group and

defuse  this potential time bomb, we will have a mass  of

unhappy  jobless older Singaporeans with nowhere to  turn

to  for  ready  funds,  except  maybe  the  loan  sharks.

Indeed,  in this respect, my biggest worry is for  women.

According to the latest CPF figures, as at 31st May 2003,

women aged between 25 and 55 have a median net balance of

only  $27,000, compared to men in the same age range  who

have  about $36,500.  The median cash balance  refers  to

cash remaining in the CPF accounts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another set of figures, that of the median regrossed

balance,  is even starker.  The median regrossed  balance

includes  cash CPF savings and those withdrawn under  the

various  schemes  before  retirement.   For  women   aged

between 25 and 55, their median regrossed balance is just

about $64,000, while men of the same age range have about

$94,000.  In other words, on average, women have about  a

third  less  than men in their CPF accounts.  This  means

that,  compared to men, women would have  a  harder  time

meeting  their Minimum Sum requirement at  age  55.   The

reasons for this include the fact that women tend to take

time  off  from work to care for their families and  then

return to work later, often for lower pay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, women tend to live longer and

would  arguably need more in their CPF savings for  their

retirement.   I  urge  the  Government  to  pay   special

attention to women to see how we can help them to prepare

better for their retirement.  Perhaps, we should consider

a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2824</b></font><br><br>

bigger  CPF  top-up for women, when times  are  good,  to

recognise  their  role as primary care givers  for  their

families,  like  the  way we recognise  NSmen  for  their

sacrifice for the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also not forget singles who are the

primary care givers for their ageing parents or siblings.

I  would suggest that the Minimum Sum need not be a fixed

amount, standard across all income groups, but should  be

differentiated  with  different  figures  for   different

income  groups.  In this way, at least the  lower  income

can touch their CPF savings after 55 years old.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, in every dialogue with workers and unionists,

they  have asked for the cost of living to be kept  down,

as we have heard in this House.  I urge the Government to

take  these  calls  seriously and I am heartened  by  DPM

Lee's assurance that the Government is looking into  ways

to  cut  waste.  But to cut waste, it does  not  mean  to

translate  the savings into cheaper transport or  cheaper

housing  for workers.  So I would urge the Government  to

consider  whether  it is necessary  to  revive  the  Cost

Review  Committee, under PMO, to examine every  facet  of

transport  costs, education costs and housing costs,  and

put pressure on the Ministries and see how costs in these

sectors  can  be  kept down.  And, in  fact,  the  Health

Ministry  is  setting a model in how it  is  aggressively

looking  at  ways  to  cut  down  costs  which  will   be

translated into keeping costs down for the consumers.  It

would  go a long way in assuring workers that their worry

is  taken  seriously, especially since the GST will  rise

next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, in conclusion, workers accept these CPF

changes  because they want job security.  They also  want

to retire with peace of mind.  They have been taking wage

cuts   on   their  chin  and,  now,  the  CPF  cut.    In

implementing  these  changes, the  other  two  tripartite

partners, the Government and the employers, must do their

part to improve the situation for workers and to keep non-wage  costs down.  The tripartite partnership is only  as

strong as each partner is and each must be seen to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2825</b></font><br><br>

pull its weight fully during this difficult time.  It  is

like a three-legged race.  Each partner must keep pace or

the  race  to  save jobs and improve our  competitiveness

will fail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I support the changes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker,  as many of my colleagues have spoken before  me

and  many  issues have been raised and covered,  I  would

only  touch  on  some of the issues that I feel  strongly

about and try to keep my speech as short as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, Singaporeans understand the need to tweak

the CPF to save jobs.  What it means for many is that, be

it in their take-home pay or their CPF account, they have

to  make every penny work and work even harder.  But I am

sure that the announcement made by DPM would go down well

to allay some of the concerns of the workers.  In fact, I

am  really  happy that the Government is showing  genuine

concern and is acting on the feedback from the ground.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, recently, there has been an increase of

bankruptcy cases.  In fact, the Straits Times reported on

27th August 2003 that bankruptcies are set to hit an  18-year high.  It will reach levels not seen even during the

last  major recessions of 1985 and 1986.  With  the  weak

economy, there are many companies that hit the bottom  of

the sea, taking with them many individuals who are either

directors,  owners, or sole proprietors with them.   That

is  part of the business risk, and these businessmen knew

what they were in for.  But the unfortunate group are the

employees  who  find that they have not only  lost  their

jobs  but  also their CPF contributions held in trust  by

the  companies.  As I understand, many of these companies

would deduct their employees' monies as CPF contributions

but  delay for months from crediting the amounts to their

CPF  accounts.  As a result, when the companies  hit  the

iceberg and sank, the employees were left in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2826</b></font><br><br>

cold  icy water.  All that the CPF Board could do was  to

represent  them at the creditors' meeting.  Even  if  the

CPF Board was a first lien on any money that was left  of

the   insolvent  company,  there  would  be  nothing   to

compensate these workers for the loss of their  very  own

monies.  So the CPF first lien becomes a paper type.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the Law Society is looking into requiring

lawyers  to deposit their clients' monies into a  special

account  held  by  an  independent  body,  the  time   is

opportune  for  the  CPF  rules  to  be  changed.    With

electronic  banking and technology, the CPF  can  arrange

for employees' contributions to be deducted directly from

their  salaries into the Board's accounts.  In this  way,

even if a company sinks, the employee will only lose  his

employer's  contribution, but not his  own  contribution.

In fact, employers who use their employee's contributions

to  roll back into business and defer payment to the  CPF

Board  are  arguably  committing a  serious  offence.   I

believe  it  is  now timely to do something  about  this.

Since  the  Government is fine-tuning the CPF  rules,  it

should  also  look  into this loophole  and  protect  the

workers for whatever that is left in their savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who escape the property downturn, I hope

that   they   learn  from  the  experience   of   others.

Singaporeans  must  take  heed  of  their  own  financial

planning.  They have to understand that the days of going

for bigger and bigger flats are no longer viable, just as

prices can go up, they can fall too, and even faster.   I

remember that, in 1995 and 1996, Bishan flats were one of

the  highest priced HDB properties.  Today, some of these

property  owners  are facing serious difficulties.   Even

if  they  want to cut losses and bail out, they may  find

difficulty in finding a buyer, at least in the near term.

In fact, the demand pattern is likely to change with more

people turning to rent, rather than buy the flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the younger generation and potential property

owners,  may  I suggest that they plan wisely  and  think

carefully.  With the greater policy changes that may come

soon, as mentioned by DPM earlier, our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2827</b></font><br><br>

younger generation will have more choices and they should

plan better.  I would say it is better that they endure a

little  hardship  or  inconvenience now  while  in  their

youths, than jeopardising their future at old age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same light, I am glad that the Ministry of

National Development will make the necessary changes, and

it will be a welcome one in these present times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we must understand that the ripple effect of

the  CPF  cut  goes  beyond just  servicing  mortgage  or

property  loans.  Consumer spending pattern will  change,

as  people prioritise on their expenditure.  But for  the

economy  to  get  out of its current woes,  the  dose  of

medicine will require a multi-disciplinary approach.  The

Government  should  also  look at  a  whole  spectrum  of

indirect  taxation that is contributing to high  business

costs.   The  efforts announced by DPM in his  speech  is

good   news,   but  I  hope  they  will  translate   into

significant   cost  cutting,  and   the   cost   of   all

governmental fees will need to be realigned  to  the  new

economic situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, Government Ministries should be more

frugal  in  spending.  Cost-cutting  measures  should  be

introduced wherever possible.  By this, I mean that civil

servants  should  be measured against  their  ability  to

provide  an efficient and cost-effective public  service,

not by the credit balances in their coffers at the end of

each year.  Singaporeans are practical people.  They know

that  there  are  other  charges that  will  have  to  be

increased in the days to come for one reason or another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF retuning introduced by the Government will

benefit the big companies more than the smaller ones.  We

have  to  do more to help our SMEs who are our own  home-grown  companies, our own entrepreneurs.  These  are  the

companies that do not employ many workers, due  to  their

size  or  technology.  Many of them do not  benefit  much

from  the CPF cuts.  Though the package announced earlier

to  assist  SMEs  is  a  welcome one,  I  hope  that  the

Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2828</b></font><br><br>

will  work out a wider package of other measures to  help

our SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the current scenario brought me back

to my student days when I was in France in the 1980s.   I

read about European companies leaving the country to move

to  Southeast Asia, where operating costs were lower.  It

caused   unemployment,  and  unions  battled   with   the

employers  and  government, as  protectionism  sentiments

emerged.   Today,  some  of the  industries  returned  to

Europe, especially those which are dependent on a highly-skilled  workforce.  But unemployment still prevails  and

the  numbers are still high.  What it means for Singapore

is  that,  even as we take these corrective measures,  we

cannot but face the fact that, in time, we have to change

mindsets as we will have to face the ills that come as we

approach  the  developed economy status.  Yes,  there  is

economic growth, but so too unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, I would wrap up by hoping that the

Government  will look into the proposal to  give  further

protection  to  workers' CPF by amending  the  rules  and

drawing  up a more comprehensive package which will  help

our SMEs.  I am sure many Singaporeans will be cheered by

the generous relief package announced by DPM earlier but,

again,  some may not.  Nevertheless, I am confident  that

many have found something to be happy about in it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the retuning of CPF.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I

am  an independent director of two listed companies doing

business  in  China.  One, a metal stamping and  computer

parts  manufacturer, pays only about S$120 per month  per

worker  in Guangzhou and Suzhou.  The other, a  fish  and

vegetable processing company, pays about S$130 per  month

per  worker  in Qingdao.  And when I first visited  these

factories,  I  was taken aback.  How can we then  compete

against PRC workers unless we restructure our economy and

sharpen our competitiveness?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2829</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, it does not mean that we have to lower our

wages to the level of the PRC workers.  But it does  mean

that  we  must  try  hard to improve our competitiveness,

especially in terms of value-add and quality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, India is another rising giant, in terms of

outsourcing and service industries.  Now, more  and  more

global  companies are outsourcing their IT, call  centres

and   backroom   operations  to  India,  including   some

Singapore  companies and MNCs.  It is, therefore,  really

no  fun  to  be squeezed between China and  India  -  two

giants.   Nearer  home, even Thailand  and  Malaysia  are

rapidly  changing and competing against us  in  terms  of

manufacturing,  logistics and even  healthcare.   Bangkok

and Malaysia are fast developing their medical facilities

for  foreign patients.  They compete fiercely against our

private  hospitals in terms of costs.  And  we  are  well

aware  of the fierce competition from the Malaysian  port

at Tanjung Pelapas.  And the story goes on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a competitive situation, Singapore cannot

afford  to stand still, or we will be priced out  of  the

competition and out of existence.  For small  and  medium

enterprises that are struggling and trying to keep  their

heads  above  water,  the reduction in  CPF  contribution

could  be a lifeline thrown at them.  It would definitely

help  cash  flow.  It would definitely make a difference:

staying  afloat or going under the water.  If  more  SMEs

survive, jobs will be saved in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the CPF changes will therefore send a strong

signal  to  MNCs and foreign investors that Singapore  is

making  a  concerted and determined  effort  to  cut  and

contain  costs.  MNCs will consider this  a  plus  factor

and,  if  they stay put and expand in Singapore, we  will

avoid  the  hollowing-out effect.  And if new investments

come  in  as a result, more new jobs will be created  for

all  Singaporeans.  I have met some MNC  and  local  CEOs

recently, and they are upbeat about the changes  and  the

positive impact on our economy.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2830</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Prime Minister confirmed that the CPF cut

would  be  by 3%, from 36% to 33%, there was  a  sigh  of

relief.  People feared the worst, a possible cut to  30%.

We  can  see from here that the Government has  exercised

great restraint and care phasing in gradually the changes

in  the  CPF salary ceiling, Minimum Sum and the Medisave

Minimum  Sum  for  CPF  withdrawal  at  the  age  of  55.

Moreover,  the  Government  has  taken  great  pains   to

implement a package to cushion the impact of CPF  changes

for  Singaporeans,  as we heard in  this  Chamber  today.

They are really encouraging and better than expected, and

we can say for sure that the Government has left no stone

unturned  to help each and every Singaporean in his  time

of need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, I would like to appeal to banks and

financial  institutions  to do  their  utmost  to  assist

homeowners,  particularly those  from  the  lower  income

groups  who  are adversely affected by the  CPF  changes.

Banks  should consider seriously reducing interest rates,

restructuring the loans and extending the loan  repayment

periods for their customers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers should not take the workers for granted.

They should take note of and recognise the sacrifices  of

the  workers in forgoing their CPF.  Companies  that  are

doing  well  should  therefore  share  their  savings  or

profits  with  their  workers through  increases  in  the

variable  wage components or through bonuses.   Employers

should  also lead by example, and cut management salaries

and fees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, CPF cut is not the only factor or solution.

What  about  cuts  in  corporate  and  individual  taxes,

Government  levies and fees?  And, not to  forget,  there

should  also  be  cuts  in  red tape  in  the  Government

bureaucracy.   Cuts should not be one-sided.   Otherwise,

CPF cuts will be in vain.  In that sense, I am encouraged

that  DPM  Lee  and the Minister of State for  Trade  and

Industry, Mr Raymond Lim, have both pledged today in this

Chamber  that the Government will try its best to contain

and cut red tape and fees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Prime Minister said, we are at the

crossroads.  There comes a time in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2831</b></font><br><br>

the  history  of  the  nation  when  we  have  to  decide

collectively  to move forward, or to fall behind  and  be

marginalised.   The choice is clear.  We have  to  retune

CPF.  We have to retool our economy.  We have to bite the

bullet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Chinese, it is said "chang tong bu ru duan tong",

ie,  rather than suffer long agonising pain of  prolonged

unemployment,  it  is better to have  it  out,  bear  the

immediate   pain  of  CPF  adjustment,  restructure   the

economy,  sharpen  our  competitive  edge,  attract   new

investments, and create new jobs for our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have overcome many crises before: Separation,

early  British withdrawal, the 1984 recession  and,  most

recently,  the SARS crisis.  Fear not.  We have  done  it

before, and we can do it again.  We shall overcome.   The

economy  will  recover  and rise  again.   Jobs  will  be

plentiful  for  Singaporeans.  There  will  be  a  better

tomorrow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is, therefore, the time for all Singaporeans to

rally  behind  the Government, to work as a united  team.

We shall triumph and prevail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support the CPF changes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mdm

Deputy Speaker, the Prime Minister raised the proposal to

retune  the CPF.  He said we have to throw away  some  of

the  burdens  so  that  we can climb  this  road  to  the

highland.   This reminded me of the "Reform  and  Opening

Up" of China.  In the early 1980s, when China started  to

have  this reform and this opening to the outside  world,

Mr  Deng Xiaoping's famous quotes were displayed  at  big

billboards  along  the thoroughfare in Shenzhen  at  that

time.  He said that, "If we do not open up and we do  not

reform,  this would be a dead world for us."   The  Prime

Minister did not mention about death yesterday.   But  at

the  National  Day  Rally, he said  that  if  you  cannot

breathe,  then you will die.  If you just lose face,  you

would  not die.  And the Deputy Prime Minister  had  just

proposed the relief

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2832</b></font><br><br>

packages.  These are a shot in the arm.  So, even if  you

may  lose face a bit, you can still stand up and then you

can  walk.  In the past, when we fell down, we just stood

up  and  walked  again.  But now, when we fall  down  and

scratch ourselves, we wait for the Government to help us.

So,  I think the people should take action themselves and

cannot  just  rely  on  the Government.   Thus,  while  I

support  the  PM's  retuning  of  CPF  and  DPM's  relief

package,  the  issue here is: what next?   I  have  three

suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as the Prime Minister has said, we have to

lighten our burden, to travel light, and we have to  have

a  thorough  reform.  It is our hope that the  Government

and  the whole set-up would cut waste, just like what the

Deputy  Prime  Minister has said,  the  Cut  Waste  Panel

(CWP).   I  think the Government should do it  thoroughly

and have a thorough reform of the whole service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC had held dialogues with 38 unions involving a

few  hundred union leaders.  They all understand that  we

needed to adjust our expectation.  We have accepted  this

CPF  adjustment.  The question they asked is,  "Will  the

Government  adjust  our  cost  of  living?"   "Will   the

Government reduce its charges?"  "Will the employers look

after our welfare?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM has given us an assurance. The Government

should  change the mechanism.  So, when the workers  have

adjusted,  the Government should also adjust.  One  point

brought  up  by  many  people  is  that  they  could  not

understand why is it that hospitals still insist that  if

you stay in a B1 or B2, you cannot downgrade to a C-class

ward.   And if you are living in a 4 or 5-room flat,  why

not make the downgrading easier for them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is this song "Struggle to Win" saying that

sometimes  you  go  up and sometimes you  go  down.   The

Teochews said that if you can only go up and cannot  come

down,  the  whole  family will  die.   So,  I  think  the

Government  should do away with all the bureaucratic  red

tape.  We are having a problem now.  All said, we want to

reform.  But when the economy

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2833</b></font><br><br>

recovers,  let us hope that the civil servants  will  not

say that we will have to increase charges here and there.

If  that happens, everything will go back to what it  was

before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the employers are concerned, I am very

happy  to note that although Dr Gan See Khem is  also  an

employer, she feels that employers should do more to care

about their employees.  Many employers give a lot of  lip

service.   They  talk a lot but do very  little.   So,  I

think  when  the employers have benefited from  this  CPF

cut,  and  if they are doing well, they should share  the

gain with their workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as jobs are concerned, nowadays, we keep

hearing employers saying that Singaporeans do not want to

do certain kind of work.  But the question is:  what type

of  job  -  because the work system and  salary  are  not

conducive for locals.  They treated Singapore workers  as

foreign  workers.  I think the employers should redesign,

re-engineer their work so that workers will find it  more

friendly  and  conducive to work.  In this  aspect,  NTUC

will  work closely with the employers in various  sectors

on  this  so  that more unemployed Singaporeans  can  get

jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Government is very good in its

financial   management.   But  this  CPF  adjustment   is

actually a manifestation of Government's financial policy

and  philosophy.  The ordinary folks may not be  good  in

managing  their finances.  Singaporeans in  general  know

the ways to prosper and want to make profits, but they do

not know how to manage their fortune.  It is said that if

you  save  one  handful of rice in every meal,  in  three

years,  you  will be able to buy a horse.  When  we  talk

about  horses, Singaporeans will always talk about horses

in  terms of buying 4-D during the weekends and make some

windfall from there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also said that even billionaires should be

calculative.   However, Singaporeans  take  this  to  the

extent that as they have a few thousands dollars in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2834</b></font><br><br>

CPF,  they have to keep calculating about it every  night

and  every day. They always look at how they can maximise

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister had mentioned about the

inadequacy  of the Minimum Sum and proposed  that  it  be

raised over a period of time.  We have to explain to  our

people  plainly. Otherwise, the Government may put  in  a

lot  of  efforts. They may have very good intentions  but

the   people  would  not  appreciate  it.  In   financial

management,  we  do not just resort to the  experts.   We

should  teach every Singaporean how to manage  their  own

wealth and property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Prime Minister had mentioned that this

reform  is  painful.  In other words,  everyone  must  be

prepared  to  endure some pain.  The Prime Minister  said

that if we do not have a fish, even a prawn will do.  But

I  have people telling me that prawns are as expensive as

fish.   It  shows that people are not thinking  what  the

Prime  Minister  was thinking.  The Prime  Minister  said

that  if we do not eat fish, then eat the cheaper  prawns

but  Singaporeans are thinking about the  more  expensive

prawns.  I  think, in this case, if you have no  fish  to

eat,  you have to adjust downwards to have dried  prawns,

not fresh prawns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, Mr Low Thia Khiang had said that the

Prime  Minister might have forgotten, might have  amnesia

that we promised a better life.  In fact, Government  has

not  forgotten what they have promised. They want to give

the people a better living.  Thus, the retuning of CPF is

exactly with this aim in mind that you must first of  all

have  a  job before you can live a better life.   So  our

Government is anxious about them.  That is why we have to

do  this reform very speedily, as fast as we can.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang said that Government has not

fulfilled  its  commitment to the people  and  we  should

apologise  to the people.  I think he did not  understand

the  serious  situation.  For instance, if a  father  had

promised  the child that if he passed his PSLE, he  would

give  him  a  watch.   But  now,  the  father  runs  into

financial problem.  He may not be able to afford to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2835</b></font><br><br>

buy  the  son a good watch but he will still  buy  him  a

watch when he gets a job.  The son can understand.  I  do

not  know  why Mr Low Thia Khiang cannot understand.   Mr

Low  compared the Government with that of a rabbit  which

has  been sleeping and has just woken up from its  dream.

I  must  say that the Government has sleepless nights  on

the  job situation in Singapore.  So if you do not sleep,

how  do you have a dream?  Every day, the Government  has

been thinking of how to restructure our wages.  The Prime

Minister  has  already raised a lot  of  points  in  this

aspect, I would not repeat them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Ministry of Manpower to get

more  Singaporeans  upgraded through  its  newly  set  up

Workforce Development Agency.  The new economy has  taken

away  many of our jobs, so we have to speed up our skills

redevelopment  programmes.   NTUC  has  launched  various

upgrading programmes and many workers have benefited from

this  scheme.   But some people do not see  the  benefits

including  Mr  Low  Thia Khiang.  He has  said  that  the

Government should apologise to the people. Actually,  the

Government  is  looking at the big picture.   Many  years

ago,  we  had  already  made the  preparation  by  urging

workers to adopt the lifelong learning approach.  Now  it

is raining, and the weather is getting very stormy, so we

have to prepare ourselves for the stormy weather.  Mr Low

Thia  Khiang  blamed the Government for the bad  weather.

My point is that we could not stop the bad weather but we

can  prepare  for it.  I think we should  encourage  more

workers to participate in these training courses so  that

we  could see the general trend.  It is not the time  for

us to blame one another. We should be working together in

one heart.

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, as

PM  revealed  the  CPF  retuning measures  yesterday,  he

likened  the  measures that we have  to  take  as  bitter

pills.   As I sat listening to DPM this afternoon, laying

out  the  assistance and relief programmes, it  was  like

listening  to a Budget statement delivery in  a  form  of

sweets for Singaporeans affected by the CPF changes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2836</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister's National Day Rally speech

provided  a  sombre backdrop to our workers today  -  the

difficulty   in  finding  jobs  for  school-leavers   and

graduates,  the  fear of retrenchment, the  realities  of

being   retrenched,  the  difficulty  of   securing   re-employment,  the  face  of international  terrorism,  the

deadly  SARS  outbreak.  With all these before  us,  some

were worried that the Singapore dream has broken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be beaten if we allow ourselves to fall into

this mindset. Singaporeans were asked to rally around the

Government  in  these difficult times.  Singaporeans  and

Members of this House asked what the Government could  do

to  help us rise out of this valley of gloom.  Today,  we

have  heard  from  DPM  the programmes  that  would  help

Singaporeans taking the bitter pill, much more palatable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM's analogy of the boiled frog is that we have to

act  now.   The  changes to the CPF will  help  us.   The

saving  of jobs is the key objective here. The signal  to

investors and employers is clear.  We all agree on that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans, who have been holding their

breath  since  the  National Day  Rally,  were  a  little

relieved  yesterday when the CPF retuning  measures  were

revealed.  Then, there were those who have been  worrying

about  the  top-ups to pay for their mortgages.   We  now

know   that  they  number  76,000,  although   big,   but

manageable and will be assisted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With impending changes to HDB's policy that are to

be  announced, it is clear that the Government is serious

and  leaving no stones unturned to help our people.  This

is  an  unwavering  fundamental  commitment  of  the  PAP

Government.   Just  like  the SARS  battle,  Singaporeans

rallied to the Government's call for action and to  forge

a strong bond that the international community held us in

high regard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, though the sacred cow of the CPF

has been adjusted and tampered with, the Government's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2837</b></font><br><br>

bond and trust with the people, to this Singaporean,  has

not  been broken.  Singaporeans will once again be lauded

for  taking  hard  knocks and rolling  with  the  punches

whenever necessary to keep the Singapore ship ship-shape,

sea-worthy and sailing on. Fundamentally, we will all get

together and push on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I had prepared a long speech, asking the

Government to do this and that.  After DPM's statement, I

am  glad  that the programmes that will be put  in  place

will address the people's concerns and that help will  be

delivered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to touch on PM's message

yesterday about changing our lifestyles and to be prudent

in  our  spending.   The Government is  encouraging  more

employers  to adopt the monthly variable wage  component.

In  future, the employer's CPF contribution can also vary

in  accordance  with how the economy performs.   Both  of

these  components, taking effect at the same time,  might

be  a  double-whammy for some people, if they do  not  do

their financial planning well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the mortgage interest rates are at

historic  lows.  As sure as the rates have come  down  in

recent years, these rates will once again rise. There may

be  periods where the interest rate increase may  overlap

with  the  reduction in the income due to a reduction  in

employer's  CPF  and a reduction in the monthly  variable

component.   People should take this time to refocus  and

to look at prudent spending.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There would be no formula in place to indicate when

the  employer's CPF would be increased or decreased.   It

will  mean that Singaporeans must be realistic  in  their

budgeting for housing costs.  I understand that it may be

difficult  to  have a formula in place,  as  well  as  to

stipulate a definite notice period.  Having this  formula

or  a stipulated period of notice will hem in and inhibit

the  Government's responses in case when our  economy  is

threatened

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2838</b></font><br><br>

once  again.  So Singaporeans should create a  buffer  in

their  finances  in  good years and it  can  be  done  by

spending   prudently,  and  to  make  changes  to   their

lifestyles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the CPF retuning.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development and Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development and Minister for Defence (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, so many

speakers  have  spoken.   So  much  has  been  said.  The

analysts  have  dissected all  the  figures.   The  Prime

Minister  gave  an excellent overview. DPM  gave  a  very

comprehensive  review of the relief measures  that  would

cushion the impact of this proposed CPF cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I asked myself whether I should speak. One less

speaker  out of 51 speakers makes no difference.   But  I

thought to myself:  maybe I should speak.  So I asked  my

good  friend here, Dr Tan Cheng Bock, "Shall I  speak  or

not?  I would sound like a broken record."  He said, "No,

you must speak."  And he will also be speaking on Monday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night, on the way back home from this House, I

tuned in to the Chinese radio programme, FM95.8.  I  urge

all  Members  to listen to the feedback programme  around

5.30-6.30  pm.   It gives honest feedback  from  Chinese-speaking HDB heartlanders.  I heard my friend, Kwek  Teng

Swee, who said that this 3% CPF cut does not cut any  ice

with  SMEs.  In fact, I read in Zaobao today and  he  was

quoted to have said that the CPF cut will save him a  few

hundred  dollars  but, in turn,  he  has  to  pay  a  few

thousand  dollars,  because of the 1% GST  increase  next

year.   Then  the  DJ  decided,  I  think,  to  get  more

employees  to  speak on the channel.  One  employee  said

that  he did not agree with these employers as they  were

looking at their perspective. 3% was a lot to him.  As he

was  a  wage earner, a few hundred dollars cut  sometimes

means life and death, whether he could send his child  to

school or whether he could cut back on his tuition.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2839</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate goes on in spite of comments by some

newspaper  analysts.  One in Today  saying  that  it  was

almost  a  non-event, when people expected a 6% CPF  cut,

the Prime Minister announced 3%.  The debate in the House

yesterday simmered down to a low ebb.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the debate goes on outside this House. 3% is a

lot  of  money  to many people.  When PSA retrenched  the

workers  earlier this year, I was one of the MPs who  was

involved  directly.  Not only was I the  advisor  to  the

Singapore  Port  Workers'  Union  (SPWU),  many  of   the

retrenched workers actually live in Tiong Bahru  and  the

Tanjong  Pagar GRC area.  In fact, one of my RC  Chairmen

was    retrenched.   Another   Vice-Chairman   was   also

retrenched.  Many residents were also retrenched.  I feel

very  sad for them because many of them are in their 40s.

And  in their 40s, as my friend, Mr Nithiah Nandan  said,

it  is quite hard to find a job because jobs are hard  to

come by and the cost of doing business is high.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I decided therefore that instead of going

through  many of the comments that Members of  the  House

have spoken on, I would look for something inspiring.   I

do not know whether you have heard this story.  But a few

months  ago,  a  true  life human story  of  courage  and

endurance  made  the  headlines  around  the  world.   An

accomplished  mountain climber was  climbing  a  mountain

cliff.   Unfortunately,  he got one  arm  caught  in  the

crevice.   He  was unable to extricate himself  from  the

mountain  face.   So  he waited and waited,  waiting  for

help.  Days turned into nights, nights turned into  days.

Help  did not come.  People were looking for him but they

could  not locate him.  Hope turned to despair.   He  was

cold,  he  was  hungry, he was tired  and  his  body  was

beginning to weaken.  He knew that if help did  not  come

within one or two days, he would be a suspended corpse on

the mountain face.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hallucinated very often. But in his moment of

sanity, he decided to do one thing. He decided that  only

he could save himself. So he took out his Swiss army

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2840</b></font><br><br>

knife and decided to cut away his arm.  Cutting the  skin

was the easy part.  Then, he began to cut his flesh. When

he  reached  the  bone, the pain was  excruciating.   The

Swiss  army knife was a very blunt instrument for cutting

an  arm.  But because he wanted to live, survival was  on

his  mind,  his  family was on his  mind,  the  pain  was

nothing.   His  will  prevailed.   Eventually,  he  freed

himself.  But that was not the end of the story,  because

he  was  still in the middle of nowhere.  He had to  walk

for  miles  in  the  snow.  He crawled,  he  limped  and,

finally,  help  came.  Today, he lives to tell  his  tale

with a smile.  Tomorrow, he will climb another mountain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to tell this real

life  human  story  to people who are  worried  that  the

proposed   CPF   cut  will  cause  pain  and   suffering.

Certainly, there will be pain.  In fact, even without the

CPF  cut, employers can always cut salaries.  So,  it  is

either  CPF cut or a cut of total wages through  salaries

and  bonuses, or through variable bonuses.   And  we  all

have  to make adjustments.  All of us have committed  our

CPF  to housing loans, to our children's study loans  and

so  on and so forth.  Therefore, we have to rearrange our

finances.   But  this is not the end of  the  world.   It

might be if we do not do anything.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key question we have to ask ourselves is similar

to  the  question which the mountaineer had to  ask.   He

asked, "Would cutting my arm off save my life?"  We  have

to  ask a similar question,  whether cutting the CPF will

resuscitate the economy.  To the mountaineer, the  answer

is obvious.  Similarly, the answer stares us in the face.

The  analogy is not quite complete because we do not lose

an arm.  He cannot grow back his arm.  He can only use an

artificial   arm  to  climb  the  next  mountain.    But,

collectively, we can recover our losses.  If cutting  the

CPF restores the economy and the economy grows over time,

then total wage would rise and 33% of a higher base would

probably  recover  the  3%  loss.   So,  the  faster   we

implement  the  CPF  cut,  the faster  we  can  extricate

ourselves from this economic quagmire.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2841</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The analogy of the mountaineer is useful. If the

mountaineer  had  been indecisive and  cut  off  his  arm

later, he would certainly have bled to death or he  would

have starved to death.  To him, it was a very small price

to pay  -  an arm for a life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us, the consequences are not so severe. Over

time, I am sure the economy will restore itself.  And  we

must not forget that we had it good for a long time.  The

40%  CPF  was  riding  on the back of  endless  waves  of

economic  tsunami.  So, in absolute terms, we  have  been

getting  a  lot  more from our employers.  In  percentage

terms,  it  had  always been 40% for some time.  But  the

question is:  how soon can we recover?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the good news from my perspective is that we

have  not  reached the point of no return.  Our  official

unemployment rate is 4.5%.   They say it might go to 5.5%

later this year or sometime next year.  But this is still

a small figure by developed world standards.  Let us look

at  Hong Kong, the worst case in this part of the  world.

Hong Kong's unemployment rate, officially, is about 8.7%.

It  is  in  a  severe recession.  Of course, that  is  no

comfort to us, comparing Singapore to Hong Kong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at somewhere down south - Australia.

Many  Singaporeans have been making a beeline  to  go  to

Australia for holiday.  Indeed, many have emigrated there

in  the  last  few years.  Australia is one  of  the  few

bright  economic spots anywhere in the world today.   Its

currency  has  gone  up by something  like  25%  to  30%,

depending at what point we compare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sydney property prices have really shot through the

roof.  In fact, they sold more million dollar homes  than

we  have ever sold in the last three years.  Yet, it  may

surprise Singaporeans to learn that unemployment in  boom

town Australia is 6.2% today.  They are at the height  of

economic prosperity and yet unemployment is 6.2%.  We are

almost   at  the  trough  of  the  recession,   but   our

unemployment is only

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2842</b></font><br><br>

4.5%.   So, we can only improve on 4.5%.  It might go  to

5.5%, but I think we can improve on this very soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second good news is that we truly have all the

resources.  What we lack today is the resolve.   All  our

infrastructures  are  first class  -  our  roads,   power

stations,   airports,   housing.   Everything  is   first

class.  They have all been paid for and they are all sunk

cost.   Once  we  adjust the CPF, total  wage  costs  for

employers go down, and when Government adjusts  its  fees

downwards, I think we will become very competitive.   And

our  neighbours  better fear for their  shirts.   Because

whatever  we  earn  belongs to us.  We  do  not  have  to

service  interest payments which our neighbours  have  to

do.   Hence, I am very confident that cutting the CPF  is

the  right  policy.  Even though using the CPF to  adjust

total wage cost is a very blunt instrument, as Mdm Deputy

Speaker  had spoken yesterday, it is effective, like  the

mountaineer  who used a Swiss army knife to cut  off  his

arm.   The  Swiss army knife was a very blunt instrument,

but it worked at the right time and at the right place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I am supporting this policy, not just because

I  am  in Government  -  I have supported many Government

policies  -  but on this point, I am supporting it for my

children.  I am supporting it for our children,  for  our

friends  and  for  our relatives.  I know  of  people   - friends,   colleagues,  relatives   -   who   have   been

unemployed for a long time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About two years ago, one of my very good MPS helper

told me, "Mr Koo, I can't help you any more."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I said, "What happened?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, "I am going to Australia."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, "Why would you want to leave?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, "Actually, I have been unemployed for a

long  time.   I have been looking for a job but  I  can't

find a job.  I wound down my business.  I sold my car.  I

sold my flat.  I am left with a little bit of money.   My

children are studying there.  They are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2843</b></font><br><br>

working there.  It's cheaper for me to go there and  rent

a small flat."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have lost him, but he has not migrated because he

does not qualify to be a migrant.  He is not rich enough.

So,  he  is on a social visit pass.  Every time he  comes

back to Singapore, he comes to my MPS and helps me.   And

he  has asked me whether I can help him to get a job.   I

have  been trying and I cannot.  All the companies I know

are actually retrenching people because business has been

poor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days ago, I had lunch with two ex-colleagues.

One  is a 42 year old ex-General Manager of Tanjong Pagar

Town  Council.  Another is an ex-colleague in the  Public

Works  Department, going back almost 20-something  years.

I  cannot remember the vintage.  The younger ex-colleague

told  me that he was clearly worried whether his children

would  have  a future in Singapore, with so  many  people

leaving Singapore or giving up hope.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older colleague has two children in Australia - one studying in Melbourne University and the other in

Queensland University.  But he told me that his  children

had told him, "What should we do if we don't get jobs  in

Singapore?  Should we stay in Australia?"  He is  clearly

worried  because he and his wife want their  children  to

come  back to stay in Singapore.  When  we grow  old,  we

all want our children to come back and stay with us.   We

all  want  friends to be around.  When our  children  and

friends  have  to leave Singapore, not because  they  are

quitters,  but  because they need to earn  a  living  for

themselves, we should sympathise with them.  But  at  the

same  time,  it is hard for us to accept that the  people

closest  to  us  are forced to leave the country  because

they cannot find meaningful jobs here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 60s before I got a scholarship, I was very

tempted  to  go  to the Philippines for my  undergraduate

studies.    Because  at  that  time,  in  the  60s,   the

Philippines  was  the  second most developed  economy  in

Asia.   The  first was Japan.  Today, the Philippines  is

among one of the poorer countries in Asia.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2844</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Iraq war broke, the Philippine government

was  worried  about two things.  They were worried  about

the  lives of the Filipinos in the Middle East, but  they

were just as worried over the loss of foreign income from

that part of the world, because the Philippine economy is

now  heavily  dependent  on  remissions  from  their  own

workers  in  the  Middle  East  and  across  the   world,

including a major component from Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reversal of fortune should not be lost on us.

Today, we are a rich country.  Tomorrow, we should  be  a

rich  country,  but history has a way  of  turning  hopes

upside down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, many of us are clearly worried about our

future.   We know that Cabinet, in particular the  senior

leadership  in  Cabinet, had sleepless  nights  agonising

over  this policy change.  PM and DPM have revealed  that

Cabinet  agonised  for  at least  two  months  over  this

decision.  We are sure that some of the senior leaders in

Cabinet must have agonised long before they even broached

the subject to Cabinet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leadership ought to be worried. And this is a

good  leadership that worries.  The PAP leadership  lives

by  its honour code.  What it cannot deliver, it does not

promise.   What  it promises, it had delivered.   And  on

this,  it  has  fallen down.  There was a  commitment  to

restore the CPF to 40%.  To break a commitment like  that

and  reverse  it must have weighed heavily on  them.   It

could  not  have been an easy decision for Cabinet.   PM,

DPM  and several Ministers have come here to explain, and

in  their explanations, we can feel their sense of burden

and their sense of worry.  Obviously, they have worried a

lot  before  they  made  the policy  pronouncement.   The

Chinese  have a saying.  A good leader first worries  and

then  enjoys last  -  sian tian zhi xia, you er you,  hou

tian zhi xia, le er le.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, we can see the agony written all over their

faces.   While we should be worried about going  forward,

how  to  readjust our finances, we should  also  spare  a

thought for the senior leaders,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2845</b></font><br><br>

because  history  will have to write the  final  chapter.

But I am convinced that history will vindicate them.  And

I   have  no  doubt  that  history  and  historians  will

vindicate  this policy U-turn. This policy  U-turn  is  a

mark  of  political conviction.  It is not  a  course  of

political  convenience.   I  urge  this  House  and   all

Singaporeans and those who speak to jiu wu ba  (95.8)  to

support this proposal.
