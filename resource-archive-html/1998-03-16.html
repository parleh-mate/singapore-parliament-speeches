<div align="center"><b>CHILDCARE SUBSIDY</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Review)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon</b> asked the Minister for Community

Development  when  the  Government  will  review  its  childcare

subsidy again so as to help the lower-income group, to encourage

more  women  to  return to the workforce  and  to  help  working

parents balance between work and family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Community Development (Mr Abdullah

Tarmugi):   Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the  provision  of  child   care

subsidies is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>



precisely to help women to return to the workforce.  The subsidy

is  given  across the board to all Singaporean  mothers  in  the

workforce.   Special  help is given to low-income  families  who

receive  additional  financial subsidies from  the  Centre-based

Financial Assistance for Child Care Scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subsidies are reviewed regularly and the last one we

carried  out was in April 1995.  My Ministry is carrying  out  a

study  on  how  to provide more child care places  to  meet  the

demand and also to allow mothers more choices.  We also want  to

ensure  that  child  care is affordable to families,  especially

those  with low-income.  The subsidies will be reviewed as well.

The study should be completed by the middle of this year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member ):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may

I  ask the Minister what steps is the MCD taking to attract more

mothers  to join the workforce.  I know it is the responsibility

of Ministry of Labour.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, as rightly pointed out by the

Member, I think that Question should rightly be directed to  the

Ministry of Labour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head R (cont.) -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question [13th March, 1998],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head R of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100." - [Mr Chew Heng Ching].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, when I was cut off last Friday, I

was  speaking  on  TV  programmes.   It  is  important  that  TV

programmes,  especially the News that is telecast in  Singapore,

and  as  pointed  out by the Minister last year  in  the  Budget

debate,  should focus on the Singapore viewpoint.   It  is  very

important because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>



sometimes I wonder what has a bus accident or small human  story

in  America  got  to  do.  In fact, if there  were  other  human

stories  of  what is happening in Asia they would be  much  more

relevant.  So I would urge the News editors to focus and give  a

Singapore  viewpoint whenever news is reported.   There  may  be

some human angle, I can agree.  But to report on small incidents

of  road  blocks, or things like that, I do not think it  serves

any purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now move to the question of Indian programmes, Sir.

The  Indian News programme is hampered because it has to  depend

on  the  other sections and it does not cover news on the Indian

community as widely as it should.  Also, there is a tendency for

the  Indian  news  programmes to focus on matters  happening  in

India.  I do not deny that India is an important country but  to

focus  unduly  on affairs in India, I think it is not  good  for

Singapore,  and  I  would urge that we  should  take  a  focused

viewpoint.  The Indian PAC has pointed this out.  But I want  to

share  my  views with this House that we should try  to  portray

India's problems in India's setting and not India's problems  in

Singapore setting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it would be good to have more journalists in this

section.  I know there are budget constraints.  But I would  ask

the Minister to urge his colleague, the Finance Minister, to  be

a  little more generous because I know the Indian programmes are

not  self-financing.   But  it is an  important  sector  of  the

community  and it should get its coverage, not only  the  Indian

programmes  but the other community and national  programmes  in

the Indian channel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is the question of timing. I know the

timing  has  improved.  The Minister may say that we are  asking

too  much.   But  I think it would benefit half  of  the  Indian

community, especially the younger listeners and viewers, if  the

News  programme  could be shifted after  8.30  pm.   The  second

point,  Sir, is that we do not have a current affairs  programme

in the Indian segment.  It is important to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>



know what is happening around us in Singapore and we should have

such  a programme either twice a month or, if not, at least once

a  month.   The programme could be for half an hour to one  hour

where  the Indian viewers could have the opportunity to see  the

problems  facing Singapore.  For this, I think  we  should  have

funding.  Again, I would urge the Minister to reconsider this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must applaud TCS for the improvement in its quality

of  programmes.  I think it would be hypocrisy not to admit that

the  standards  have gone up.  But I am asking the  Minister  to

urge his officers to do something that we can be proud of our TV

and radio programmes, especially when they compare with the news

media.  If you look at the Straits Times, it has got such a wide

coverage, in particular From the Gallery.  If we could have  the

same  coverage for TV programmes, I think Singapore as  a  whole

would benefit.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

television  programmes produced by TCS   have  become  part  and

parcel  of  the  Singapore  culture,  and  the  current  affairs

programmes  and  dramas produced by Channel 8 have  also  become

part of the social life in the Chinese community in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1997 is an eventful year for Singapore. First, we were

affected  by  the  haze.  Then there was  this  tension  between

Singapore  and Malaysia, followed by the financial  turmoil  and

the  SilkAir  tragedy.   The  current  affairs  programmes  from

Channel  8  such  as Tuesday Report, Focus and Money  Week  gave

extensive  coverage  and analysis of all these  events  for  the

benefit  of Singaporeans who are concerned with the society  and

the fate of their compatriots. The efforts and prompt reports by

the   Current   Affairs  Section  of  TCS  are   indeed   highly

commendable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, TCS telecast a serial known as Taxi Driver,

which  was  well  received by the audience in general,  and  the

taxi drivers themselves in particular.  They feel that this kind

of drama truly reflects our society and the transport workers in

our society.  It shows not only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>



their  life  but  also their hardship.  It  would  also  promote

better   understanding  between  the  taxi  drivers  and   their

commuters,  as well as  improve the image of taxi  drivers.   On

behalf  of  the  taxi  drivers, I would like  to  record   their

appreciation to the producers of this serial.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Programme Advisory Committee in its report released

recently, pointed out that among TCS's top 10 serials last year,

two   were  considered  to  be  undesirable,  not  suitable  for

children.   One  of  them  is the Choice Partner  which  conveys

undesirable ideas and the other is Rising Expectations which has

a  very complicated plot, involving prostitution, rape and other

very illicit relationship between men and women.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report commended the good social values depicted in

The Price of Peace and Guest People.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one related problem is that the viewership of Channel

8  drama serials  has generally dropped.  In the past, they used

to  command  a viewership of more than 700,000, but now  it  has

dropped  to  around  600,000.  When we are producing  television

drama serials, no doubt we have to consider viewership, but with

so  many channels now available, a viewership of 600,000 can  be

considered not too bad.   If we want to cater for the viewership

and the revenue from the commercials, and add in plots which are

undesirable and depict bad social values, then  it is not  good.

I  think  we should not be too surprised by a drop in viewership

because there are now so many channels available to the viewers.

Viewership is spread out and thinned out.   What TCS  should  do

is  to produce more programmes like The Price of Peace and Guest

People  to attract more viewers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few days, we have been discussing the question

of  bond-breakers of our scholarship holders in this Parliament.

This  involves  the  basic  value of trust.   TCS  may  consider

gathering  more materials on this matter and produce a programme

on   scholarships,  bond-breakers,  and  so  on.   Perhaps,  the

Minister may call upon TCS  to consider  producing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>



a  programme  based  on scholarship bond-breakers.  If  we  have

realistic programmes like this, it has a good chance of securing

high viewership.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in

the  Final Report of the Advisory Committee on TCS Chinese Drama

and  Variety Shows (ACCESS), 1996/98, it was pointed out,  among

other things, that TCS should not telecast programmes which  are

unsuitable  for children, during the prime time.  In  the  past,

TCS used to schedule their programmes in such a way that certain

types  of programmes were telecast during certain time slots  to

cater  for the different groups of viewers. However, as  pointed

out  by  the  Advisory Committee, in recent years, there  was  a

change  in  this kind of arrangement.  I feel that the Singapore

Broadcasting Authority should prepare a  menu for  TCS  so  that

they  would  be  guided  as to when to  telecast  what  kind  of

programme.  Then, the Chinese Programme Advisory Committee (PAC)

will  not have to spend so much time to set out all this  advice

in its annual report.  The Committee will then have more time to

devote  themselves on constructive suggestions and giving  ideas

on  the production of better programmes, such as art programmes,

documentaries,  etc.  to  inculcate  cultural  values   in   our

children  and young people, for example, to encourage people  to

look after the old and the elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the locally produced TV drama serials, I am glad to say

that  over  the past few years, they have improved by leaps  and

bounds.   But  there  is still room for  improvement.    On  the

whole, the programmes are good.  There are not many big problems

with the programmes.  But, as pointed out in the final report of

ACCESS,   TCS  should  be  careful not to introduce  undesirable

values  in  these  serials, as these serials  have  considerable

influence on our society at large.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the TV programmes from another angle, when you

are   talking  about  the  decline  in  viewership  of  our   TV

programmes,  I think this is a bigger problem that  we  have  to

face.  Because, basically, from the viewership, we can see



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>



the   challenges  facing  TCS  and  SBA  ahead.   Comparing  the

viewership of our programmes with that of the imported ones,  we

can know how we fare.



<br>12.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we have cable TV and wireless TV. Are there any

differences in the programmes between the two?   I think we have

to consider this point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, are the wireless TV Channel 5 and Channel 8 making

profits or not?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, how are the programmes produced by us compared to

those  produced  by  Hong Kong and China  which  are  now  being

telecast over cable TV?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decline of viewership for our local TV channels is not

a totally unexpected phenomenon.  I believe that in the years to

come,   viewership  may continue to decline as  cable  TV  gains

popularity.   I  hope the Minister can take this opportunity  to

inform us of the future of cable TV and wireless TV.  What  kind

of a role will TCS  play in future?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is on digital TV. The advent of digital TV

will also have an impact on television in Singapore.  There will

be  some kind of revolutionary effect.  I hope that the Minister

can enlighten us on this new phase of development in  television

in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, I rise to address

some  concerns specific to Singapore Cable Vision (SCV) or cable

TV.   Would  the  Minister be able to provide an update  on  the

project  to  develop the infrastructure for Singapore  to  be  a

"wired city state"?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the items on the agenda was to give every household

access  to cable TV, should they wish to subscribe to  it.   For

HDB   estates,  the  feasibility  and  the  cost  is  reasonably

efficient.   But  how does SCV handle landed  estates  where  it

could  cost easily up to $3,000 to wire up an individual  house?

What  if private estate residents refuse to pay this sum?   What

recourse  does  MITA  or SCV have?  Would  the  Minister  please

clarify?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, further to my comment on the long-term role of TCS

which  I raised last Friday under an earlier amendment, I  would

like  to seek clarifications from the Minister on what MITA  see

as the long-term role of SCV vis-a-vis TCS?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is timely to review the definitions and the role

of SCV versus TCS, in the light of the limited resources that we

have.   And I mentioned last Friday that we should try to  avoid

too much duplication of resources.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, first, I wish to declare

my  interest.   I am a director at Singapore Technologies  (Pte)

Limited, which is one of the principal shareholders of Singapore

Cable Vision (SCV).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCV is responsible for wiring up the entire island to

ensure Singapore is cable ready by the end of next year, in time

for  the  new millennium.  I wish to take up, more specifically,

the  point  just raised by my colleague, Mr Chew.  I  understand

that  progress in wiring up has been good.  80% of the HDB flats

have  been wired and I think about 40% of the private flats have

also  been  similarly wired.  The project has been  extended  to

landed  properties,  and  I understand the  response  from  this

segment  of  the population has been less than enthusiastic.   I

think  the  relatively  high cost of getting  wired  up  is  the

principal reason for this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may illustrate, Sir, for the typical HDB unit, the

first TV point is free.  For each subsequent point, the cost  is

$60-$70.  This affordable rate is possible, partly because of  a

Government grant to SCV to wire up about 7,000 HDB blocks.   For

a  typical private flat, the cost to the first TV point is  $150

and  $90  for  each  subsequent point.  There is  no  Government

subsidy,  as far as I understand, but the operator  is  able  to

offer  more competitive prices because of the density  of  these

developments.  But for private landed properties,  the  cost  to

the  first point is at least $1,500 and, in some cases, as  high

as  $3,000.  This is largely because they have to foot the  bill

of  the  external  wiring, to tap the main  lines  of  Singapore

Telecom and bring it to the household.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of these households could reasonably ask the

question whether the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>



service or cable access they receive is worth paying 10 times as

much  or  more  as  that paid by their counterparts  in  HDB  or

private  flats.  There are about 60,000-70,000 such  households.

I  urge the Minister to consider extending a Government grant or

some  other form of measure to defray at least part of this cost

which  would otherwise have to be borne by these households.  It

would at least bring it to a level more comparable to that  paid

by private flats and HDB estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One possible measure could be for Government, the household

and  SCV  to  bear this cost equally, for argument's sake,  $500

each.  I think this would amount to about $35 million investment

for  the  Government as a one-off exercise.   This  would  be  a

worthwhile  investment in Singapore's IT infrastructure,  as  we

all  know  that  the cable network is not just a medium  for  TV

programmes,  it  is  part  of Singapore  One  providing  a  high

bandwidth   network  for  access  to  the  Internet  and   other

multimedia  applications.  In time to come,  a  cable  point  is

going  to be as essential in the home as a telephone point,  and

we  do  not have this kind of differentiation when it  comes  to

telephone  points in the home.  At least, the cost  relativities

are  far less.  It would therefore be a great pity, I think,  if

we do not seize this opportunity to ensure that all of Singapore

is cable ready by the end of next year.  I think, in my view,  a

Government  financial stimulus would be a  welcome  catalyst  in

this respect.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, Singapore

is  now  developing  into an IT hub.  Our IT infrastructure  and

development  are more advanced than our neighbouring  countries.

The  strange  thing  is  that countries such  as  Indonesia  and

Malaysia  which  are  lagging behind us in IT  development,  are

allowing  their  people  to  use the satellite  dish  freely  to

receive satellite TV telecast,  while Singapore bans the use  of

such satellite dish.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is concerned that if people are allowed to

tune  in  freely to undesirable programmes, such as pornography,

from   the  satellite  TV,  this  would  have  a  grave  adverse

repercussion on our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>



society.  I agree with this stand.  However, with the advance in

technology, would the Minister consider the use of some kind  of

technology  to  block out such undesirable programmes  from  the

satellite TV, so that they will not reach Singapore?   Then  the

Government can allow people to install satellite dishes so  that

they can freely select and watch programmes from other parts  of

the world, particularly programmes on political commentaries.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

today,  the  younger  generation of Singaporeans  are  receiving

better  education,  and many of them are effectively  bilingual.

With  the advancement in communications, the quality of life  of

our  people  has enhanced.  Now, more and more Singaporeans  are

travelling overseas to broaden their visit and to motivate their

pursuit for knowledge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, each of the four language streams has one

daily  newspaper.   In addition, there is one afternoon  English

newspaper and two Chinese evening newspapers.  As far as I know,

many  Singaporeans are hoping to have at least one more  Chinese

or  English daily newspaper, so that they can have the option of

an  alternative  newspaper to the existing one  and  only  major

language newspaper in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after 30 years of nation building, our people are more

mature  now.   The  younger  generation  of  Singaporeans   have

received better education.  They know how to distinguish between

right and wrong.  They are not easily instigated by others.   So

by  giving  them one more newspaper, their daily life  could  be

further  enriched.    Under competition, I think  the  editorial

contents  and  substance  of  the newspapers  would  be  further

improved  and  more  quality reports will be  provided  for  the

benefit of  the readers.  To the advertisers, they will have  an

alternative choice to place their advertisement.  It  will  also

create   more  job  opportunities  for  our  mass  communication

students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Government has already started what we call a

"self-discipline" development in terms of education and culture.

For example, the Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>



Education is encouraging more independent schools to be  set  up

so  that  they  could have their own curriculum and  methods  of

teaching,  provided they comply with the   guidelines issued  by

the Ministry of Education.  Secondly, with cable TV and Internet

getting  more and more popular, it implies that MITA is allowing

our  people to be subjected to the impact of various  views  and

schools  of  thoughts.   Thirdly, we are allowing  our  cultural

organisations more space for development, for example,  busking.

Under  the  necessary  supervision, encouraging  creativity  and

competition is a breakthrough.  I hope that the Government would

encourage  any  consortium which is interested to  start  a  new

major daily newspaper in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, I am sorry I did not catch your

eye earlier.  I am speaking on radio stations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in its efforts to further improve the radio services

to  better meet the needs of Singaporeans, the Radio Corporation

of  Singapore (RCS), following popular requests by MPs  and  the

general  public,  introduced  the arts  radio  station  and  the

dialect  news programmes over radio in recent months.   I  think

these  are  good  moves.  It serves to benefit our  arts  loving

Singaporeans and our senior citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recent financial crisis developments in the

region,  the  Indonesian crisis, the SilkAir MI 185  crash,  the

Thai  baht  crisis and so on, all show that there is  a  greater

demand  now  for  news coverage of international,  regional  and

current events over radio.  Singaporeans want to tune in to  the

latest on the news.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe we have yet to have a station solely

dedicated to providing up-to-date news.  May I therefore ask the

Minister what plans RCS has to set up more stations to cater  to

the  needs of Singaporeans in general and the business community

at large?

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, Chinese

news  over  Channel  8  enjoys one of  the  highest  viewership,

especially during this period of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>



financial  crisis and unrest in Indonesia.  A lot of people  are

watching TV  news on Channel 8.  Two months ago, in January,  TV

news  on  Channel 8 itself became a  focus of news   because  it

failed to telecast the death of the well-known veteran comedian,

Wang  Sa.  There was no mention at all over the TV news  in  the

three  days immediately after his death.   A lot of people  were

talking  about this omission.  Personally, I believe  that  this

omission was unintentional.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incident tells us that our society is still quite

humane.   Our  veteran  comedian died, and  he  is  still  being

remembered  by the people.  They want more people to know  about

his death through the TV news.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we are going regional and international, the news

on  TCS  should  cover  not only local news,  but  regional  and

international news as well, so that Singaporeans can cast  their

eyes  not only on our society but on the whole world.   This,  I

think, should be the policy of all media in Singapore.   On  top

of  that,  we  are a multi-racial society.  One of  our  special

features  is the ability to seek concord while maintaining   our

differences.   As such,  the people of Singapore  are  concerned

not  only with common issues in our nation, our society and  the

region, but also  what is happening in our own communities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, while covering the major events in the world and

in Singapore,  Channel 5, Channel 8 and Channel 12 share more or

less  the  same contents.  However, while covering news  on  the

various communities,  each has its own characteristics.  At  the

same   time,  they  do  not  exclude  coverage  on   the   other

communities.    This  is  to  ensure  that   there   is   better

understanding and familiarisation among the various communities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take our Straits Times, Lianhe Zaobao, Beritan Harian, and

Tamil  Murasu,  for example.  Although their main  focus  is  on

Singapore,  regional and international news,  each has  its  own

characteristics   when  covering  events  in  their   respective

community.   To understand the Chinese society, we  should  read

Lianhe Zaobao.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>



But Lianhe Zaobao  also covers the news concerning the Malay and

Indian  communities as well.   The Straits Times is targeted  at

the  English educated and the bilingual readers, but it does not

neglect the other communities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore needs to have newspapers which have their own

characteristics  as well as common points.  Likewise,  Singapore

needs  to  have  different  TV channels  which  have  their  own

characteristics as well as common points.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am

quite  happy  with the yardstick adopted by our Film  Censorship

Board.   What we should cut we cut, what we should not  cut,  we

keep.   They  will not affect the continuity of  films.  I  have

spent  some time going to the movies, and I am quite happy  with

the  PG movies. I feel MITA should reward the Board.  As for the

R(A)  movies, I will try and find time to view these movies with

my family so that I could give my feedback to the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our TV programmes are, on the whole, quite good. They are

improved  from time to time and over the past few  years,  there

were  winning praises from all quarters.  My complaint  is  that

there  are  many  imported programmes and  too  few  films  from

Singapore.  Many foreign film producers are interested  to  come

and  invest  in  the film industry in Singapore.  However,  they

feel  that  the  procedure  for  various  applications  is   too

complicated.   They  have  to go from one  Ministry  to  another

Ministry,  and  one  department to  another,  to  process  their

applications.  A lot of time is wasted in these procedures.   To

film  a  programme with Singapore as a background, many  permits

have to be applied for, and many departments are involved.   For

example,  if  the  film touches on life at a  HDB  estate,  with

schools,  factories, riverside, etc., applications  have  to  be

made  to the HDB, Town Council, URA, National Parks Board,  Land

Office,  Ministry  of the Environment, JTC,  etc.   Filming  can

commence  only  after permits have been granted by  the  various

Ministries   and   departments.   It  is   so   cumbersome   and

troublesome.  As a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>



member  of  the  Jalan Besar Town Council, I have also  received

letters  from TCS for permission to film the activities  of  our

Jalan  Besar  Town  Council.   Can we  not  simplify  all  these

procedures?  If we apply for a permit and must wait for approval

from  each and every agency before anything can be done, it will

take  a very long time and this is inconsistent with our pursuit

for  high efficiency in our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that so long as we have some control over the moral

values  depicted in the films, and our oriental values will  not

be  adversely  affected, then we should liberalise and  simplify

the  procedures for  permission to film in Singapore.  We should

provide  a  one-stop  agency to handle all  these  applications.

Producers need submit only one application and MITA will be able

to  coordinate and help them to get the approval so that filming

can  commence as soon as possible.  This will be very useful  in

helping  Singapore to become a film and movie hub  in  the  Asia

Pacific  area.  I hope that MITA will consider this  to  develop

Singapore into a Hollywood of the East.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, as Singapore moves

towards  high  value-added industries, there should  be  a  more

concentrated  effort to develop film as a core art  form  and  a

major  drive  to make Singapore a film industry  centre  in  the

region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With economic problems in the region, in South Korea, with

recession  in Hong Kong and Japan, the timing looks correct  for

this  push.  Unlike other high value-added industries, the  film

industry  has low education entry barriers. A wide  spectrum  of

jobs  could be created for a wide range of age groups  from  the

young to the old.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ACCESS, the Advisory Committee on TCS Chinese Drama

and  Variety Show, in its February 1998 Report, also  felt  that

TCS  had an important role to play in the development of a full-fledged  TV  Centre  and went on to say  that  TCS  support  was

crucial for the development of an educated, mature film  and  TV

profession  in Singapore.  ACCESS observes that the  recruitment

of  creative  talents continues to be a concern.  The  Committee

hopes to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>



see  a  long  term solution to this issue.  The  Committee  also

recommends TCS to widen its search for instructors from  England

and  the  United States instead of focusing only on  those  from

Hong  Kong,  Taiwan and China.  The same report also  recommends

TCS  to open some of the more general training workshops to non-TCS staff as well so that wider interests could be attracted and

potential talents nurtured.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask what measures will MITA take to implement

these recommendations?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the film industry to take off, there must also be

alternatives to TCS productions.  More production houses  should

be  invited  to Singapore.  Just as my colleague, Mr  Peh  says,

film  companies feel that shooting movies in Singapore has  many

complications  and  they  complain of  difficulties  in  getting

permission  or permit for location shooting, lack of  supporting

infrastructure, post-production and animation facilities.   Film

companies feel that there are too many permits to apply from too

many  different Government and statutory bodies before they  can

start shooting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MITA could consider setting up a one-stop service

centre, as Mr Peh has suggested, which will help film production

houses  obtain all the necessary permits and clearance, such  as

closure  of  roads  for  location  shooting,  getting  loan   of

equipment and props from Government bodies like MINDEF  and  the

Police.  MITA could perhaps look into the provision of grants to

assist  local  film companies to bring in talents from  overseas

for  local  production.  This could include  grants  for  hiring

directors,  art  directors,  music  directors,  special   effect

technicians and any other talents or skills lacking  here.   The

technology  transfer will help our local talent pool to  develop

faster.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, a report which I read

in  the Life Section of the Straits Times on 19th February 1998,

noted that studies in the US showed that art and music may  make

children smarter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>



It  seems  that  fine arts help the brain to focus  on  learning

other  skills.  The researcher concluded that there are  logical

links between music and mathematics.  It was also reported,  and

I  quote,  "learning  from  the arts can  help  build  emotional

skills".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note that in Singapore we also have embarked

on  an  arts  education  programme.  The National  Arts  Council

launched  last  year the 6th Arts Education Programme  aimed  at

bringing  the arts to the students through a variety of  events,

some  even  staged by the students themselves.  The Chairman  of

the NAC, Mr Liu Thai Ker, noted that the young formed the second

largest  audience  at last year's  Festival of Asian  Performing

Arts.   He  also  pointed out that schools have increased  their

bookings  for  arts  programmes  and  that  the  Arts  Education

Programme has reached about 60% of schools in Singapore.   These

are  healthy signs of a growing art scene and art following.   I

am  confident  that  all  this  will  contribute  to  our  Prime

Minister's vision of a gracious society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder if the time is not right for MITA, being the

lead  agency,  in  conjunction with MOE,  to  push  further  the

development  of the Arts Programme in Singapore.  I  believe  we

should  make  arts part of the core curriculum  for  all  school

children  in  Singapore.  I am not advocating that we  implement

this  immediately.  What I am suggesting is that we have a plan,

say, an Arts 2005 Plan providing for all schools in Singapore to

eventually have an arts programme in place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits that would flow to students from introducing a

universal  arts education will be tremendous.  First,  based  on

the study I cited earlier, improvements in the school children's

academic performance in key subjects such as mathematics can  be

achieved.  Secondly, such a programme would help to create  more

well-rounded students.  And this is in line with our efforts  to

move  away from examination performance as a sole criterion  for

university admission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arts scene would also benefit tremendously from such a

programme.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>



An  arts  education programme will help us cultivate and develop

the  art  followers of tomorrow.  This is a vital component  for

the  development  of a healthy art scene.  Furthermore,  as  has

been  noted  in  some reports, the arts usually survive  due  to

generous  donations  from individuals and corporations.   It  is

highly unlikely that those without an interest in the arts  will

want to make generous donations to the arts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Arts 2005 Plan which I mentioned must be

approached  creatively.   I share the concerns  of  MOE  on  the

burden  that  incorporating the arts into the school  curriculum

would  place  on students.  Perhaps this is where MITA  and  the

private arts groups can come in and share their experiences  and

insights  in  developing the arts.  I do not believe  we  should

approach the arts education programme in the same manner  as  we

approach  a  mathematics  programme,  for  example.   The   arts

curriculum need not follow curriculum time.  I believe  that  if

we  can  bring together experts from MITA, the arts  groups  and

MOE,  we can find creative ways to introduce arts to all  school

children in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, let me first

start by declaring my interest as a member of the resource panel

for  the  National  Arts  Council and a past  recipient  of  the

National Arts Award.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today we have heard quite a lot about MITA in its

function as censor and controller. I turn more to MITA's role as

promoter and sponsor.  The comments I have heard from my  fellow

MPs  have also focused on the arts as an industry, the  arts  as

education and perhaps, underlying some of the ideas, a luxury in

expenditure.   I  think  that this is  an  important  background

perception  of  the arts that we need to focus on  during  these

economic hard times.  The downturn has led to a budget with less

operating expenditure for the arts and grants.  I make this  cut

in order to call for consistent support and attempts to continue

the  promotion  and  support of the arts that  is  necessary  to

improve the quality of life in Singapore.  In making this  call,

Sir, I see that the arts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>



promotion has two prongs.  The first is of Singapore being a hub

for  arts and here the focus is on foreign talent, such as  some

of  the  large scale musicals we have seen.  The second,  beyond

the  hub concept, is that of promoting the indigenous talent  of

Singaporeans.   In  this sense, our arts policy,  like  so  many

other   policies  in  Singapore,  demonstrates  tension  between

attracting  foreign  talent  and giving  sufficient  support  to

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in these hard times, we may have to make hard choices.

If  funding  does  go down, we may have to well  decide  between

priorities, between foreign talent and our own artists,  between

hub  and  indigenous growth.  Sir, we owe it to our artists  and

our arts groups to put them first.  Some of these have gone full

time.   For  every one large Beauty World there  are  many  more

experimental productions which attract an audience  but  do  not

make the kind of commercial reward.  I call for this, not in the

name  of  blind nationalism or parochialism, rather, it  is  the

essential  difference between a foreign artist and a Singaporean

artist.   To  me,  Sir,  the  foreign  artist,  no  matter   how

acclaimed,  no matter how entertaining, no matter how universal,

will  fail  to  speak as a Singaporean artist can of  Singapore.

The Singaporean artist can portray us and articulate Singaporean

life,  who  we are, and from this particularity, also touch  the

universal.   With  that,  Sir, I ask the  Minister  to  continue

support for art and artists as a whole, but especially a  choice

must be made for Singaporean artists.



<br>1.15 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I recently saw a full-page print

advertisement  by the EDB which reads: "How do you  reach  three

billion people in Asia?  Simply get a desk in Singapore."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This summarises our vision of becoming the centre or hub in

Asia  for  the  media and the arts.  I understand, for  example,

that   industry  heavyweights  such  as  Discovery,  HBO,   Sony

Entertainment  - just to name a few - are already in  Singapore.

This is good and I believe we must continue to make every effort

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>



attract   wire   service   providers,  arts   providers,   major

exhibitions, theatrical performances and the like to  Singapore.

We  must  also examine our regulatory framework to  ensure  that

these  companies find Singapore an attractive place in which  to

operate.  I understand, for example, that the move to allow 100%

foreign  ownership  for  broadcasting companies  has  been  well

received.  This is a good beginning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is whether given the current economic turmoil,

our  efforts to realise our vision are being cut back or whether

foreign companies have cut back or avoided setting up operations

in  Singapore.   It  is not uncommon to cut funding  and  reduce

efforts  in the arts and media when there is an economic crunch.

However, our efforts to consolidate during this period  so  that

we  are well placed at the next economic boom must also apply to

our effort at making Singapore a hub for the media and the arts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are investing heavily in many areas. During a briefing

by  the  Singapore Arts Centre to GPC (MITA), we were told  that

Singapore is not investing $500 million solely for the  sake  of

her  three million people.  This investment is meant to have  an

international impact.  I applaud this vision.  And this must  be

our  vision even in these difficult times.  I read, for example,

in  the  Asia Magazine of 6-8 March 1998, that there are critics

of  this vision.  A reader, Mr John Faulkner wrote that,  and  I

quote,  "the  SAC  could  be one of the  most  celebrated  white

elephant  in  Asia:".  I am confident that  he  will  be  proven

wrong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Ministry to double its efforts at

realising  our vision.  We need not beat our chest  and  declare

this  to  the  world.   Let us work quietly but  conscientiously

towards this dream.  I would like an update from the Minister on

what more is being done by MITA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making ourselves into a hub does not entail just providing

buildings  and a good regulatory framework.  That  is  the  easy

part.   We  must also ensure that our people are interested  in,

and support and donate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>



generously to the arts.  It is also important to ensure that our

people  can  pursue  careers in the arts in  a  financially  and

intellectually  supportive environment.  I have been  told  that

arts groups in Singapore are constantly in search of funds.  And

we  have just heard Mr Tay appealing on behalf of our local arts

group.   I  support  his appeal and I wish MITA  could  consider

further ways of assisting these groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us do more to ensure that the successes that we

have achieved thus far in the arts are not whittled away by  the

economic slowdown.  If so, our dream of becoming a hub  for  the

arts and the media may just become a pipe dream.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, busking was introduced on 1st

October  1997.   The  benefits  are  obvious.   They  give   the

opportunity  for  Singapore to be a  more  vibrant  city.   They

assist  in  the  development of the  arts  scene.   They  create

opportunities for both local and foreign artistes to be creative

and, hopefully, lead to the development of youth interest in the

arts and also participation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe we should further encourage busking in

Singapore.   The  current  form of controlled  busking  has  its

benefits.   But  I  believe  the National  Arts  Council  should

further  liberalise busking, ie, allow more  licences  and  more

places for busking in line with our intention to be the cultural

renaissance city of Asia.  I, therefore, would like to urge  the

Minister  to  make  the  application for  busking  licence  more

accessible  and to also consider allowing busking in HDB  towns,

and not just be confined to public parks and open spaces managed

by  the  National  Parks Board and pedestrian malls  at  Orchard

Road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Minister, therefore, give the House an update on

his Ministry's latest thinking on busking?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ravindran is not here. Mr Peh Chin Hua.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in this age of fast

development of information technology, the Internet has  reached

every nook and corner of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>



world, giving lots of benefits in our work, our studies and  our

communications  with one another.  However, I am very  concerned

with  the  avalanche of sex-related information on the  Internet

which  is easily accessible from every home.  This may  have  an

impact on the young generation of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the USA Media and PC Survey Company's report,

there  is a strong demand among the Internet surfers in the  USA

for  sex  entertainment. Sex business on the  Internet  is  very

lucrative.   It  is  a  roaring  trade  and  those  traders   in

pornographic  information on the Internet are making  a  lot  of

money.   It  is  the  easiest computer tool  for  making  money.

According to the people in the computer trade, in May  1997, the

number of visitors to sex-related websites doubled that in   May

1996.  Turnover for such sex-related information on the Internet

comes  up to  billions of US dollars. Apart from providing  nude

pictures, these sex websites also provide pornographic materials

such  as  "digital striptease shows" and "exotic  nude  videos",

etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our young people can gain access to these undesirable

websites  without  paying a single cent for  it.   In  order  to

protect  the  healthy growth of our children and  young  people,

and to prevent these sex-mongers from promoting such undesirable

activities  on the Internet, we should pass more stringent  laws

to  regulate and shut out such pornographic information  on  the

Internet.   The Ministry of Community Development, the  Ministry

of  Education,  the  People's Association and  MITA  should  co-operate  in  jointly starting a campaign to familiarise  parents

with  the  Internet, so that they will understand  the  type  of

"yellow-culture"   traps   on   the   Internet   which   exhibit

pornographic materials, in order that they may be able to  guide

their children on the proper way of getting onto the Net.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope MITA will pay close attention to the dissemination

of  sex information on the Internet and study the possibility of

starting  this  "Familiarise  the  Parents  with  the  Internet"

campaign.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin:</b> Sir, the Internet is a great place for kids

and  kins  to interact with their peers from around  the  world.

However,  when  children go on line, they must  use  commonsense

such  as  they use commonsense in the real world.  Kids must  be

taught never to give out personal information such as addresses,

phone numbers, real names, or the addresses of their parents  to

random people with whom they meet and converse on the Net.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A check of sites in the United States in October last year,

involving  126  children's  commercial  sites,  found  that  86%

collect  data  about  US children, including  e-mail  addresses,

phone  numbers, most without seeking parental consent.   No  one

knows how this information is being used.  Other news have  also

made much of a danger of the Internet to children.  As a result,

many parents have become worried about the impact of Internet on

their kids.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to adopt some form of regulatory approach

to  help  safeguard children when they go on-line.   Of  course,

ISPs  will  argue that filtering software such as  NetNanny  and

Cyber  Patrol  and many others, are available and parents  could

put  such filtering software in their children's PCs.  But  most

parents today are not so well versed as their children when they

come  to  the  computers and the Internet.   Most  probably  the

parents will have to ask their children to install the filtering

software and the children may not even do that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many school children are today asked to do research on

the  Internet.  Children learn to use different search  engines.

But  once the children know how to use the search engines,  they

get access to much information, including those not suitable for

them.   Currently, there is also no system of classification  or

age restriction that is enforceable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, SBA could make available tools for parents to protect

their  children.   ISPs could be encouraged  to  offer  filtered

Internet  access  with web filtering software installed  at  the

server level.  Children's safe zones which offer monitored  safe

sites  for kids could be created.  This service could be offered

to  schools  and  parents who want cleaner Internet  access  for

their children.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, shall I proceed to the next amendment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin:</b> Sir, since last year, many Chinese-based

Internet sites have been developed.  According to the China  Net

Information Centre, there are over 49,000 homes and 250,000  PCs

connected to the Chinese Internet.  Meanwhile, Chinese  Internet

has grown into bandwidth to accommodate an increasing number  of

users,  estimated to hit some three to four million in China  by

the year 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this development, many large databases with important

business  and education information and a vast pool of knowledge

are  now  available on Chinese Internet sites.  With  the  rapid

growth  of  on-line  networking for  Chinese-based  information,

Chinese  Internet  becomes  a whole new  field  of  opportunity,

especially  for  many  Singaporeans who  are  today  effectively

bilingual.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBA could encourage the development and expansion of usage

of Chinese-based Internet services, so that Singaporeans will be

able  to tap two huge reservoirs of knowledge in English and  in

Chinese.   Sir,  encouraging  the development  of  Chinese-based

Internet  will  also  speed  up the development  of  double-byte

computing   technology,  extending  our  development  capability

beyond  the  single-byte computing technology used  in  English-based Internet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister what measures will be taken to drive

this  development  and provide the direction  for  technological

research in this area?

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in October last year,

the  web  page of Lianhe Zaobao attracted more than  10  million

visitors,  and this makes it an international on-line newspaper.

It  is  something  that  we  can rejoice  in.   This  shows  the

popularity  of  the  Internet which  enables  Lianhe  Zaobao  to

transcend  geographical and national boundaries  to  extend  its

influence throughout the world, and not just confined to a small

nation like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>



Singapore.   This  enables the newspaper to  break  through  the

restriction  of  having  just  a small  readership  of  Chinese-educated Singaporeans, and expand its market to the whole world.

Chinese-speaking readers all over the world can now gain  access

to  information on Singapore through the Internet, and thus have

a  better understanding of Singapore.  This is very important to

the internationalistion of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, the English Internet has been extensively used

in  Singapore, and  information activities on the Net  are  very

busy  and frequent.  This strengthens our exchanges and contacts

with  the  world  and opens up new channels  for  us  to  access

information.   But in terms of the development  of  the  Chinese

Internet,  we  are lagging behind.  At the moment, the  Internet

market  in  China  is  developing  very  quickly  and  all   the

government  agencies,  universities,  research  institutes   and

business community are making more and more use of the Internet.

There  are also more and more people using Chinese all over  the

world.  If  we can promote and develop the Chinese  Internet  in

Singapore, it  will help us to promote our exchanges with  other

Chinese communities from various parts of the world.  This  will

help  to  promote our exchanges in terms of culture,  trade  and

industry,   technology,   etc.     This   has   very   important

significance in realizing our dream of going regional.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Ministry of Information and the Arts can

make  a  study on how to promote the use of Chinese Internet  in

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, the

National  Courtesy Campaign has been around for many years  now.

It  is  held with the hope of creating a more gracious  society.

With  the rapid pace of advances in technology, the courtesy  or

the  lack  of  it  continues to affect our quality  of  life  in

Singapore.  As a result, the nature of courtesy has to take  new

and different forms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, let me talk about the growing trend of the lack

of handphone courtesy.  I think the advent of handphones has not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>



only  made us busier but has also made some of us in our society

become  ruder.   We  need to remember that restaurants,  private

clubs,  libraries,  theatres, auditoriums and conferences,  etc.

are  public  places  and  the basic  human  courtesy  should  be

expected and extended to the public and it should be the  public

norm.  I  am  sure  that Members of this  House  would  be  very

irritated  when someone's phone rings like this.   Let  me  try,

Sir. [Demonstrating].  It is very irritating, as you can see.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was this person who told me that at his business

association's  monthly meeting one of his  fellow  businessmen's

phone  rang  and he whipped out his handphone oblivious  of  the

occasion and went on loudly and said, "Ah Beng, can you buy  for

me  this number 1234, 10 big and five small."  Sir, is this  not

totally discourteous and something that we should frown upon?



<br>1.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, then there was another occasion when a stage

performance   was  in  progress  at  the  World   Trade   Centre

Auditorium.   While  the  play was  entering  an  emotional  and

sentimental  scene, a handphone rang.  The handphone  owner  who

was  seated at the second row unhesitantly whipped up his  phone

and   spoke  so  loudly,  seemingly  again  oblivious   of   the

surroundings.   Needless  to say, the audience's  attention  was

angrily  shifted from the stage to him.  But he went on  despite

voices of strong disapproval.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Minister that it is time that

we made the theme of this year's National Courtesy Campaign such

that  it is focused on courtesy or the lack of it, brought about

by  technological gadgets like handphones, pagers and  also  the

problems of e-mail.  So we need to educate the public on how  to

use   these   gadgets  so  that  Singaporeans  do   not   become

inconsiderate of others around them.  Sir, I do not have time to

explain the discourtesies of e-mailers, both "he-mailers and fe-mailers",  who  put up rude and irresponsible outbursts  on  the

Net,  especially  in the Internet chat groups like  `soc.culture

singapore'.  Unfortunately,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>



because  some  of  them  use pseudonyms which  therefore  cannot

identify them, the law cannot get onto them. Instead, we  suffer

as we try to find out what is on the Net.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, their outbursts are totally ungracious and

irresponsible.  Again, I would urge the Minister that we have to

tackle  this problem not just by legislation, but by  trying  to

appeal  to  them  through  other  means  such  as  the  courtesy

campaign.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us work on creating a technologically advanced but

gracious society.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I would like to commend the good

work  done by the National Heritage Board.  We have more museums

than we had originally.  We are not just serving our own people,

but also people from other parts of the world who want to get  a

flavour  of  our  past  can do so.   And  I  am  glad  that  the

Government has done so much in an area which cannot be mentioned

in dollars and cents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to touch on is the buildings.

Sir,  many  buildings which would have been demolished  are  now

preserved.  Thanks to the National Heritage Board.  This  is  of

course  a historical heritage which we are bequeathing  for  the

generation  to  come to cherish and enjoy.  In this  context,  a

shophouse  in Telok Ayer Street, where the Anglo-Chinese  School

started, was preserved by an old boy of the school.  Such an act

of  generosity should be applauded.  I hope other members of the

public,  who  are  owners  of buildings  with  historical  link,

whether  started  by an association, school or  even  a  clinic,

should try to preserve them.  I hope the National Heritage Board

would  get  in touch with them and assist them, not by financial

means but by historical research.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we take a walk along London street, we come across

many  buildings and plaques saying that a governor or  a  writer

had stayed or was born there.  I hope we too could have this.  I

know  there are some streets with plaques at the corner.   There

are   many   roads  which  are  named  after  many   illustrious

Singaporeans  and  we  should try to find out  their  historical

link.  How many people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>



know  about  Kim  Seng Street or Jiak Kim Street?   There  is  a

history behind it.  Take, for example, Coleman Street.  There is

a plaque which was beautifully done.  Unfortunately, maybe it is

due  to  the  weather the inscription has faded, and  it  is  so

difficult for one to read now.  It serves no purpose.  So if  we

want to do it, do it well.  I would urge the Minister to ask his

officials  to look around for such buildings.  How  many  of  us

know where the Trade Unions Building was?  None.  Where was  the

communist party operating from?  Where did many of the political

parties  start off?  This is a historical wealth.  I would  urge

the  Government to go in because time is not on our side.   Many

of the buildings would be torn down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may illustrate, recently, there was a building in

Little  India  at Dunlop Street, which was first  started  by  a

group  of Hindi community speakers in 1910 or 1920.  Some people

wanted to buy it.  Unfortunately, the price was too high.   They

could  not buy it.  But they were hoping that a plaque could  be

constructed  there.  I will be writing to the  Minister  in  due

course and hope that he will give consideration to this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important that we recognise the good work of the

National  Heritage Board.  Every member of the  public  who  has

knowledge  of a historical building should do his own  research,

find out how it started and pass it to the Government so that we

could preserve it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Information and the Arts (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo): Sir, I would like to thank Members for their

comments  and suggestions.  This year I notice that,  when  many

Members  were raising problems or challenges to MITA, they  also

built  into their comments and suggestions the recognition that,

very  often, what we are trying to do is a question of  balance.

And the entire cut has been characterised by two threads running

through:  One thread wanting Singapore to open up, to be a media

hub, to promote the film industry, to bring in talent, satellite

dishes, second Chinese newspaper, and so on.  Then there is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>



second  thread  running through, which is,  but  please  let  us

preserve our identity, let us control TCS, let us not forget  to

censor,  yes, more Internet but be careful of Internet,  protect

our young, and so on.  These two threads are entangled.  And  if

we  have one without the other, both will come off and both must

somehow be woven into our social fabric.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we had the debate in this House about bond breaking,

the  issue there really is what kind of people do we want to be.

We  want to be a big tree with branches spreading everywhere and

a  huge canopy.  But big trees catch big winds and the tree  can

topple  unless the roots are very deep, especially in a  crisis.

So  the challenge to us is to grow but at the same time to  sink

roots.   And, paradoxically, the more we want to grow, the  more

we  must  sink  roots.   The  more we  want  one  thread  to  be

accentuated, the more we must colour the other thread  as  well.

Then  our  fabric  would  be strong.   But  otherwise,  we  lose

everything.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this really is what we try very hard to do in all our

programmes  in  MITA,  to  promote  the  external  dimension  of

Singapore   but,   at  the  same  time,  to  ensure   that   our

underpinnings are strong and become stronger year by year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to address the specific points raised by

Members.  First, the Internet.  Both Mr Peh Chin Hua and  Dr  Ho

Tat  Kin  touched on the explosive growth of the  Internet,  the

effects of pornographic and other undesirable sites on the young

and the way children are catching on to the e-mail.  Here, there

is  a generational divide.  It is very difficult for parents  to

install  the software programmes to protect their children  when

their  children  know  much more about  the  computer  than  the

parents  do.   We have grappled long and hard with this  problem

and  SBA  has decided that by the end of this year, all Internet

Service Providers in Singapore will be required by regulation to

provide  an  option for all parents, a cleaner,  more  sanitised

Internet  service  which will build in at  the  server  level  a

software  filter  programme like Cyber  Patrol,  Surf  Watch  or

NetNanny.  There are many available now in the market.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not really want to specify the particular one for

which  the Internet Service Provider should offer as an  option.

But an option should be given to parents and should be available

in  schools and public libraries.  So if we, as parents,  get  a

request from our children to have Internet installed and  we  do

not  know too much about it, then at least we know enough to put

a  tick that it should be the Family Access Network and not  the

general service Internet which you may not want your children to

have  until they have reached a certain age.  I think this  will

provide  something more practical for parents to have.   But  of

course  whatever  safer,  cleaner,  more  sanitised  option   we

provide, it cannot be 100%.  Indeed, if it is even 70%  to  80%,

that is already very good, and do not expect that there could be

any  service which is provided which will ensure that everything

that comes into the home is completely clean and sanitised.   It

is  not possible.  But it should be better than what is commonly

available.  However, there is a price to be paid.  Otherwise, we

will  introduce it for everybody.  The price to be paid is there

will  be a certain degradation of the Internet service but which

should not matter too much for young people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBA is also encouraging a voluntary code of good practice

and  encouraging web sites in Singapore to classify  themselves.

This  is  a  big  problem all over the world.  Every  regulatory

authority in the world is grappling with this problem.  There is

still no consensus.  People are meeting and talking.  I think we

should also keep up with the technology, try certain things  and

eventually work out a system of regulation which best suits  our

needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new phenomenon of the Internet is a big thing. It

will  change  human history.  It is like fire.   Once  fire  has

arrived,  you  cannot  ban  it.  You cannot  say,  "Well,  let's

disinvent fire."  You can regulate fire.  But you cannot prevent

it.   You cannot control it properly.  The only way to handle  a

new  technology like fire is to teach every young child.  So all

of  us,  as  parents, as part of our education  of  raising  the

young, is to teach them how to strike a matchstick and to  learn

to respect fire as a force for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>



both  good  and  evil.   Of  course,  public  authority  has   a

responsibility to provide fire hydrants and have the fire  code.

But  at  the end of the day, the technology must be internalised

within every individual.  All our children will grow up with not

only a postal address but also an e-mail address.  When they  go

home,  when  they go to the office, you do not just  check  your

mail  box  which all of us do, you check your e-mail, you  check

your  voicemail,  your  check your fax machine.   Yes,  life  is

becoming more complicated and for those of us who are older,  it

is  becoming somewhat confusing.  But the young ones, they  must

be prepared for this new age.



<br>1.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Dr Ho and Mr Peh Chin Hua talked about the importance

of  the  Chinese  Internet.  I fully agree with their  point  of

view.   Right  now, the English Language websites  dominate  the

world,  and  if  you do not know English, you are  at  a  severe

disadvantage.   But  the  Chinese  universe  is  expanding  very

rapidly.  All kinds of figures have been offered.  By the end of

the  century, there will be 2-4 million Internet users in China.

Today,  we  know  that  Chinese is the fastest  growing  foreign

language,  taught  and  learnt in the whole  world,  because  of

China's economic progress.  It would be very foolish of us  when

many  of our people have a mastery of both not to dive into  the

Chinese  Internet as well.  Language is a very high  barrier  to

entry.  If you do not know it, to acquire enough skills and then

to  develop the inputting systems and to master the nuances  and

subtleties, it is impossible.  But if we get our young people on

to  it  when their minds are still flexible, then we will  equip

them  with  an advantage which will see them through  throughout

life.   And it will also position Singapore wonderfully  between

the English-speaking world and the Chinese-speaking world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate this, MITA has set up a Chinese Internet

Steering  Committee.  It is chaired by Prof. Wee Chou  How  from

the  University.  He is also the Chairman of our Speak  Mandarin

Campaign.   In  it,  we have many members from  a  broad  cross-section  of society, including technologists like Sim Wong  Hoo.

The list will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1305</b></font><br><br>



released this afternoon to the media.  The idea is to study  the

problem and the opportunities, to address all aspects, inputting

systems,   double   byte  technology,  creation   of   websites,

classification and so on, in order that, comprehensively, across

the  whole  country, we move our people into it.  And then  when

Internet fully takes off in China and becomes important  in  the

world, our people are fully equipped to access this universe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On television and radio, many speakers have asked me about

what is our long-term objective.  We know that for stations like

Channel 8, viewership is on the decline.  I think this is a long-term  trend because of SCV and the Internet.  Then why have SCV?

And what is the proper relationship between TCS, TV12 and SCV?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to recall for Members the general approach

that my Ministry has been taking for the last 6-7 years.  First,

we  saw the challenge of satellite television, and how this will

eventually  erode our ability to monopolise TV  broadcasting  in

Singapore.   So,  to  prepare  for  the  day  when  it   becomes

impossible to keep out satellites, we forced the corporatisation

of  TCS  and forced it to become more responsive to the  market.

It  used to be run as a department of state, as a civil service.

Then  RTS  became  SBC,  then TCS.  And  we  freed  up  internal

procedures  so  that they can hire and fire.  And  they  had  to

watch  ratings.   Of  course, in the  process,  they  made  many

mistakes.   But  had  we not forced SBC into  restructuring  and

privatisation, I do not think we would be where we are now.  And

since   corporatisation,  programming   hours   have   increased

tremendously    news, current affairs, dramas and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, we try to keep satellite TV at bay for as

long as possible, while recognising that one day it will come in

no matter what we do.  And when that day comes, we will probably

change our regulations to say, "Okay, now we accept satellites."

But while it is possible to keep it out, we keep it out in order

to buy time for local broadcasters and local programme producers

to become better.  And for them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>



to  become  better, we have got to put the spurs into  them,  so

that  they  are  subject  to external pressures  and  they  face

competition.  At the same time, we did not want Singaporeans  to

be  denied  of  programming choice and of access  to  broadband.

What  did  we  do?  We embarked on a programme to cable  up  the

whole  of  Singapore.  Unlike Indonesia or Malaysia,  we  are  a

compact  city  state.   90%  of our  people  live  in  high-rise

apartments.   It  is  not  feasible, to begin  with,  for  every

household to stick out a satellite dish.  Satellite dishes  work

on  the  basis  of line of sight.  We cannot just cantilever  it

out.  We put it on top of our rooftops.  In the old days, we had

TV antennas on our rooftops and they made it look as if we had a

full  head of hair.  Today, if we have dishes all over, we  look

like a golliwog.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is the position we take? We treat Singapore as a

heavily  cabled local area network, which is Singapore One,  big

dishes  to take in all signals from all major satellites in  the

world,  all  kinds  of  broadband  cables,  T1,  T2,  T3  lines,

connected  to the major hubs in the world and, within Singapore,

to  progressively  remove bandwidth as a constraint.   In  other

words,  our  strategy for survival is not to think that  we  can

keep  out the water, but to channel the water.  And to tell  the

local  broadcasters that they have got to swim  in  this  water.

They  have got to give up dry land.  And these are the pressures

and  the  tensions that we face.  If we say, "TCS,  don't  worry

about  viewership.  Concentrate on the good stuff  news, current

affairs, local programming, "Today in Parliament", that  is  the

easiest  thing for them to do.  Any civil servant can  do  that,

and they will do it with distinction.  But that is not the skill

that  they  need to survive in this new environment.  They  have

got  to  watch ratings.  They have got to accept the programming

need to change from day to day, from week to week, and they must

be very responsive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, on the one hand, we should not give them a free hand.

On  the other hand, we want them to develop swimming skills  and

to force them to learn quickly.  We throw them into the deep end

and  some will, from time to time, reach out for help, gasp  for

air, and then we rescue them and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>



try  them again.  But I agree with Mr Choo Wee Khiang  that some

of  them  may be bad swimmers whatever we do.  Maybe  we  should

take them out of the pool.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBA is constantly caught between these two requirements, on

the  one hand, to maintain a certain level of public programming

while,  at  the same time, understanding that the only  way  for

TCS, TV12 and RCS to survive is to swim.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the long-term position that we want? Our hope is

for our national broadcasters eventually to have a position like

that of the BBC in England.  Today, the BBC operates in quite  a

free  environment of competition, they still  have  50%  of  the

market share, with BBC1, BBC2 and the various stations on FM.  I

met  John Birt recently and he told me that, with the advent  of

digital  television, they have got to keep on moving.  And  from

this year or next year, they are starting seven new TV stations,

in  addition to BBC1 and BBC2, three based on public funding and

the  other  four commercially funded, including a  24-hour  news

channel and various other things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge is not over. Digital TV, Internet TV, will

confront  us  with new challenges and we must  ensure  that  our

local stations maintain their dominance in the English language,

Chinese language, Malay language, Tamil, in radio and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In radio, despite fierce competition from abroad and from

NTUC  and SAFRA, RCS has managed to maintain dominance in  every

segment,  and they have done well.  TCS and TV12 will face  more

competition, particularly from SCV.  What should they  do?   The

strategy really is to concentrate on local programming,  because

that  is  the  most difficult for international broadcasters  to

take  away from them.  It is not easy for a local radio  station

to  compete  with  the  BBC  or  CNN.   But  none  of  us  would

exclusively watch CNN or exclusively listen to BBC.  Our day  is

not  complete  until we have also tuned in to  our  local  radio

station,  local  TV station, read our local newspapers.   So  we

must ensure that our local newspapers, local television stations

and local radio stations are able to maintain a certain position

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>



dominance and credibility in our hearts and in our minds.  If we

say,  only  good stuff, unfortunately, a lot of  good  stuff  is

boring.   After  a long day's work, and Singaporeans  work  very

hard,  they  go back home, they are not going to  read  War  and

Peace.    They  want entertainment.  They want something  simple

and  easy to digest.  They sit back, be couch potatoes for a few

minutes at the end of a hard day.  And what we try to do  is  to

build  in some education, some social values into the programmes

that we put out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a very elaborate programming code for

broadcasters.  They breach it from time to time.  And when  they

do, I think we should rap their knuckles.  But we should not rap

them so hard as to stifle their creativity.  And to help SBA  do

this,  they have worked out with the industry a system of fines.

So  sometime towards the end of this year, SBA will say,  "Okay,

these  are the programming guidelines.  They were arrived at  in

consultation with the industry.  If you make a mistake, we  will

fine  you,  maybe  $1,000.  If you are a repeated  offender  and

seriously offensive, we may fine you $50,000."  The objective is

not  to  inflict  financial hardship.  It is to send  a  signal.

Even  within a TV station, there are many players in competition

with  each other.  From time to time, they get offside  and  the

referee may have to wave a card.  And I think this is a  way  of

institutionalising a process by which those who are recalcitrant

are told off, and it will help the industry too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I thank Members and PAC and ACCESS committee members

for  bringing  to our attention programmes which  have  been  in

breach like,  Zhuo Ai Jin Shen and Chang He which, I agree, were

screened  at the wrong times.  They were screened during  family

hours between 7-10 pm when adult themes were in the series.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong talked about how TCS did not cover Wang

Sa's  death.   I was overseas at that time.  He was  one  of  my

constituents and he turned up for one of my block  parties.   At

that time, he had weak legs.  What struck me was that every  one

in  the  block party stood up when he walked into the  compound.

Such was the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>



respect  and  reverence  they had for  him.   People  were  very

courteous.  They were very keen to meet him, because  he  was  a

figure  whom  they  remembered with great nostalgia,  especially

among older Singaporeans.  I think it was a mistake for TCS  not

to  have  understood  this immediately and reported  his  death.

They did subsequently, after criticisms.  They made up.  But, at

that  time, somehow the instincts were not there and  I  suspect

partly  because young journalists, young editors, did not  quite

understand.  And for these things, we cannot specify in advance.

It  is  not possible.  There must be a certain deep feeling  for

what  we are and where we have come from.  If you are not rooted

here,  if  you are a journalist or an editor who has  just  been

brought  in  from Hong Kong, Taiwan or whatever, you  would  not

understand who is Wang Sa and how he made us laugh and cry  some

time ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I agree with Mr Shriniwas Rai that our stations and our

news crews should ensure that while they should cover their  own

market  segments,  there  must be a  core  which  makes  us  all

Singaporeans.  In other words, whether you tune to TV12,  Prime,

Premiere,  Channel 5 or Channel 8, and listen  to  the  news  in

Malay,  Chinese  or Tamil, at the end of the day,  it  is  still

about  Singapore.  So when a big issue like Singapore's position

in  the  financial  crisis comes up, there should  be  a  common

position  across all the news stations.  And this  is  what  the

newsroom  tries  to do.  They define a core  but  they  allow  a

periphery which is for the particular ethnic station to decide.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai asked if we could not have longer reports

on  Parliament  and have it at prime time.  We have  tried  many

formulas  in  the  past.   At  one  stage,  Mr  Rai  might  have

forgotten,  we actually carried the Budget session live  in  the

afternoon,  and  the viewership was so low, it  was  funny,  and

perhaps an insult to MPs.  So gingerly we retreated and we said,

"No,  no.  We  only  cover it when the issues  warrant  coverage

during prime time."  I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>



think  we  have  got  it about right now.  The  key  points  are

summarised, encapsuled and put out in news times, it is on InTV,

it  is  carried.  Then 15 minutes at the end of the news, it  is

not too big a pill to swallow.  But if you have it too long, too

extended, I think the viewership will plummet.  And we  have  to

worry  about  viewership.   If our  viewers  develop  a  certain

antagonism, a certain negative attitude, towards our  television

stations, they will not turn to it routinely.  You know how some

magazines turn us off.  And even when they arrive on our  desks,

they go out to the out-tray immediately.  While others, you will

always leaf through.  This is the kind of position which all our

stations  should try to maintain.  When digital TV  arrives,  we

may  have  to  unbundle even more to ensure  that  every  market

segment is properly looked after.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On TCS coverage of the SilkAir accident, in fact, TCS gave

a  lot of coverage to SilkAir.  The problem, I believe, was that

for  certain  news  breaking items, foreign  news  stations  and

foreign  journalists cover them before us. And that is  because,

as  national broadcasters, TCS has a special responsibility  for

accurate  news  reporting.  They  could  not  confirm  that   an

aeroplane  was  missing until CAAS told them  so.   Others  were

prepared  to  speculate and they could, because if they  make  a

mistake they make a mistake.  But CAAS cannot make that mistake,

and TCS cannot make that mistake.  The price we pay for that  is

that occasionally we may be a few minutes behind other stations,

but it is a price well worth paying for the credibility that our

stations enjoy among Singaporeans and in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully sympathise with Mr Rai's request for more Indian

programmes, but it is difficult.  For television, 16% of funding

goes  to  Indian programmes compared to 23% for Malay,  34%  for

Chinese  and 26% for English programmes.  For radio, the  Indian

station get 33% of the revenues as opposed to 53% for Malay,  0%

for Chinese and 14% for English.  Within this budget allocation,

we can try to do more.  As Members know, Mr Dhanabalan chairs  a

Committee  to  try  and improve our programming  but  there  are

certain limits to what we can do and I hope our Indian



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>



audiences will understand this.  Even  Tamil Murasu has  a  very

low  circulation of less than 10,000 and finds it hard to  break

even, which was why they sold out to SPH.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching asked whether we have plans to provide

more  radio services to enhance our position as an international

financial  centre.  In fact, we do.  We have managed to  squeeze

out  three additional FM frequencies.  RCS will be launching  an

all news station in October 1998.  They can do this because they

already run a 24-hour news room.  The factory is there.   It  is

creating another product.  That additional product will be a 24-hour news radio.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we are prepared now to have an international

financial news station on FM, and we have discussed this with  a

number  of foreign operators, like Bloomberg and Reuters.   Some

have  expressed  interest. We will tender  out  that  particular

station.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, to serve the various foreign communities in

Singapore,  we  are  also  planning for an  international  radio

station  to broadcast in French, German and Japanese.  But  this

will depend on private sponsorship because I do not think it  is

right to use public funds for this purpose.  All this will  help

enhance our hub status.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cable TV, particularly the cabling of private estates, was

raised  by  a number of MPs such as  Mr Chew Heng Ching  and  Mr

Iswaran.  By the end of this year, all apartment blocks, HDB and

private, will be cabled up.  The last and most difficult bit  is

the  landed  properties because they are scattered over  a  wide

area  and we do not allow overhead cabling in Singapore.  If  we

allow  overhead cabling in Singapore, this is not a problem,  we

can  just  hang  it from pole to pole and get into  your  house.

However,  we  require it to be dug under.  This is a  matter  of

public  policy and it has been so for a long time.   This  makes

cabling rather more expensive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCV is required by its licence to ensure that all estates

are  passed through by the end of 1999, which means that if  you

live  in a semi-detached, or a terrace house or a bungalow,  and

you want it, you can have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>



it.   But  you  may have to pay for it, depending on  where  you

live.   If these are town houses and compact, then you will  pay

less.  If you are living in a sprawling bungalow area, then  you

have  to  pay more.  Even if you have to pay $2,000 for a  house

which   is   worth   $10  million,  I  do  not   think   it   is

disproportionate.  It is not quite right to ask  for  a  subsidy

for  the  small  number of Singaporeans who are already  in  the

highest  income  bracket to be subsidised for having  access  to

broadband.  It  is  available to them.   The  infrastructure  is

already  provided.  But for the last bit to bring it into  their

homes, they must surely pay for that bit of it.  It is like  gas

and  electricity  and water. The Government  provides  it  to  a

particular  point and you bring it into the  house.   I  do  not

think it will be a problem because you cannot afford not to have

it.   Our  objective in the end is to ensure that you  have  the

telephone line, and with ADSL technology you can get  a  lot  of

bandwidth  from  it,  and also a coaxial cable,  and  eventually

there  will probably be cellular wireless access into the  house

as well.  Our whole telecommunication strategy is to ensure that

within Singapore, bandwidth is not a problem at all. And for the

kind  of  prices they are talking about for cabling,  I  do  not

think they are prohibitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCV, of course, can weight the payments differently. They

can  give you a free handphone and charge you a little more  for

the  subscription.  So they can tell private households, "I will

charge you less to lay it into your house on condition that  you

subscribe  for  three years and I charge you a little  more  per

month."   But  that  is for SCV to decide. They  are  a  private

company  and  they have got to answer to their own shareholders.

But  they  are  required by their licence  to  ensure  that  all

private estates are passed through by the end of 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked whether we can jam satellite

broadcasts instead of banning dishes.  It is not easy.  I  think

it  is unbecoming of us to jam satellite broadcasts when we  are

an  up-linking  centre and a media hub.  We   have  more  subtle

methods  of achieving our purposes.  That is the broadest  blast

approach one could think of.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng asked whether we would allow another major

Chinese  newspaper in Singapore.  No, I do not  think  we  would

disallow  it  if  the  market  can  accommodate  another   major

newspaper.  Of course, we should not allow foreign control.   We

must  ensure that whatever newspaper comes out, it feels a  deep

sense of responsibility for Singapore, and these conditions  are

adequately  covered  under the Newspapers and  Printing  Presses

Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan talked about the use of handphone getting

out  of hand in Singapore.  I fully agree with him.  I will  put

it  to  the Courtesy Council for them to take it up.  They  have

been  talking about it.  But I think Mr Sinnakaruppan is  right.

Maybe  they  should  make it a particular subject  of  emphasis,

maybe this year, next year, or at some opportune time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for courtesy in cyberspace, I think they should also

have  a  cyber  courtesy campaign, particularly  on  soc.culture

Singapore.  Soc.culture Singapore, as Members know, is a kind of

a market place, anything goes.  But there is nothing to stop the

Courtesy  Council from seeding a civic group of  cyber  denizens

who  understand  Netiqette and behave with a certain  propriety,

trying to influence the atmosphere and the way communication  is

carried out in that market place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On art policies, I would like to thank Mr Simon Tay for his

stalwart  and consistent support for the arts and  artists.   He

made  an important point that our objective is not just to trade

in  the  arts which he inferred, when we said we want to  be  an

arts hub.  He said that we should foster local arts, and I agree

with him entirely, in fact this has always been the objective of

MITA  and  the  NAC.  It is very important that  we  foster  the

development  of  local arts because they express something  very

deep  in the soul of the people.  You ask yourself: what is  the

difference  between  a  computer and a  human  being?   Science,

technology,  solving calculus, memory banks, a computer  can  do

any  of these things, and do it better than we can.  In the end,

championship chess in the world will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>



not be played between Deep Blue and Kasparov.  It will be played

between computers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is the difference between computers and human

beings?   Computers do not laugh and cry. They have no emotions.

So  the whole phenomenon of the art in human civilisation is not

an  add-on.  It is not entertainment.  It is something  deep  in

the nature of man, in our biological and spiritual nature, which

we do not fully understand.  And to deny that aspect of us is  a

great danger. Then we will produce more Hector Yees.  You may be

very smart, but if you have no sense of where you came from, who

your  parents are, the schools you came from, the community from

which you sprang, something is wrong.  A computer programme, you

press  one button, the software gets transferred. You  carry  it

from  place  to  place, you buy it and you sell it.   But  human

beings, like all animals, are not like that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A turtle may swim in the vast ocean but it never forgets

the tiny stretch of beach from which it swam out.  For birds and

animals, it is encoded in the early memories.  How much more for

human  beings!   And  the  arts somehow  reflect  this.   It  is

something from deep inside.  And when we promote it, we  are  in

fact  affirming ourselves and our identity.  Therefore, I  agree

with  Dr  Yaacob that we should make it a part of our  education

system, not in a stilted curricular way, prescribe it, you  must

have  so  much of it.  No.  But somehow to create an environment

where people feel that they are incomplete without art.  You may

be  very  smart, but if you do not recognise this tune,  or  you

cannot  tell  the  difference between two  paintings,  there  is

something missing in you.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can somehow create this environment in Singapore,

then  we  would  have  succeeded.  If  we  do  not  create  this

environment  in Singapore, where the art carries  no  financial,

moral  or  social value, then we will fail, and  we  will  be  a

stunted  tree which will not be able to take a storm.  The  word

for  it  is pathos.  How do you programme pathos into a computer

and make it feel for people?  You cannot.  But a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>



human  being, even a Downs syndrome child, will have some of  it

in  him  or in her. This is the difference between a human  life

and a smart computer, and the reason why the arts are not an add-on,  not  a luxury, but something which is very important.   And

Government takes it as something which is very important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the private sector does as well because every time

we have fund raising for a violinist or for a good cause, people

turn up and try their best to be helpful.  And interestingly, it

is  in  times of crisis that real creative work is done, not  in

times  of  prosperity.   In times of prosperity,  you  may  have

beautiful paintings and beautiful studios and so on.   But  deep

feelings  are  the result of people caught with having  to  make

tough   choices,  and  re-examining  the  conditions  of   their

existence and then coming up with new creative alternatives, and

that  is  when artistic developments take place.  So I see  this

financial  crisis as being two-edged for the arts.   It  is  not

completely  a  bad  thing. The crisis will  itself  provoke  new

thinking and deepen our sense of being Singaporean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of having our debate on bond-breaking here is

that,  at  the  end  of it, our thoughts crystallise,  the  line

between right and wrong is more clearly demarcated, our position

is  consolidated.  Across the whole front now,  because  of  the

financial and economic crisis in the region, new positions  will

be  established.  This will make us stronger.   It  will  better

defend  us as Singaporeans.  For this, our musicians, our poets,

our  prose  writers, our painters, our calligraphers, will  make

their contributions.



<br>2.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Busking - we try to do more. Firstly, what we do not want

is  for busking to become a glorified form of begging, which  is

the  case  in  many cities in the West.  A hippie  comes  along,

short  of cash, so he takes out his guitar, he opens his  guitar

case,  he strums, and people throw in a few coins, and  he  gets

some  pocket  money.  I do not think that is  what  we  want  in

Singapore.  What we are hoping to create is something more  like

the Xinyao



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>



phenomenon  which used to take place in the Bras Basah  Complex.

I  have not been there recently.  So I do not know whether it is

still continuing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Saturday afternoon, school kids would go there. They

put  up  a banner, they put up a microphone, and then they  will

sing  beautiful  songs, beautiful ballads which they  themselves

compose,  and  they provide their own audiences.   And  shoppers

like us come along, stand for a while and say, "Oh, it is a good

tune!",  and clap, and cheer them along.  Any Town Council,  any

HDB  estate,  Pasir  Ris  Resort,  anyone  of  us  here  who  is

interested in bringing street performance to a particular place,

spontaneous  or  otherwise,  let  the  NAC  know,  and  we  will

facilitate  it.  I think it is good for us.  You enliven  street

life  in  Singapore and enliven our cultural  scene  here,  but,

please, do not turn busking into a form of begging, so that even

parents  are  reluctant to have their children get  involved  in

busking, which is the situation today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Yaacob asked about LaSalle and NAFA. Dr Tony Tan has

appointed Dr Tan Chin Nam to chair a committee to study  how  we

can   upgrade   NAFA   and  LaSalle  into  fully   funded   arts

institutions.   The report will be coming out later  this  year,

and  I  think  we  intend to fund them off  fully,  but  without

robbing  them of their independence or killing their independent

spirit.   They  both  have  got long  histories;  they  survive,

despite  quite  difficult conditions, and it is  important  that

while  we  help  them, we should not in helping them  make  them

dependent on us and nationalise their activities.  That  is  not

the  intention.  But it is right that we pay much more attention

to arts education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were many comments about the film industry. Let me

summarise by saying that we hope to promote it.  We are  setting

up a Film Commission to facilitate film production in Singapore,

not  to  finance  film  production  because  that  is  expensive

business which is best left to the market, but to facilitate it,

to  promote Singapore as an Asian film festival centre and to be

a  one-stop centre.  Many film producers face a lot of  problems

in Singapore getting permits.  I remember once Andy Lau's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>



manager coming to see me to get my help for a hot-air balloon to

be  put up over Singapore for a dramatic scene between Andy  Lau

and  Li  Nanxing, a final moment before some cataclysm occurred,

and he wanted Singapore as a backdrop.  But he could not get the

permit from CAAS.  So I asked my staff to help, and they helped.

But  by that time, the producer gave up, they went to Johor  and

shot the scene in Johor.  We do not want that to be repeated and

we   should  really  facilitate  the  production  of  films   in

Singapore.  That is good for us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai talked about how to mark more places in Singapore in

order that the island is scattered with memories.  In fact, this

is  what the National Heritage Board has been trying to do.   We

have a programme now to identify buildings for preservation  and

for conservation.  We mark many sites, about the old days, about

the  war,  many  of  the  things  which  we  talked  about  will

eventually be marked, including the marking of schools, and that

is  important because many of us have some of our most important

memories from our school days.  Raffles has been marked.  So too

ACS, RGS, Singapore Chinese Girls' School, Gan Eng Seng and  St.

Margaret's.   We  are  also  working  on  heritage  trails,  and

eventually  our objective is, whether you are in  Changi  or  in

Tuas,  in Woodlands or in Sentosa, within a short distance there

are  markers  telling  you about the significance  of  different

parts  of  Singapore at different periods of our  history.   And

these  are  the  things  which will eventually  cause  Singapore

turtles  to  remember the beach from which they swim to  conquer

the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching and Dr Yaacob Ibrahim asked me about the

progress  of our National Education Exhibition.  It is in  hand.

The  exhibition will be held from 7th to 31st July this year  at

Suntec  City.  The emphasis will be on Singapore's history  from

the early days, Second World War, the struggle for independence,

our  years  in Malaysia, and having to go off on our  own.   The

idea  is  to teach young Singaporeans who they are.   I  do  not

think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>



we  need  very  much  to teach that they are  Chinese,  Indians,

Malays  or  Muslims, or Buddhists - these things are  powerfully

transmitted through families and through religions - but that we

are  Singaporeans in good times and in bad, that is much harder.

We  have 11 public holidays a year.  But most of them, eight  of

them, are ethnic or religious holidays - Christmas, Chinese  New

Year, Hari Raya, Thaipusam, Vesak, Good Friday.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I think it is not correct. Not

Thaipusam.  Deepavali.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Not Thaipusam, I am sorry.

Deepavali.   Only  three days we celebrate together  -  the  New

Year,  May  Day,  National Day.  This is how much  we  celebrate

together  as  a  people.  So we have a  long  way  to  go.   Our

ancestral history is much longer than our national history.   We

must give much more emphasis on our national history so that the

parts  of  us  which  bind us together as Singaporeans  will  be

strengthened.  We hope to have up to half a million visitors  to

this  Exhibition.  It will be presented in all the four official

languages  and  we estimate a budget of about $10  million.   We

hope that some of it can be privately funded, but the bulk of it

will  be  funded  by Government.  This will supplement  all  our

efforts  in  National Education, in our schools, by the  various

cultural associations, the clan associations, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Yaacob asked whether we should not fund private efforts.

I  think we should facilitate private efforts.  We fund them  if

there  is justification.  If you take the Chinese Chamber,  they

have  done  very good work, every year organising  the  memorial

remembrance  at  the civilian memorial.  This year,  over  1,500

students turned up, and they put up an exhibition which will now

be  compiled into a book.  It is part of National Education  for

young  Singaporeans  to know of an event which  shook  us  as  a

people  and  which  created the most powerful influence  on  the

nationalist movement here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other efforts being made by various groups.

I  think they should be encouraged.  Force 136, they worked with

TCS to create a series called



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>



the  Price of Peace, and this was very well received, and in the

process  of  enjoying a very good TV serial, young  Singaporeans

learnt  about  a very important part of their past,  when  local

people,  despite  the  fact that they were a  colonised  people,

fought, sacrificed their lives, in order to keep the land free.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is running out. If I can summarise, the character of

a people is shaped more by adversity than by prosperity.  A long

boom  has  ended.  We are going through a period of crisis.   It

can  be  a very bad crisis.  It can be a relatively minor crisis

for  us.  But there is no doubt that across the region, it is  a

very major crisis.  And because of this crisis, the character of

Asia will change.  The fundamental attitudes towards the market,

towards America, towards China, towards Japan, towards religion,

will change, as a result of this crisis.  Our national character

was  very  much  forged  as  a result of  the  British  colonial

experience,  of the Second World War, of the fight  against  the

Communists, of our traumatic years in Malaysia, and of our  need

to  survive when we became independent.  In the same  way,  this

crisis  will  reshape young minds, and young people who  thought

that  the boom will never end, are suddenly confronted with  the

harsh  reality of living in a tumultuous world, and  discovering

what  their own strengths and weaknesses are.  So if we put  our

minds  to  it, all of us, as teachers, as parents,  as  MPs,  as

entrepreneurs, as workers, as unionists, we can turn this crisis

into  a strengthening experience, once out of it, we will emerge

much stronger as a people.  In a crisis like this, either we  go

through  it stronger or we go through it weakened.  No one  will

go through it intact, everyone of us.  No one is spared.  But if

we  do it right, if the people and the Government work together,

then  I  have  no doubt that across all fields, we  will  emerge

stronger.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I seek clarification from the

Minister.   I  am  not  asking the  Government  to  jam  up  the

satellite TV transmission.  I am asking: is it so impossible for

the Government to use the technology available to us to prevent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>



clear  transmission of pornographic signals to the homes, rather

than banning satellite dish wholesale?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second clarification is: why has the Government decided

to  spend  so much in laying the cable network and then  at  the

end,  people  have  to pay for the subscription?   Why  did  the

Government not consider installing a central satellite  dish  at

HDB  blocks?   And I understand that quite a lot  of  programmes

transmitted through satellite are free.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Low's first point. I think

what  he was describing is a form of jamming.  And it is a  very

crude  way of blocking out foreign broadcast.  I am not sure  if

it  can be done.  I have got to discuss it with my experts.  But

it is not a method we will contemplate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Low's second point about the cabling exercise, it is

done as a private undertaking by SCV.  SCV is a private company.

It  is  not owned by the Government, and it includes an American

investor who has 20% in it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Malay) On 14th February 1998, the month-long Chinese

Cultural Festival was launched.  A number of interesting  events

were  held.   For  example,  to attract  the  English  speakers,

Teochew opera was presented with English subtitles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Festival succeeded in attracting many sponsors such as

the People's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>



Association,  the  Federation of Chinese Clans  Association  and

Shell  group.   This shows that there is no lack  of  grassroots

organisations and corporate bodies who are prepared  to  support

cultural and artistic programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, there is feedback that the Malay

community would also like to hold a similar festival.  This is a

good idea and I hope it would have Government assistance.  I  am

not  referring  to financial assistance, although  we  will  not

decline   it.   The  assistance  needed  is  in  the   form   of

opportunities  to publicise the festival in the mass  media  and

Government  media,  and  publicity  by  organisations  like  the

Singapore  Tourism Board and SIA.  At the same time,  assistance

is also needed to secure performance venues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Malay community, like the other communities,

want  to  spread their culture not only to the other communities

but also to the tourists.  In view of the fact that this will be

an  inaugural  effort,  Government assistance,  as  I  mentioned

earlier,  will  be  important  to ensure  the  success  of  this

festival.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our dream to make Singapore a cultural hub needs the

contribution  of  all  communities  in  Singapore.   The   Malay

community  would also like to contribute in one way  or  another

towards making this dream a reality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head M of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, I spoke on the issue of improving

environmentally friendly and responsible behaviour  through  the

use  of  financial  incentives.  I am happy  to  note  that  the

Ministry of the Environment has managed to persuade the Minister

for  Finance  to  do  this.  Because in his recent  Budget,  the

Minister  for  Finance has provided for accelerated depreciation

allowances for industrial noise and chemical hazard control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to appear ungrateful. But I must say

that  it  is  not  enough.  Environmental awareness  leading  to

responsible environmental behaviour rests with individuals,  not

companies.   Company decisions are in fact made  by  individuals

and such decision makers will by the nature of their trusteeship

make  decisions  for  the good of their company's  bottom  line.

When such decisions get translated into environmentally friendly

practices,  Sir,  it is usually incidental and  not  by  design.

Hence,  I  believe  that  to  achieve responsible  environmental

behaviour,  the  Government  must  begin  with  influencing  the

individuals.  In fact, if one can induce environmental awareness

to  be  part  of  an  individual's  personal  value  system  and

environmentally friendly behaviour to be part and parcel  of  an

individual's  behaviour,  there will  be  no  need  to  persuade

companies to behave in a responsible manner.  They would  do  so

on  their own accord because their decision makers will do it as

a  matter  of routine.  It is the right thing if it is  part  of

their value system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current policy regarding the inculcation of

environmental awareness and hopefully responsible  behaviour  in

individuals  is  through public education.  It is  good  and  we

should  continue  to  do so.  But again,  it  is  not  adequate.

Environmental  awareness does not automatically  translate  into

environmentally responsible behaviour.  We simply  do  not  have

the necessary social discipline.  Otherwise there is no need for

littering penalties and CWOs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, public education in this important social behaviour

must  be augmented by financial incentives, whether positive  or

negative, as in penalties for littering.  So if we are  prepared

to  use  negative financial incentives to punish environmentally

and   socially  irresponsible  behaviour,  what  so  wrong  with

positive  incentives  to  reinforce environmentally  responsible

behaviour?   Why  cannot, for example, we give tax  rebates  for

household   expenditure  related  to  environmentally   friendly

practices?   We already had done so in the past for  expenditure

related to gardening.  Why cannot we do so again?  Why cannot we

give  tax  rebates  to those who install solar heating  systems?

Why cannot we reduce the PARF for electric vehicles?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are only some examples which come to mind. I am

sure  the  Ministry would have many others if only the  idea  is

accepted.    Today,   we   are  already  considered   the   most

environmentally aware country in this part of the world.  Let us

also  be the most environmentally protected country.  Sir,  with

our  small land mass, it is imperative for us to be so.  And the

only  way  to start on this difficult journey is to utilise  all

ways  and  means, including financial incentives,  to  inculcate

environmentally responsible behaviour in individuals.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Low is not here. Mr Simon Tay.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I think that in talking about this cut

on  trans-boundary pollution, some backgrounding  is  necessary.

The first is that, clearly, as Mr Heng has pointed out, we are a

very  small country.  It behoves us therefore to recognise  that

the  region  we  are in is one ecological system,  that  we  are

interdependent  with our neighbours, in the Straits  of  Malacca

and the Straits of Johor, in airborne pollution which we see now

in  the haze and the fires in Indonesia, and that there are also

economic  links together with the environment.  Singapore  as  a

vast  port  of  the region has a great hand in trade,  including

that of potentially hazardous materials.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think that Singapore has been a good citizen in

accepting its responsibility



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>



to  do  our best not to cause harm to our neighbours or to allow

other  companies, ships that pass through, things  that  we  can

control, from passing on this harm to our neighbours.   In  this

past year, our country has acceded to the Basel Convention,  the

limitation  of  course  being that our ability  to  control  the

transhipment of hazardous materials is encumbered by our wish to

have  a  very  busy port and it is impossible  for  us  to  play

policeman for all our neighbours.  So we have a system where  we

are  part  of the larger web.  The harm caused and harm suffered

to us are interwoven.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In seeing this therefore, Sir, I think that the policy of

the  Ministry  and  of this Government as regards  environmental

trans-boundary pollution must take on a new chapter.  This is to

increasingly   recognise  an  international   principle.    This

principle  is  called common but differentiated  responsibility.

This  principle suggests that we have a common  aim  to  have  a

cleaner  environment,  whether  in  the  sea  or  in  the   haze

pollution.   But  our countries have different responsibilities,

Sir,  as  regards our ability to deal with this problem to  come

out  with  a  solution or to prevent the problem  in  the  first

place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, focusing on the haze pollution, a recent study has

suggested  that  the  region as a whole has suffered  some  $1.4

billion worth of damage.  Singapore, in the study, was estimated

to  have suffered some $90 million in damages.  Sir, this  is  a

preliminary  study. I think these figures are undervalued.   The

global cost of the haze pollution in terms of bio-diversity  and

the  release  of CO2 climate change gases has not been  factored

in, for example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the principle of common but differentiated

responsibility, Sir, would be very helpful for the  Ministry  in

moving us beyond finger-pointing, either our neighbours pointing

fingers at us for whatever harm we may cause them or us, as  the

Government,  as the people, pointing fingers at our  neighbours.

I think this finger-pointing and blame allegation is not helpful

.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what we need to do, and I was very heartened by the

Minister's  statement  in reply to a  question  I  filed  at  an

earlier   sitting,  is  to  internationalise  the  concern   and

attention  that the haze pollution problem needs.  Much  as  the

regional  economic  crisis  has had  to  have  an  international

response,  I believe, Sir, that it is timely that our Government

has   welcomed  the  move  by  the  United  Nations  Environment

Programme to call for international attention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this new push towards international attention to

the   trans-boundary  haze  pollution  that   faces   Singapore,

Singapore must do more.  Beyond what we can do as a small nation

for  ourselves and beyond what we have put into our work at  the

regional level, we must do our bit to support this international

attention and effort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have spoken in the previous cut on the Ministry of

Foreign  Affairs that Singapore needs to do more to  assist  the

United Nations Environment Programme.  I still say so but I will

not repeat my point in detail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if and when international cooperation for the haze

comes,  Singapore should be among the first countries to  fulfil

our  obligation under the principle of common but differentiated

responsibility.  If our technical and financial and other  forms

of  assistance can go well beyond the rather modest sums we have

given  and  help  we have given in terms of computerisation  and

satellite  imaging, this should continue and we  should  add  to

them.  This is not just for good neighbourliness.  It is in  our

self-interest to do so.  And in that sense, Sir, I wish that the

Minister  will provide some assurance that it is the  policy  of

the  Ministry  to join in any pending international  effort  and

that  there  will be both the political will and  the  budgetary

reserves to do so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, my cut is on the

topic "Cooperation to solve haze problem".  Singapore as a  good

ASEAN  neighbour has tolerated the haze problem  for  too  long.

The haze problem



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>



has  been  with us for six years since 1992.  ASEAN  Environment

Ministers  have  met  and  discussed  the  problem  but  nothing

concrete  appears  to have come out of those meetings.   I  hope

that  at  the  next  ASEAN Environment Ministers'  meeting,  our

Minister  shall use stronger words to put the message across  to

the Indonesian Environment Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore cannot tolerate the haze problem any longer. The

costs  are  too  high.  It is not only a big financial  loss  to

Singapore  but,  more importantly, the haze is a health  hazard.

It  is  reported in the Straits Times today that the haze caused

Singapore $104 million last year.  This amount comprised loss by

the  tourism  industry, $81.8 million, health cost incurred  was

$12.5  million and the airline industry's loss of  business  was

estimated at $9.7 million.  We have just heard Mr Simon Tay that

the  actual  loss  may  even be more than this  amount  of  $104

million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These monetary losses do not take into account the long-term effects from cancer and other diseases. The price is too

high.   I would urge our Minister at the next round of the ASEAN

Environment  Ministers' meeting to put across to the Indonesians

the  message that the haze problem cannot be tolerated any  more

by  Singaporeans.   It  is  true that the  haze  problem  is  an

international one.  But the Indonesians in the first place  must

be  made  responsible  for  it.  The haze  originates  in  their

country.   International help, however good the intention,  from

friendly  nations or international organisations like  UNEP  can

only  go  so  far.  The brunt of eliminating the  problem  rests

squarely on the shoulders of the Indonesians themselves.  If the

Indonesians  do  care for their good name and  reputation  as  a

country  that assumes full international responsibilities,  then

it  is  incumbent on them to make more stringent laws  and  take

more effective enforcement action to wipe out the haze problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The haze problem is a serious problem. It is not just a

question  of  smoke  being blown from  one  country  to  another

country.   The  haze  contains  tiny  harmful  pollutants.    In

addition  to some very toxic gases, these tiny pollutants  known

as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>



respiratory  suspended particles (RSPs)  cannot  be  stopped  by

wearing  cloth  masks.  These pollutants  can  only  be  stopped

through  the wearing of heavy war time type of gas  masks.   But

using such masks is impractical.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to medical sources, the best solution is to move

out  of the region.  This we certainly cannot do.  So are we  to

breathe these harmful pollutants for six to eight months a  year

depending on the weather?  If the haze is not eliminated, we may

have  a  whole  nation of sick people in 10 to 15  years'  time.

This  certainly again we do not want.  It is therefore important

to   once  and  for  all  resolve  the  haze  problem  with  the

Indonesians.   I  shall  say  that  if  the  Minister  for   the

Environment insists on being polite to the Indonesians, then  he

should consider telling them politely that we shall take them to

the International Court if the haze problem is still unresolved.



<br>2.45 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, the immediate health

hazards  caused by haze, like eyes, nose and throat  irritation,

skin  rashes, asthma and other respiratory problems are obvious.

The   long-term   ill-effects,  however,  are  not   so   easily

determined.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study from Harvard University suggested that particulate

pollution  over  a period of time was strongly  associated  with

deaths from lung cancer and heart disease.  Another study showed

that  particulate pollution reduced the average life  expectancy

by one to three years in some of the polluted cities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister for the Environment if his Ministry

would analyse all the available data and enlighten the public on

the various possible long-term effects.  And since we are in the

thick of our own particular type of haze, would his Ministry  be

planning  our own study, maybe in collaboration with  the  World

Health Organisation, on the  short-term as well as the long-term

health hazards of the pollution problem in the region?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these findings will benefit not only ourselves but

also our neighbors.  It will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>



enable  all  of us in the region to be more resolute in  curbing

the  problem  and to be more prepared in dealing with  the  ill-effects of the haze.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, it looks like we

are bracing ourselves to be hit by another few months of health-threatening haze condition, and it is predicted to be worse than

what  we  had suffered last year.  Despite all the international

and  regional  efforts in trying to deal with this hazard,  very

little  headway  has been made.  And I do not  think  it  is  as

simple  as Mr Chiam says, just to be tough with the Indonesians.

Because,  I  believe,  the Ministry of the Environment  and  the

international  environment organisation are fully  committed  to

battle  the serious problem in this region.  But, realistically,

we  have  to resign ourselves to the fact that there is  nothing

much  that  can  be  done,  at  least  for  the  coming  months.

Therefore, it is important for us to make preparations  to  deal

with this problem ourselves internally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we made improvements in the early warning system

and  much has been done to alert our Singaporeans on the  impact

and  condition  of  the haze daily.  But  most  of  the  average

Singaporeans  are  still at a loss on  how  to  react  when  the

condition worsens. I would suggest that the Ministry draw  up  a

comprehensive  plan  on what action can the average  Singaporean

take  when  the haze hazard strikes, especially measures  to  be

taken  by schools, old folks' homes and any other crowded public

areas.   For example, the Ministry can advise every school,  old

folks'  home  and  public  premises  where  there  is  no   air-conditioning  to  at least provide one room equipped  with  air-conditioning, so that those who are more sensitive to  breathing

problems  can  take  refuge.   They could  also  conduct  public

seminars and talks to better educate the public on how to lessen

the  negative  effects  of this problem, and  provide  technical

advice  such  as  recommending  special  filters  to  all   air-conditioning  units, provide more information on  all  available

air  purifiers or the type of masks, if any, that can reduce the

effect  of the smog and harmful particles, or any other measures

that can make our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>



population safer.  Because, at this moment, the health and well-being of all Singaporeans should be of the utmost importance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir,

first, let me thank all the Members who have spoken up and  have

made very useful suggestions.  I shall reply in the order of the

Members who have spoken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I am glad that Mr Heng Chiang Meng is happy with the

fact  that  the  Finance  Ministry has  now  also  extended  tax

incentives  for  companies  which have  introduced  more  energy

efficient equipment.  But I would like to point out to him  that

the  state  of  the environment in Singapore has  been  of  high

international  standards, even though much of the  actions  have

been  taken without tax incentives.  I think this points to  the

fact   that,  firstly,  our  regulations  have  been  very  well

structured  and, secondly, that we have been able to impress  on

companies the need to be good corporate citizens and to take the

necessary steps to reduce pollution voluntarily.  In fact, I  am

happy  to say that most companies have introduced measures which

reduce their pollution levels far below what is stipulated.   It

shows  that the awareness is there.  Therefore, while incentives

are useful, incentives are not everything.  If we have to depend

on  incentives for each and every action, I think our  companies

would  not really be reacting at all on their own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also agree with him that individuals can play a

useful  part in enhancing environmental compliance, and this  is

what  we are doing.  We are educating the public through various

mechanisms at the school level, through grassroots organisations

and by working with the NGOs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that, as the environmental awareness

increases, Singaporeans will become more discerning consumers of

products and that we should not be using incentives to influence

Singaporeans on what to buy, because it is not just in terms  of

electric  vehicles  or  solar heaters, but  there  are  so  many

products available,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>



whose   manufacturers  claim  that  their  products   are   more

environmentally friendly and are more energy efficient.  And for

Government  to  get  involved in vetting them  and  then  giving

incentives  for each of them, I think would really  distort  the

market.  It is better that these products are sold based on  the

values  they  give to the people, and let us not  intervene  too

much by giving incentives.  But we should continue educating our

people  so  that they are more discerning in terms of what  they

buy.   And,  hopefully, over time, they will  be  buying  things

which are also more environmentally friendly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay has asked that I reassure the House about

Government's  policy  in terms of joining in  the  regional  and

international  efforts on the haze problem.  Sir, Singapore  was

very  forthcoming on a bilateral basis, because we realise  that

the  haze  problem is one which cannot be tackled  by  Indonesia

alone.   The  problem  is  much too  big  for  the  country  and

especially  in  today's context of the economic  turmoil,  their

ability  to  tackle the haze at source is a lot more diminished,

which  is  why at the last Ministerial meeting in February,  the

Indonesians were very willing to straightaway join us in issuing

a  call  for international assistance.  And I am glad also  that

UNEP  was there at the meeting and UNEP has assured us that  the

UN  itself  would  be  very interested in  getting  involved  in

resolving  this  problem.  I can assure Mr Tay  that  when  UNEP

finally comes up with a package of needed assistance,  Singapore

will  be amongst the countries to review the assistance required

and  we  will  do  our  part in helping to push  the  assistance

programme and effort forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam has spoken very strongly and I appreciate his

concern which many of us share as well.  It is just that we  are

a  little bit more circumspect but, nonetheless, we too are very

concerned about the impact of the haze on not just the health of

Singaporeans but also the overall regional economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in trying to resolve the problem, I think one must

also  analyse and see what is the most effective approach.  Will

shouting be counter productive or will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>



shouting  help  to  resolve  the  problem?   If  it  is  counter

productive, then I think we should not shout too loudly but  use

better persuasive tools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members an example about Miri. Miri is in

Malaysia,  if  Mr  Chiam does not know.  It is in  the  west  of

Kalimantan, northern part of Sarawak.  Miri recently was totally

blanketed  by  smoke haze from fires within Sarawak  itself,  so

much so that the airport had to be closed and the PSI level  was

300-400.   You cannot even see beyond 50 metres.   And  this  is

Malaysia.  This is not Indonesia.  At first, the Malaysians  had

to  despatch 500 people from peninsular Malaysia to Miri to help

fight  the fire, supplement whatever resources Sarawak  had  for

fighting the fires.  And when that was not enough, they  had  to

further send another batch of 500, and I think there are a total

of   1,000   fire   fighters  now,  from   peninsular   Malaysia

supplementing the resources that Sarawak has.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So even for Malaysia with all the resources, when the fires

broke  out  in Miri, they had so much trouble trying to  control

it.   And today, the fires are still raging, and this is only  a

small  part of Sarawak, which is again a small part of the whole

of Kalimantan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Singapore, we look at fires and we say that we should

put  out  that fire.  After all, whenever there is a fire,  fire

engines  go there and within a few hours, the fire is  put  out.

In  the context of Kalimantan, if we put Singapore on the map of

Kalimantan,  it  is  just  a dot in Kalimantan.   The  fires  in

Kalimantan  are  huge.  Some of the fires there  would  probably

engulf the whole of Toa Payoh, including Potong Pasir.  That  is

how huge it is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To expect Indonesia to have the resources, I think it is

expecting a little bit too much, which is why we have  to  bring

it  to the international level, bring in international expertise

and   know-how  and,  more important, put in place  a  long-term

mechanism  which  will help the Indonesians to  solve  it  on  a

continuing  basis, rather than every year trying  to  fight  the

fires, and this is what we are trying to achieve.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo has asked whether there are long-term studies

on  the impact of the haze.  At the moment, we are using the PSI

as  a  measurement  of  the haze level.  PSI  which  stands  for

pollutants standard index, is a system that was devised  by  the

US  Environmental  Protection Agency, and the  system  has  been

derived  after  many years of extensive study on the  impact  on

health  when people live in environments of a certain  level  of

pollution.   They  have a system where if you measure  and  find

that  the level of pollution there is within the PSI of 50, this

is  a  healthy environment.  Between 50 and 100, it is moderate.

Between  100 and 200, it is unhealthy.  This study is  based  on

long-term  observations.  But studies are not available  in  the

context of what we are facing or what we had last year, 12  days

where PSI was between 100-150.

<br>3.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we have been in contact with the World Health

Organisation and the WHO has informed us, not just Singapore but

also  Malaysia and the other countries, that they will  be  very

keen  to  do a long-term health impact study from the haze.   We

have informed WHO that Singapore would be very keen to work with

them.  When  the  results are out, I will  definitely  keep  the

Members informed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen has said that Singaporeans are still at a

loss as to what to do when the haze hits and whether we can have

a  larger  publicity programme.  This year, realising  that  the

likelihood  of  a  haze is very high, in fact  my  Ministry  has

already embarked on a public education programme.  Members  will

probably  have  read  in the papers a few weeks  ago  about  the

information that we have released on the use of air cleaners and

filters.   We  cannot clean the entire atmosphere in  Singapore.

There  is  no  way  for  us to go out and have  a  giant  vacuum

cleaner.   But we can reduce the personal space to be  protected

to  either  the home or the office, because that is  where  many

people spend much of their time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the office, office owners can install filters in the air-conditioning systems because most of the offices in Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>



are  air-conditioned. We have written to most  of  the  building

owners and we hope that they will be doing something.  At  home,

those  families  whose  homes  are air-conditioned  can  install

filters.  For others, whose homes are not air-conditioned,  they

can  purchase  air cleaners, and the price of the  air  cleaners

would  vary  from about $300 to $900 and above.  So there  is  a

broad  range  and  there are products that will  fit  into  each

person's budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are working outdoors, Mr Chiam was saying,

"Well, because the particles are so fine, we need to wear a  war

time  gas  mask."  I  am glad to inform Mr Chiam that technology

has  actually gone a lot further than that, and that  respirator

masks  are  now  available.   They  are  very  light  but  still

effective  enough  to  filter out most of  the  fine  sub-micron

particles.   They are not very comfortable and this  is  why  we

have been advising the public that for those with chronic cardio-respiratory illnesses, it may be advisable for them to wear one,

but they should only do so with the advice of their own doctors.

For those who are working outdoors, if the PSI does get up above

200,  it may be useful for them to also wear a respiratory  mask

if they have to work outdoors for a very long period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will continue to publicise the different measures.

As  suggested by Mr Kenneth Chen, we will also continue to  give

talks to the schools as well as give talks over the mass media.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered all the points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head M (cont.) -

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (1). Mr Chiam, you wanted to

seek clarification.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I have decided not to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Low.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Sir, I missed

my  cut  just  now.   I  would like  to  ask  the  Minister  for

clarification regarding the matter of haze.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister whether it is possible for us to

initiate  some sort of international agreement within ASEAN,  so

that  the culprit, who started the fire and caused the  haze  to

us, besides being punishable under the local law, could also  be

summoned to the country affected and be answerable to the damage

that   he   has  caused  to  the  country  concerned   and   pay

compensation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to ask the Minister is about

certain  companies which started fire in a foreign  country.   I

think  it is not easy to find out which are these companies  and

who  are the directors.  Can we consider blacklisting this  kind

of  companies and the directors?  Also, at the same time, we can

prevent them from entering Singapore and also from tendering for

public sector jobs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, before one can have a regional

agreement  on trans-boundary pollution, there must  first  be  a

consensus  amongst the countries involved that there is  a  need

for such an agreement.  I have informally mooted the idea to  my

counterparts,  but,  unfortunately,  there  was  absolutely   no

support for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the meantime, we have been doing some research. We

have  reviewed similar agreements elsewhere to see what sort  of

provisions  they  have.   I  must  say  that  whilst  there  are

international  agreements, they are quite disappointing  because

what we have found is that all the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>



agreements  contain no provisions for penalties  or  payment  of

compensation,  and  they  are mainly statements  of  intent  and

commitment.  Therefore, they are not enforceable at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the companies, Sir, in the first place, we have

to wait for the Indonesians to investigate and then to prosecute

them.   Once  they  have prosecuted them and the  companies  are

convicted,  we  can  proceed  to  get  information  about  those

companies.  And even then, I do not think it is really our  role

to blacklist them.

And  neither  should we be involved in enforcing their  law  for

them.   It  is  better that those penalties and  punishments  be

meted  out in Indonesia under their laws.  If our companies  are

involved, they should pay the penalties as well.  And, in  fact,

if  we are aware of those companies in which Singapore companies

have part share in, we will be very happy to also, in Singapore,

advise  those  Singaporeans involved to comply  with  Indonesian

law.  And the Indonesian law is very clear - burning of land for

clearing  purposes, for conversion into plantations, is illegal.

And  we  have  always  insisted that  Singaporeans,  when  going

abroad, should comply with all the laws of the host country.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, the topic I would like to

talk  about  is  vehicle pollution.  In 1989,  I  spoke  on  the

subject  of  energy  conservation  through  the  use  of  diesel

vehicles.   Precisely because a diesel vehicle is  significantly

more  efficient compared with a gasoline powered vehicle, almost

all  trucks  and  taxis in Singapore which have very  high  fuel

consumption choose to use diesel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite being energy efficient, poorly maintained

diesel powered vehicles pollute the air by emitting soot in  the

exhaust.   Every  day,  we  could spot  a  few  diesel  vehicles

emitting  black smoke that pollutes the air and the particulates

from  the  soot could have bad health effect to the  other  road

users and also to those who live near the road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister how many diesel vehicles

were  caught last year for emitting black smoke.  How does  this

figure compare with that of the previous year?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on modern technology, diesel design could easily meet

the  stringent pollution control we implement in Singapore.  The

problem  of  diesel  smoke  is due  to  poor  maintenance,  poor

workshop  practice  and  a  lack of  knowledge  on  modern  fuel

technology.   In my Budget debate speech last year, I  mentioned

about  the  diesel detergent additive which was really  good  in

reducing diesel smoke through its keep- clean ability.  I  would

like to suggest to the Ministry to have a publicity programme to

let  the  diesel fleet operators and the truck and taxi  drivers

understand,  first,  what is the role of engine  maintenance  in

relation  to  pollution;  second, what are  the  wrong  workshop

practices  which  should be avoided and  watched  out  for;  and

third,  how does the fuel affect or shorten the duration  before

the next maintenance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of programme could be taught on a different

occasion, like at the time when a driver receives his Class 3 or

Class  4  driving licence, or when a new taxi licence is issued.

It  can  also  be  taught to persons who were caught  repeatedly

violating the soot emission regulation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the long term, when we no longer have problem with

the  soot  emitted from diesel vehicles, we should then consider

progressively  allowing  more  diesel  vehicles,  in  particular

diesel  cars,  on the road with some favourable regulations  for

the sake of energy conservation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could I take the next cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, the next cut I would like

to  talk about is noise pollution.  Recently, the residents have

complained in The Straits Times about the construction noise  in

the  Chestnut  housing estate in my constituency.   I  had  also

personally  experienced similar construction  noise  in  my  own

housing estate where work was carried out at night.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is regulation on the control of noise from

construction  sites.  This is in terms of the noise  level  they

could  emit from the boundary of the construction site and  when

the noisy work should not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>



be  carried out.  All the construction companies understand  the

rules  and  regulations.  Despite warnings and fines that  could

possibly  be imposed by the Ministry, work was still carried out

and  it disturbed the peaceful life of the people who live  near

the  construction site.  One of the reasons, I was told, was the

heavy penalty imposed by the developer for late delivery of  the

project,  which  was much more severe than a  fine  which  could

possibly be imposed by the Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether we have adequate

laws  to deal with the construction companies or developers  who

break  the  noise  regulations.  Are the  punishments  or  fines

effective enough to deter repeated offenders?  If not, will  the

Minister  consider revising the level of penalty or  introducing

other  new  punitive measures to make it more effective?   Could

the  Ministry  have the power to stop work at the  site  if  the

construction company defies the existing law?

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, since 1984, the world has

generally experienced higher temperature.  During this period it

recorded  13  years of the warmest weather in  history.   It  is

predicted  that the world will be getting warmer and  warmer  in

the  future.   In  Singapore, in the last  few  weeks,  we  have

experienced  some of the highest temperatures  in  the  last  50

years.   Some have attributed this unusual condition to  the  El

Nino phenomenon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore is a hot and humid country, if the mean

temperature  goes  up by even 1 or 2 degrees,  it  will  greatly

affect  our  comfort level and make our hot and humid  air  that

much  more unbearable.  The decision to make Singapore a  Garden

City  by extensively greening our city has created some positive

results.  Not only psychologically we feel that we are living in

a  more  pleasant and cooler environment, it is  also  estimated

that  our  mean temperature might have gone down by one  or  two

degrees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there plans to further intensify this environmentally

friendly measure to our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>



city?   For example, can we introduce more water-scape into  our

public  area,  because water is a very effective cooling  agent?

As  heat intensifies in hard concrete surface, can we limit  the

extent  of open paved area in our city and provide as much  lawn

area  as  possible?   The concept of huge open  paved  plaza  is

environmentally unfriendly to a tropical country like ours.   In

Hong  Kong's  CBD  area, the buildings are connected  by  either

underground   passages   or   overhead   bridges    which    are

environmentally  controlled, so that  one  can  walk  for  miles

without having to be exposed to the external weather.  We should

have   more   water-protected  people  movers   connecting   our

buildings.   All these, together with keeping our air  pollution

free,  should help to lessen the warming effect in  our  weather

condition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know whether the Ministry of the

Environment has done any study on the effect of global  warming,

how  does  it affect our general weather condition in Singapore,

and  in  what way can we condition our environment so  that  the

effect of this warming condition can be reduced.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, we have a very clean Singapore and

we  must all be grateful to the Ministry of the Environment  for

having  maintained such a high standard.  Few cities  can  boast

this as we can.  Our roads are clean and our backlanes are swept

every  day.  But there is one aspect which is rather disturbing,

and  this  is  littering  by not only the  illiterate,  but  the

literate.   If  one were at the bus stops, or  in  MRT  stations

where  a lot of pamphlets are distributed, we find papers  lying

all over.  The worst culprits are the bus commuters.  They leave

their  tickets  everywhere.   Then the  next  culprits  are  the

smokers.   After smoking they will throw the cigarettes  in  the

drain where it is an open drain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite large amounts of money being spent on

education and social condemnation of this act by asking them  to

do  corrective work, it has not worked.  I think we have to find

a  solution.   And  I urge the Minister that perhaps  we  should

reconsider the position and appoint what I call voluntary  based

officers  or friends of the environment who should be  empowered

to book these people and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>



make  them  appear  in court rather than compound  the  offence.

Similarly, in the town councils, more of such officers could  be

appointed.  And I think every Government agency should be  asked

to help in this process because if we do not check this, Sir,  I

think  we  will have to pay a lot of money in keeping  our  city

clean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know the Minister has taken pains to see that things

are maintained clean, but I think something has to be done if we

want  to  maintain our reputation.  Especially  the  people  who

distribute pamphlets, they go around HDB flats and distribute  a

lot  of things.  If you go to any of the estates, you will  find

litter all over the litter boxes.  Sir, both HDB as well as  the

other departments have to work out a solution.  And I appeal  to

the  Minister to take whatever steps to socially disgrace  these

people  and  to  make  them realise that it  is  not  worthwhile

littering.



<br>3.45 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Choo is not here. Mr Rai, you can

proceed with the next topic.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Thank you, Sir. First of all, I must

declare my interest. I am the owner of a private property in one

of the very old housing estates with open drains.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister has gone on record that he would

help  the private property owners to upgrade, not internally  of

course.   But surely something could be done to the environment,

like  the  example  I am going to quote.  Many  of  the  housing

estates  which  were  built in the 1960s  and  1970s  have  open

drains.  I am urging the Ministry to consider this proposal.  As

I have seen that in some older HDB estates like Hougang, where I

used  to live some time back, HDB has actually closed the drains

and  they are very tidy and neat.  If the same could be done  to

the private housing estates, it would beautify the estate.  They

could  put some potted plants and it would be greener and nicer.

The   Minister  must  bear  in  mind  that  these   people   pay

considerable  income  tax as well as property  tax,  unlike  the

benefits  which  HDB flat owners get.  I do not think  they  are

given any benefit at all so far.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would urge him to proceed by stages and surely he

could get some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>



money from some other funds and try it out in one estate.  If it

is  feasible,  I would urge him to do it all over Singapore.   I

know  the  new  estates  do not require this  because  it  is  a

requirement  of  the Environment Ministry.  But I  am  concerned

that  some of these old estates are in fact worse off than  some

of  the  HDB  estates.  Let us not treat these private  property

owners  as  untouchable Brahmins.  They have  contributed  quite

well  to the coffers.  Let us compensate them and at least  give

these things to them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, my speech is on pasar malam. Sir,

pasar malams are part of the way of life in HDB housing estates.

The  pasar malams are a sort of flea market where residents  can

browse and buy goods at very reasonable prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of the Environment is the Government body that

issues  the main permit to hold pasar malams although if  cooked

foods  are  sold,  a  permit is required from  the  Ministry  of

Health.  Permits to hold pasar malams are issued only to the PAP

grassroots    organisations   and    some    other    charitable

organisations.  Opposition Members of Parliament have no  formal

grassroots organisations.  They apply for pasar malam permits to

hold  these  fairs  in  the  name of their  town  council.   The

Ministry  of the Environment recognises this kind of application

by  the  town councils.  In the past, the town council at Potong

Pasir  had no problems getting the necessary permits to organise

pasar  malams.   But  commencing 1995,  the  Potong  Pasir  Town

Council  has been completely denied the opportunity  to  do  so.

All  the  quotas to hold pasar malams at Potong Pasir for  those

three  years up to 1997 were allocated to the Potong  Pasir  CCC

instead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this sense, the MOE has not been fair in dealing

with  the  allocation of quotas to hold pasar malams  at  Potong

Pasir.   First, it changes the rules and, secondly, it has  been

unfair  in  implementing the rules.  When the Potong Pasir  Town

Council  applied to hold pasar malams in 1995, it was  surprised

to  learn  that  the CCC had been allocated the  quota  for  two

years, that is, the full 32 days to hold a marathon pasar  malam

for more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>



than  one  month.  Pasar malam permits are normally  issued  for

only  one  year  but for that year, the MOE bent its  rules  and

favoured  the CCC and gave it a two-year quota in one year.   In

1997,  the permit to hold a pasar malam was also issued  to  the

CCC.   The  Potong  Pasir  Town Council  again  was  denied  the

opportunity  to  hold pasar malam that year.  I hope  ENV  would

change  its  rules  and allocate permits to  hold  pasar  malams

fairly  to  the  Opposition  and the  PAP-controlled  grassroots

organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our national pledge says that we believe in justice

and  equality.   But  as far as ENV is concerned,  they  do  not

believe  in  justice and equality in the issue  of  pasar  malam

permits at Potong Pasir.  ENV should respect the elected  Member

of Parliament for that constituency and at least allocate to him

a few days a year for his town council to organise pasar malams.

In  Potong  Pasir,  I,  as  the elected  MP,  have  been  ridden

roughshod over and pushed aside.  I am deprived of organising  a

pasar  malam  for  three  years.  Such  a  situation  should  be

corrected.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I will first answer the cuts from

Prof.  Low  Seow  Chay.  Prof. Low in his cut talked  about  the

diesel  powered vehicles, that they tend to be smoky even though

they  are  more fuel efficient and asked what is the  number  of

diesel  vehicles  that were found to be smoky and  were  caught.

Sir,  in  1997,  about 2.7% of the diesel driven  vehicles  were

found to be smoky and this is a vast improvement from 1989 where

about 8% of the vehicles which were smoky were actually caught.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked that we give some publicity programme to

drivers, especially when they are getting their licence, on  the

proper  use  of  the  engine  of  the  vehicles  and  on  engine

maintenance.   Sir, I believe this has already  been  done.   As

part  of the training programme, the learner drivers are  taught

not  just how to drive but also the theory behind the use  of  a

diesel  driven vehicle and part of that theory includes how  the

engine  works, the maintenance and how they should not over  rev

with their engine.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he also talked about the choice of fuel. I like to

inform Prof. Low that in Singapore, all the diesel that is  sold

for  vehicles  at the fuel pumps are all already  provided  with

additives.  I understand that the diesel additives help to clean

the  fuel injector and therefore make the burning process a  lot

more  efficient, thereby reducing the risk of smoke.  And I also

understand  that  some fleet owners do not buy from  the  petrol

stations.  They contract directly with the oil companies to  buy

in  bulk and that the diesel provided to them is also similar to

the  diesel  provided to the petrol stations, ie,  most  of  the

diesel used in Singapore is already provided with the additives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, his second cut was on noise pollution. What are the

laws  against  contractors who work at night and who  break  the

noise  regulations?   Sir,  I agree  with  Prof.  Low  that  the

penalties  at  the  moment  are  fairly  low  compared  to   the

liquidated  damages the contractor will have to pay  if  he  was

late  in  completing the project.  However, what  we  have  also

available  to  us is a heavier tool which is a stop-work  order.

So  far,  we have not applied that.  But recently, we have  been

getting more complaints about noise and I have asked my officers

to  look  into  using that as a final measure.  If a  contractor

repeatedly  works  at night and breaks the regulation  on  noise

after three or four times, we should tell him that, "Look,  this

is  the  final warning.  We will compound it this time but  next

time, we will give you a stop-work order."  This will force them

to plan their work better and make sure that the noisy works are

all  done  in  the day and that the work that does not  generate

much noise can then be done at night.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will answer the points made by Chiam. Sir, he said that

ENV  does  not believe in justice and equality and that  we  are

very unfair to Potong Pasir Town Council and I am very unfair to

Mr  Chiam  himself.   Sir,  let me first  explain  the  need  to

regulate  pasar malams, as he called it.  Pasar malam is  not  a

way  of life.  It may have been a way of life when we were small

kids.   Then  the  shops were poorly stocked  and  therefore  we

needed  the pasar malams, which moved from one place to another.

Today, the housing estates are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>



well-provided with shopping centres.  In fact, in  some  of  the

housing  estates  the shopkeepers have already  complained  that

there  are  too many shops and that their businesses  are  badly

affected.   Therefore, we have to control the  proliferation  of

pasar  malams.   That  is why ENV came out with  the  change  in

regulations  in  1994  whereby Residents' Committees  are  given

three  days in a year for pasar malams and that the constituency

organizations like CCCs, CCMCs, the town council,  of  which  Mr

Chiam  is the Chairman, I presume, are all entitled to one pasar

malam session a year, a maximum of 16 days.  But in applying the

rules,  we also have introduced some flexibility.  Town councils

and constituency organizations like CCCs and CCMCs can now apply

to  combine two years' quota into one for the simple reason that

many  of the pasar malams are now no longer small little things.

They  have  kiddy  rides, they have Ferris  wheels,  with  heavy

equipment.   If they are only brought in for 16 days,  they  are

not  viable.  And having listened to the grassroots leaders,  we

have  agreed  that  we should be flexible.   Town  councils  and

constituency  organizations  can therefore  apply  to  have  two

years' quota combined into one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is ENV unfair and has ENV been unfair in the past? Sir,

the answer is no.  Other town councils have managed to run their

trade fairs and Mr Chiam may wish to know that Bukit Gombak  had

done  it  two years in a row, ie, 1995-1996, when it  was  still

under  SDP.  Nee Soon Central Town Council also got their  quota

in 1996.  So it is not a matter that ENV is being very selective

in approving the applications.  If Mr Chiam had applied based on

the  guidelines,  he  would have got his approved  as  well.   I

understand that he applied very far in advance and he  was  told

that  he  has  to  apply within two months and not  further.   I

suggest that the next time, he makes sure that he applies within

a  stipulated time and it will definitely be approved.  There is

no  reason  for us not to approve if he complies  with  all  the

requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now ask my Senior Minister of State to reply to the

other questions.

<br>4.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for the Environment (Encik

Sidek  bin  Saniff):  Sir, Mr Kenneth Chen  asked  about  global

warming.  The recent warm weather was the result of dry  weather

conditions  and the general lack of clouds over Singapore.   The

warm  spell  is  a  short-term  variation  and  is  most  likely

attributable  to  the impact of the El Nino phenomenon.   Global

warming,  on the other hand, is very gradual, long-term process.

It   has  generally  been  projected  that  the  average  global

temperature  may rise between 1-3.5 Celsius by  the  year  2100,

should greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous

oxide and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) continue to be released  at

current rates

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen also suggested tree planting and water

schemes  to help cool the city.  Such efforts will provide  some

localised  relief.   In fact, tree planting  is  an  established

practice  in Singapore.  Given the scarcity of land,  Mr  Chen's

suggestion  of  water  schemes such  as  ponds  may  not  be  as

workable.  It is perhaps best to leave the provision of features

such  as  ponds  and  water fountains to the developers.   While

local actions help to provide some relief, the key to overcoming

the  global warming problem is to address it at source,  namely,

the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen also mentioned the ban on CFCs. Apart from

the  global  warming  potential, CFCs are also  ozone  depleting

substances and they are controlled under the Montreal  Protocol.

Singapore is a party to the Montreal Protocol and complied fully

with her full ob1igations to phase out CFCs.  The import of CFCs

into  Singapore has, in fact, been prohibited since 1st  January

1996.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on littering, Mr Shriniwas Rai had put the following

question.  I cannot agree more with the NMP that it takes only a

few   irresponsible   litterbugs   to   undermine   our   living

environment.  In addition, litter is a health hazard, as  litter

that  holds  water  is  one  of the  main  sources  of  mosquito

breeding, and this makes littering even more objectionable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On anti-littering campaigns and public education

programmes,  these go back many, many years and every  one,  the

students  in school, the community at large, is aware that  they

should  not litter.  There is no excuse.  Litter bins are always

at  hand for people to use.  There is at least one in every  bus

stop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the corrective work order, Sir, we introduced it in

1992.   To  date,  1,975  litterbugs  had  served  their  order.

Although  a number of them served for a second time,  many  have

said that they would not litter again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for friends of the environment, we have friends of the

environment, from school children and the public at  large,  but

to  take them to court, I would like to inform the House and  Mr

Rai,  in  particular, in this era of Internet and cybernet,  the

finding  of  two cyberneticists, namely, Ludwig van  Bertalanffy

and  Norbert Weiner.  They are Dutch.  According to them,  after

we have taken all these measures and feedback including comments

in  the House, at the end of the day, the person must have  this

esteem  of  self-organisation, self-regulation.  And that  every

individual  must  self-organise himself, self-regulate  himself,

rather  than  further regulation.  Nevertheless, we are  already

imposing slightly higher penalties, including the number of days

for CWO.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other question by Mr Rai is on housing estates

with open drains.  The Ministry will consider the covering up of

drains  only  in  private housing estates situated  on  elevated

ground where the drains can have a good gradient and water  will

not  stagnate.  This is to prevent mosquito breeding.   We  will

therefore consider the proposal to cover the drains selectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the greenery, I think there are two parts. One will

be  looked  after  by the Government, and the other  is  by  the

developer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, as the Minister has said that

financial  measures are not important in influencing responsible

environmental behaviour, I look



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>



forward  to  the day when he comes to this House to abolish  the

fines   and  other  financial  measures  enacted  to  discourage

littering.   Otherwise, I thank him and the Senior  Minister  of

State for the replies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2), Mr Heng.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head M of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code MC 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, illegal dumping on vacant land, mainly State land in

this  case,  is becoming a serious issue.  All kinds  of  debris

such as construction material, marine clay and,  more seriously,

toxic  and  hazardous  wastes  are some of  the  rubbish  dumped

illegally.   Often, such illegal dumping is done  in  the  rural

areas,  such as in Jalan Kayu or in Punggol.  Not only  do  they

give  rise to additional land maintenance work and waste  public

funds  in  removing  them, but also affect the  environment  and

personal health of residents living in and near these areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the increasing level of illegal dumping and the skill

and speed of the illegal operators, I suspect that it is more an

organised  activity  carried  out  by  syndicates  than  ad  hoc

activities by unrelated parties.  Sir, this is not surprising as

there  are good profits to be made in this illegal business.   I

was  informed that the price per lorry load for illegal  dumping

was  about $200, whereas one had to pay about $470 for a similar

lorry  load  at the Government's dumping grounds.   Perhaps  the

real  reason is that the penalties are not heavy enough to deter

this illegal activity, given the potential profits to be made in

this  business.  When caught, usually, only the lorry driver  is

fined.   The master-mind is seldom caught, as officers from  the

Ministry  of  the Envrionment lack the powers to detain  and  to

interrogate the offenders.  Hence, they are unable to trace  the

offence back to the top.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest that the penalties for illegal

dumping be increased



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>



to  reflect  the  seriousness of this activity, especially  when

toxic  or  hazardous wastes are involved.  The  Ministry  should

also be given police assistance to help them with detention  and

interrogation so as to enable the officers from the Ministry  to

stem illegal dumping at its source.

<br><br><!-- Encik Harun A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Harun A. Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, in the early 70s and

the  80s, Singapore citizens who were above 40 years of age  and

who   received   social  welfare  assistance  were   given   the

opportunity  to get a stall.  Through their hard work,  we  find

that  their  standard of living has changed from non-comfortable

to  comfortable.  I am of the opinion that perhaps this  is  the

way  we could narrow the gap between the low and the high income

groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned several times that those who receive

assistance from the Ministry of Community Development and  those

who  are  in the low income group be given a stall so that  they

could change and improve their standard of living.  I still hope

that  allotting  of stalls through the tender  system  could  be

modified so that those in the low income group could also have a

chance of getting stalls.  And I will keep on fighting for this.

I   hope   the  Minister  could  review  the  system  and   give

consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I continue with my next topic?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, you may.

<br><br><!-- Encik Harun A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Harun A. Ghani:</b> Sir, the Ministry of the Environment

has  implemented  various programmes and projects  to  curb  the

spread of dengue fever.  However, the Ministry's efforts seem to

be  less  effective as the number of people infected  by  dengue

fever  from  1995 to 1997 shows no improvement.  It has  instead

increased as follows: 2,008 cases in 1995, 3,128 cases  in  1996

and  4,300  cases in 1997.  Worse still, recently, the newspaper

reported that within the last two and a half months, there  were

1,291  cases.   I think at the end of the month,  there  may  be

6,000 cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the figures that I have quoted, it clearly shows

that  the  general public is still not aware of the  dangers  of

dengue  fever.  Perhaps they believe that it is not  as  bad  as

other sickness.  In actual fact, if the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>



fever is left untreated, it would make the victim go into shock,

as  manifested  by  a rapid and weak pulse rate  and  low  blood

pressure.  Hence, death can also occur.  Therefore, what is  the

follow-up action the Environment Ministry is planning to take in

the future?  I hope the Minister will enlighten us.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Sir, we have just heard that for the

first two and a half months this year, there were 1,291 cases of

dengue  fever.  And one of the worst hit areas, as reported,  is

the  construction  site of the new Tan Tock Seng  Hospital.   So

far,  15  hospital  staff are down with  dengue  fever.   It  so

happens  that the Minister in charge of the environment is  also

in   charge   of  health,  which  is  overseeing  the  hospital.

Apparently, the mosquitoes did not choose where to breed and who

to  bite,   so long as there is stagnant water, and so  long  as

they smell human blood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my constituency also experienced a surge in dengue

fever  cases  for the month of August last year.   There  was  a

record  high  of 74 cases, and together with the  Marine  Parade

Town Council which is managing my ward, we literally combed  the

whole ward and found that the main source of dengue outbreak was

from a HDB construction site at Serangoon Central.  ENV together

with  HDB  intensified the source reduction at the  construction

site  and  brought the situation under control.  This experience

led  us  to  think  that identification of the  main  source  of

mosquito breeding ground is an effective way of eradicating  the

hazard posed by dengue fever.  Based on the recent feedback from

my  constituents,  we  feel that the construction  site  at  the

Northeast  MRT  line  will be a potential  source  for  mosquito

breeding and if it is not effectively controlled, there will  be

future outbreaks of dengue cases in my ward.



<br>4.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand from the Marine Parade Town Council that

currently the Ministry of the Environment is conducting a  joint

project  with the Town Council with the aim of total eradication

of mosquito breeding grounds, which I fully support.  I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>



believe  this  is a more systematic way of bringing  the  dengue

cases  under control.  Basically, this project involves engaging

a   pest  control  company  for  routine  mosquito  control  and

checking.   I  was  told  that  the  initial  result  was   very

encouraging.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the above background information, I would like to ask

the Minister the following questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Has the Ministry of the Environment identified the root

cause of the seemingly uncontrolled increase in dengue cases?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) With the alarming record of high dengue cases reported

over  the  last two years, what is Ministry of the Environment's

short  term  and long term strategies to combat this undesirable

trend?  And  what is the Minister's prediction of the  trend  in

1998?  Is it going to level off, going down or continue to rise?

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, as my parliamentary

colleague,  Encik  Harun  Ghani said,  despite  the  Environment

Ministry   being  extremely  vigilant  in  keeping   mosquitoes,

especially  the Aedes  mosquitoes, under control,  dengue  cases

still persist.  In fact, it has increased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Ministry has encouraged owners of landed

properties  to  do away with the provision of gutters  in  their

premises  and  request all Town Councils to take  away  all  the

covers of the open drains.  Have these measures been found to be

effective  in  reducing mosquito breeding grounds?   Or  is  the

Ministry contemplating introducing any new measures so  that  we

can  lessen or even eradicate this serious nuisance?   How  does

this  decision to remove all covers of the open drains reconcile

with the earlier decision to cover all drains, especially in the

catchment area in order to maximise the collection of water  for

recycling?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to know the latest profile of dengue

cases.  Is East Coast still the most vulnerable area?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, originally, dengue

haemorrhagic fever which was supposed to have vanished



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>



from Singapore has reappeared.  According to reports, the number

of  such  cases  is on the rise.   I know that  the  Environment

Ministry's  officers  are trying their best  to  wipe  out  this

problem.   But,  of  late,  their efforts  do  not  seem  to  be

successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever are on the rise.

Recently, because in the increase in cases reported in  the  Tan

Tock  Seng  Hospital  area, ENV officials conducted  a  thorough

search of the area and discovered that there were about 18 sites

which   were   breeding  grounds  for  the   Aedes   mosquitoes.

Construction works have been going on in this area  for  over  a

year.   It is only now that they have discovered that there  are

so  many breeding grounds for the Aedes mosquitoes.  Is  it  not

too late?  According to the Annual Report of the Ministry of the

Environment,  in  1992,  7,052 mosquitoes  breeding  sites  were

discovered.   By  1992, the number of breeding sites  discovered

was  25,530.    On the average, more than 20,000 breeding  sites

were  discovered.   So I want to ask, since  there  is  a  clear

increase  in  the  breeding sites, apart from  fumigation,  what

other measures are taken against this kind of situation?  I feel

that the Ministry of the Environment should cooperate with other

Government Ministries and agencies to have an overall  plan  and

scheme to stop the breeding of Aedes mosquitoes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, before PWD and URA approve the permits for

construction  work to commence, the contractors  concerned  must

first engage vector control agencies approved by the Ministry of

the  Environment to regularly inspect the construction sites  to

prevent  mosquito breeding.  Together with URA and the Singapore

Institute  of Architects (SIA), the Ministry of the  Environment

can  stipulate the minimum gradient of the drains so that  water

will  not  accumulate  and  remain stagnant  to  facilitate  the

breeding of mosquitoes therein.  Likewise, there should also  be

stipulations  that  no  gutters should be  constructed  for  the

houses in new development projects.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> I shall take the last set of cuts first

on vector control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problem of dengue fever is a major concern to my

Ministry.  As pointed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>



out  by  Mr  Harun Ghani, the trend has been quite a frightening

one.  The number of people down with dengue increased from 2,000

in 1995 to over 4,000 last year, a doubling in two years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the cause of this? Firstly, dengue arises

only   when  we  have  Aedes  mosquitoes.   When  the   mosquito

population  increases, the risk of dengue also  increases.   One

problem  is  that over the years the Aedes mosquito has  adapted

very,  very well to our urban setting.  In the past,  the  Aedes

mosquitoes  tended  to breed mainly indoors  in  stagnant,  very

clean  water.   But  now the Aedes mosquitoes  have  also  moved

outdoors and also they are able to breed in water that  is  less

than  clean.  So the number of breeding sites available  to  the

mosquito  has now increased, which is why this is a battle  that

cannot be fought by the Ministry of the Environment alone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a battle that must involve every Singaporean,

because our studies have shown that in a neighbourhood, all  you

need  is,  out  of  100  homes,  two  homes  which  breed  Aedes

mosquitoes, and there will be a dengue outbreak risk  there.  98

families  who are very, very vigilant but two families are  very

complacent, and you will get dengue in the neighbourhood,  which

is why the cooperation of the general public is important.  That

is  why  the public education programme must continue to be  the

linchpin.   It  is  not  possible  for  the  Ministry   of   the

Environment to go and inspect each and every home in  Singapore.

We  do  not have the people.  This is not a police state.  Every

family  must  be  responsible for inspecting its  own  premises.

Fines  are not really the solution. We have increased the  fines

last  year to $150.  But that is really not a solution.  To fine

a  family is after the fact.  I would rather that they  have  no

mosquitoes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other source of mosquito breeding is the construction

sites.  Here I must say the trend has been a good one because of

the  heavy  penalties  being imposed  against  the  construction

companies.  If they are caught breeding, the first time we  fine

them, the second time we will have a heavier fine, and the third

time we will ask



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>



them to shut down.  A stop-work order is issued until they clear

up  the entire site.  It may be two or three days.  The cost  to

them  runs  into tens, if not hundreds of thousands of  dollars.

Because  of  that, most construction companies now have  engaged

pest  control  companies to help them because they realise  that

looking after mosquitoes is not really their forte.  So many  of

them have their own pest control companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my other point that we are now

introducing  a  programme  to  better  train  the  pest  control

companies on, firstly, looking for mosquito breeding sites  and,

secondly,   how   to  advise  the  construction   companies   on

eradicating and preventing mosquito breeding sites.   I  believe

that  with  this  effort, we should see further  improvement  in

eradicating mosquito breeding in construction sites.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen asked about the roof gutters. There is

really  no  need  for  us  to ban roof gutters.   For  old  roof

gutters,  we  have  asked  that  they  either  paint  them  with

insecticide  paint or they find some other ways of  making  sure

that  the  water does not stagnate in the old gutters or,  worse

comes to the worse, remove the gutters.  But what we would  like

the architects to do is to see whether they can come out with  a

better roof gutter design which will prevent stagnation of water

over  time.  If they can do that, they would have contributed  a

great deal to our fight against dengue fever.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does the measure to remove drain covers reconcile with

the  earlier measure, which is to ask that drains be covered up?

Sir, we have asked for the drains to be covered up earlier on in

order  to  prevent littering of the drains.  But  what  we  have

found  is that the covered drains actually lend themselves  even

better  to mosquito breeding.  Between the two problems,  it  is

more  important that we tackle the mosquito problem.  Therefore,

we  have asked for the drain covers to be removed.  We have come

out  with  other  measures  which should  help  us  prevent  the

littering  problem from getting out of hand and  preventing  the

litter from getting into our water reservoirs, etc.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to the earlier cuts. Mr Heng Chiang Meng

talked about illegal dumping.  Yes, I agree with him.  It  is  a

big  problem.   It is a problem we are very concerned  with  and

which  is  why  we  have  increased the  penalties  from  $1,000

previously  to $10,000, or a jail term of up to 12 months.   For

repeat offenders, the previous penalty was $2,000.  We have  now

increased  it to $20,000, and a mandatory jail term  of  between

one  and 12 months.  I would like to inform Mr Heng Chiang  Meng

that we are still not satisfied that the penalties are adequate,

and  we will be taking steps later this year to raise the  fines

further  and to make it mandatory for the vehicles used  in  the

illegal dumping activity to be forfeited.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Harun Ghani has asked about hawkers. Sir, he talks about

the  60s  and 70s, I agree with him.  In the 60s and  70s,  with

rampant unemployment, it was very difficult for people to get  a

job  and  therefore the hardship cases had to be helped somehow.

Some  of  them were lucky enough to get hawker stalls.  But  the

situation  today  has  totally changed.   In  our  labour  short

situation, anyone who wants a job can easily get one.  Those who

think  they can cook but do not have the capital to start  their

own business, or who are unable to join in the tender process, I

would suggest that they get a job as a cook, and maybe work as a

cook in one of the hawker stalls and establish their reputation.

Once  they  have done that, they can go and join in  the  tender

process  and get themselves a stall.  We have to make sure  that

our  limited  number of hawker stalls is used efficiently.   Our

experience  has been that this is best accomplished through  the

market mechanism.  They tender for it.  They must make sure that

it is being efficiently used from morning to night.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> A clarification from the Minister, Sir.

I  mentioned  in my speech that the number of cases of  mosquito

breeding  has shot up from over 7,000 cases in 1992  to  25,000,

and subsequently an average of 20,000 cases.  That is the number

of  mosquito breeding cases discovered.  It was reported in  the

Annual Report of the Ministry of the Environment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>



I  would  like to know specifically what has the Ministry  done,

after  discovering that mosquito breeding cases were  going  up.

Secondly,  I  would  like  to  know  whether  the  Ministry   is

considering  cooperating  with other  Government  agencies,   in

terms  of  certain policy coordination within the  Ministry  and

departments,  to  make sure that construction  sites  and  other

places where there is a likelihood of mosquito breeding would be

prevented



<br>4.30 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, a large part of the increase was

in  the  private households which has been well publicised,  and

which  is  why we have been focusing very much also  on  private

households.  And, yes, there is a lot of outdoor breeding in the

private  households - roof gutters, pots and pans left  outside.

Nowadays,  just  a  small little puddle of  water  can  lead  to

breeding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we cooperating with the other Ministries? Sir,

whenever  a construction site is approved, we inform  them  very

clearly  about their responsibility and, in fact, we  have  been

ensuring  that they have a qualified pest control company  under

their  employment.   And  that is why our  experience  with  the

construction  sites is that the situation has  improved  in  the

last one year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for his

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the clean up of the six rivers and canals in and

around  Singapore  and  Kallang River basin,  namely,  Singapore

River, Kallang River, Geylang River, Whampoa River, Pelton Canal

and  Rochor Canal, took about 10 years, from 1977 to  1987.   It

removes  the  major  sources  of pollution  which  include  farm

wastes,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>



sewage, illegal disposal of waste water from street hawkers  and

vegetable wholesalers and industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, the rivers are biologically clean and alive.

With  the  beautified banks and surrounding areas,  these  water

bodies  provide  a  source  of visual,  recreation  and  leisure

activities for many Singaporeans, especially since these  rivers

are  located downtown in the midst of built-up areas.  Yet, Sir,

10  years of planning and hard work could easily be destroyed by

only  a  few months, or even a few weeks, of neglect.  Pollution

of  the  rivers is never ending.  The sources of river pollution

are  extremely  widespread.  River pollution can come  from  any

land  area which drains into the rivers, regardless of  how  far

that land area may be from the rivers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, the Ministry of the Environment installs

vertical  gratings at selected outlet drains and float booms  at

strategic  locations  in the rivers and canals  to  protect  the

aesthetics of the water bodies.  But no government can ever hope

to  stop  or  even  minimise pollution  of  rivers  without  the

cooperation  and assistance of the community.   It  is  in  this

regard  that  I  would  like to congratulate  the  Ministry  for

agreeing  to a suggestion of my GPC for the establishment  of  a

specialised  community  group  for   monitoring,  restoring  and

protecting  the  aesthetics of these water  bodies.   Currently,

this  proposal is being discussed with the Ministry as a concept

paper.   But,  Sir,  I  do  hope that when  the  time  comes  to

implement  this  idea,  the  Ministry,  together  with   private

sponsorship,  will  provide  adequate  funding  to  ensure   its

success.   More  importantly, I hope that  the  members  of  the

community,  those  that are interested,  will  come  forward  to

volunteer for this very exciting project.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, spending just one evening in a

discotheque  can  leave  a young person with  a  severe  hearing

impairment and very definite threat of deafness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr John Hazell, head of medical research at the Royal

National  Institute  for  the Deaf, said  that  nearly  all  his

patients



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>



with problems caused by clubbing had done it for just one night.

Up  to 80% of night-club patrons would end up with some kind  of

hearing damage.  In Germany, researchers found that up to 25% of

young  people had impaired hearing from listening to loud  music

and  about 10% of the nation's 18-year-olds suffered such severe

damage that it would handicap them in normal conversation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask the Minister for the Environment if we have

any  specifications and permissible safety limits of sound level

for the discotheques in Singapore? And more importantly, can  we

protect  the  public, especially the young, from  this  type  of

deafness through public education?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, haze

is a problem which the people are very concerned about.  Because

of  the big forest fire in Indonesia, there was a heavy haze  in

Singapore last year, resulting in the pollution of our air,  and

the  health  of  our people was affected.  The Ministry  of  the

Environment  took a serious view of the matter.   It  not   only

helped  the Indonesian government to control the forest fire  to

reduce  the  effect of the haze, but also explored the  possible

causes of air pollution in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, it was discovered that the giant joss-sticks and candles burnt during the Seventh Moon festival and

at  religious  ceremonies of the temples was  also  one  of  the

causes  of  air  pollution.  For this reason, the Government  is

regulating  the burning of giant joss-sticks and  candles,  with

effect  from  1st  March  this  year.   The  regulation  clearly

provides  that the giant joss-sticks to be burnt  shall  not  be

longer  than  2 metres, and not more than two sets,  that  is  6

sticks, of these joss-sticks shall be burnt at any one time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new regulation which takes effect from 1st March,

provides that anyone who violates the regulation may be fined up

to  $2,000.  In order to avoid any misunderstanding arising from

the enforcement of this new ruling, I would like to suggest:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we should explain such measures to the people

through  an education campaign.  The Ministry of the Environment

should coordinate with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>



grassroots organisations and relevant religious bodies to invite

the  organisers  of  the Seventh Moon festival  to  a  talk  and

explain  the  new rules to them,  so that they could  understand

the need for such regulations.  I think it is better to get them

to  abide  by the law through education rather than  by  way  of

fines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should prohibit the import of such giant joss

sticks.  Most of these are imported from other countries.  Under

the new regulations, only those who burn the joss-sticks will be

fined  but  not those who sell them. Sir, Singapore  is  a  free

entrepot.   If  such joss-sticks are imported for  re-export  to

other  countries,  then it is all right.   But,  we  should  ban

traders  from  importing such joss sticks for use in  Singapore.

Once  the  supply of these over-sized joss-sticks is  banned  at

source,  it  will  not  be necessary for  the  Ministry  of  the

Environment officials to check on the illegal burning  of  over-sized joss-sticks, and the precious resources can be better used

for other purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we should be more liberal in implementing such new

measures.  Burning  joss sticks is part of the  religious  rites

among  the Chinese community in Singapore.  We should allow  the

people  more time to understand these new measures.   We  should

understand  the Seventh Moon festival is part of the culture  of

the Chinese people in Singapore, and burning of joss sticks is a

religious  rite practised  at such festivals.  So, in  order  to

ensure  that people do not break the law, we hope the Government

should  explain  to the people first.  We must not  forget  that

these  organisers  of  the  Seventh  Moon  festivals  are   also

contributing  to  our  charitable  organisations.    They   have

contributed  quite  a lot to our charitable  organisations.   So

they  must  first  understand what the  benefits  of  these  new

measures are, and then I believe all the organisers and devotees

would do their best to comply with the regulations laid down  by

the Ministry of the Environment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope that during this first year of implementation of

this   new  regulation,  we  could  be  more  liberal   in   our

enforcement actions.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, I would like to talk

about  the  topic  of  benzene in  petrol.   On  more  than  one

occasion,  readers of The Straits Times wrote in the Forum  page

about  the  benzene  level in automotive  gasoline  (petrol,  in

short).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, benzene is classified as a carcinogen and it can cause

blood  disorder cancer, called leukemia, if there  is  prolonged

contact  of  about 20 parts per million.  Regarding the  benzene

level  in the petrol, to my understanding, it is not a mandatory

control  item.  However, the oil companies and the  Ministry  of

the   Environment  agreed  among  themselves  not  to  have   it

excessively dosed in  petrol.  However, due to competition,  oil

companies might use higher research octane number, in short RON,

to  attract  customers.  One of the ways  to  boost  the  octane

grading  of petrol is to increase the level of benzene component

in the brand of petrol.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every car is designed to consume a certain grade of

petrol.  The RON of petrol which is higher than what the car  is

designed  for, normally it is about 95 RON, has no advantage  in

performance of a properly maintained car.  The rise of  the  RON

in  petrol  at the expense of more benzene component,  which  is

harmful  to  human  health, is really unnecessary.   The  people

whose health could be affected are the petroleum workers, petrol

truck drivers, petrol station attendants and the motor mechanics

who  frequently  use  petrol  as a cleaning  agent  for  certain

sensitive engine components.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask, firstly, whether the Minister

will  consider  the  control of benzene in automotive  gasoline.

Secondly,  would  he  consider initiating a  consumer  education

programme  on research octane number (RON), so that  the  higher

than necessary RON product promotion gimmicks at the expense  of

having  more benzene component in the fuel could be discouraged?

Thirdly, would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>



the  Minister  consider setting an upper limit of  RON  for  all

newly  registered cars and ban petrol that exceeds the limit  at

the expense of the limit for benzene?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> First, let me respond to Mr Heng. Sir,

indeed,  I  would like to thank Mr Heng and his GPC members  for

coming out with a concept paper.  We agree with him that keeping

the  rivers clean should also be a national effort involving  as

many   people   as   possible,  and  I  look  forward   to   the

implementation of the scheme in due course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On deafness from discotheques raised by Dr Lily Neo, there

is  no  restriction  at the moment on the  volume  of  music  in

discotheques.   Although I agree with the Member that  prolonged

exposure  to  very loud noise may cause noise induced  deafness,

unfortunately,  no other country has implemented  similar  noise

control measures.  I will ask my Ministry to take a further look

into  this subject and do a more thorough study on the  measures

that  have  been  adopted by other countries in the  control  of

noise.  Sir, in terms of publicly educating our youngsters, yes,

we will do that and we will get the non-Government organisations

that are interested to join us in this effort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng spoke on the burning of giant joss sticks.

Sir, I would like to inform Mr Ang that since October last year,

we  have been in active discussion with the key parties involved

in  the  burning of giant joss sticks.  We have been  discussing

with  the merchants involved but, more importantly, we have also

been discussing with the religious bodies - the Singapore Taoist

Association and the Singapore Buddhist Association.   And  I  am

glad  to  say that both the Taoist Association and the  Buddhist

Association  have  supported the move by the  Government.   They

have  informed  us that giant joss stick is not  part  of  their

tradition  and that a smaller joss stick would do equally  well,

in  terms  of conveying their prayers to the gods. As  such,  we

have  decided  to proceed with the ban on the burning  of  giant

joss  sticks.  We have actually been a little bit more  flexible

because the original proposal which we discussed with the bodies

was to have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>



much smaller joss sticks.  But in response to their appeals,  we

have agreed to allow them to have a 2-metre joss stick and a  75

mm diameter.  So in actual fact, we have acceded to the requests

of  the  relevant  people.   There is  no  need  to  do  a  soft

introduction  this  year.   This  is  especially  so  since  the

likelihood of the haze hitting us will be quite high this year.



<br>4.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked us to perhaps ban the trade in re-export

of  giant  joss sticks to other countries.  Sir, we  should  not

interfere  in  the  general trade of joss sticks  or  any  other

matter.   There  is  a market for that.  It is  legal  in  other

countries.  Let our traders continue with their trading but they

should know that in Singapore, we do not allow such giant  joss-stick to be burned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On benzene in automotive fuel, Sir, I would like to inform

Prof. Low that there is a maximum limit on the amount of benzene

in  fuel, and that is 5% by volume.  We have a regulation.   And

this  5%  limit is the same as that adopted by the EU countries,

Australia,  Japan,  Hong  Kong, and South  Korea.   My  Ministry

conducts  regular tests on petrol to see what is  the  level  of

benzene   because,  as  he  has  pointed  out,  benzene   is   a

carcinogenic  item and I am glad to say that today,  there  have

been no cases of benzene content exceeding the 5% limit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about the raising of the octane rating and that he

fears  that  this  is done through additional  benzene  content.

Sir,  it  is  true that benzene can help to increase the  octane

rating  but there is an alternative, and that is by using methyl

tertiary butyl ether (MTBE).  And this is the route being  taken

by  the  oil  companies for raising the octane rating  of  their

fuel.   I am glad to say that MTBE has also been shown to  be  a

non-carcinogenic item and therefore it does not pose any  threat

to public health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked us to initiate education to inform Singaporeans

that  they  really do not need such a high octane rating.   Sir,

since  the  benzene  content does not pose a  threat  to  public

health, we should leave it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>



to market forces as to whether we should opt for a higher octane

rating or a lower octane rating.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for his

reply and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head S of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have attended a regional conference recently. One

clear disappointment among the delegates was that the unions had

not  been involved in policy and decision-making in the  efforts

to  handle  the  serious  economic crisis  in  the  region.   It

appeared  that  the  trade union movement had  no  role  in  the

economic  crisis.   It  was only lately  that  some  governments

invited  the  trade  unions to be involved in  IMF  discussions.

Such a situation exists because in those countries, there is  no

tripartite mechanism which enables the viewpoints of the  labour

movement to be an important input in all negotiations.  The lack

of  this is detrimental to industrial peace.  For example,  when

Korea amended the Employment Act, workers went on strike because

of a lack of a well-established tripartite relationship.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br>4.50 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fortunate for Singapore that we have a strong

tripartite working relationship.  However, we must not take this

relationship  for  granted but must instead, during  this  time,

take  the opportunity to strengthen it.  I would therefore  like

to call



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>



upon  the  Minister  to look into how we could  invoke  existing

mechanisms  or, if need be, set up new channels for  discussions

among  the  three  parties on how to prepare  ourselves  and  to

respond to the challenges that are fast taking place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note that there is already a Retrenchment

Committee.   I  hope that the Committee would take  a  proactive

approach  by  looking  into measures such  as  job  redesigning,

identifying new jobs and job replacement for retrenched  workers

and matching retrenched workers with available training schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC has set up a blueprint called NTUC 21. Some of its

key  mission  objectives are employability,  competitiveness  of

companies,  promoting productivity and strengthening  tripartite

partnership for better industrial relations.  SNEF also has SNEF

21  which will also benefit both employers and workers.  I  call

upon the Ministry of Manpower to incorporate the aspirations  of

both unions and employers in the formulation of its mission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the formation of the Ministry of Manpower is timely.

With  keen  international competition, our workforce has  to  be

globally  competitive if we want to retain our  competitiveness.

It  is  important  that we have one Ministry to  coordinate  and

develop  an  integrated  and  comprehensive  strategy  for   the

planning, development and management of human resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, there are several agencies like NTUC, PSB, EDB

and  ITE which are involved in training.  With the establishment

of  MOM, the roles of these agencies would have to be clarified.

I  would  like to suggest that MOM set up a tripartite committee

on  training to look into training and overall manpower planning

and human resource development in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the formation of MOM has generated a lot of interest

and  expectations.  Many would like to know what key initiatives

MOM will be working on once it is launched.  One key concern  is

training for the existing workforce.  I call upon



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>



MOM   to   support  programmes,  such  as  Skills  Redevelopment

Programme,   Back-to-Work  Programme  and  Skills  Certification

Programme, and to develop these programmes into national schemes

to cover all workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another area of training that MOM should look

into.   This  is  the building up of skills in  areas  of  human

resource  management and industrial relations.   Human  resource

management  training is important for helping  companies  manage

their  human  resource.  And industrial relations training  will

enable  officers  who  are involved in industrial  relations  to

understand  the  job  better and thus be  more  effective.   The

target  of such training will be MOM staff who handle industrial

relations,  trade  union staff, employers and management  staff.

This will complement training currently provided by NTUC and the

Singapore Institute of Labour Studies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to the issue of foreign talent. I would

like  to  ask the Minister to elaborate on the kind  of  schemes

that will be put in place to attract foreign talent and how this

fits into our overall manpower planning.  There is no dispute at

all that to remain competitive, we need talents from outside  to

enhance  the  capabilities   of  our  own  workforce.   This  is

inevitable  given our small size and manpower constraints.   But

at the same time, we must not overlook Singaporeans' concerns on

the impact that an influx of foreign talents would have on their

jobs  and  standard of living.  To get rid of  such  fears,  the

message  transmitted must be clear: that every Singaporean  will

continue  to  be  given  full  opportunities  to  develop  their

potential.  Could the Minister ensure that sufficient safeguards

are  put in place to prevent employers from abusing this  scheme

by  bringing  in  talents  from  outside  even  when  there  are

Singaporeans  to  fill the jobs?  We must also ensure  that  the

transfer   of   skills   and  competence  from   foreigners   to

Singaporeans  takes  place so as to avoid  continued  and  over-dependence on foreign labour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once these workers are in our workforce, we must help them

adjust and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>



adapt to our work environment and society.  We ought to have  in

place   programmes   that  will  cater  to  their   social   and

recreational needs and help them to understand Singapore society

better.   We  could  use  the  CDCs, CCs  and  other  grassroots

organisations  and even NTUC to provide the network  of  support

and  assistance needed to run such programmes.   All  these  may

help  the  foreign talent become integrated, if not, assimilated

into  our  society  because  it  is  important  to  prevent  the

formation of unhealthy enclaves.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San):</b> Sir, come 1st April,

the  Labour  Ministry  will  become  MOM  to  conceive  quite  a

formidable  task to deliver, and that is no joke.  As stipulated

in  the mission statement, Sir, the Ministry of Manpower will be

entrusted  with  the  role of developing a globally  competitive

workforce  for our Singapore.  This will be done through  proper

manpower  planning and development and this will  also  be  done

with the support of selected international talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question that comes to mind is how much different will

this  new  Ministry be from the former Ministry of Labour?   The

budget shows a 13.8% increase in manpower and 14.5% increase  in

expenditure.    What  does  the  Ministry  see  as   its   major

challenges?   Will  the Ministry of Manpower  set  training  and

upgrading  of  the  local workforce as its  main  priority?   In

trying to augment local manpower with international talent, does

the  Ministry  see  conflicts of interests?  And  how  does  the

Ministry intend to balance the needs and interests of the  local

workforce and foreign talent?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Manpower has also identified the need to

enhance  Singapore's  international image and  interest  in  the

field  of labour.  This is also an area which is of interest  to

the  NTUC.  How does the Ministry of Manpower see the two,  that

is,  the Ministry and NTUC, collaborating in this field?   Would

MOM  consider  working  with Singapore International  Foundation

(SIF)  and other related agencies which leave visitor programmes

to facilitate their visitors to observe and understand the state

of industrial affairs here?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, one important area that could enhance

Singapore's  image is the way Singaporeans treat  their  foreign

workers  and  talents.  Would the Ministry of Manpower  consider

organising programmes that would help Singaporeans to understand

why  we  need  foreign workers and talents and  also  to  assist

foreign  workers in urgent need of help and those treated  badly

by irresponsible Singaporeans?



<br>5.00 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I am not persuaded

by  the  Ministry  of Manpower terminology.  While  I  certainly

agree  that we have to develop a globally competitive knowledge-based  workforce and hence the need for an overarching strategy,

I find the term "Manpower Ministry" a little outdated.  I am not

even  thinking  of  gender neutrality.  In the next  millennium,

surely  brain  power and portable skills are going  to  be  more

important  in the global market challenge.  Our people  must  be

well  educated and well trained.  Those who reach a certain  age

group should even be retrained.  Those who are well-qualified or

skilled  will  be able to find a market for their  skills,  even

across  borders.  And our regionalisation effort,  which  is  an

important  facet  of  our necessary capital export  strategy  in

Singapore,  will  have  to  integrate  with  our  overall  human

resource development to enable Singaporeans to go world-wide, to

invest and to work, and to build a second wing for our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing our human resource and networking the region or

the  world for the right kind of investment to build our  second

wing  point to the right way to go for our future.  In  a  world

where  industries  or technologies can get obsolete  very  fast,

emphasising  portability of skills, training and transferability

of  skills and the learning culture are crucial and defining for

our success.  Hence, I find the Ministry of Manpower a bit of  a

misnomer.  Perhaps we have even gone a step backward.  At  least

labour  is a factor input in macro-economic terms.  When we  are

trying so hard to get our females to participate in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>



the  economy  and  join back the labour force, "Manpower"  is  a

little inadequate to be attractive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned about this terminology as I hope we do not

get into the danger of micro managing sectoral labour markets by

specific   manpower  policies  which,  being  managed   by   the

bureaucracy,  may  be slow to react to the  market  place.   The

thrust  of  today's  labour  market  policies  is  towards  less

rigidities,  facilitating mobility of skills and flexibility  in

wages, in order to be competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope we should be looking for foreign talents and skills

only to supplement what we lack, after we have done all our best

to train, cross-train and to retrain our people, and not to plan

to  fill up the foreign manpower gap even when we have not  done

all  these.   It  is  foreign talents and skills  we  want,  not

foreign manpower per se.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest it is not too late to change the name of the

Ministry  to  the  Ministry  of Human Resource  Development,  to

prepare  ourselves for the challenge of the 21st century  market

place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where knowledge and skill intensity in product

manufacturing  and  services will be  the  critical  factors  in

competitiveness, we should always remind ourselves that our  own

human  resource must be valued, and the utmost be done  for  its

development  so  that  our  workers  will  be  employable,  with

training  to upgrade their skills and knowledge.  We always  say

that  human resource is all we have, knowing that it can achieve

wonders  with training.  We never say manpower is all  we  have,

knowing full well it is not very much.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will not consider I am nit-picking on a

name, but a name is everything.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would

like to thank Mr Chay for making a pitch for womanpower.  But if

there is any comfort at all, the new acronym for the Ministry of

Manpower is MOM, and mum is a woman!  And we were told also that

mum knows best because she has delivered all these years of hard

labour.  So in that sense, I think let us not quibble.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am going to focus on three areas. First, is the

immediate impact of the economic downturn on women.  In the last

few  weeks, we debated on the impact of the economic  crisis  on

workers  and  the need for retraining of workers.   There  is  a

gender blindness in the discussions, and I would like to ask the

Minister if there is a disproportionately high tendency  towards

retrenchment  of women workers, for example, and  whether  women

workers have any great difficulties in finding jobs after  their

retrenchment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women who are sole breadwinners feel the immediate impact

of the financial crisis.  Does the Minister have figures on this

situation  and help us assess the severity of the impact?   What

sort  of employment related strategies is MOM prepared to extend

to such families?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second area is on long-term strategic planning for women

workers.   It appears that more men than women workers  use  the

Skills Development Fund.  Could the Minister explain why this is

so,  and  whether  there  is  any strategic  planning  from  the

Ministry to encourage women to use this fund for upgrading  and,

if so, in what sectors?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1994 Department of Statistics Report showed that 84% of

dual  career  wives were under 45 years old.  The trend  towards

younger  women and paid employment will persist.   We  are  less

sure,  however, that they will stay in employment after  45.   I

would  like to reinforce Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon's call for focused

effort  on the Back-to-Work programme.  The Ministry has done  a

good  job  in the last few years.  I hope that it will  continue

with  this effort.  We have to recognise that young women  today

desire  both  work and family.  The notion of role contradiction

is  no  longer applicable.  The problem is one of role overload.

They  work long hours at work and they also work long  hours  at

home,  sometimes with little help from husbands  who  also  work

late in the office.  We need to find new solutions if we want to

keep all in employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minister consider setting up a special task force

consisting   of   multi-disciplinary   experts   -   economists,

sociologists, family therapists, psychologists and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>



so  forth  -  to  examine nationally the impact of  dual  career

families  on  family  cohesion and  identify  appropriate  human

resource strategies to tackle the problems?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third area is work integration of vulnerable groups.

Community   agencies   which  are  taking   care   of   mentally

disadvantaged  and disabled young specifically  request  if  the

Ministry  could  give  some  attention  to  the  issue  of  work

integration  of these groups.  They would like to  know  in  the

Ministry's manpower planning for the next millennium if it could

identify  the  kind  of  skills which  are  suitable  for  these

disadvantaged groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bizlink, for the information of Members of this House, is a

voluntary organisation supported by MCD.  It has been set up  to

service  the  disabled by matching their skills  and  employment

needs,  but they lack the information on skills requirement  for

specific   job  types.   So  they  cannot  really  provide   the

appropriate  training to the clients.  Can  MOM,  MCD  and  VWOs

combine efforts to identify and enhance employment opportunities

for the disadvantaged?  This will help VWOs to better plan their

work  rehabilitation programmes and equip clients with  suitable

skills to be employable in the community.  The argument is  that

these  groups  have  much to gain by participating  directly  in

community,  instead  of being isolated in  sheltered  employment

centres.   For the society, this is an additional human resource

anyhow.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, foreign talents have

contributed  to the leadership and manpower that have  developed

Singapore.  Our policy to open Singapore to foreign talents is a

correct one.  Their contributions will continue to be important.

However,  we are not without local talents, but our people  fear

being  overlooked  or ignored.  They want to be  considered  for

opportunities that arise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans want to be assured that when everything is

equal  or near equal, they will be given preference.  We  should

use  our  own talents first and then turn to foreign talents  to

augment  the pie.  This must be so.  Otherwise, our people  will

feel  disenfranchised and being a citizen of a country must mean

something.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, employers must not view the foreign talent policy as a

licence to hire foreign talents when local talents are available

to  do  the  job.   This  should be  made  clear  to  employers,

especially  our  Government Ministries,  departments,  statutory

boards  and Government-linked companies.  We must not  make  our

people feel second class.  If our people feel this way, we  will

find  our own talents moving overseas in search of opportunities

denied to them in their own country.  This will indeed be a  sad

day for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign talent to augment our talents in Singapore is an

important policy.  But for the policy to work, we must make sure

that  Singaporeans accept that as important.  I think if we  can

assure Singaporeans that their interests are taken care of, that

they will not be denied opportunities, then the support will  be

forthcoming.  Sir, this assurance is extremely important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to another point. I want to add that

talent  does not just appear in a person.  The potential of  our

people must be nurtured and helped to surface.  On this point, I

must  give credit to the Government which recognises this desire

of  our people for opportunities to educate themselves.  This is

most evident in the funds allocated for education.  In spite  of

the  difficult  time, the Government has not only  not  cut  the

allocation for education but has increased it by some  30%  over

last  year's  budget.  A substantial part of it  will  fund  our

tertiary educational institutions, especially our universities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expenditure for university education will increase

further  when  the  Singapore Management University  is  up  and

running  in  the year 2000.  The Government is thus  giving  our

citizens more opportunities to get not just a tertiary education

but a good one.  This foresight is highly commended.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC has also the foresight to see the importance of

Singaporeans  to upgrade themselves, their skills and  knowledge

to  keep  themselves relevant to the changing times.   NTUC  has

given flesh to the ideas



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>



by  instituting several programmes.  I call upon Singaporeans to

take  the  many  opportunities that are  available  to  them  to

upgrade  themselves.  If we do, we will reduce  the  chances  of

opportunities passing us by.

<br><br><!-- Mr K. Shanmugam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. Shanmugam (Sembawang):</b> Sir, since the Prime Minister

first spoke on the subject of attracting foreign talent at  last

year's  National  Day  Rally, the issue of  foreign  talent  has

become  topical,  prompting  comments  from  many  Singaporeans.

Foreigners brought in under the talent scheme have now become  a

conspicuous  presence  in Singapore.  We meet  them  everywhere.

With  their  greater presence, the subject has increasingly  and

perhaps  inevitably become a gut issue.  Voices of concern  were

already heard from the beginning when the Prime Minister  called

for  a  national effort to draw and embrace talent from  abroad.

There  were questions about the implications of such  a  policy.

Some  were  worried  that  more foreigners  meant  more  intense

competition   for  limited  resources,  be  it  jobs,   schools,

recreational  facilities, or simply space.   Others  saw  social

problems  that might arise as a result of an in-rush of  foreign

influence  or  a  clash of cultural values.  As NTUC  chief  and

Minister without Portfolio, Mr Lim Boon Heng, said last October,

our  workers  were a little bit cheesed off by the  Government's

move  to  bring  in  more foreign talent.  He  had  formed  this

impression after a dialogue session with some 200 union leaders.

That  initial  "little bit cheesed off" feeling  seems  to  have

rubbed  off on more and more Singaporeans, particularly  in  the

light of the current regional crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I talked to some people about foreign talent and the gut

reaction  is  quite  revealing.   They  question  the  perceived

favourable treatment of foreigners over locals.  They  ask:  why

is  JTC subsidising foreign talent by renting out flats to  them

at  below  market  rates?   Why is the Government  still  giving

companies tax incentives to defray the costs of bringing in more

foreigners  at  a time when the job security of Singaporeans  is

uncertain,  and  indeed a number of our citizens  have  actually

been retrenched?  Some even ask:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>



why is the Government cheapening our citizenship by making it so

easily  available to foreigners working here?  Why do foreigners

who  have acquired our citizenship and thus enjoy privileges not

have to perform national service, or at least a modified form of

national service or any reservist service?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These questions perhaps betray an acute and deep sense of

frustration.  I do not think that such frustrations suggest that

Singaporeans  are becoming xenophobic.  We have always  been  an

open  and  cosmopolitan  society which welcomes  foreigners  and

immigrants.   We are, after all, a very young country  built  by

immigrants.   I believe that the disgruntlement lies  more  with

the  manner  in  which the question of foreign talent  has  been

handled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will outline two factors which I believe contribute to

that  disgruntlement.   First,  a  number  of  Singaporeans  are

puzzled  over  the definition of "foreign talent"  itself.   Few

would object to bringing in what the Prime Minister described as

the best and brightest to Singapore in the same way that the top

brains  are attracted to Silicon Valley.  But the foreign talent

that  our citizens mingle with in the HDB heartlands or in their

work  places are very much like the people who live  next  door.

They  could be nurses, train operators, teachers, counter  staff

and  so on.  For the Singaporean who holds a similar job, it  is

incomprehensible why a foreigner doing the same job is  labelled

a  talent and accorded privileges which one who is born and bred

here does not enjoy.



<br>5.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is a sense that the foreigner who is termed

"talented"  takes  maximum advantage of  Singapore  without  the

intention of making Singapore his or her home.  The male foreign

talent does not do national service nor reservist training.  Our

younger people feel that this gives an unfair advantage  to  the

foreign  talent  in  the  work place. A  foreigner  starts  work

younger  and employers prefer employees who have no disruptions.

There  is also a feeling that a number of young foreign  talents

simply use



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>



Singapore as a springboard to take advantage of the system,  get

an education, live in cheap JTC rental flats, acquire skills and

then  leave for what they perceive to be greener pastures.  That

is  why  a  number  of our citizens appear to resent  what  they

perceive  to  be the Government's disregard for the feelings  of

Singaporeans  in the all-out effort to lay the  red  carpet  for

foreigners.   It is now not uncommon to hear Singaporeans  speak

of emigration, and then returning as foreign talent to feel more

welcome here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it will be in the longer term interest of Singapore

for  the  Government to ensure that it addresses these concerns.

We  have  to  do  something  to  ensure  that  Singaporeans,  in

particular younger Singaporeans, do not feel disadvantaged vis-a-vis foreign talent.  The policy of attracting foreign talent  is

a  sound  one.   Without it, our future must be that  much  less

bright.   I therefore speak as a strong supporter of the policy.

But  even sound policies have to be sold on the ground.  If  the

policy creates unease among younger Singaporeans, then that is a

cause   for   legitimate  concern.   We  cannot   take   younger

Singaporeans  for granted.  They are, like the  foreign  talent,

also mobile.  We have to consider their views, perhaps relook at

our   definition  of  foreign  talent  and  bear  in  mind  that

Singaporeans  will be evaluating the quality of  the  foreigners

and compare them with the privileges that are accorded.  This is

not a problem that will simply go away when the economy recovers

and strong growth returns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nation building is not merely about keeping the country

ahead  of global competition or achieving higher and higher  per

capita  income.   It is also a question about making  sure  that

Singaporeans feel for Singapore with their hearts.  The  foreign

talent  question is a gut issue that concerns hearts  and  minds

and  the Government has to address the hearts and minds so  that

our younger Singaporeans will treat Singapore as a home, and not

as a hotel.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the mission of the

Ministry  of Manpower was touched on in great detail by speakers

preceding me, including Mrs Yu-Foo and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>



Mr  Zainul  Abidin.   Its primary goal must be  to  produce  the

manpower  needed for Singapore in the 21st century.  To  achieve

its goal, I believe it is necessary for the Ministry of Manpower

to  have a strong and effective manpower planning capability or,

in  deference to my colleague, Mr Chay Wai Chuen, human resource

planning  capability.   So  its goal must  be  to  identify  the

manpower  needs of the country in the 21st century.  All  of  us

would  love to have accurate and reliable forecast to work with,

for  instance,  how many engineers, how many doctors,  how  many

workers  and  what  discipline  and  so  on.   But  it  is  also

unrealistic  to  have  perfect 20/20 vision  when  it  comes  to

forecasting the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, manpower planning has always been a very sensitive

topic.   For  instance,  MOE uses its own manpower  forecast  to

identify allocation of resources with the various institutes  of

higher learning, which in turn determines how many students will

be  enrolled each year, in what discipline, and in what classes.

Since  education  is  very  important to  our  future,  manpower

planning  then  directly  influences the  future  of  all  young

Singaporeans.  To make my point, let me use an illustration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have to go too far back to come up with examples

of  forecasting which cause great emotional stress  to  students

and  parents.  I am referring to the restriction imposed on  the

number   of  doctors  trained  each  year  in  Singapore.    The

Government directly controls the number of doctors trained  each

year.  This number is derived from a very logical doctor/patient

model.   Mr  Yeo Cheow Tong, then Minister for Health  in  1993,

announced  a  set  of policies restricting the  medical  student

enrolment every year that Singaporeans should have.  It does not

just   apply  to  NUS  but  also  as  a  standard  for  overseas

universities.  We can understand that enrolment in NUS is funded

by the Government, but in the enrolment overseas, those students

are funded by the parents.  On top of that, in fact, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>



restriction  excludes  some very famous  and  prominent  medical

schools.  All this is done in the name of manpower planning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many aspiring doctors were denied the opportunity to

pursue,  some of them, life-long dreams to become a  doctor,  to

serve  their  fellow human beings.  Several have  approached  me

during  my meet-the-people sessions in the past regarding  their

appeal  to be given exemption, not just to get into NUS  but  to

continue their enrolment with overseas universities, but  to  no

avail.    As   a   Government  policy,  I  still  support   this

restriction,  which was logical and rational at  that  point  of

time.   But  only  a  few years later, the  Ministry  of  Health

started  to  hire  overseas doctors to meet its  own  shortages.

Only  a  few  days  ago,  Mr Yeo Cheow  Tong  gave  a  reply  to

Parliament  during  the  debate on his Ministry  justifying  the

hiring  of foreign doctors based on the shortages.  It seems  to

me  that the restriction imposed by MOH  now does not make  very

good common sense.  Worse, the suffering and emotional stress of

all those who were denied a career in medicine have been all for

nought.  This sudden reversal of the forecast reflects poorly on

the   accuracy  and  points  to  the  pitfalls  of  implementing

Government policies based on poor forecasting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that manpower forecasters always err on the

safe  side.   In  fact, there is very little or no  penalty  for

under-estimating.  But over-estimating would  lead  to  wasteful

Government spending and potential social problems as a result of

unemployed graduates, etc.  So, it seems to me intuitively  that

it  will be very difficult to obtain accurate manpower forecast.

On  the  other  hand, the consequences of a poor  one  are  also

highly undesirable.  Yet, with the establishment of the Ministry

of  Manpower,  this  is exactly what will  be  expected  of  it.

Whatever forecast it produces, there will be even greater  faith

in  using  this information.  After all, they are the  full-time

experts in this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would like to ask the Minister to enlighten this

House, how he would be addressing this issue and how he would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>



ensure  that  MOM will be able to discharge its responsibilities

when it comes to manpower planning for the 21st century.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> First, I would

like  to  thank the hon. Members who have spoken on the  various

topics  concerning the Ministry of Manpower and other  manpower-related  issues.  In particular, I wish to thank Mrs Yu-Foo  Yee

Shoon,  Member  for Bukit Timah, who welcomed and supported  the

formation of the Ministry of Manpower.  Mrs Yu-Foo and Mr Zainul

would  like to know what are the key initiatives of the Ministry

of  Manpower after April 1998, because the Ministry  will  start

functioning on 1st April 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newly established Ministry of Manpower aims to develop

a world class workforce to spearhead Singapore's growth into the

21st  century.  It will undertake manpower planning, development

and  carry  out  the  regulatory roles in meeting  our  national

manpower  needs.  The Ministry's new role will include  manpower

planning  to  balance the demand and supply of manpower  at  all

levels  of  the  economy,  meaning  manpower  requirements  from

unskilled,  semi-skilled to skilled and  talented  workers.   It

will  develop a framework and programme for continuing education

and  training  for workers in order to build up  a  capable  and

knowledge-based workforce.  We will also develop  strategies  to

attract foreign talents to supplement local talents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the existing roles of the Ministry of Labour, such as

regulating  and  managing  the  admission  of  foreign  workers,

ensuring  a workplace environment conducive to productivity  and

efficiency, and ensuring continuous harmonious labour  relations

will be enhanced to reinforce the Ministry's overall mission.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Manpower will formulate national manpower

policy  in consultation with principal economic agencies of  the

Government and also the National Trades Union Congress  and  the

Singapore  National Employers' Federation.   We  will  certainly

take note of the efforts already put in by the National



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>



Trades  Union  Congress  and the Singapore  National  Employers'

Federation  to chart a vision for the future.  We will  consider

the  ideas, suggestions and the concerns that they have  already

drawn  up  in their NTUC 21 and SNEF 21 in drawing  up  our  own

manpower  policy.   While  the Ministry of  Manpower  undertakes

manpower  planning and capability development  at  the  national

level,  the  current  statutory boards that  are  already  doing

manpower training and manpower development work will be able  to

continue   this  work.   For  instance,  the  Productivity   and

Standards  Board, ITE and EDB will continue to administer  their

respective  manpower training programmes.  But it will  be  done

within the overall framework of a national manpower policy.  MOM

will  focus on strengthening existing institutions and  training

networks,   coordinate   and  streamline   manpower   management

functions  and develop a new framework and programme to  achieve

our mission of developing a world class workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo has also lent her support to the allocation of

more  funds to the Ministry of Manpower so that it can give more

support to the various skills upgrading programmes, and I  thank

her for this support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul has asked whether the budget, as it stands in the

Budget  book, reflects the financial support that the Government

is  giving to the new Ministry of Manpower in order to allow  it

to  carry  out its duties.  I would like to point out  that  the

budget  estimates for the Ministry of Manpower, as reflected  in

the  current  Budget book, are actually the old budget  for  the

Ministry  of  Labour  to perform the current  functions  of  the

Ministry  of Labour.  This was because the budget was  finalised

prior  to  the  recent  decision  to  establish  a  Ministry  of

Manpower.   Obviously, in order for the Ministry of Manpower  to

carry   out   the  enlarged  functions,  with  a   much   bigger

responsibility, we will require additional funding.  This is not

reflected  in  the  present budget.  To  determine  the  overall

budget needs of the Ministry of Manpower, we will engage various

manpower-related  agencies such as the  Ministry  of  Trade  and

Industry, EDB, PSB and the Ministry of Education in a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>



joint  planning  exercise to determine the full scope  of  work,

including  the  overall budget requirements for  both  1998  and

1999.  We will put up a supplementary budget to the Ministry  of

Finance.   In the meantime, the Ministry of Manpower, after  1st

April this year, will proceed to carry out its new functions and

programmes with the MOL budget as well as the existing programme

budgets of the various agencies and statutory boards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next month, the new Ministry will embark on a

comprehensive exercise to develop a strategic manpower blueprint

for Singapore in the next century.  This blueprint will be known

as  the  Manpower  21 Plan.  Mrs Yu-Foo has  asked  whether  the

Ministry will involve the trade unions and the employers in such

an  effort.  Let me assure all Members that,  apart from  inputs

from  other key Government economic agencies, we will  certainly

consult   the  National  Trades  Union  Congress  and   employer

organisations  in  order  to  draw  up  the  Manpower  21  plan.

Manpower  21 will, in fact, bring together tripartite  resources

to   focus  on  national  manpower  planning,  development   and

management issues.  This will help to strengthen the  spirit  of

tripartism  to  help us face up to economic  challenges  in  the

future.



<br>5.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, we are not waiting for Manpower 21 to be

completed  before  taking  any  initiatives  because   it   will

obviously take quite some time to go through the whole  exercise

of  identifying the key issues and the priorities,  and  mapping

out  a  strategy  to cope with each of these  areas  or  special

needs.   We will, in fact, start work immediately in April  this

year.   And  one of our first tasks will be to study,  integrate

and  coordinate existing manpower programmes, such as the Skills

Redevelopment  Programme,  the Back-to-Work  Programme  and  the

Skills   Certification  Programme,  with  our  overall  manpower

vision.  In particular, Sir, we will be looking at how to expand

the Skills Redevelopment Programme which had started in December

1996.  This is particularly urgent because of the economic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>



slowdown  and the prospect of increased retrenchment  among  our

workers.   We  will have to speed up the process  of  reskilling

workers who are likely to face retrenchment so that they can  be

redeployed effectively to other sectors of the economy which are

still in need of workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I understand correctly, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon suggested

that there is also a need to train Ministry of Manpower's staff,

trade   union  leaders  and  employees  in  companies  who   are

responsible for human resource management duties.  I agree  with

her.   I  think  there is a need to train such  people  who  are

generally grouped as the human resource practitioners.  I  agree

with  her  that the Ministry of Manpower, as a national manpower

agency,  should ensure that our own staff are also well trained,

kept  up  to date with the latest development in human resource,

management and also issues concerning manpower.  We will  ensure

that  there  will be ample training opportunities  for  our  own

staff and we will support any national programme to create  more

opportunities for training of human resource managers and  trade

union   leaders.   For  instance,  the  Government  is   already

presently  supporting the Singapore Institute of Labour  Studies

(SILS).  Government has given the Institute a substantial  grant

to  start  up  their endowment fund and this will help  them  to

finance their operations.  We will continue to give the SILS the

support  that  they require in order to fulfil  its  mission  of

providing training for union leaders to improve their ability to

manage industrial relations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, I have to respond to the hon. Member, Mr Chay,

from  Tanjong  Pagar  GRC.  He made a  very  eloquent  and  very

persuasive  argument why the name "Ministry of Manpower"  should

be  reconsidered.  I would like to tell him that, in fact,  when

the  idea  of  expanding the roles and responsibilities  of  the

Ministry  of  Labour was first mooted, we did actually  consider

the name "Ministry of Human Resource".  It was certainly one  of

the  alternatives.  As Mr Chay has pointed out, the term  "human

resource" appears to sound more progressive and modern and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>



in keeping with the IT and knowledge-based era.  It also applies

to  a wider range of issues such as individual welfare, personal

development and personal fufilment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to admit that the name "human resource development"

is quite relevant to the mission and duties of the new Ministry.

Actually for this reason, we had to think over the choice of the

name  very  carefully.   We took a long time  in  deciding  what

should be the name for the new Ministry.  Should we call it  the

"Ministry  of Human Resource" and appears to be fashionable  and

correct in keeping with the age?  Or should we call it "Ministry

of  Manpower"?   However, when we looked back  on  why  the  new

Ministry  was being established in the first place,  the  choice

became   clear.    The   new  Ministry  has   been   given   the

responsibility of harnessing the full potential of our  national

manpower  resources so that, firstly, we can ensure  Singapore's

pool of human capital or talent capital will become an engine of

growth in a knowledge-based economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the new Ministry is to ensure that our people,

Singapore's  only resource, will become a strategic  competitive

advantage  in the next phase of our development.   With  such  a

strong  economic  agenda to produce a world-class  and  globally

competitive  workforce, we felt that the term "manpower"  better

conveys  the  economic linkage and economic  force  of  the  new

Ministry's  responsibility.  Manpower is also a  term  which  is

clear and easily understood by the people.  Needless to say,  to

be  effective  as  a  national manpower agency,  we  will  adopt

practices  and concepts of human resource development which  are

appropriate to the Singapore context.  Calling the new  Ministry

the  Ministry  of Manpower will certainly not detract  from  its

dynamism and dedicated pursuit of its mission.  As the old adage

goes, "the test of the pudding is in the eating".  Whether it is

"manpower" or "human resource", what matters eventually  is  how

successful we are in nurturing a world-class workforce to ensure

Singapore's long-term competitiveness and prosperity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in anticipation of such queries which are quite

natural, I looked up several



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>



dictionaries.  The Oxford English Dictionary defines  "manpower"

as: "The power or agency of man in work or the number of persons

available for a purpose."  I should also point out that the same

dictionary also provided an explanation that "man" can  be  used

as "a human being irrespective of sex and age".  In other words,

the  "man"  in "manpower" is the same as the "man" in "mankind".

Chamber's  Twentieth Century Dictionary defines  "manpower"  as:

"The  agency  or  energy of man doing work."  Sir,  the  meaning

closest to the use of "manpower" in this case came from Collin's

Cobuild English Dictionary (New Edition) which I understand from

the cover blurb is based on an "unrivalled in-depth analysis  of

the  language of the 90s".  So it is very current, very topical.

Collin defines "manpower" as: "Workers are sometimes referred to

as  manpower  when  they are being considered  as  part  of  the

process of producing goods or providing services".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Sir, in our context, workers are all we have as

indigenous inputs to our goods and services output.   Hence,  it

is  not inappropriate to call the new Ministry the "Ministry  of

Manpower"  to strengthen the links between our efforts  and  the

viability and competitiveness of our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I next turn to the points made by the Nominated

Member,  Mdm  Claire  Chiang.  She has  made  several  excellent

suggestions and observations.  To begin with, she asked  whether

in  the context of current economic downturn, what is the impact

on  women,  particularly retrenchment of  women.   There  is  an

obvious  difference in the rate here in the sense that when  you

see  most of the retrenchment in the electronic sector, and most

of  the  retrenchment taking place at the production level,  and

also if you note that there are more women working as production

operators, both Singaporeans and also female foreign workers  on

work  permit,  it  is not surprising to find that  if  you  have

higher  retrenchment  in the sector, you will  find  more  women

there being affected by the retrenchment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether retrenched women, in this case it would be,

of course, resident Singaporean women who have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>



retrenched from the electronic sector, have greater difficulties

finding  jobs,  I do not have the specific information  on  hand

right now.  But I gather that if they are actively looking for a

job,  there is very minimal difference in time lag, because  the

average time taken for a retrenched worker to get a job  -  this

is  for  1997  -  was 1.8 months, and there was  no  significant

difference  between male and female, or between  young  and  old

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has also suggested that we look at the long term

strategy or specific plan to cater to the needs of the women  in

the  economy  and  how  to  attract  the  women  back  into  the

workforce.  Let me assure the Member that we will certainly take

this approach in conjunction with our effort to map out Manpower

21  plan.  Within the Manpower 21 Plan, we will certainly  study

the specific needs of women, including upgrading their skills in

order  to prepare them for the higher value jobs that are  going

to be created in the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has also noted that in the labour force, there are

fewer  women, particularly above the age of 45.  In  fact,  from

age  30 and above onwards, the female labour force participation

rates  start  to decline, and we have also observed this  trend.

That is why we have launched the Back-to-Work programme about 18

months  ago.   We  understand the difficulties  faced  by  women

because they have to balance the needs of the family and also  a

career.  That is why we have convened an Advisory Committee  for

the  Back-to-Work  programme.  The Advisory Committee  has  held

quite  a  number  of meetings already to study  how  to  further

develop  this Back-to-Work programme so that it will be able  to

meet  the  needs  of  the  housewives who  want  to  rejoin  the

workforce in particular, or the kind of training  that  will  be

required  in order to enable some housewives who have  left  the

labour force for quite some time already to be re-equipped  with

the skills, so that they can take on the jobs that are available

in the job market today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will certainly convey her suggestions to the Advisory

Committee on the Back-to-Work programme, and we will see



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>



how  we  can  further expand this programme  and  make  it  more

relevant to the needs of the women, particularly in light of the

potentially  higher  retrenchments among  women  in  the  labour

force.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also spoke about the needs of those who are

physically  handicapped, I believe, in trying to look  for  work

for this group of Singaporeans.  I share her concern and I agree

that   we   should  not  overlook  the  needs  and  the  special

requirements of this group of Singaporeans.  They can also  make

a  contribution  in  their  own way,  and  we  should  have  the

opportunities for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry presently works with Bizlink Centre to provide

employment  assistance  to  Singaporean  job  seekers  who  have

disabilities.  This Bizlink Centre was set up under the Ministry

of  Community  Development and the National  Council  of  Social

Services.  They specialise in looking into the employment  needs

of the disabled.  It offers job-matching services to people with

disability who are found suitable for general employment.  Those

whose  disabilities are so severe that they  cannot  cope  in  a

normal working environment, we try to find them appropriate jobs

in   sheltered  workshops,  activity  centres,  as  well  as  in

Bizlink's own production workshop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, based on feedback from Bizlink, if people with

disability are prepared to work and have the basic capabilities,

we could train them and prepare them for a job which could be as

rewarding as those of a normal Singaporean.  So my Ministry,  or

come  April the Ministry of Manpower, will continue to work with

Bizlink   and  other  Ministries,  like  Ministry  of  Community

Development,  to  look  into  ways  to  enhance  the  employment

opportunity  for  the disabled.  This would include  encouraging

and  helping employers to create suitable jobs which  will  meet

the  needs and constraints of persons with disability.  And here

I  want  to  emphasise that this is a very important point.   We

have  to  get employers to cooperate with us, employers who  are

generous and willing enough to take the extra step to cope  with

the   challenge  of  employing  those  who  have  some  physical

handicap.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>



<br>5.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I next turn to several Members who spoke on the

Government's  policy  to attract foreign talents  to  Singapore.

They  have spoken generally in support of the policy.  I do  not

believe any one of them had questioned the wisdom of this policy

to  attract  talent  to  Singapore.  But they  have  urged  that

Government's  policy or attitude towards foreign  talent  should

not disadvantage local talents or the homegrown talents.  First,

I  would  like to stress that local talents will always  be  the

foundation  of  our  manpower  pool.   Without  adequate   local

talents,  we  will not be able to compete in the global  market.

Foreign  talents  and workers will be welcomed to  Singapore  to

supplement and add value to the Singapore workforce.   They  are

here  to supplement our own talent so as to enhance our economic

competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past 10 years, the Singapore economy has outpaced

the growth of our own workforce.  As a result, the labour market

has become much tighter until very, very recently.  We have seen

unemployment remaining at low levels for many years.  Last year,

the  unemployment  rate was 1.8%.  Without the  contribution  of

foreign  talents  and workers, we would not have  been  able  to

sustain  the  growth rate of 8.9% on average  between  1987  and

1997.   So  foreign  talents and workers make  a  very  valuable

contribution to our economy and they allow us to grow at a  much

higher rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we should look at the issue perhaps from the perspective

of  stock  and the flow.  We have a stock of indigenous talented

Singaporeans who can contribute to the economy.  But as long  as

we just live within this stock, then our economic growth and the

opportunities  for prosperity would be limited to  what  we  can

produce with our own stock.  But if we were to stimulate a  flow

of talent from all over the world towards Singapore and we bring

in the right kind of talent who would supplement what we have in

our  stock, then we would be able to achieve much more  than  we

can  with our own people alone.  We will be able to have  higher

growth,  as has been seen in the last decade.  We have  achieved

much higher



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>



growth  because of the injection of foreign talents and  foreign

workers.   So  the flow of foreign talents into  Singapore  will

supplement our own resources and help us to achieve much  higher

growth rate than otherwise possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us consider some of the recent trends that have been

reported in the various business magazines and newspapers in the

US.   Consider a labour force of the size of the US.  Even today

in  the  US,  the top executives in the electronic  industry  in

particular are lobbying their government in Washington to  relax

the  quota  for  the  H1B  visa,  which  is  meant  for  foreign

professionals  to  enter  the US to work.   They  have  done  so

because  the  labour  market in the US has  become  very  tight.

There is a serious shortage of talents, particularly, in the  IT

industry.  Unemployment rate in the US has dropped to 4.6% which

I  believe is an all time low.  The industries, particularly the

IT  industry,  desperately need foreign talents  to  meet  their

manpower  needs in view of this very tight labour  market.   And

here  is  a  huge nation with over 200 million people  and  vast

resources,  and  they are still recruiting  foreign  talents  to

supplement their own workforce.  Compared to the United  States,

Singapore,  with its unemployment rate of only 1.8% and  a  very

much smaller workforce of about 1.9 million workers only, surely

our  need  for  top-up talents must be much  more  pressing  and

critical than the United States.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, foreign talents certainly will help us to enlarge our

economic pie and create greater wealth for all.  Let me give  an

example.   In some high-tech electronic companies in  Singapore,

foreign skilled workers make up 50% to 70% of the skilled labour

force.  The employers are simply unable to hire enough from  the

local talent pool to meet their needs, either due to an outright

shortage  of such people or the locals find other jobs are  more

attractive and unwilling to take on these jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without access to the skilled foreign workers, these high-tech companies would not have been able to operate in Singapore.

We would not have been able



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>



to  attract them to invest in Singapore.  And at the end of  the

day,  we  would not have been able to have such investments,  we

would  not have been able to create the employment opportunities

for  another  15%  or  30% of the company's  workforce  who  are

Singaporeans.  So by making available a steady flow  of  foreign

talents  and workers to investors in Singapore, we are  actually

helping   to   create   more   employment   opportunities    for

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While figures show that there is a shortage by sheer

numbers,  the question is how do we ensure that foreign  talents

and  workers are not coming in and displacing Singaporeans  from

the  same  desired  positions.   Several  Members  including  Mr

Shanmugam  and  Mr Zainul have spoken on this.  We  have  always

subscribed   to   a   free   market   policy   which    promotes

competitiveness and greater efficiency.  This would apply  to  a

certain  extent  to the manpower arena in the  labour  force  as

well.   Protectionist measures, whether it is in trade or labour

force,  would  hamper the upgrading of our local  workforce  and

create  a false sense of complacency and security.  If Singapore

wants to become a world-class workforce, our local workers  must

be  able  to match up and compete with workers anywhere  in  the

world.  We must be able to measure up to global standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Ministry of Manpower does not intend to flood

the labour market with foreigners.  Foreign talents are actively

pursued  when they bring critical skills which we lack  or  when

they  bring intellectual and entrepreneurial capital  that  will

sharpen the competitiveness of our economy.  Our priority  would

remain  on  fully  developing  the talent  and  capabilities  of

Singaporeans.   This  begins with the  Ministry  of  Education's

effort  to  provide  a  sound and relevant  education  to  young

Singaporeans  in  schools, polytechnics and  universities.   The

process  carries  on  when  the  young  Singaporeans  join   the

workforce   through  programmes  on  continuing  education   and

training.  The key issue here is to ensure that national



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>



resources  are  focused and applied optimally  to  enable  local

talents to develop to their highest potential and to fully reach

this potential in order to be able to compete and capitalise  on

the contributions of foreign talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shanmugam has asked if the Government will assure that

foreign  talents  will not be given special  privileges  and  as

such, they would move up faster or why is it that foreign talent

coming  to  work  in  Singapore and  enjoying  the  benefits  of

Singapore do not have to do National Service.  I think  we  have

to  take  a wider perspective when we set out to attract talents

to  Singapore.  Our policy will not discriminate against our own

talents,  ie, our own workers.  For instance, we will  certainly

not  encourage  our employers to pay foreign talents,  with  the

same  qualifications and capabilities as local talents, more  in

terms  of  monetary compensation or benefits.  It will just  not

make  commercial sense to begin with.  However,  most  employers

who  need to bring in foreign talents would need to provide one-time  relocation  assistance to facilitate the foreign  talents'

relocation to Singapore.  I think this is unavoidable.   And  in

the  same  context, a Government scheme to set  aside  some  HDB

flats to house foreign talents is necessary in view of the  high

cost  of  private  sector housing in Singapore.   Such  specific

measures  to  facilitate the relocation of talents to  Singapore

must  be expected in view of the global competition for talents.

If  we  do not make any effort to overcome the intrinsic  hurdle

and  difficulties  that we face, then very few  foreign  talents

will actually come to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget, Sir, that the talents that we want to

attract  are also being courted by employers in other countries.

I  have  mentioned earlier that the IT industry  in  the  US  is

planning  to attract many more foreign talents.  But  we  should

also  take note that many other countries are also scouring  the

world  for  talents  to  boost their  competitiveness.   As  for

National Service, we should not view it as a stumbling block  or

a  disadvantageous factor against our own talents in  Singapore.

Rather,   National  Service  enhances  each   and   every   male

Singaporean's overall



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>



development through the knowledge and values acquired during the

training  and, more importantly, a dedicated service  to  defend

the nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to take this opportunity to point out

that  if  foreign talents who come to Singapore choose  to  sink

roots in Singapore, then their children, being second generation

migrants, will of course have to serve National Service like any

other born and bred Singaporean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the globalised economy, there will be strong

competition  for  top  talent.  We  have  to  create  the  right

environment to attract some of the talents to come to  Singapore

to  help  us to become more competitive.  Here, I would like  to

point  out  that I agree with Mr Zainul that we have  to  ensure

that our international image remains conducive in our effort  to

attract foreign talents.  Because talented foreigners would want

to  work  and  live  in  a dynamic, secure and  culturally  rich

society.   I  think we can offer such an environment to  attract

the best to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For other foreign workers, we can offer safe, secure and

rewarding  employment opportunities.  The Ministry  of  Manpower

will continue to enhance the workplace environment so that local

and  foreign workers and talents will be able to give their best

in  rewarding  jobs.   In particular, we  must  make  them  feel

welcome  and  motivate some of them to sink  their  roots  here.

They  will make a significant contribution and add value to  our

economy.  The Ministry of Manpower will be willing to work  with

NTUC  and  the Singapore International Foundation and any  other

organisation to realise this vision to ensure that  we  will  be

successful  in  our  effort to recruit talents  to  top  up  and

supplement our own talent and manpower resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as part of the coordinated approach to manpower

development in Singapore, the new Ministry of Manpower will take

on  the overall attraction and management of foreign talents and

workers.   These  will include all the policies, programmes  and

operations related to the flow of foreign talent into Singapore.

We  will  also  put up a supplementary budget in due  course  to

ensure  that  there are sufficient resources  for  managing  the

foreign talents and workers in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>



<br>6.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in summary, as Singapore aims for a world-class

workforce,  we  need to position Singapore as  a  global  talent

capital  or  a talent hub.  Singapore is where the  best  talent

will  converge,  both  local and foreign.   We  will  create  an

environment  for talent, local and foreign, to  excel  in  their

areas  of  expertise  and add value to  our  economy.   We  will

facilitate  employment training, especially for Singaporeans  at

all  levels,  so  that  they are able to  compete  with  foreign

talents and workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I will respond to Dr Wang, the Member for Bukit

Timah  GRC.   Dr  Wang is correct in pointing out that  manpower

planning will be a complex task.  It is not an easy task.  Some,

in  fact, may argue that because of rapid technological changes,

and the changing skills that are required by employers, manpower

planning  might become less relevant.  However, we  differ.   In

the context of Singapore's small labour force, manpower planning

is   crucial.   We  have  seen  that  this  small  workforce  is

insufficient to meet the demands of the economy, and hence there

is a need to supplement with foreign talents and workers.  Faced

with  such  a situation, we need to have a coordinated  manpower

planning  to  ensure that manpower demands are met and,  at  the

same  time,  retain  the  desired social  fabric  and  cohesion.

Manpower  planning is important to bring about an efficient  and

sustainable balance of manpower demand and supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To move Singapore up the development ladder, we must be

conscious  of  the  rapid   changes in technology  and  to  take

advantage of this.  Manpower planning will hence take  a  demand

driven approach, to keep abreast of the new industry trends  and

encourage  training in new areas of specialised skills  to  meet

the  ever  changing needs of the globalised economy.   To  some,

manpower  planning  may  be  a very  mundane  and  very  complex

process.   But  let  me  point out that  in  the  demand  driven

manpower  planning process, it is very dynamic, and it  aims  to

anticipate and better prepare for the changes in technology  and

economy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Council of Professional and Technical

Education (CPTE), which is chaired by the Ministry of Trade  and

Industry,  gives broad recommendations to tertiary  institutions

on  their  student intakes, based on demand and supply analyses.

Dr  Wang quoted the example of the restriction on the number  of

medical  students.   I  would not go into the  details  on  this

subject because it has been extensively debated and discussed in

this  Chamber  by the Minister for Health, the argument  on  why

there  should be some restriction on the number of doctors  that

are   trained  in  NUS  and  also  on  the  number  of   foreign

institutions  whose graduates will be recognised.   But  what  I

want to point out here is that manpower planning in general does

not  always  aim  to  limit enrolment of  students  at  tertiary

educational  institutions,  but rather  to  ensure  an  adequate

supply of skilled manpower in critical areas of the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, sometimes manpower planning do actually increase

the  range  or the spectrum of choice available to students,  by

encouraging  institutions to take on new  areas  of  specialised

education and training which they may not have been doing in the

past.  Because through the process of manpower planning, we have

been  able  to anticipate the economic development in a  certain

direction, the emerging needs of new industries and that we  are

able then to transmit these messages to the tertiary educational

institutions and encourage them to prepare their students or  to

start  up  new opportunities for their students to  prepare  for

careers in these industries.  For example, in the past, the CPTE

had  recommended that the university broaden the  curriculum  of

their science courses to make it more technology based, so  that

their graduates will be able to do a much wider range of jobs in

the industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polytechnics have also come up with new multimedia courses

as  a result of emerging demand in the IT industry in Singapore.

This  move  initiated  through a process of integrated  manpower

planning, supplemented by coordinated manpower



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>



development,  will  help  to ensure  that  our  local  workforce

possess the right mix of skills and experience required  by  the

global market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the long run, manpower planning aims to move

Singapore towards a globally competitive workforce.  Through the

upgrading of the economy, Singapore would reduce our reliance on

unskilled foreign workers and increase the overall skill profile

in  the  economy, including both local and foreign  workers.   A

dynamic   and   skilled  workforce  will  enhance  the   overall

international image of Singapore, one with a world-class economy

with a world class workforce.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, the subject of

tripartite partnership was discussed at length recently when the

Nominated  Member, Mr Cyrille Tan, moved a motion in this  House

for  the  Government  to  recognise  it  as  a  key  competitive

advantage of Singapore.  Sir, I feel the adoption of the  motion

could  not have come at a better time in the wake of the current

economic slowdown arising from the regional financial crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a private and manufacturing sector employer, allow me to

provide   my  perspective  of  tripartism  from  the  employer's

viewpoint.  We all recognise that we currently live in an era of

pervasive change.  Companies and organisations will have to keep

reshaping  itself,  shifting  and flexing  to  fit  the  rapidly

changing world.  This is the only way we can hope to survive  in

this fiercely competitive environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed is another crucial element for business survival

these  days.   Slowness kills companies and this  translates  to

also   the  death  of  many  careers.   Workers  must  therefore

recognise that many changes going on are designed to help  their

companies pick up speed.  Everyone is expected to operate with a

stronger sense of urgency to get things accomplished.  I believe

speed  even  ranks  higher than perfection in  this  challenging

business  environment we are operating today.  High  quality  is

important  but it must come quickly.  Even if it means  failure,

we need to learn to fail fast, fix it and race on.   The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>



days  of solely relying on incremental step-by-step improvements

are  over.   We need to seek radical breakthroughs  and  quantum

leaps  to remain relevant.  Our workers, therefore, must  expect

and be prepared for flexible waves of working.  Duties and tasks

will be regularly realigned to suit changing conditions.  Short-lived  assignments will be more common.  Workers can  expect  to

have a constantly new set of co-workers, work for more than  one

boss or switch bosses more often.  Companies will prefer workers

who  show a high capacity for adjustment and want those who  can

adapt fast, not those who resist change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current economic crisis sets the stage for even more

rapid  changes  within  companies  and  organisations,  as  they

restructure  their operations to stay competitive and  relevant.

Our unions have demonstrated their responsibility in the past by

acting positively to assist companies become more productive and

efficient and, as a result, enable both employers and workers to

benefit  from  higher profitability.  I see no reason  why  this

cordial partnership could not be put to beneficial use at a time

when  companies are faced with difficult business  decisions  in

the wake of the financial crisis taking its toll on our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our priority must be to preserve jobs. I think

employers should recognise that our responsible unions have  the

capacity and expertise to assist companies in trouble and  those

having cash flow problems due to their business exposure in  the

region.    They  could therefore be pro-active by sincerely  and

honestly  sharing their difficulties they face with the  unions.

Trust  could be strengthened and built by having management  and

union  leaders sitting down together to sort through the various

options  to save jobs, such as moderating expectations,  cutting

down  on  the  variable components of wages  wherever  possible,

implement wage freezes or working short weeks, depending on  the

issues afflicting the troubled companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been so much talk and emphasis given to

upgrading  the skills of employees but, unfortunately,  this  is

not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>



correspondingly  met with concrete and swift  action  to  tackle

this  problem.  With activity tapering off in the light  of  the

present   economic   slowdown,  it   presents   an   outstanding

opportunity  for  employers to conduct the much needed  training

and  skills  upgrading which many employers have kept postponing

during  peak periods.  This is where employers and unions,  with

the  assistance of the newly set up Ministry of Manpower,  could

quickly  act to get our workers trained up so that they will  be

more  knowledgeable, productive and efficient when better  times

return.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the national level, as already asserted by NMP Cyrille

Tan and the Member for Kreta Ayer-Tanglin GRC, Mr Sinnakaruppan,

during the February 1998 debate on this subject, I would like to

echo  their  sentiment  on  the  urgent  need  to  establish   a

structured  programme to ensure life-long employability  of  our

workers.  I am glad to note that the Minister, Dr Lee Boon Yang,

has  just announced that the Ministry of Manpower will make this

as one of its key priorities when it begins functioning from 1st

April 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our unique tripartite setting which I am certain is

the  envy of many countries has worked marvellously for us.  The

union movement has demonstrated its value and usefulness to  not

only  help companies and businesses become more productive,  but

also contributed in steering our industries to become one of the

most  competitive in the world.  Companies, workers  and  nation

have collectively benefited from the peaceful harmony created by

the  tripartite partnership.  However, past success should never

be  taken  for granted.  The three partners in this relationship

will  be  tested  in  the  wake of the constantly  changing  and

increasingly competitive global business environment.  There is,

therefore,  a corresponding need to also constantly nurture  and

strengthen  this  tripartite partnership to  suit  the  changing

landscape  as  we endeavour to build a world-class and  globally

competitive workforce.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, with your indulgence on the

question of names



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>



between MOHR and MOM, my choice, of course, is clear.  In  fact,

the word "MOHR" reminds me of Oliver who is asking for more.  In

the  tradition of our training and retraining, I thought MOM  is

best  and  wise too, with due respect to my colleague, Mr  Chay.

And  as  suggested by Dr Lee, the test of the pudding is in  the

eating,  so while we wait for MOM's pudding, allow me  to  share

some   food  for  thought  on  tripartism  to  strengthen  MOM's

foundation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to see that MOM has included and I quote, "to

harmonise   workers  and  employers'  interests  in  employment,

safeguard  workers' rights and provide advisory and  promotional

services in labour-management relations as part of its terms  of

reference  for  its  labour  relations  department."   From  the

Ministry's  point of view, what are the possible minefields  one

needs   to   look   out  for  in  terms  of  future   tripartite

relationships,  particularly  in the  context  of  the  economic

turmoil in the region and possible economic restructuring?



<br>6.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a labour MP, I dare say that the union leadership, and

the  labour  movement as a whole, will play  its  part  to  help

companies meet the challenges of the region's economic turmoil.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a mere rhetoric. The NTUC and our workers have

proved   themselves  to  be  positive  and  made  the  necessary

sacrifices  to  help Singapore move out of the  1985  recession.

The  CPF  cut then was proof that the unions were ready to  take

initiatives and make tough decisions when the situation  demands

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another instance, for example, Straits Steamship of the

Keppel  Group, there was agreement then to cut wages across  the

board so that retrenchment could be avoided, helping workers  to

keep their jobs back in the mid 80s.  We have been told that the

situation today is not as bad as in 1985, and there is  no  need

to  cut  CPF contributions, and that is only an option  of  last

resort.   We are reassured, Sir.   But workers must be ready  to

accept tough



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>



decisions to make the companies and the economy as a whole a lot

stronger.  After all, there must be a strong commitment to  work

as a team for the longer term interest of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question, Sir, is: how does MOM see her role to ensure

there  is  that understanding and that employers too  will  play

their part and not take advantage of the situation, say, to  get

rid  of  older workers as a way to reduce cost?  I am  reassured

also,  as  Mr  Ahmad  Magad has spoken,  that  on  the  part  of

employers  they  have to play their part to help  us  form  this

formidable team in facing the economic turmoil.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon:</b> Sir, over the years, our workforce

profile has changed drastically.  In 1992, there were only 15.8%

executive, managerial and professional staff.  Today, there  are

21.5%  of  them.   With  60% of every  PSLE  cohort  going  into

university  and  the  polytechnics,  this  group  will   further

increase.   All these have serious implications for  the  labour

movement.  It will mean that the membership and leadership  pool

will  decline.  It will mean that those who are eligible to join

unions will decline to 40% of the total workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not by accident that we have a harmonious industrial

relations climate which had enabled employers to get on with the

task  of  managing  their companies with no disruption.   A  key

contributing factor for the industrial peace that we had enjoyed

is  because of the quality of our trade union leadership.   This

would be compromised if we cease to have leaders of such calibre

because  they  fall  outside  the  scope  of  our  trade   union

representation.   More so than in the past, we  will  need  such

leaders  now, because of the changing nature of our economy  and

the  demands  of global competition.  This requires trade  union

leaders who understand the ground well but at the same time have

the  knowledge  and sophistication to deal with  complex  issues

which are global in nature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the issue from another angle, executives and

managers are also employees of a company and do need



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>



some  kind  of  assistance  when they  have  problems.   Seeking

redress  in  the  courts  can  be a costly,  time-consuming  and

generally  damaging experience for the individual  arising  from

the   attendant  publicity  that  arises.   Litigation  is   not

necessarily the best option for employers either.  It results in

a  workplace  that is hostile and will cause loss of  productive

manhours  when  a  company has to defend against  expensive  law

suits.   Therefore,  we  would like to encourage  executives  to

bring   their  grievances  to  the  Ministry  of  Manpower   for

conciliation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am aware that there are presently guidelines to help

weed out bogus titles.  These guidelines were passed in 1992 and

were  an  attempt to overcome some of the difficulties faced  in

organising executives.  Instead of amending section 16(3) of the

Industrial  Relations Act, we agreed that one alternative  would

be  to  try  out these guidelines and gauge their effectiveness.

While  the  guidelines have resolved part of  the  problem,  the

restriction  on  a  rank  and  file union  representing  genuine

executives  remains  unresolved.  It is time  that  we  reviewed

these  guidelines  and  come out with more effective  solutions.

This review could be done through tripartite efforts and through

the  good  office of MOM, so that a consensus may be reached  on

this issue.

<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cyrille Tan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, we have come a long

way from the days of industrial strife, of strikes and riots, of

economic  stagnation.  Today, in a workplace dispute, our  union

leaders try to settle them through negotiation.  But if there is

a  deadlock,  the disputes would be referred to the Ministry  of

Labour for conciliation.  And if no settlement is reached,  they

are sent to the Industrial Arbitration Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that when it is set up, the Ministry of Manpower

will  continue  to  play  an  active  conciliatory  role.   With

experienced conciliation officers,  handling of disputes will be

smoother.  In my view, we need more experienced hands  to  serve

as conciliation officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers posted to the conciliation department need time to

become familiar



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>



with  labour  laws  and  industrial relations  practices.   More

importantly,  they  need  to  get to know  industrial  relations

practitioners on both the management and the union  sides.   All

this knowledge goes to waste if they are transferred out of  the

conciliation department too frequently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present system of settling disputes was put in place by

the  older generation of PAP leaders who did not want to see the

trade  unions put in a disadvantageous position.  This symbiosis

between  the  PAP  and  the  NTUC has  since  developed  into  a

tripartite  relationship among the Government,  the  unions  and

employers.  Tripartism has helped Singapore to forge ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not be complacent simply because we have a

tripartite  relationship that works.  Other countries  are  also

moving  in this direction.  In the 17th February 1998  issue  of

the Financial Times, Mr John Monks, General Secretary of British

Trades Union Congress said,  and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In the 1970s and 1980s, everyone talked just about rights.

Now  we  know  that with rights go responsibilities.   Employers

need  to  accept  that with the right to employ staff  goes  the

responsibility to deal with them collectively if that  is  their

staff's  wish.   Employees and their unions know that  with  the

right to negotiate goes the responsibility to work for the  good

of the enterprise in partnership.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In New Zealand and Australia too, there have been changes

in dealings between unions and management.  For quite some time,

American  unions have, under extenuating circumstances, accepted

wage  cuts  so as to preserve jobs.  If the developed  countries

get  their tripartite act together, they could siphon off a huge

chunk of investments now heading for countries like ours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must do everything possible to maintain industrial

harmony.  One good way is for unionists and management personnel

to  attend  the  same  courses, as  they  do  at  the  Singapore

Institute  of Labour Studies.  Then each will be able to  better

appreciate the problems faced by the other.  Perhaps, it is time

we allowed management personnel from the non-unionised sector to

join in such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>



courses  so that they can better understand what trade  unionism

is all about in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state of industrial relations will be severely tested

during an economic downturn.  While retrenchment is management's

prerogative, I would like to repeat a call made by Mr  Lim  Boon

Heng,  NTUC's  Secretary-General.  Mr Lim  said  that  employers

should  not  cut  back on training during an economic  downturn.

Instead,  we  should not stop training and upgrading  so  as  to

strengthen  our competitiveness.  Then we will be in a  position

to benefit when there is an upturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure this House that our unions have been working

with  management to solve company problems, and make  them  more

competitive.   For example, members of a union  worked  overtime

during  the  weekends to help an MNC meet an urgent order,  thus

paving the way for more new orders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Realising that its workers need to have their skills

upgraded,  the  company signed up for the  Skills  Redevelopment

Programme,  a  scheme initiated by the NTUC  with  support  from

Government  and employers.  With certificates that  the  workers

will  get  at  the end of the course, they can look  forward  to

lifelong employability.  Armed with such certificates, they  can

get jobs much easier should they be retrenched.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another case, union and management are working together

to  retrain  workers,  re-engineer the  production  process  and

inculcate  a  new mindset so that the company could realise  its

Vision   of   Excellence  2000  in  quality,  productivity   and

innovation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in difficult times, unions and workers are willing to

make  sacrifices  and moderate expectations.  When  the  economy

recovers, I am confident that employers will reward workers  for

their commitments and sacrifices.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, may I,

at the commencement of my speech, ask the Minister the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>



question, which is the whole purport and import of my amendment:

Does  his Ministry have any intention to restore to the  workers

their  rights,  which they took away from the  workers  back  in

1968?   Or  is  it the intention of the new Ministry,  with  its

shift  on  emphasis, to bury workers' rights altogether  and  to

forget them?  I would like a clear answer from the Minister when

he  replies at the end, whether the Ministry proposes to restore

to  the workers these rights which were taken away from them, as

I said, in 1968.



<br>6.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the benefit of those Members who were perhaps not old

enough, and who may not have studied the old legislation, let me

remind  them that under the Lim Yew Hock administration,  before

the  PAP  Government took power in 1959, our  workers  had  some

rights.   The trade unions had their rights.  But after the  PAP

took  over, in 1967/68, after we came out of Malaysia,  and  the

British government announced its intention to withdraw its bases

from  here, the Government decided to restrict and cut  down  on

workers' rights and the rights of trade unions.  And Mr Lee Kuan

Yew  who  was  then the Prime Minister openly said  this  in  an

interview  with  the  BBC.  He said, "I told  the  workers  that

Singapore  would  be experiencing a difficult  time  and  it  is

necessary  now for us because of the withdrawal of  the  British

bases  that  we  should build our own industries  and  build  up

Singapore's  economy."  And he said the workers  and  the  trade

unions  were  prepared to do that for Singapore.  So  there  you

have  an attitude displayed by the workers then, an attitude  of

their  acknowledging their responsibility for Singapore and  the

community.   But Singapore has come a long way since  then.   We

were  told  that Singapore has progressed economically  and  yet

none  of  the rights that were taken away from the workers  have

been restored to them.  Is that not a betrayal of the workers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a lot has been talked about tripartism, how wonderful

it is.  But may I repeat, what I think I read Mr Chiam as having

said,  it  is  hollow, because the trade union participating  in

this  tripartism  is not there as an equal partner.   I  do  not

think we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>



have  to  pretend that the trade unions have the muscle and  the

clout that they possessed at one time.  I am not just advocating

rights for rights' sake.  Everyone acknowledges that with rights

go  duties.  And I am sure our workers know that and  they  have

demonstrated  their willingness to do their duty  for  Singapore

and  the  community.  But rights are important.   In  the  first

place,  they  give  dignity  to  the  working  man.   He   feels

protected, not because of assurances given by a Ministry  or  by

an  official.   He  feels  protected because  he  says  the  law

protects his rights.  He can look at the law, he can point to it

and  say,  "There  we  have it."  And if their  rights  are  not

granted  or  broken, they can challenge those rights.   So  they

give  dignity to the worker, and that is important, to  motivate

the  worker into working his best, into giving his best for  the

employer  and helping in the economy of Singapore.  Without  any

rights, he is completely, as I said sometime this week,  at  the

mercy  of the employer, and that is no way to treat our workers.

We have got to give them an equal footing with the employers and

assure  them  that  their  rights will be  protected,  not  just

because  we  say  so,  but  because the  law  provides  for  the

protection of their rights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So may I ask the Minister whether it is the intention of

the  Ministry  to restore these rights?  May I  ask  him  again,

whether  it  is  the intention to set up an Industrial  Tribunal

which will deal with any problems or complaints from the workers

that  their  rights have been violated.  We had  the  Industrial

Arbitration  Court, but I have not heard or  seen  any  decision

from  the Industrial Arbitration Court for many a long year.   I

wonder  if  it  still  functions.  Is it  not  time  we  had  an

Industrial Arbitration Panel or Tribunal, as they do  in  almost

all other countries?  They have one in Malaysia which listens to

complaints  from  the  workers  and  hears  them  through  their

representatives,  and then adjudicates on their  rights  against

the employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is all very well for the Ministry and for other labour

leaders here to say about the employers cooperating or they look

to the employers to cooperate.  It is not good



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>



enough.   The  employers have to understand  that  workers  have

rights.   It is not a question of charity.  It is not a question

of magnanimity, but a question of the rights of the workers.  So

will the Minister answer these questions?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Encik Othman bin Haron</b>

<b>Eusofe):</b> Sir, first, let me take the issues which have been

brought  up  by the Member for Pasir Ris GRC and the Member  for

Cheng  San GRC, Mr Ahmad Magad as well as Mr Zainul Abidin,  and

also the points made by Mr Cyrille Tan, the Nominated Member  of

Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have spoken about the issues of tripartism and labour

management  relations.  As they have pointed  out,  this  was  a

subject  which  was thoroughly discussed in the sitting  earlier

this  year.   Tripartism  is  a  key  competitive  advantage  of

Singapore,  and in discussing this motion we had got  resounding

support from Members and also from Parliament that it is  a  key

advantage and we have made big steps as we go along to  see  how

we  could  further enhance it, so that Singapore  will  be  more

competitive as we face the challenges of the 21st century.  They

have  raised this issue again.  I think it shows by  itself  how

important the issue of tripartism is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently we are facing regional financial turmoil and

economic  slowdown.  And I think the question of tripartism  is,

therefore,  very much more important.  Members have spoken,  and

even  quoted experience, of what happened in 1985 and 1986  when

we had a recession.  When the onset of recession came about, the

tripartite  framework  was swift in its response.   Through  the

NWC,  an  extensive  package of anti-recessionary  measures  was

formulated and implemented successfully with strong support from

the  employers,  the  trade unions and  the  workers.   I  think

Members  are  aware  that  there  was  a  drastic  reduction  in

employers' CPF and there was acceptance of severe wage restraint

and  wage  cuts.  Now all these had been done because there  was

trust  and confidence between management and the unions.   As  a

result, the prompt and effective implementation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1401</b></font><br><br>



of the cost-cutting measures helped companies and the economy to

turn  around  quickly.   And when growth resumed  and  Singapore

continued  to achieve strong economic growth from 1987,  workers

have  been  rewarded  with substantial wage increases  and  good

bonuses.   All  these were made possible as the social  partners

were able to pull together to overcome difficulties in times  of

economic adversity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Cyrille Tan has pointed out that workers are prepared to

make  sacrifices for the long term good.  So on the part of  the

trade  unions  and workers, they are prepared  to  put  national

objectives  above  sectional interests, and  go  for  long  term

benefits  over short term gains.  On the part of the  employers,

they  are prepared to share their gains when the business  picks

up and prospers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I agree with the three Members, who have spoken, on the

need  for the social partners to work closely together  to  pull

Singapore  through  the  current  difficulties  caused  by   the

regional  financial  crisis and the  expected  slowdown  of  our

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our strong tripartite foundation has been built over

many years.  And it will certainly provide us with the mechanism

and  commitment  to ride out the storm.  Tripartite  efforts  to

help deal with current problems will certainly be stepped up, at

least in the following areas:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in the area of cost, particularly wage cost. The

NWC,  which is a tripartite body, could deliberate and come  out

with  recommendations on how employers, unions and  workers  and

the   Government  could  work  together  to  help  maintain  the

competitiveness  of our economy, and of our  companies,  in  the

current  difficult period, and how to safeguard  the  long  term

interest  of  our  workers.   And  to  assist  workers  who  are

retrenched  as a result of this economic slowdown, Members  have

been  informed  by  my  Minister that we already  had  formed  a

tripartite panel and it has already started working.  The  panel

will  certainly  find  ways to facilitate the  re-employment  of

retrenched  workers and to encourage employers to also  consider

alternatives to retrenchment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1402</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the areas of skills upgrading and training, my Ministry

will  work  closely  with the tripartite partners  to  formulate

programmes  to  upgrade the skills of our workers,  particularly

the  low  skilled ones, to ensure that they continue  to  remain

employable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the company level, management, trade unions and

workers  should also work closely together to help the companies

to improve productivity and help them to be more competitive, so

that  the  companies are in a better position to cope  with  the

current  difficulties,  and  they can  achieve  their  corporate

objectives when the business environment improves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with all these efforts in the strong spirit of

tripartism, I am confident that we will be able to ride out  the

storm and emerge stronger for the benefit of all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the points which were made by ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Othman, we have got one more minute. You

might want to reply tomorrow.  It makes more sense.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> All right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Do I have the assent of Members to continue

tomorrow?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the Committee

and took the Chair of the House.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to report

that  the Committee of Supply has made further  progress on  the

Main and Development Estimates for the financial year 1998/1999,

and ask leave to sit again tomorrow.
