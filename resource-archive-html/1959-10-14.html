<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE PUBLIC PASSENGER TRANSPORT SYSTEM</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Unification)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr A. P. Rajah</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  if  he  will  state  what  steps   the

Government  proposes to take to improve the  public

transport  system in Singapore, and  whether  early

consideration is being given to the unification  of

the  public passenger transport system in Singapore

into  a  single  undertaking  or  other  means   of

improving the public transport System.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, a few days after

the  new  Government was formed,  I  instructed  my

Ministry  to  put  up a scheme to improve  the  bus

transport  system  of Singapore, laying  particular

stress  on  the  rural areas which are  either  not

adequately served or where there are no buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a first step, the Omnibus Licensing Authority

has  recently  been reconstituted with  honest  and

capable  persons  and  since then  they  have  been

meeting  a few times a week to try and improve  the

mess left over during the past ten year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is unable at this stage to make a

policy  statement regarding the unification of  the

public passenger transport system in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Would the Minister state, in view of

the  existing  conditions  of  national  transport,

whether  the transport system is adequate  to  meet

the pressing needs of the travelling public?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, the public in

Singapore know that during the past ten years,  the

passenger   transport   system   which   was    the

responsibility of the City Council and in which the

Member  for Farrer Park played a leading part,  has

been  completely in a mess, with two or  three  bus

lines serving one route and in other places with no

bus routes at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand the needs of the travelling public

as  well  as the conditions of service of  the  bus

employees.  From  the  first  week  when  the   new

Government came into being, I was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>



given  the  authority to look into the  matter  and

certain steps have been taken to try to remedy  the

situation. Mr Speaker, one of these steps was  the

reconstitution  of the Omnibus Licensing  Authority

which  replaced the corrupt Vehicles  Committee  of

the  City  Council in the issuing of  licences.  We

have  reconstituted the Omnibus Licensing Authority

set up in late 1957 with honest and capable persons

and since then they have been meeting a few times a

week  just  to  try  and remedy a  little  bit  the

situation left over in the past ten years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the new P.A.P. Government has only been formed for four months and the public of

Singapore realise that during the past four  months

we have been doing as best we could to tidy up some

of the mess left over and to start everything fresh

again.

<div align="center"><b>PEOPLE'S ACTION PARTY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Details of Employment of Defeated Candidates in Public Services)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr A. P. Rajah</b> asked the Minister for National

Development how many defeated People's Action Party

candidates in the last general election are now  or

have  been  employed  in the Singapore  Improvement

Trust, the City Council of Singapore and/or in  any

department in the Ministry of National Development,

and  whether he will state their names,  the  posts

held, the manner and date of their appointments and

the monthly salaries attached to such posts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, three of the

defeated  candidates in the last general  elections

were  members  of the City Council  staff  who  had

resigned  from  the  City Council  to  contest  the

elections. These three are Inche Roslan Bin  Hassan

who contested on the P.A.P. ticket, Inche Osman bin

Gani who contested on the U.M.N.O. ticket, and  Mr

Chen  Ta  Ren  who contested on the P.A.P. ticket.

These  three are persons of calibre and  integrity.

Immediately   after   the   elections.    I    gave

instructions to contact these three persons, asking

them  to  help the new Government in  the  task  of

building  the country and working for  the  people.

They agreed and they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



now  working very hard in the Ministry of  National

Development.  From the time they started,  we  have

given the fullest publicity to their work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Roslan and Inche Osman are getting all-in salaries, without the usual civil service benefits,

of $400 and $700 a month respectively. They are now

working actively on the promotion of Malay welfare,

like  the  work  in the Southern Islands.  Further,

with  the  Parliamentary Secretary of the  Ministry

(Inche Yaacob), they interview every day many  tens

of Malays from all parts of Singapore and help them

to  solve  their  problems. The third  person,  Mr

Speaker,  Mr Chen Ta Ren has been engaged  in  the

Singapore Improvement Trust. He is now in the flat-letting  section, checking through the applications

and  helping to put an end to the corrupt practices

of  the past Singapore Improvement Trust. Mr  Chen

Ta  Ren  gets  an  all-in salary of $250  inclusive

without the usual civil service benefits.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> In view of what the Minister has said,

would  he  agree that, if this system  were  to  be

continued,  we  would  fast approach  the  American

spoils system?

whether  he  is  aware  that  the  Manager  of  the

Singapore  Airport, on his return to  Singapore  on

the  7th September, 1959, after three months' leave

of  absence, has not yet resumed the duties of  his

post,  and whether he will make a statement on  the

matter.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Mr Ford was

recalled to answer certain disciplinary charges. He

duly reported for duty on 9th September and he  was

interdicted from duty on 19th September. He is  now

facing   a  charge  of  gross  negligence  in   the

performance  of  his duties. A  Tribunal  is  being

constituted under the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



chairmanship of a Judge. In these circumstances,  I

think, in fairness to this officer, I shall refrain

from making any public statement.

<div align="center"><b>POLITICAL SECRETARIES</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Disciplinary Action under Government General Orders and Regulations)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr A. P. Rajah</b> asked the Minister for Finance

to  state whether Political Secretaries are subject

to  Government General Orders and Regulations,  and

whether  disciplinary action will be taken  against

each and every of the Political Secretaries to  the

Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Labour and Law,

the  Ministry  of  Education and  the  Ministry  of

Finance    for   having   attended   and   actually

participated  in  the  Singapore  Traction  Company

Employees  Union's  strike  meeting  held  at   the

Union's premises on 29th September, 1959.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Personal

Secretaries (Political) are political appointments.

They  hold office at the pleasure of the Government

in  power.  They  presumably will be  removed  from

office  should  at the next election another  Party

form  the  Government. There is therefore  a  basic

distinction between the Political Secretary and the

career  civil  servant whose duty it  is  to  serve

impartially  and  to the best of  his  ability  any

elected government. The post of Political Secretary

does  not therefore offer a career and, because  of

this   and   the   difference  in   functions   and

responsibilities  from those of  the  career  civil

servants,   is  not  subject  to  the  disciplinary

provisions   of   General  Orders.  The   Political

Secretary is a member of the political party in the

government  of the day. As such his public  actions

and   utterances,  be  they  made  either  in   his

individual or official capacity, have an  important

bearing  upon the policy of the government.  It  is

therefore  his  responsibility to  clear  with  his

Minister  whether  his actions  or  statements  are

consistent  with government and party policy.  The

control  of Political Secretaries is not  exercised

through normal civil service channels and it  would

be  improper  that  that should be  the  case.  The

control is exercised directly through



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



the  Minister  to whom the Political  Secretary  is

attached  and through the Minister by the  Cabinet.

The Member will appreciate that since the system of

Political Secretaries is new it will take some time

for  the relationship between the Minister and  his

Political Secretary to be defined in detail.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> In view of the Minister's statement,

could   the  Minister  state  whether  these   five

Political  Secretaries  had  clearance  from  their

respective Ministers before they took part in  this

meeting?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Regarding the instance cited by

the  Member for Farrer Park, the answer is: Not  to

my knowledge.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE'S INTERNAL SECURITY</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister)</b></div>



<br><br>2.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker, I have a statement to make on the internal

security  of  Singapore and our relationships  with

the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the first opportunity the P.A.P.

Government  has had, since assuming office  on  5th

June, 1959, to make a statement on the question  of

the   security  of  the  State  and  the  Communist

challenge.  Our  basic attitude and  philosophy  on

this  question  have been stated  and  restated  on

innumerable  past occasions when the Party  was  in

the Opposition. However, today is the first time we

restate  the  position in some detail after  having

assumed  office.  It  has  not  been  made  earlier

because  up  to the third meeting of  the  Internal

Security  Council  on the 8th October  it  was  not

possible  for  us  to make any statements  on  this

matter. Suffice it to say between the 5th June  and

28th  August  there was correspondence between  the

Federation  Government, the British Government  and

ourselves to clarify the rights, powers and  duties

of  the  Internal Security Council as laid down  in

Part VII of the Constitution. At the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



first meeting of the Internal Security Council, the

provisions  contained in sections 65  and  66  were

considered, and the powers of the Internal Security

Council  were noted and placed on record in  simple

language as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) "The competence of the Singapore Government to

formulate   and  implement  the  policy   affecting

internal  security  is subject  to  the  overriding

powers of the Internal Security Council."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) "In addition to consultation and decisions on

questions of policy, the Internal Security  Council

is  competent to make executive decisions  for  the

maintenance of internal security in Singapore,  and

any  such  decision which has been communicated  to

the  Singapore  Government must be given  immediate

effect."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) "The Singapore Government is competent to

take  executive  action on  its  own  authority  in

matters  of  internal security. For its  part,  the

Internal  Security  Council is  competent  to  take

decisions in these same matters, and in so  far  as

it  does those decisions, by virtue of section  66,

paragraph (2), endorse, supplement or override  any

decisions which the Singapore Government may itself

have  taken and constitute binding directives  with

which  the subsequent decisions and actions of  the

Singapore Government must conform."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) "The Singapore Government should not take any

action  in  any  field which would be  contrary  to

policy  already  agreed by,  or  decisions  already

taken  by, the Council or would be likely to  raise

policy   issues,   or   would  have   repercussions

affecting   internal   security,   without    prior

reference to the Council."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Government has considered it

important that not only the constitutional but also

the  military and economic power positions  of  the

three  Governments participating  in  the  Internal

Security Council should be clearly recognised. This

power position prevails for this term of office  of

the  Government up till June 1964, and will not  be

changed  just  by  the United Kingdom  Commissioner

withdrawing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



from  the  office of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  on

the 3rd December, 1959. We have nothing to gain  by

trying to assume, as the last Government did to its

own  destruction, powers and responsibilities which

were  not properly within its province. But at  the

same  time such powers and responsibilities as  are

within  our competence, we shall discharge  to  the

fullest in the interests of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agreed to the provisions for an Internal

Security   Council   in  June  1957,   giving   the

Federation  Government  representative  a  deciding

vote on our Security Council, because we recognised

that  that  was  better  than  giving  the  British

Government the decisive say and that, in  fact,  if

we  achieved independence we can only do  so  as  a

Member  State of the Federation, in which case  the

Federation  Government would have a decisive  voice

in  our national policies anyway. Therefore,  until

independence through merger is achieved, we  accept

the position of the Federation Government having  a

deciding vote in the Internal Security Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But apart from the constitutional position, it

might  be useful to remember also the military  and

economic positions of the State of Singapore vis-a-vis  the  British  Government  and  the  Federation

Government. We have the doubtful honour  of  having

the  largest  and  most important British  military

base  East  of  Cyprus. The British Government  has

also a defence pact with the Federation Government.

In   effect,  this  means  that,  to  succeed,  the

Communist challenge for supremacy would have to  be

strong enough to subdue both the armed might of the

Federation  and  the British, because  in  military

terms  a  Communist Singapore would not be possible

until  there  is a Communist Malaya.  No  Communist

Party  can  hope to capture power in Singapore  and

continue  to  exist,  unless there  was  already  a

Communist Government in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is so simple an analysis that it is not

worth further argument or discussion. The fact that

the  tactics of the Communist Party of Malaya  have

shifted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



their  emphasis from armed struggle to  penetration

and  subversion does not alter the validity of  the

above analysis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the economic power position is not so easily

discernible    and    requires    more    elaborate

explanation.  For  the last 140  years  of  British

rule,  whatever the constitutional niceties of  the

Colonies  in the Straits Settlements, the Federated

Malay  States  and  the Unfederated  Malay  States,

Malaya  was in fact one economic unit, administered

as  such by one civil administration manned by  the

Malayan Civil Service. Now, since independence,  we

have  watched with concern the growing tendency  to

separate the economy. A fact worth noting  is  that

in  both  the  Federation and Singapore,  the  same

British trading interests have investments.  It  is

obviously  in the interest of not only the  British

but also of Malaya to remain as one economy. But if

for  political reasons the position cannot be  held

in the immediate future, then we run grave risks of

having  the  British and the Federation Governments

settling  such political differences  that  we  may

have from time to time through economic instead  of

political action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, we have considered it important

at   the   outset  of  our  discussions  with   the

Federation to make it unmistakably clear  that  our

hope is to co-operate and not to compete with them,

particularly in the economic and social fields. But

to  avoid  any misunderstanding, we have deemed  it

important  that we should not mislead  by  word  or

conduct our British overlord, or anyone else,  into

believing that the Singapore Government can be made

into a stooge government. We shall do everything in

our  power to work for the interests of the  people

of  Malaya.  These  interests demand  the  ultimate

reunification  of  the  two  territories,  but  co-operation  must  be on the basis of mutual  respect

and  adherence  to  certain  principles  agreed  to

beforehand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence it was necessary to clarify the difference

in  approaches to security problems between a  non-Communist  Socialist Singapore  Government  and  an

anti-Communist Federation Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation Government stressed their different

position, particularly as a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



result  of  a militant Communist insurrection.  The

Singapore   Government  has  stated  the  following

principles by which it would be guided on  security

problems:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The Singapore Government shall not act as a

buffer  to protect pro-Communist Party forces

against the Federation Government. These pro-Communist Party forces, some originally  from

the  Federation and some from Singapore,  who

are  hoping  to use Singapore as a  refitting

base  for  their struggle in the  Federation,

must take the consequences of their actions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) That it is the duty of the Singapore

Government to defend in Singapore the  rights

of  left-wing non-Communist Party forces  and

to  encourage their growth. It is the  P.A.P.

Government's   view   that   the   democratic

socialist     is    the    most     effective

countervailing  force in the labour  movement

in  this  country,  and that  our  policy  is

designed  to aid the growth of the democratic

socialist  and  not a Communist  trade  union

movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) That while the Singapore Government shall

by  social, economic and political  policies,

negate  the  Communist claim  that  only  the

Communists   can  resolve  the   social   and

economic injustices in our society, it  would

in  the meantime prevent the security of  the

democratic state from being undermined by the

Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having made our stand on principle, we

discussed the question of some 30 odd detainees who

were  arrested  by the previous government  in  two

purges - in October 1956 and September 1957.  On  the

22nd  May,  1959, during the election  campaign,  I

stated  that  "The  P.A.P. would  not  take  office

unless  former  members  of  the  Party  who   were

intimately  connected  with the  Central  Executive

Committee and who are now in jail are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



released."  This  pledge we have  fulfilled.  Eight

P.A.P. members all those intimately connected  with

the  leadership of the Party were released  at  our

insistence on the 4th June before we assumed office

on  5th  June.  On the 1st June, 1959,  immediately

after   the   elections  and  before  forming   the

Government, my Party's Secretary-General,  now  the

Prime  Minister, stated that: "The  record  of  the

other  detainees will be reviewed and justice  done

on  the merits of each case." At present we do  not

know the full facts leading to their detention. The

P.A.P. does not intend to be or even appear  to  be

the hand-maid of the Communist Party. But we do not

intend  to  soil our hands by putting them  in  the

same  gloves  once used by the previous Government.

That is still our stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We took a lenient line and released four detainees

on  the  22nd day of June, 1959. Immediately  after

that,  the Internal Security Council joined in  the

review  of  all cases. On the 1st day  of  October,

1959,  after  prior consideration by  the  Internal

Security   Council,  four  women   detainees   were

released. The work of the Internal Security Council

of  reviewing the other cases is still  proceeding.

But  let  us  make it clear to all  concerned  that

whilst  we  do not wish to be in any way associated

with   the   purge  carried  out  by  the  previous

Government,  we shall be less inhibited  in  taking

our own steps to ensure that there is no recurrence

of pro-Communist Party activities. Those who embark

on such activities do so at their own risk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a convenient time for us to say that

the  Internal Security Council is vigilant  and  on

the watchout for any re-appearance of pro-Communist

activists  in  rural organisations,  trade  unions,

student  groups  and  all the other  societies  and

associations  which  were  formerly  exploited  for

united front purposes. All we wish to say at  this

stage  is  that ill-advised activists should  learn

the lessons of 1956 and 1957. It is our business to

look  after  the  welfare  and  well-being  of  the

people.  We  have  no intention to  jeopardise  the

welfare of the people as a whole for the benefit of

a small group whose cause we consider mistaken. Let

them ponder on the things we have said



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



and the many more things that we have left unsaid,

and desist from the folly of trying to use

Singapore as a refitting base of a struggle for

supremacy in the Federation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill handed in to the Clerk

<div align="center"><b>Second Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Party's stand on emergency powers for the

Government was stated on the 8th October last year,

when the last Assembly debated an amendment to  the

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance extending

its life for another year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time we made our stand in this House, we

envisaged a situation when in October 1959 we would

be responsible for the Government, and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



Bill  would either lapse or come up for  a  further

extension. It was with circumspection that  we  set

out  the principles which guided us, and which  led

us  to  the  conclusion that as long as  there  are

Emergency  laws in the Federation,  there  will  be

Emergency laws in Singapore. But for the benefit of

Members  who  were  not in this House  on  the  8th

October  last year, may I refer them to  Volume  3,

No.  9  of  the Hansard, column 800 for my  speech,

column  815  for  the speech of my  colleague,  the

present Minister for Health, and column 819 for the

speech of my colleague, the Member for Tampines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I read a few passages out of the speech I

made on that occasion? The beginning of column 803:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, there may be people - I am quite sure that

there  may be some in important positions not  only

in  Singapore but across the Causeway - who may  want

to  know what the People's Action Party propose  to

do in the next elections. Is it going to repeat the

same  anti-Emergency Regulations stand? Is it going

to make this an election issue, and then having won

the   elections  seek  to  abolish  the   Emergency

Regulations and precipitate a crisis? Under  normal

conditions,  Sir,  I  would  tell  such  nosey  and

curious people to wait for the proper time  in  the

next  few  months  when  we shall  be  issuing  our

election   manifesto.  But  it  may  be  that   the

Federation  of  Malaya  would  like  to  know   its

position vis a vis Singapore after the next general

elections, because the Federation of Malaya has  to

be  represented  on our Internal  Security  Council

under the new Constitution. In fact, it is to  have

the  decisive  vote.  What is to  happen  to  these

Emergency  laws  is  a matter of some  considerable

importance  to  them, because  there  are  now  two

political situations; one in the Federation and one

in  Singapore, both distinct and separate and self-contained with a cordon sanitaire in the Straits of

Johore.  And they would like to know whether  there

is  going  to  be  a crisis immediately  after  the

general elections, with an emergency meeting of the

Internal  Security Council summoned by the  British

to   oppose  any  intended  moves  to  abolish  the

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance. In  such

a  situation, the Federation may find themselves in

the  embarrassing position of (1) voting with  the

British  against the Singapore representatives;  or

(2)  voting  with the Singapore representatives  to

abolish  the  Emergency  laws  which  they  in  the

Federation still consider necessary."



<br><br>May I then take Members to column 804?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As a Party of the "Left", we may not always agree

or see eye to eye with a Party



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>



of  the  "Right", as the Tunku has once called  the

United  Malay Nationalist Organisation. But we  can

assure  them  that their views and susceptibilities

will be given the most careful consideration by us.

We  state  our  stand now on the quest  on  of  the

Emergency  laws, and it is this: that  as  long  as

they  are  necessary  for the  maintenance  of  the

security  of the Federation, so long will  they  be

necessary for Singapore. Sir, we state this now  in

the full knowledge and anticipation that there will

be  political bankrupts and charlatans,  those  who

have, and those who have not ever graced the chairs

of this Assembly, who will make promises to abolish

them  in the next elections. We have met such types

before,  and  we expect to meet them  in  the  next

elections.  When that time comes, we shall  justify

out  view  and  our stand, that there  will  be  no

abolition of the Emergency laws in Singapore  until

they  have been abolished in the Federation.  Those

who  want the Emergency laws abolished in Singapore

should try to help to establish conditions of peace

and security in the Federation so that they may  no

longer be required there."



<br><br>And again in column 807:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we also wish to say that the use of these

Emergency  powers  depends upon the  stand  of  the

persons  who are equipped with them, and  we  stand

for   an   independent,  democratic,  non-Communist

Malaya. Within this democratic system, everyone has

the  right  to  compete, to  preach  his  political

views,  but the competition must be for the purpose

of  working the system, not of destroying it. These

powers  will  not  be allowed to  be  used  against

political  opponents within the system who  compete

for   the  right  to  work  the  system.  That   is

fundamental  and  basic, or the  powers  will  have

destroyed  the purpose for which they were  forged.

If  in using these powers you, in fact, negate  the

purpose for which you made them, then you will  end

up  with  a situation where force, and more  force,

will become increasingly necessary."



<br><br>May I pass on to column 810?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let this also be made known, that our definition

of the word "subversion" is probably different from

the British definition of that term, and maybe even

from   the   Labour   Front  definition   of   that

term - "subversion".  In our definition  "subversion"

is  any political activity designed to further  the

aims  and  interests not of our own people  but  of

foreign  powers; and by foreign powers we mean  not

just  Russia  and  China,  but  also  America   and

Formosa, and the Western bloc."



<br><br>And we went on to say on that occasion:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We in the People's Action Party would prefer to

lose  an  election  rather than  win  it  on  false

premises and promises."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I proceed to deal with the amendments

which  this  Bill seeks to make, may I  remind  the

Right  that  our antipathy to local  or  expatriate

agents,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>



who  subordinate  the interests of  the  people  of

Singapore to foreign power interests, is as  strong

now  as  it  was  when we were the Opposition?  Lip

service  docility  will not hide  their  malevolent

intentions to see that the Left Wing Government  in

Singapore does not succeed to the detriment of  the

interests of the Right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really unnecessary for me to elaborate on

the  reasons  for  this Bill. But  there  are  some

changes  about  which  Members  may  wish   to   be

informed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, clause 5 of the Bill repeals section 5 of

the  present Ordinance which provides for an Appeal

Tribunal   consisting   of   three   judges,    and

substitutes  in  its  place the  original  position

obtaining  under the Emergency laws,  that  is,  an

advisory committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September this year, I had discussions with the

present  Chief Justice about the functions  of  the

judiciary under the Preservation of Public Security

Ordinance, which is due to lapse later this  month.

The  position is that the judges have been  unhappy

over   their  duties  under  section   6   of   the

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance and  have

indicated  that they would like to be  relieved  of

their executive responsibilities under that section

and act only in an advisory capacity. Sir, this  is

not  something new. In 1955, when the former  Chief

Minister,  Mr David Saul Marshall, had to  deceive

the people into believing that he had abolished the

Emergency  Regulations, as he promised  to  in  the

last   elections,   by  replacing   it   with   the

Preservation  of  Public  Security  Ordinance,   he

obtained the consent of the then Chief Justice, Sir

Charles  Murray-Aynsley, to  allow  the  judges  to

serve  on  an executive appeal tribunal.  When  Sir

Charles  retired and Sir John Whyatt succeeded  him

as  Chief  Justice, protests were made to the  then

Government about the improper use of the  judiciary

under   the   Preservation   of   Public   Security

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 1958, one month before the Ordinance

was  due  to expire, or come up for extension,  the

then  Chief Minister wrote to the then Acting Chief

Justice,  Mr Tan Ah Tah, asking him  to  agree  to

allow the judges to continue for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>



one  more year under the P.P.S.O. The Acting  Chief

Justice replied in these terms:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My brother judges and I are all of the opinion

that it is extremely undesirable for members of the

judiciary  to constitute the Appeal Tribunal  under

the  Preservation  of Public Security  Ordinance...we

think it was a mistake to have caused the judiciary

to  be  associated with the work of  the  tribunal.

However,  in  view of the reasons for extension  of

the  life  of the Ordinance set out in your  letter

and  more  particularly in view of  your  assurance

that  the judiciary will not be called upon  to  do

this  work  for  more than one  further  year,  the

judges who constitute the tribunal have agreed with

great reluctance to continue to serve as members of

the tribunal."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these letters are on record and leaders of

the  Opposition who constituted the last Government

are  fully aware of their contents and of the  real

position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we state that on principle it is wrong to use

the  judges in this way. First, by the very  nature

of the tribunal the judges are not presented with a

justiciable  issue.  They are  not  presented  with

issues either of fact or of law and asked to decide

on  the  evidence adduced before them according  to

the  Evidence Ordinance. They have either to accept

or  reject the Government's intelligence reports on

a   particular  person.  If  they  agree  with  the

decisions of the Executive in all cases, then  they

become  a rubber stamp for the Executive.  If  they

reject  the intelligence reports so received,  then

they   will   have  to  be  responsible   for   the

consequences it may bring about on the security  of

the  State.  The net result has been that,  in  the

vast   majority   of  cases,  they  have   accepted

Government intelligence reports. But now and  again

they have allowed a few appeals. This they must  do

unless they are to be obvious rubber stamps for the

Executive.   This  position  they  have  considered

unsatisfactory and, in fact, it demeans their  high

office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, on principle, the responsibility for the

detention   or   otherwise  of   a   person   under

extraordinary powers such as these cannot rest with

the  judiciary.  An  Executive  which  shifts  this

responsibility  to  the judges by  asking  them  to

superimpose their judicial stamp



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



on   an   Executive   decision  is   shirking   its

responsibility  and  abusing  the   judiciary.   On

principle,  it is not the duty of the judiciary  to

act  as administrative or executive officers of the

Government,  nor  are  they  properly  equipped  to

discharge   such   functions.  In   all   civilised

countries  the responsibility for the  security  of

the  State  rests with the elected government,  not

the  judges of the State. In Singapore, our's is  a

special  position, as the Leader of the House,  the

Deputy  Prime  Minister, has  stated - that  ultimate

power  rests not with the Singapore Government  but

with   the  Internal  Security  Council,  on  which

Singapore  has  three out of seven representatives.

Therefore,  in  the last analysis, let  us  clearly

understand  that these extraordinary  powers  under

the  P.P.S.O. are  vested  not  in  the  Singapore

Government  but in the Security Council.  Certainly

they are not vested in our judiciary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other amendment set out in clause 3 of

the  Bill  is  intended to give the  Minister  more

flexibility in the exercise of these powers.  Under

the  present law restrictions can only  be  imposed

after  a person has been detained. A man must first

be   detained   before  he  can  be   released   on

conditions.  Under clause 3 of the Bill,  a  person

can be placed on conditions without first having to

have  him  detained.  This will  avoid  unnecessary

detentions.  Also  for the same purpose,  to  avoid

having to detain more people than is necessary, the

powers  of  restrictions have now  been  made  more

flexible  to  allow a wider field  of  cases  where

conditions  can be imposed on a person  allowed  to

remain  outside, instead of keeping  him  inside  a

place of detention. Hence clause 3, which sets  out

that  restrictions  can be specified  not  only  in

respect  of  residence but also  of  employment  or

activities.  These, Mr Speaker, Sir, are  the  two

principal amendments that the Bill seeks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me be the first to remind this House that

the  final answer to the Communist challenge is not

provided  by  this type of legislation  giving  the

Executive   Emergency   or  extraordinary   powers.

Finally   it  is  the  economic,  the  social   and

political conditions and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



battles   on  these  fields  that  decide   whether

Singapore,  and  indeed  Malaya,  will  grow   from

strength to strength as a democratic State in which

the  more  tolerant features of human  civilization

are   preserved,  whilst  the  economic  needs  and

necessities  of the people are adequately  met;  or

whether  a  totalitarian system  will  succeed  the

democratic  State  and  cater  for  these  economic

needs.  These powers can only provide  a  temporary

damper  against  those who set  out  to  wreck  the

democratic State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principles which guide this Government in the

exercise  of its primary functions as a  Government

have  been enumerated by the Deputy Prime Minister.

I  would  like  to harken back to what  I  said  on

behalf of my Party last year:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Within this democratic system, everyone has the

right  to  compete, to preach his political  views,

but  the  competition must be for  the  purpose  of

working  the  system, not of destroying  it.  These

powers  will  not  be allowed to  be  used  against

political  opponents within the system  to  compete

for   the  right  to  work  the  system.  That   is

fundamental  and  basic, for the powers  will  have

destroyed the purpose for which they were forged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time we state quite categorically that

we  believe in the democratic system, that we  will

allow   full   competition  within  the  democratic

system,   but  competition  for  the   purpose   of

destroying the democratic system will be resisted."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Ong Eng Guan):</b> Mr Speaker, we meet here today to discuss

the  P.P.S.O. in  a political situation  which  my

Party  had envisaged as early as October 1958.  The

stand of the People's Action Party taken before the

General Elections as stated in October 1958 in this

Assembly was as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is because this is a fundamental issue that I

have  a  mandate  from my Party to  state  now  our

future  position. If it were the British Government

in  control of the Federation of Malaya, as it  was

three   years  ago,  we  would  still  oppose   the

Emergency laws as vehemently as we did three  years

ago,  because then the Emergency laws could be used

and  were  sometimes used, not  only  to  curb  the

Communists,   but   also  to  curb   the   militant

Nationalists.  It was a simple issue  then  of  the

people  versus British imperialism, and  we  stated

unequivocally where we stood.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we were asked to vote for these laws

three years ago, we opposed them, for the centre of

the  Government  in  the Federation  was  the  High

Commissioner  and his nominated officials,  and  in

Singapore  it  was then, and now is still,  in  the

triumvirate of the three official Ministers  headed

by  the Governor with over-riding powers. These are

men  who  are  not answerable to the people.  Their

masters are not in Singapore but in London. In that

situation, we allied ourselves with all  the  anti-colonial  forces to fight colonialism and  we  will

continue  to  do  so  until the  last  vestiges  of

colonial rule are removed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, however -".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I remind the Minister that

we are having interpretation? And I think the

interpreters are having a bit of trouble. The

Minister is going a bit too fast.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I continue:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But now, however, partly as a result of scheming

by  the  British  Raj  and partly  because  of  the

accidents of history, we are faced with a  separate

and  independent  Federation  of  Malaya  with   no

prospects  in the immediate future of our  becoming

independent.  Next  year,  we  are   to   be   only

internally  self-governing,  and  in  all  security

matters   which  affect  defence  upon  which   the

Singapore and the British Governments disagree, the

Federation  Government is to  be  the  arbiter.  We

accepted  that position because we accepted  merger

as the only way to independence. If we are prepared

to  accept the Federation and join it as  a  member

state, then it means that we are prepared to allow

the  Government representing the 11 States  in  the

Federation to have a decisive voice in the  affairs

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is still our position and it will be our

position  for  all the years to come until  merger.

This   is  the  basic  analysis  of  our  political

situation.  If  that  analysis  is  correct,   then

certain   logical  consequences  follow.  We   must

recognise that our over-riding objective is merger

and  that means that we must acknowledge that until

merger  the over-riding interests of the Federation

must prevail over Singapore. Therefore, we say that

if we are the Government of Singapore, we will take

no  steps which will undermine the interests of the

Federation. We state our stand now on the  question

of the Emergency laws, and it is this: that as long

as  they are necessary for the maintenance  of  the

security  of the Federation, so long will  they  be

necessary for Singapore"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are now taking the same stand on the extension of the life of the P.P.S.O. as we had

openly stateed in this Assembly before the People's

Action Party became the Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>



It   is  being  fully  recognised,  under  the  new

Constitution  granted to Singapore by  the  British

masters, that the decisive say in internal security

in this Island is the Internal Security Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the amendment of the Appeal Tribunal, not only

is  the  position of the Judges untenable  but  the

amendment  would bring more into line the  existing

differences between the Emergency laws of  the  two

countries. Mr Speaker, I support the Bill moved by

the Prime Minister.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we

are  glad  to  receive  from  the  Hon. the  Prime

Minister  certain assurances: firstly, that  within

the  democratic system we should compete  to  build

and  not to destroy; secondly, that so long as  the

Federation finds it necessary to have an  Ordinance

like this one then Singapore must have it too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having stated our points of agreement, Sir, we

have also to state that on certain points we do not

quite  see eye to eye. Firstly, it seems  to  be  a

growing practice for the Government to rush through

very  important  Bills  at very  short  notice  and

through  all  the  three stages,  thus  giving  the

public  no  chance to weigh the pros and cons.  The

essence  of  democracy is to enable the  public  to

have  a  share in the government of the country  by

being  given time to think on the coming Bills  and

by    expressing   their   views   through    their

representatives.  Sir,  we would  request  that  in

future where possible - we know that at times it  may

not be possible - Bills should not be rushed through,

and longer notice should be given to the public and

to Assemblymen. I would suggest that where possible

there  should be a time lapse of at least one  week

to  ten  days between the publication of a Bill  in

the Gazette and the debate on it in the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I think none of us - not even those on the

Government  side - would like to live  in  a  country

where  there is an Ordinance like this one  forever

in   force.  We  know  that  under  this  Ordinance

citizens' liberties are curtailed. They do not feel

that they are free as they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



should  be.  There is always the fear that  through

some   error   or  through  some  wrong  complaint,

somebody might be taken in by the Police and locked

up  for  an indefinite period. I have always  quite

appreciated  the  position that Singapore  and  the

Federation  of  Malaya  are going  through  a  very

unusual  period and that there is a secret struggle

going on underground, and therefore it is necessary

for  an  Ordinance like this one  to  be  still  in

existence. At the same time, we on this  side  feel

strongly  that  despite any practical difficulties,

there must be a right of appeal to prevent acts  of

injustice.  Therefore, we feel that if  the  Appeal

Tribunal  is  abolished,  then  that  would  be   a

retrograde step for this country. It could be  said

that an Advisory Committee would be able to perform

the  same functions. Sir, we do not think that this

is  possible  because, when the Advisory  Committee

have  made  their decisions and the detainees  have

been  sentenced, where a victim feels  that  he  is

innocent, he still has no right of appeal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point to remember - that there are

usually  one  judge  and  two  appointees  on   the

Advisory  Committee.  Now  we  know  that  the  two

appointees,  who  are not legally trained,  may  be

swayed by other feelings, and injustice may be the

result. At this point, I wish to refer to something

not quite pleasant which I might have hesitated  to

mention  but for the fact that people feel  that  I

should  mention it here. We have noticed a tendency

on  the  part  of  the - Government  that  when  they

appoint a Committee, a Board or a Commission,  they

appoint mostly - sometimes all - members of their  own

Party.  We note that in the list of members of  the

Rent Conciliation Board practically all are members

of  the  Government Party. Sir, to  be  democratic,

there  must be opportunities for minority or  other

views  to  be  expressed,  otherwise  we  run   our

Government  along  a  one-track  line.  It  is  the

essence  of  democracy, Sir,  that  the  rights  of

minorities must be preserved, otherwise it  becomes

just  a  one-Party  Government,  and  democracy  as

practised  would be a Government of one  Party,  by

one  Party  and for one Party; whereas  we  believe

that democracy in essence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



means  a  Government of the people, by the people's

representatives and for all the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we feel that although we do not oppose

this  amending  Bill in principle,  we  oppose  the

abolition of the provision for an Appeal Tribunal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You oppose the judges.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Well, Sir, I say this: it is a

case of whether we want to preserve for the man who

is  detained  the  right of  appeal.  A  democratic

system  allows an appeal, otherwise  it  becomes  a

totalitarian system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are some of our views and I believe

that  before  the  Bar  of  world  opinion,  it  is

necessary to provide ways and means for an appeal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has the power and the numbers

to  override all objections but we trust  that,  in

the  interest of Singapore, we present to the world

the  view that we are running a democratic  system,

and  that  nobody will be sent to gaol without  the

right  of appeal. I beg of the Government therefore

that they will try and preserve the right of appeal

in the amending Bill.



<br><br>3.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It is accepted, Mr Speaker, Sir, that

it  is  necessary  in  the existing  conditions  in

Malaya that such an Ordinance as this is necessary.

There  rare  three main ponits to which  this  Bill

gives rise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, is there a necessity for this Ordinance to

be  extended? The second point is: For how long  is

it to be extended? And thirdly, and by no means the

least,  the question of the abolition of the Appeal

Tribunal  and the substitution therefor of Advisory

Committees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first two points - that is, the necessity

for  the  extension of the life of this  Ordinance,

and  the  number of years in respect of  which  the

extension is necessary - there is unanimity  on  this

side  of the House and on the Government side. But,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, there is a difference of opinion

on the question of whether, in the existing context

of public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>



opinion  and public reaction to Ordinances such  as

this,  it  is  wise to change the  Appeal  Tribunal

which has functioned successfully - I presume for the

last four years - to Advisory Committees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, I admit, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

necessary to deprive human liberties arbitrarily in

the  overall interests of the preservation  of  the

State, but in our concept of Government, that is, a

democratic  form of Government, the  liberty  of  a

person  is  such  a precious thing  that  where  it

becomes  necessary  to  deprive  a  person  of  his

liberty,   then   there   must   be   corresponding

provisions which will ensure, as far as is  humanly

possible,  that the person detained or  the  person

who  has  been deprived of his liberty,  can  avail

himself of for the purpose of defending himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one point on which every citizen in Singapore

is  agreed  is  the  absolute impartiality  of  our

Judges.  It  is  a good thing that  the  public  of

Singapore have such faith in our Judges.  Once  the

faith   in  our  Judges  is  destroyed,  then   the

fundamental   basis  of  the  rule  of   law   will

disappear.  However, we are now  in  the  fortunate

position that our Judiciary is held in high  esteem

by  the  public  of  Singapore. If  the  Government

should  at  this  stage,  after  four  years  of  a

judicial  Tribunal  listening  to  the  appeals  of

detained  persons,  change it suddenly  to  one  of

Advisory   Committees  and  place  this   political

prisoner - if   I   may  use  the  words   "political

prisoner", Mr Speaker, Sir - in the same position as

a  thug,  then I think there is something radically

wrong.  Under our existing law, the Appeal Tribunal

consists  of two High Court Judges and  a  District

Court Judge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two points raised in support of this issue are

as   follows.  First,  that  the  Judges  find   it

embarrassing  to  sit  in judgment  over  executive

actions of Ministers. The second point is that such

judgments have to be formed by the Judges  on  data

which  they  themselves  do not  consider  judicial

evidence. I cannot appreciate the first point,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, because very often in such  a  legal

system  as ours, Judges are called upon to  sit  in

judgment  over the executive actions of  Ministers.

The  rule  of  law  is the final control  over  the

illegal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



acts  of  Ministers, and very often Judges  of  the

High  Court  are, in fact, called upon  to  sit  in

judgment   over   executive  decisions   taken   by

Ministers.  So  the first point, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

does  not appeal to me. The second point is a  more

valid  one  in  that Judges are given  evidence  or

statements which they normally would not accept  in

their  Courts. I accept the statement of  the  Hon.

the  Prime Minister that this is a weakness in  the

system and our Judges should not normally be called

upon  to  adjudicate on such evidence; but I  would

appeal  to  him  to suggest to the  Judges  of  the

Supreme  Court that the situation in  Singapore  is

such that only the Judges themselves can adequately

satisfy the members of the public that no injustice

would be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is proposed by this amending

Bill   to   appoint  as  Chairman  of  an  Advisory

Committee a person who has seven years' standing as

a  lawyer  in this country and two others  who  are

either laymen or lawyers to sit with him. Recently.

Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  been   treated   to

appointments  made  by  the present  Government  to

judicial or semi-judicial Committees of persons who

are openly and blatantly Party men. In the context

of  other  appointments, this Bill would  not  have

received  the  opposition that it is receiving  but

for  this.  When  one  sees,  from  time  to  time,

appointments    to   judicial   or    semi-judicial

Committees  being made of persons who  are  openly,

publicly and blatantly Party men, then one does get

a  bit nervous as to who would be Chairmen of these

Advisory  Committees. It is an undoubted fact  that

if  a person of legal standing is appointed and two

laymen  are  appointed to sit with  him,  then  the

tendency is for the two laymen to accept the advice

of the Chairman, and if the Chairman is an out-and-out  Party man, then surely, Sir, the faith in that

Committee is destroyed.



<br><br>3.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, concerning this Bill which is

to  amend the P.P.S.O., we are of the opinion  that

in principle the old Ordinance is good. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



do  not  deny  the good intentions of  the  present

Government in wanting to co-operate in many aspects

with  the  Government of the Federation of  Malaya,

particularly  in  the  matter of  annihilating  the

Communists  in  the Federation or  suppressing  the

remnants  of  Communism  in  Singapore.  But,   Mr

Speaker, Sir, the strange thing which I would  like

to  emphasise is this. If I were to relate a  story

concerning this Public Security Bill, it would be a

long  story, which has its background not  only  in

our  organisation, the U.M.N.O., but also in others

who had voiced their protest against this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, U.M.N.O. was a Member of the

Coalition  Government, and although U.M.N.O. youth

had  opposed it vehemently in principle, this Bill,

however,  was eventually agreed to by  U.M.N.O.  We

too suffered as a result, because at that time some

of  my colleagues became victims of this Ordinance.

Therefore, on that basis, we are apprehensive about

this  Bill, because, even when U.M.N.O. was in  the

Coalition Government, it could not prevent our  own

members   from  being  victims  of  the  Ordinance.

However,   because  of  our  demands  and  appeals,

particularly  from U.M.N.O. youth and its  branches

in  the  Federation and Singapore,  we  managed  to

settle  the matter concerning this P.P.S.O.,  which

was passed by the previous government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, this amending Bill today,

in  the  opinion  of U.M.N.O., is not  fit  and  we

cannot   accept  the  substitution  of  the  Appeal

Tribunal for an Advisory Committee. There are  many

matters  contained  in the Bill  which  we  oppose.

Today, we have a Government elected by the majority

of  the  people,  and therefore we,  the  U.M.N.O.,

cannot  carry  out fully the wishes of  the  people

from  the  point  of view of the Internal  Security

Council, in line with the Federation of Malaya. But

we must remember that doubts or anything which will

undermine  the peace of Singapore cannot  certainly

be  overcome  by  the Government  alone.  For  this

reason, U.M.N.O. considers that the substitution of

the Appeal Tribunal for an Advisory Committee is to

monopolise the powers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



or  to diminish the hopes of the detainees. It  may

well  be  that the detained persons are victims  of

cases  without  thorough  investigation.  So  these

victims  will  have no opportunity to pursue  their

struggle in a democratic institution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if we want to follow truly the steps of the Federation of Malaya, I cannot deny that on

principle this is not of benefit to the Federation.

But  there  are many big matters which I think  can

suit  the Federation of Malaya Government and which

can be put into effect if the Government wishes  to

do  so. We of U.M.N.O. are of the opinion that  the

Judges  in  Singapore are held in high  esteem  and

unbiased  in  carrying out their  duties  from  the

legal point of view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in the circumstances, Mr Speaker, we

cannot  accept but we oppose the amending  Bill  in

respect of section 5 which seeks to substitute  the

Appeal Tribunal for an Advisory Committee.



<br><br>3.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Tanglin has just

returned  from  a lengthy sojourn in very  pleasant

surroundings  in Switzerland, and he can  therefore

be  excused for having lost track of events in this

country.  Mr Speaker, Sir, he has complained  that

we have introduced this legislation in haste, but I

would like to remind him that the present Ordinance

expires  on the 20th of this month, and it  is  for

this  reason that we have to rush through this Bill

in the Legislative Assembly this afternoon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Members of the Opposition

profess  to  be great democrats. They profess  that

they  adhere  very staunchly to the tenets  of  the

democratic tradition. Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, I want

to put a question to them here. Do you believe-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister must remember

that  he  is  addressing the Chair,  and  therefore

questions can only be put through the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must apologise for

that lapse. Mr Speaker,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  I would ask hon. Members opposite a question.

Do they now believe in the principles of democracy?

Do  they believe in the independence of our Judges?

Do  they believe in that principle at all? If  they

do, why do they ask that this Appellate Tribunal be

retained?  Have  they  not  heard  what  our  Prime

Minister  has  just said? Have they not  heard  him

read out extracts of letters which our Judges wrote

to  the Executive complaining that it is unfair and

improper to put them in a position where they would

have   to   make   orders  either   validating   or

invalidating the actions of the Executive?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, some of the Opposition Members

and the people who are closely associated with them

believe  in moral rearmament, but many of them  are

wont to be moral cowards!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order! I think I must overrule the

words "moral cowards" with reference to Members  of

the Assembly. Will the Minister please withdraw the

expression?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I withdraw. But, Mr Speaker, Sir, they

are  always looking for some sort of a screen. They

must  try  to hide behind a screen. That  was  what

the  last government did. They picked some  people

up  under  these powers and took them into custody.

Then  they  turned  round and  said  to  the  chap,

"Sorry, chum! We picked you up; it is  true.  But

you  know,  the  fact  that  you  are  still  under

detention  is  really  not our responsibility.  You

failed to make out a case for your release. It  was

the Judges who decided your fate." That is the sort

of  thing  that they wanted. They always wanted  to

screen  themselves behind others. We are  not  like

that. We accept responsibility for everything  that

we do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if it is so that in the exercise of these

powers  we have to pick up people and keep them  in

custody  for  a  temporary period, we  will  accept

responsibility for those decisions. We do not  want

to  pass  the buck to others. Mr Speaker, Sir,  we

know our responsibilities. Our responsibilities are

to  the  people  who  put us  in  this  Legislative

Assembly. We know that if we abuse those powers, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



will have to face them and explain the position  at

the end of our term of office. That is the position

that  we accept, and it is on those principles that

we act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Opposition are great at

adopting  a  very negative role in  this  Assembly.

They  are  only here to criticise us,  to  try  and

smear us, and to try and suggest that we do not act

democratically. We have an Opposition not  only  in

this  Assembly,  but  also an  opposition  outside.

There is a former Chief Minister who appears to  be

terrified   at   the  legislation   that   we   are

introducing  today. He has sent  to  all  of  us  a

circular  letter telling us that the whole  of  our

democratic  traditions is in great peril.  He  says

that  it  is  our  intention to pack  the  Advisory

Committee  with  P.A.P. stooges  and  with  a  very

subservient  Chairman.  I  can  assure  Mr   David

Marshall   that   we  believe   in   democracy   as

passionately  as  he  does, and  it  is  never  our

intention  to place any P.A.P. stooge in  any  such

Advisory Committee. If I could make a suggestion to

Mr  David  Marshall - he  need  not  really  be   so

frightened  of the position as he says  he  is.  He

need  not  fear any P.A.P. imprisonment.  We  could

always  leave it to the course of nature to operate

in  his  case, and in good time he might very  well

find  himself  a  refuge in  some  other  place  of

detention, not necessarily a P.A.P. prison.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in discussing the

Preservation of Public Security (Amendment) Bill, I

stand  here to clarify the attitude of U.M.N.O.  In

principle,  we  agree  to  the  extension  of   the

P.P.S.O. But what we of U.M.N.O. object to  is  the

replacing  of the Appeal Tribunal with an  Advisory

Committee.  In  my opinion, this replacement  would

result in a system or regulation by which those who

are  detained under this Ordinance will be deprived

of  their right of appeal, or of the right to  have

their cases reconsidered, and justice done to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister for Labour and Law has stated

just now that the Opposition



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>



is  here  only to criticise  or  condemn  the

Government,  as though what has been  expressed  by

the Opposition has been done out of spite or merely

to disrupt the functions of the Government. We have

on  numerous occasions stated here that the  object

of  the  Opposition is to put forward the views  of

the people of Singapore. It is therefore only right

that  our views and opinions should be put  forward

here  in this Assembly. It should never be imagined

that  all that we say or do can be accepted by each

and every one. It should never be imagined that our

way  of  life  can be adhered to by all.  For  that

reason,   we  should  give  thorough  and   careful

consideration  to  the merits or demerits  of  this

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, in exercising the powers under

the  Preservation  of  Public  Security  Ordinance,

should also provide an opportunity to those who are

detained    to   bring   up   their    cases    for

reconsideration, and to prove their  innocence.  If

no  such opportunity is given to them, surely  then

there will be no justice. Certainly it will be seen

from  the amendments put up by the Government  that

the Ordinance will be even more stringent than what

we  have today. This is clear and cannot be denied.

For  example, the old Ordinance looks  after  those

who have been released. With the amendments put  up

by   the  Government,  this  will  mean  that   the

Government  can supervise these suspected  persons.

This  has been in practice since the P.A.P. formed

the Government. It is also known that meetings have

been  curtailed,  which had never been  experienced

during  the  past Government. Is this  one  of  the

means  to curb the freedom of an association or  an

institution? Or is the Government always afraid  of

the  movements  and activities  of  the  people  of

Singapore?  It may well be so. We note that  people

are  now  always full of fear about their fate,  so

much  so  that  they have no place to  voice  their

grievances    or   criticisms   concerning    their

livelihood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the newspapers, we have seen a change of

outlook.  This  will be evident if we  compare  the

newspapers published during the previous regime and

those published during the present Government.  The

Government, of course, have stated that they do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>



agree   that  the  newspapers  should  voice  their

opinions  in  a  manner  which  will  lead  to  the

separation  of  Singapore and the  Federation.  But

there  is more to it than that, I think, which  has

resulted in the change of attitude adopted  by  the

newspapers, so that it is now different  from  what

it used to be in the past.



<br><br>4.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chew Chua):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

ask your permission to allow me to read part of  my

speech on 8th October of last year:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, my Party's attitude towards the Preservation

of Public Security Ordinance has always depended on

the answers to two questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question is: To whom are these

extraordinary powers being given? The second is: To

what use will these powers be put?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two questions, in fact, are inter-related. We

can  tell  from the nature of the persons  to  whom

these  powers  are given, how they will  use  these

extraordinary powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party has, in the past, attacked the

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance,  or  the

Emergency  Regulations as it  used  to  be  called,

because  we  know to whom these powers  were  being

given and to what use they would be put.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emergency Regulations, as you know. Sir, were

first promulgated by a colonial regime. It is  true

that the supporters of this regime claimed that the

Emergency  Regulations would be  used  to  preserve

democracy   against  armed  Communist  revolt   and

subversion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it may be that the colonial forces genuinely

believed  that  the  interests of  colonialism  and

democracy were identical. They were only  a  little

less virulent in their attacks on the anti-colonial

parties  than  they were in their  attacks  on  the

Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as a colonial regime and its journalistic

tools  were unable to distinguish between democracy

and  nationalism, it would have been folly to  have

agreed to extraordinary powers to such a regime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, the times have changed. Next year

Singapore is to have internal self-government -"



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think that by my

silence  I intended to give the hon. Member licence

to   read  the  speech  completely.  All  that  the

Standing  Order permits me to do is  to  allow  the

hon.  Member  to  read extracts.  He  seems  to  be

reading the whole speech. I do not think that is in

order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Sir, I was just about to finish

my reading, which seems to me rather important.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I assist the hon. Member

by  suggesting  that after reading an  extract,  he

interposes one or two words?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, it will be hard for a small territory

like Singapore to escape subversion once it becomes

self-governing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. therefore agree that extraordinary

powers   are   necessary  to  preserve   democracy,

provided  they  are in the hands  of  a  government

freely elected by the people."

Assembly  that  it  is because  the  P.A.P. had  a

For that reason, with this overwhelming victory, we

do not hesitate to say that we have received a full

mandate from the people to present the Bill  today.

This is in the interests of security and safety  of

the  people  of  Singapore as  a  whole.  For  that

reason, there should be no doubts from any quarters

about  the  Bill  which  we have  presented  today,

particularly with regard to the amendments  to  the

P.P.S.O.   We  have  repeatedly  said   that   only

undesirable  elements who are fighting for  foreign

countries need fear this Bill. So if there are some

sections  who voice their fears and doubts  in  the

Assembly,   it   would  appear   that   they   have

connections  with  them,  and  therefore  might  be

affected by the provisions under this P.P.S.O.  The

P.A.P. Government is ready to face anything in  the

interests  of peace and prosperity of  the  island.

Therefore, we will not hesitate to take any  action

against  undesirable elements when the time  comes.

We  do not wish to have the Government dubbed as an

irresponsible  Government by  taking  irresponsible

actions. But unfortunately, the Member who  at  one

time  used to be the Chief Minister in the previous

Government  is  not  present  today.  We  see  that

previously there had been occasions when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>



people were arrested and detained and later sent up

to  the Appeal Tribunal, where they were found  not

guilty and released, and were rewarded with a  mere

apology.  Therefore, I feel that such  a  state  of

affairs  showed  that many people were  victimised;

they were arrested and detained first, and released

later. I feel that because of this, we should  give

opportunities for the Minister first to review  and

investigate such a case and then to refer it to the

Advisory  Committee. By this means a fair and  just

line  of action will be taken. Thereby a case  will

not  arise,  as  it  were,  where  a  person  first

delivered  a thrust with his knife, then  threw  it

away, and then appealed as to whether he was guilty

or  innocent,  as to whether the thrust  was  well-delivered  or not. This, I feel, will  cause  grave

injustice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park stated that he was

concerned  about the members who will be  nominated

to  serve on the Advisory Committee. In the present

struggle,  I  would  like to emphasise,  it  seldom

happens  that  the  fight is  between  individuals.

Rather,  in the political climate today,  it  is  a

case  of  party against party. The action  that  my

Party is taking is in the name of the Party. If  my

Party is not sincere, it will be left to the people

to  decide.  Therefore, I say, this  Government  is

responsible  to the people. It may  be  that  among

members  of the Advisory Committee to be  appointed

later  there are Party Members; however,  the  fact

still  remains  that  we will  be  responsible  for

seeing that justice and fair play are carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan has chosen to

screen an old film by saying that when the P.P.S.O.

came up for debate for the second time the youth of

U.M.N.O. had raised their objections and opposed it

vehemently, whereas their State Committee and their

own representatives in the Government supported the

motion.  This is merely the showing of an old  film

depicting the dissensions in his own Party.  It  is

not proper here for me to say what had happened  at

that time-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Point of

explanation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the

Member  for  Bukit  Timah had  stated  that  I  was

attempting to show an old film. I hope that  if  he

wishes to reveal what had happened to Singapore for

the whole world to know, then let him do so.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): To that, I would say I

was  not  talking about U.M.N.O., but  it  was  the

Member for Kampong Kembangan himself who said  that

the U.M.N.O. youth had opposed this motion. So,  it

was he and not I who was screening the old film.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for the Southern Islands said that this Ordinance is more stringent than the

previous  one. I wish to emphasise that it  is,  in

fact,   more  drastic  only  to  those  undesirable

elements who indulge in activities which are in the

interests  of  foreign  States  and  not   in   the

interests  of  the  State of Singapore.  Therefore,

however  sharp the knife may be, if it is not  used

to  kill, I think we need not fear it. It  is  only

those  creatures for the slaughter-house  or  those

who  should be put to the dagger who need  fear.  I

think  that  those who are law-abiding  and  peace-loving with an undivided loyalty need not fear this

Bill, however stringent or drastic it may appear to

be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for the Southern Islands also stated

that  since  the P.A.P. Government came into  power

there  were  public meetings which were disallowed,

as though the Government was afraid of the people's

movements.  As  far as I know there  were  no  such

meetings which had been curbed or curtailed  except

when  the  Government  was forced  to  act  in  the

interests  of peace and security of the  people  of

Singapore.   I  fear  perhaps  there  are   certain

quarters who are playing behind the scenes to  make

use  of  such  meetings to disturb  the  peace  and

tranquillity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning newspaper publications the Member said

that they had changed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>



their  attitude or outlook. If I remember  rightly,

Mr  Speaker, since the P.A.P. came into power,  it

was  reported  that a representative of  the  World

Press Association had been in Singapore because the

freedom  of  the  Press  was  in  danger.  But  the

representative  had since returned to  England  and

had  said  on  his return that the freedom  of  the

Press was not restricted and there was no fear,  as

was  exaggerated by certain local newspapers.  This

shows  that  freedom of the Press in  Singapore  is

really  being  enjoyed, in the true  sense  of  the

word.  Concerning  the outlook  or  the  change  of

attitude  of  the  newspapers,  that  is  not   the

business  of the Government. It is the business  of

the  publishers. It is a matter for the  publishers

to  decide. I think, Mr Speaker, we therefore need

not  fear.  But as a fighter, we must  sharpen  our

knife,  not necessarily for the purpose of  killing

our  enemies,  but  at least for  self-defence  and

security  so that our family, and for that  matter,

the   whole  population  of  the  State,  will   be

defended.



<br><br>4.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  from what the Members of the Opposition  have

said two points are very clear, that we have agreed

with  the  Government that the  extension  of  this

Ordinance  is  necessary and that we are  glad  and

grateful  to the Prime Minister for the  assurances

that he has given us. But I feel that there are two

sections which need clarification, and I hope  that

the  Prime  Minister  in his  reply  would  clarify

these. In section 3 subsection (1) it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) If the Yang di-Pertuan Negara is satisfied

with  respect to any person that, with  a  view  to

preventing  that person from acting in  any  manner

prejudicial  to  the  security  of  Malaya  or  the

maintenance   of  public  order  therein   or   the

maintenance  therein of essential services,  it  is

necessary  so  to do, the Minister shall  by  order

under his hand make an order -".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask who satisfies the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara? Is it the Minister or the Security Council?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next one is section 5, subsection (3):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(3) Upon considering the recommendations of the

advisory  committee the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  may

give such directions, if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



any,  as he shall think fit regarding the order  or

direction made by the Minister."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara is the

constitutional head and, I believe, does  not  make

his  own decisions. He takes directives. May I  ask

again  who  will be giving him directions  in  this

respect to carry out this section? Will it again be

the  Minister  or  the Advisory  Committee  or  the

Security Council?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it appears it will not be the Advisory

Committee  because  the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  is

free  to treat the advice in whatever way he thinks

fit.  I  have  asked this question because  in  the

Singapore Constitution, section 65, paragraph  (b),

it-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must remind the hon. Member

that  we are now on the Second Reading which  deals

with  principles, and principles only. These points

which  the hon. Lady is raising could best be dealt

with in Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> I will raise them in

Committee.



<br><br>4.28 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, firstly, I rise to support

the  Bill  which is now under discussion. Before  I

elaborate  on  this  Bill  and  on  the  amendments

contained therein, I would like to emphasise that I

stand  by what I stated in this Assembly on October

1958, and which is contained in the Hansard that is

in  front  of me here. It is important  for  me  to

repeat  what I stated then and also what  my  Party

stood  for before it went before the electorate  in

1959. Before we make any speeches concerning policy

or  basic  issues, whether they be in this Assembly

or outside, on behalf of the People's Action Party,

we  consider  carefully what we have  to  say.  Mr

Speaker, this is what I said then. "If our Party is

victorious in the elections on 29th May, 1959,  the

People's  Action  Party  will  carry  on  with  the

Preservation   of   Public  Security   Ordinance - an

Ordinance  to provide for security and peace  which

we  consider vital." This was not said lightly.  We

believed  then  in priority of security  and  peace

because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



these all are very vital things. This Government is

prepared  to shoulder its responsibilities.  If  we

are    not   courageous   enough   to   face    our

responsibilities then I think we will be placed  in

a  very  dangerous position. Not  only  members  of

political  Parties,  but also the  people  will  be

faced with difficulties and dangers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gather from what the Members of U.M.N.O. said

just  now,  that  they are not very specific  about

their  objections. They do not appear to understand

how  important this Preservation of Public Security

Ordinance  is.  They  said  that  this   Bill   was

dangerous. An explanation about it has already been

given  by my colleague, the Member for Bukit Timah.

The Member for Kampong Kembangan told a story of  a

crisis  in  his Party when the previous  Government

moved  a  motion concerning this Ordinance.  As  my

colleague  has said in his reply, this is  not  the

place to relate stories about political Parties. We

are  here as elected representatives of the  people

to  discuss  matters concerning  the  life  of  the

people  as  a whole. The stand adopted by  the  two

Members  of  U.M.N.O. towards  this  Ordinance  is

extraordinary and strange. First they say  that  it

is  drastic and undemocratic. Then they say that it

is  important that we should have this Ordinance if

we  want a merger with the Federation of Malaya.  I

know  that  the  Singapore U.M.N.O. has  the  same

policy as U.M.N.O. in the Federation of Malaya.  If

the Alliance Government in the Federation of Malaya

had an Advisory Committee to review cases connected

with  the Emergency laws, then I am sure the Member

for the Southern Islands and the Member for Kampong

Kembangan would argue how important it was to  have

such an Advisory Committee here also. But I regret,

Mr  Speaker. Sir, to say that both the two Members

have  failed  to  grasp what is contained  in  this

Bill.  I also find that there has been a difference

of  opinion  between the two Members.  They  should

find a point of agreement between themselves.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has brought this Bill because it

realises  that it is necessary for the preservation

of  peace  and security in this country. Also,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, as the Hon. the Prime Minister  said

earlier, the P.A.P. had made clear its stand before

it  came  into  power  four  or  five  months  ago.

Internal peace and security, Mr Speaker, Sir,  are

matters  for  the  Internal Security  Council,  the

members  of  which are the British Government,  the

Singapore  Government  and the  Government  of  the

Federation  of  Malaya. We should be  very  careful

about  what  we  say. We cannot  pretend  that  the

Singapore Government has full powers in matters  in

which  the British Government or the Government  of

the  Federation of Malaya have also a say. However,

we  do  not  wish to hide behind a  screen.  As  my

colleagues   have  said,  we  are   a   responsible

Government. Unlike the previous Government, we,  as

the elected representatives of the people, will not

shirk our responsibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, with regard to the amendments to the Bill, it is evident that Opposition Members agree

in principle that the Ordinance should be preserved

in  the interest of the people of Singapore and for

the  peace and security of this country.  But  what

they are opposed to is the amendment to replace the

Appeal Tribunal with an Advisory Committee composed

of  members nominated by the Government. Here,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Opposition Members need not  fear

or  have  any  doubts because the  members  of  the

Advisory  Committee will not be  nominated  at  the

whim  and fancy of the Government. We will nominate

members  with experience who understand  thoroughly

the political developments in Singapore. Members of

the  Opposition need have no fear about the  P.A.P.

Government nominating only men belonging to its own

Party to sit on the Advisory Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have more or less clarified my

stand   concerning  the  Preservation   of   Public

Security  Ordinance. The Opposition Members  should

take this opportunity to reconsider their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>



views.  They should not have any misgivings  as  to

the aim of the Government with regard to this Bill.

In  all  sincerity, we believe that  the  Ordinance

will  safeguard  the  security  of  the  people  of

Singapore as a whole, irrespective of the colour of

their skin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all, Mr Speaker. I give my whole-hearted

support to this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Prime Minister, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the

Opposition  enthused over the rights and  liberties

of    the    individual,   democratic   traditions,

independence  of  the Judiciary,  I  wondered  what

would  have happened had they won, and we lost  the

election.  I venture to suggest, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

that human liberties are better preserved with this

Government than if the position were reversed.  Can

one  imagine a Government with Mak Pak  Shee,  Seah

Peng  Chuan, Tang Peng Yeu, Vasagar and  God  knows

who  else-S.P.A./Lib. Socs, combined?  I  say  that

democracy  would have flown out of the window,  and

the  only  people  left would be those  who  stayed

underground  and would probably fight  and  finally

destroy  the  system.  Let us not  be  hypocritical

about  these things. We know, and they  know,  what

the   power  positions  are.  Despite  the   little

unhappiness  that  Members of the Opposition  feel,

that  some  of the actions of the P.A.P. Government

may  not be what they themselves would have  taken,

let  them  search their conscience  and  ask,  "Has

there been a denial or a negation of the spirit  of

reasonableness and tolerance which is  the  essence

of a democratic system?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been castigated by the Member for

Tanglin   for  taking  this  Bill  through   on   a

Certificate  of  Urgency. May  I  explain,  without

giving  away too much, that it would not have  made

the slightest difference to us whether we took this

Bill through all the three stages in one sitting or

spread  it  over  three  or four  months?  We  were

provident  enough to foresee the sort of situations

which would arise when we won the election. We took

a stand last year for this specific purpose and the

stand has stood the test of time. Why the urgency



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>



then?  It  is not because we feared public  debate.

The public debate started in October last year. The

last  meeting of the Internal Security Council  was

on 8th October. What the Deputy Prime Minister read

out  is the power position of the Internal Security

Council:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) The competence of the Singapore Government

to  formulate  and implement policy  affecting

internal   security   is   subject   to    the

overriding  powers  of the  Internal  Security

Council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In addition to consultations and decisions on

questions  of  policy, the  Internal  Security

Council   is   competent  to  make   executive

decisions  for  the  maintenance  of  internal

security  in Singapore, and any such  decision

which  has  been communicated to the Singapore

Government must be given immediate effect."



<br><br>It goes on to (3) and (4).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the strict constitutional position. We

could just fold our arms, and those sections in the

Constitution,  which allow for a  situation  to  be

overcome where the Singapore Government refuses  to

move in this Legislature, would have to be invoked.

If  our views, albeit somewhat different from those

of   the  other  representatives,  were  not  given

consideration,  then  that  might  have  been   the

position we would have adopted. In other words,  we

would  not  have pushed through this Bill.  It  was

because basically we felt that we had to honour our

responsibilities as a Government, so  long  as  our

views  are given proper weight and attention,  that

we  have  moved to put the Preservation  of  Public

Security (Amendment) Bill through this Chamber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Opposition had only one point to make and

that was on the alteration of the complexion of the

review  tribunal - from an appellate tribunal  to  an

advisory  committee. They reminded me  of  rockets.

Once  set  on  a  fixed course, without  corrective

devices,   they   go   out   into   outer    space.

Miscalculations are made; targets are missed;  they

go  out into outer space never to return. The  next

step  is to find a rocket with a corrective device;

then  it  might hit the moon or go round  the  moon

twice and come back to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps they did not know. Putting it at its best

construction, they were unaware



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



of  the  position.  They  were  real,   true

democrats who have complete faith not only  in  the

integrity but also in the sagacity of the Judges as

administrators and executive officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter that I had read out is the complete

and  conclusive answer to any suggestion  that  the

position was otherwise. I had given some Members of

the  Opposition  the benefit of the doubt.  Perhaps

they  did not know of the letter. After all it  was

addressed  to the last government and some  Members

on  the  other side were not Members  of  the  last

government.  But having got to know of the  letter,

and  then  nevertheless to go  on  and  hammer  the

argument that this is a negation of democracy seems

to me a travesty of a debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me put the argument that they have advanced,

succinctly  in the reverse. The Member  for  Farrer

Park said that one of the more laudable features of

our system is the respect with which the judges are

held.  The  fact  that they are,  not  corrupt,  or

unfair  or biased, is acceptable. For what purpose?

For  the  purposes  of administering  the  law,  to

interpret facts, make findings on them, and  decide

on  the  law  applicable. If they are used  for  an

executive   purpose,  and  this  is   exactly   the

situation they do not wish to find themselves in - if

they are used in an executive tribunal to say "yes"

or  "no" to an executive act, the consequences that

follow  will  be  the reverse of what  the  Members

opposite   have  expressed  they  would   like   to

see - public  esteem of the Judiciary.  Let  us  face

facts.  He  whose appeal is denied and rejected  is

not going to accept the independence of that Appeal

Tribunal. The Communist Party is not going  to  sit

back  and  say, "Ah! Yes, we have been  fairly  and

adequately  heard by a panel of two Judges  of  the

High  Court and one District Judge. They have found

our comrade so-and-so a fit and proper person to be

detained.  So  be it." That is not the  case.  They

systematically set out to destroy the  prestige  of

the  Judges, to smear them as stooges and executive

instruments of the Government. Thereby  you  reduce

their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



usefulness in the proper office for which they were

constituted, namely, to hold a fair trial according

to  the  law. It is as simple as that. That is  why

the Judges wrote in those terms. I became aware  of

this position, and so discussed the matter with the

present Chief Justice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in case it is thought that I had read out a

bogus   letter,  I  extended  the  courtesy,  which

normally are not expected of Governments, of taking

someone  who  is  not  a  nominal  leader  of   the

Opposition  into my confidence. I  was  willing  to

disclose  the  circumstances in which  that  letter

came to be written, and the advantage was taken of.

The  Member for Farrer Park knows exactly what  the

position  is.  What his leader,  the  former  Chief

Minister,  wrote to the Acting Chief Justice;  what

the  Acting Chief Justice wrote back; and what  the

former  Chief  Minister wrote  back  to  the  Chief

Justice. Yet he comes here like an American  rocket

on  a  set  course shooting out into  outer  space,

unable  to  alter  course in the  face  of  altered

circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me wind up the Second Reading of this Bill by

harking back again to the long-term issue.  In  the

situation  in  which  we  find  ourselves,  it   is

inevitable  that  these extraordinary  powers  will

have  to be exercised by whoever wishes to see that

order  exists  and  law is possible.  Usually  when

lawyers  talk, they use the phrase "law and  order"

but  I think lawyers are the first to know that  if

you  have  no  order, there is no law.  You  cannot

enforce the law in a state of disorder. That is  as

far  as  this  Bill  provides - that  in  exceptional

situations, in order that public order shall not be

upset,   extraordinary  steps  are  taken  by   the

Executive to ensure that the security of the  State

is  not  undermined. But whether you finally  bring

the  whole of your people round to believe that the

system you are working is worth preserving, because

it  works  for  the benefit of the people,  depends

upon    your   economic,   social   and   political

programmes.  On  the one hand,  we  dampen  through

these  means any chances of disorder. On the  other

hand, we must ensure that the order that exists  is

fully   utilised  to  bring  about   a   completely

different situation where the people not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>



only  are  told, but can visibly see and feel  that

their  lives  are being altered under the  existing

system  to  their decided advantage.  That  is  the

function of an elected government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[The Prime Minister].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.55 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 and 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 3 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, could I ask whether the

Security Council or the Minister satisfies the Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara as stated in subsection  (1)?  I

ask  this  question because in the Constitution  of

Singapore, section 65 says:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Council shall have the following functions,

that is to say -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to maintain the efficiency of all organs of

the   Government   of  Singapore   which   are

concerned with internal security;"



<br><br>and  it is logical for me to assume that this  Bill

is  a  matter  of internal security  and  that  the

Security  Council  would be  playing  an  important

part.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, the answer is

either  the  Singapore Government or  the  Internal

Security  Council. In the first  instance,  if  the

Singapore  Government acts, then it  recommends  to

the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara,  i.e. the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara is satisfied on the advice  of  the

Government,  that is the Cabinet.  If  the  Cabinet

should  not  be  in  agreement  with  the  Internal

Security  Council,  the Internal  Security  Council

could  then advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.  The

Part of the Constitution which provides for this is

Part VII of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>



the  Constitution, "The Internal Security Council",

section 66:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) It shall be competent to the Council to make

decisions  for  the  maintenance  of  the  internal

security of Singapore or for the due performance of

the  functions  conferred on it  by  the  preceding

section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Every decision made under the preceding

subsection shall forthwith be communicated to the

Government of Singapore and it shall be the duty of

that Government to give immediate effect to that

decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Where the Chairman of the Council is satisfied

that the Government of Singapore has failed to give

effect  to any such decision as aforesaid, he  may,

by  writing under his hand, so inform the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara, and advise him to  make  an  Order

giving  effect to that decision; and the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara shall make an order accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Chairman, with the concurrence of the

Council, may, from time to time, advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to make a further Order revoking  or

amending  any  Order made under this  section,  and

upon  such  advice  being communicated  to  him  by

writing  under  the  hand of the  Chairman  of  the

Council, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara shall make such

further Order accordingly."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What it means is this: Let us assume for a moment

that  in  the best liberal traditions we refuse  to

deal with a known subversive who is a member of the

opposition Party, but the internal Security Council

feels, however, that in the interests of order  and

progress such a person should not be allowed to  be

at   large.   Then,  theoretically  speaking,   the

Internal  Security  Council  orders  the  Singapore

Government and the Singapore Government advises the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara. If the Singapore Government

chooses  to  be acquiescent, then these  provisions

are   invoked:   the  Singapore  Government   being

acquiescent,  the advice is directly given  to  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara. But I can  assure  Members

opposite  that  if any Right-wing subversion  takes

place  in  Singapore, the first of those  instances

which   I   have   mentioned   will   take   effect

immediately.   In   other  words,   the   Singapore

Government  on its own accord advise the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara and if any review is to take  place,

it will be in the Internal Security Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 5 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move that the whole

of clause 5 be deleted from the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member just votes against

the  question.  I  understood the hon.  Member  for

Mountbatten had a question?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Yes, Sir. But as the Prime

Minister  has  answered query No. 3, I  believe  it

will  be  the same answer for No. 5. Do I  take  it

that it is the same procedure?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I would say to the hon. Lady

that  the sections that I have referred to  in  the

Constitution are comprehensive. On the wider  issue

as  suggested by the Member for Farrer Park, may  I

suggest  to  him that perhaps in his  eagerness  to

demonstrate  his  democratic  tendencies,  he   has

forgotten that if he suggests that we scrap  clause

5  altogether - just say no, negate  it - he  is  being

undemocratic; because we, the P.A.P. Government, at

least pay attention to the forms and the ritual  of

the  Emergency legislation. If he just negates  it,

he is saying that we need not even have an Advisory

Committee. I am sure that is not his intention.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> With great respect to the Prime

Minister, Sir, if clause 5 of the Bill were  to  be

negated, the existing section would still remain in

force.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> With respect to the Member for

Farrer  Park, if clause 5 of the Bill were negated,

then immediately the whole of this Preservation  of

Public  Security (Amendment) Bill would  not  reach

the  Third Reading, and it would lapse on the  20th

October.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Clause 5, Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may

read  it  for  the benefit of the  Hon. the  Prime

Minister, says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Section 5 of the principal Ordinance is hereby

repealed and the following substituted therefor."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



So  that  if clause 5 of the Bill is not  proceeded

with  and  abandoned,  the  existing  section  will

remain.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I must point out to the Member

for  Farrer  Park  that  if  the  existing  section

remains in the Bill and the Judges do not act, this

Bill  becomes a nullity. It would not be worth  our

while  proceeding  with the Third  Reading  of  the

Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the last Chief

Minister could have persuaded the Judges to act,  I

feel  certain  our  present  Prime  Minister  could

persuade them even better.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, amongst my few

virtues, I do not possess the power-



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Of persuasion!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Those who are unkind would

have used the word "prostitution". Never mind.  But

I  am  incapable,  in  an  executive  capacity,  to

persuade  people to do what I know to be manifestly

wrong.  The  last Chief Minister at least  had  the

excuse,  that he went down on his bended knees  and

asked  the  Judges to do something which  he  could

proclaim he did not know to be wrong. But  that  is

not the position which I can claim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That clause 5 stand part of the

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to introduce a Bill intituled

"An Ordinance to amend the Seamen's Registry Board

Ordinance, 1957 (No. 11 of 1957)."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill read the First time.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Second Reading, what day?

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Now, Sir. Mr Speaker, I lay

upon  the Table a Certificate of Urgency signed  by

the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  in  respect  of  the

Seamen's Registry Board (Amendment) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Certificate is in order. Are

typed  copies of the Bill available for the use  of

Members?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, there are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill handed in to the Clerk

and distributed to hon. Members.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (3) of section 3 of the existing

Seamen's  Registry  Board Ordinance  makes  various

stipulations about the sort of person  who  can  be

appointed as Chairman of the Board. One of these is

that  he  may not be a person in the employment  of

the  Government  of  the State,  unless  he  is  so

employed  in  a  judicial capacity. The  Government

considers that this particular provision should  be

deleted  in  order  to  give  the  Minister  rather

greater  freedom of choice in this matter  than  he

possesses at the moment. The term of office of  the

present  Chairman  expires  today,  and  it  is  to

prevent  a  hiatus  before a new  Chairman  can  be

appointed  that  this  Bill is  taken  through  all

stages on a Certificate of Urgency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to make some

other minor amendments to clarify sections 2 and  5

of  the  Ordinance by putting the word "ship's"  in

front  of  the  word "articles", where  the  latter

expression  is  used,  and by inserting  the  words

"agreements  for employment" instead  of  the  word

"articles"  in  paragraph (b)  of  subsection  (5),

which  refers to foreign seamen in transit who  may

not  by  the  law  of their employers'  country  be

required to sign a document which could properly be

described as "ship's articles", but who must  still

for our purposes have signed whatever documents the

employers' country does require before they come

Mr Speaker, Sir, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read a  Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary object of this Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir,

is  to  save  the time of the Court  by  making  it

unnecessary, in cases where a game, method, device,

scheme  or  competition is known  to  be  a  public

lottery,  for  the  Court to  record  the  detailed

evidence  to  show that it is a public lottery.  At

present,  for example, where a man is charged  with

assisting  in carrying on a chap ji ki lottery,  it

is necessary for a witness to give evidence to show

in  detail how a chap ji ki lottery is run so as to

show  that  chap  ji ki is a public  lottery.  This

would appear to be necessary even though chap ji ki

has  been held to be a lottery in a number of cases

in the High Court and in the subordinate Courts and

although the magistrate, for example, who tries the

case  may  from his own experience of  trying  such

cases know how a chap ji ki lottery is run.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will enable the Court to take judicial

notice  that  a  game, method,  device,  scheme  or

competition is a public lottery. Power is given  to

the  Minister to declare any game, method,  device,

scheme  or  competition to be a  lottery,  and  the

Court  is  required  to accept the  evidence  of  a

police officer not below the rank of Sergeant  that

a  document produced before it is a lottery  ticket

or  an  account, memorandum or record of stakes  or

wagers  in  or  relating to a  public  lottery,  as

presumptive evidence of that fact. The  reason  why

it  is  necessary to allow a police officer of  the

rank of Sergeant to give such evidence is that  the

gambling experts of tie Police Force are at present

of the rank of Sergeant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has been taken to increase the

term  of  imprisonment for which a  person  can  be

sentenced  under  section 4 of  the  Common  Gaming

Houses  Ordinance from 12 months to 3  years.  This

removes the anomaly of a person who is sentenced to

pay  a  fine  of  $6,000 under  section  4  of  the

Ordinance  being liable in the event of non-payment

of  the fine to imprisonment in default of only six

months. The period for which a person can be  bound

over  under  section 21 of the Ordinance  has  also

been increased from one year to three years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I read this Bill

for the first time, I had some doubts about one  of

the   subsections  of  clause  2,  that  particular

subsection which enables the Minister to gazette  a

game,  method, device, scheme or competition  as  a

lottery to be an irrebuttable presumption in Court.

I  felt that this would be a subsection which could

be  used to give the Minister, if I may put  it  in

this  way,  a  competitive  jurisdiction  with  the

ordinary Courts of the country. But after listening

to  the Minister, I will not raise any objection if

the  whole  point and purpose of this amendment  is

merely  to enact in a general way that a particular

game  is  a  public lottery. This would, therefore,

mean  that  some  of  the  complicated  and  rather

difficult evidence which is now required to  prove,

shall  I say, a game of chap ji ki need not be  led

in  evidence.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I  would  like  an

assurance from the Minister for Labour and Law that

if  he  is  to use these powers under this proposed

subsection,  he  would  gazette  in  general  terms

rather  than  in  particular ones.  May  I  explain

myself.   If  the  Minister  wishes  to  use   this

subsection, he could say that a particular kind  of

game,  say, football, in general shall be a  public

lottery  but  he will not use these powers  to  say

that a game of football played on a particular day,

on  a  particular ground and between two particular

teams  is a lottery. Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems  to

me  that  the  subsection as it  now  stands  could

enable  the  Minister to do both  these  things  or

either one of them. I can appreciate the difficulty

of  the  Minister for Labour and  Law,  and  I  can

appreciate why he wants this subsection, because  I

know  that  the proving of chap ji  ki  is  a  very

tricky  matter  in Court and sometimes  people  get

away  with it because of the difficulty of  proving

it.  If  I  can have the Minister's assurance  that

this  subsection will only be used in general cases

to declare a game or a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



competition to be a lottery and will not be used in

such  a way as to make it easy for the prosecution.

Let  me explain. Supposing a case is put up to  the

Prosecutor's Department after investigation and the

Prosecutor  after  investigation says,  "Well,  you

know, it is very difficult, this way, that way.  We

might  get  a conviction or we might not."  So  the

matter is put up to the State Advocate-General  who

then approaches the Minister for Labour and Law and

says,  "Look, Mr Minister, this chap is  a  crook,

you  know.  He must be put in, but if we  take  him

into  Court, his clever lawyers might get him  out.

Therefore, will you gazette this particular game or

this  particular  competition  to  be  a  lottery?"

Whereupon, the Minister gazettes it and the man  is

then  brought in to Court. The Court is then  faced

with a Gazette order which declares it to be a game

which   by   virtue  of  this  subsection   is   an

irrebuttable   presumption   of   law.   In   those

circumstances, all that the Court is left  with  is

to  convict  him  and  fine  him  or  sentence  him

according  to  law. If I can have the assurance  of

the  Minister for Labour and Law that this will not

take place, I will not raise any further objection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not know whether any other

Member wishes to speak. No? Mr Minister, in reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will say here and

now that it will never be my intention to declare a

friendly  game of mahjong in which the  Member  for

Farrer Park indulges in his own private home -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I do not play mahjong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> -to be a private lottery. It is clearly

apparent  from  this Bill that the purpose  of  the

amendment to the Ordinance is to enable the  Courts

to take judicial notice of games such as chap ji ki

which are generally known to be public lotteries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>6.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is known that considerable quantities of stolen

property   find  their  way  into  the   hands   of

pawnbrokers.   It   is   seldom,   however,    that

pawnbrokers  report to the police  that  they  have

reason  to believe that articles offered  for  pawn

are  stolen  property  and if  they  accept  stolen

property  it may be difficult to trace  the  pawner

because  of the laxity of pawnbrokers in  recording

the   personal  particulars  of  pawners.  It   has

accordingly been decided that pawnbrokers should be

required to record the identity card numbers of the

pawners so that their identity may be traced at any

time.  The  purpose  of  this  Bill  is  to  enable

regulations to be made to require the production of

identity  cards when articles are pawned. In  order

to  empower pawnbrokers to record the identity card

numbers of-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am afraid I cannot follow

the  Minister very well. We are on the Registration

of  Persons  (Amendment) Bill. I was wondering  how

pawnbrokers  and pawnbroking have  anything  to  do

with it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I am coming to that point, Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, the purpose of this Bill is to enable

regulations to be made to require the production of

identity  cards when articles are pawned. In  order

to  empower pawnbrokers to record the identity card

numbers  of  their customers, it  is  necessary  to

amend the Registration of Persons Ordinance, 1955.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



The  inspection of identity cards is  governed  by

the  Registration  of  Persons  Ordinance  and  the

regulations made under it. At present there  is  no

provision for pawnbrokers to legally demand to  see

their customers' identity cards. When this Bill  is

passed,  the necessary amendments will be  made  to

the  Registration  of  Persons  Regulations,  1955,

requiring pawnbrokers to inspect and record details

of the identity cards of pawners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hoped by these means to prevent the use of

pawnbrokers' shops as a channel for the disposal of

<div align="center"><b>MINOR OFFENCES (AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill which seeks to amend the Minor Offences

Ordinance  is largely devoted to strengthening  the

law  relating  to  the  use of  dangerous  weapons.

Members  are aware that in pursuing their  campaign

of  terrorising  innocent  people,  secret  society

members  and  gangsters  will  not  stop  short  of

vicious  physical attacks utilising  a  variety  of

deadly weapons, many of which are devised from  the

ordinary  implements of everyday  use.  It  is  our

intention to deal very severely with all those  who

seek to inflict the terror of physical suffering on

their unfortunate victims.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the details of the Bill, the main

provisions relate (1) to amending the penalties for

soliciting  in  public places for  the  purpose  of

prostitution or any other immoral purpose, and  (2)

to   strengthening  legislation  relating  to   the

possession,  custody  or  control  of  any   knife,

offensive weapon, explosive or corrosive substance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill increases the penalty for

soliciting by prostitutes for immoral purposes from

the  present  fine of $20 or 14 days'  imprisonment

for  the  first offence and a fine of $50 or  three

months' imprisonment for subsequent offences, to  a

fine of $100 for the first offence and a fine of up

to  $500 or six months' imprisonment for the second

and  subsequent offences. It is well known that the

activities   of   secret  society   gangsters   are

frequently centred on the proceeds of prostitution.

The so-called protection of these loose women is  a

fruitful source of revenue to gangsters, who do not

hesitate  to  assault those persons  who  will  not

contribute to their own protection. It is with  the

object  of  not  only driving prostitutes  off  the

streets  in our campaign against vice but  also  of

depriving  gangsters  of this  fruitful  source  of

revenue  that  we  now  propose  to  inflict  these

heavier   penalties  upon  those  who  indulge   in

soliciting for immoral purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 4 of the Bill is designed to strengthen

the  existing legislation in respect of  possession

of   corrosive  or  explosive  substances  and   of

offensive weapons which can be used to smash or  to

stab.  The  weakness of the present legislation  is

that  the  Police  can only prosecute  persons  for

possession of these offensive weapons when they are

apprehended in a public place. The Police found  it

very  difficult  to prove ownership  of  caches  of

secret  society  offensive weapons  when  they  are

discovered in houses and other premises. Under  the

amending legislation, it will be an offence  for  a

person  to have acid or an offensive weapon on  his

person  or in his possession or custody or control,

unless  that  person can prove  that  the  acid  or

weapon  is intended for a legitimate purpose.  Much

ingenuity has been shown by gangsters in converting

domestic or commercial implements



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



of everyday usage into formidable  weapons

which  can  be  used to maim or kill.  The  parang,

bearing scraper, and the ordinary screwdriver  have

all  been  used  in  the past to  inflict  terrible

injuries   on  those  who  dared  to   oppose   the

gangsters.  Under  this proposed  legislation,  the

possession  of  these implements will  be  made  an

offence,  unless  the person having  or  possessing

them   can  prove  that  they  are  for  legitimate

purposes.  The law-abiding householder  or  artisan

need  have  no fear that he will be prevented  from

having  in  his  possession  such  implements   for

genuine  domestic purposes or for purposes  of  his

trade,  but  resolute action will be taken  against

thugs whose sole aim is to terrorise or to kill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 5 of the Bill is a new provision designed

to  outlaw  those particularly vicious  weapons - the

flick  knives.  These  vicious  implements  can  be

easily carried and concealed, but with no more than

a  flick  of the wrist they are converted  into  an

instrument of death. The effect of this section  of

the  Bill  will  be  to make it illegal  for  these

weapons  to exist on this island. Members will  see

that   penalties  for  having  or   possessing   an

offensive  weapon,  which I  have  just  mentioned,

includes a heavy fine or imprisonment for the first

offence;  and if the offence is repeated,  a  heavy

prison sentence can be inflicted without option  of

the fine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said before, it is the intention of

this  Government to use all means in its  power  to

smash the gangsters in our midst, and we will  take

all  additional necessary measures to achieve  this

aim and to safeguard the law-abiding persons of the

community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, contrary to the previous

statement expressed by the Minister for Labour  and

Law that Members of the Opposition know only how to

criticise, I wish here to express my great pleasure

in  supporting this Bill and promise to support any

other Bill brought forth by Government to clean  up

this country from bottom to top, or top to bottom.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Inside out!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I believe we should go

even  further. What are the things which  encourage

our   young   people  and  others  to   resort   to

gangsterism and to other vices in order to  have  a

living? I believe that crime comics and crime films

play a very great part, and an insidious part,  not

only  in  this country but also in other countries.

The  problem of juvenile delinquency is  found  not

only  in Singapore but also in many other parts  of

the  world. I think it is time for us here to  give

notice  to producers of films, whether in Hollywood

or  in England, and those who publish crime comics,

that we do not wish to receive such exports and  if

they want the goodwill of countries like ours, they

should stop or discourage the production and export

of  such  films  and crime comics. I  believe  that

action  has  already been taken  in  Singapore  but

unless the people who produce them know also of our

new  attitude, they will continue to produce  them,

and   once  they  have  invested  money   in   such

production,  they will see that these things  reach

Singapore, which makes our problem more difficult.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Does the Minister wish to reply?



<br><br>6.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad to

hear that Members of the Opposition have decided to

give their support to this Bill, and I am sure that

with  the  support of every member of  the  public,

this  problem of secret societies and thugs can  be

suppressed to a large extent. I am sure the  Member

for  Tanglin is aware that film censorship has been

tightened   up   and  that  we  are  now   bringing

periodicals  such as comics, etc, under examination

by the Publications Section of the Ministry of Home

Affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<div align="center"><b>SPECIAL CONSTABULARY</b></div>



<br><br>6.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in connection with the Special

Constabulary  in  Singapore, I would  like  to  say

that, as we all know, the Special Constabulary Unit

was  formed in September 1945, and in the 14  years

up  to  today the youths who served in the  Special

Constabulary have rendered a great service. We know

that  on 30th April, 1959, six Inspectors and about

180  members of the Special Constabulary took  part

in  a parade held at the Police Training School and

among them about eight were awarded Service Medals.

Therefore,   it   is   clear   that   the   Special

Constabulary,  since its formation, has  played  an

important role in the Island of Singapore. We  know

also that there are some amongst them who have lost

their lives in the performance of their duties.  We

cannot  deny this. Mr Speaker, it is a  matter  of

regret to us that the Government had terminated the

services  of  about  250  members  of  the  Special

Constabulary.  This  constitutes  a   big   problem

because  the  Government which is  responsible  for

this   has   stated  that  these  people   had   no

qualifications. On this point, it is a big question

mark today. We do not know whether this matter  has

a communal bearing or not. It is up to the Assembly

to  decide. In fact, on this matter the  people  of

Singapore should decide. I do not say that it is  a

communal  affair.  But it is strange  to  say  that

although  our  Government today has  declared  that

Malay  is  the national language, and although  the

Special  Constables can be said to be qualified  in

the  Malay  language, yet their services  had  been

terminated on the ground that they had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>



no  qualification. Mr Speaker,  we  can  say  that

these  constables are fluent in the Malay language.

We  know  that the majority of them whose  services

had been terminated are Malays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, with regard to this matter why were

they  not  given  an opportunity to continue  their

services?  There  is a proverb  which,  in  effect,

means  that it is ingratitude to discard  something

after  your purpose has been served. But I  do  not

think this Government will adopt this attitude, for

this is a Government which has declared that it has

been  elected by the people and will therefore look

after the interest of the people. I am sure it will

not  follow the saying: "After you have crossed the

bridge, you throw away the walking stick."  I  know

that the present Government is not like a hen which

lays  just  an  egg each time, but  rather  like  a

turtle which lays many eggs at a time. This  is  an

example  which  has been given by  the  Member  for

Bukit Timah some time back in this Assembly. He has

stated so and told it to me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of making Malay the national

language,  the  Member said this: "To  do  this  is

wrong,  and  to  do  that also is  wrong."  I  hope

therefore  to receive some clarification  from  the

Government on this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, what is going to happen to the Malays

who  cannot afford to have further education, apart

from  receiving  an  education  in  Malay  schools?

Although  the  Special Constables  know  the  Malay

language, their services were terminated  for  want

of  qualifications. Ultimately, those who only know

the Malay language will die an untimely death. This

is the fate of the blind who need guidance and like

those  who depend on the fence to protect the  padi

seedlings,  they find later that it  is  the  fence

itself that collapses and destroys them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been told of the policy concerning

citizenship. In order to obtain citizenship  today,

there  are  certain qualifications laid down  which

must  be complied with. For instance, there is  the

specific period of residence necessary to enable  a

person  to  become a citizen of Singapore.  Compare

this with Malay as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>



the   national  language,  the  language  of  those

members  of the Special Constabulary whose services

were terminated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, why is it then that the

services of these people were terminated? Why  were

they  not  given  an opportunity  to  stay  on  and

continue to serve as they have served for a  number

of years? Why cannot we help our young men who have

served the State and have proved their worth? Where

is   justice   and  fair  play  then?  An   elected

government of the people in a self-governing  State

must  render  all  assistance  to  those  who  were

ignored  by the past government. We have proclaimed

democracy. But step-sons have always been ignored.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, to continue this matter further, there are some points to which should like to draw

the  attention of the Government so that they  will

receive  due attention. I refer especially  to  the

Special  Constables who comprise all the  races  of

Singapore,   whether   the   services   have   been

terminated or whether they are still in the  Force.

According  to  the annual report of  the  Singapore

Police Force for the year 1958, there is a shortage

of  personnel and yet those who had served  in  the

Special  Constabulary  have  not  been  given   the

opportunity to fill these vacant posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely hope that this Government will not

ignore  the  fate  of  these constables  and  their

families who are in need of the bare necessities of

life. Mr Speaker, it is strange that these people,

who    have   been   considered   as   having    no

qualification, had received their training from the

Police Training School in Singapore. It means  that

the  training that they had received was of no  use

at  all.  On the other hand, we all know  that  the

majority of the members of the Special Constabulary

whose services were terminated are Malays. If  this

is  the  state of affairs, if this is the treatment

meted  out to the Malays, who are considered to  be

the  indigenous people of Singapore and who are  in

need of help in many aspects of life, as stated  in

the  Constitution of Singapore, then it means  that

the special position of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>



Malays  is  being ignored. That is what  it  simply

means  when these special constables are  dismissed

from   their   jobs,  and  not  given   alternative

employment. I hope that this Government will not be

one-sided,  and that it will give an  assurance  to

treat them-



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I want to

ask whether the hon. Member is reading his speech.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The point has been raised

whether  the hon. Member is reading his  speech.  I

did  notice  that the hon. Member was referring  to

his  notes a bit too much. Perhaps the hon.  Member

will not read so obviously.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, thank

you  for correcting me. Mr Speaker, as I have said

just now with regard to the position of the Special

Constabulary, what is the policy of the  Government

towards  the  special position  of  the  Malays  in

Singapore? If the Malay language is not suitable as

a  qualification - for, as has been explained in  the

newspapers, the services of the special  constables

were    terminated   because    they    were    not

qualified - where then is the special position of the

Malays?  Where then are the special rights  of  the

Malays  as  mentioned in a special  clause  in  the

Constitution?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to criticise the Government or to

cause annoyance to the Government, but I only  want

some  clarification. It may be  that  without  such

clarification the position might be misconstrued by

the  Malays  in  Singapore. The  Malays  are  today

wholeheartedly  supporting the  Government  in  its

declared   policy  in  making  Malay  the  national

language.  Therefore,  Mr  Speaker,  I  hope  this

Government  will in turn consider why the  services

of  these special constables were terminated. Today

there  exists a force called the Volunteer  Special

Constabulary. They are not in fact volunteers. They

receive an allowance and some other benefits.  Such

people  who  volunteer their services  are  already

employed.  Why  is  it that such people  are  still

required?  On  the  other  hand,  those  who   have

rendered their services to the State, who know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>



a little about administrative matters in the Police

Force,  have had their services terminated  on  the

ground that they are not qualified, although  Malay

has  been  made the national language of Singapore.

That is all, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

I am taking this opportunity to speak at the end of

this    sitting   in   order   to   clarify    some

misunderstanding which was expressed by the  Member

for Kampong Kembangan in his adjournment speech. If

someone is fluent in the Malay language, it  cannot

be said that he has the necessary qualification and

should  be accepted as a police officer. Otherwise,

those  who are maimed can also claim that they  too

are  fit  to be police officers. We know  that  the

existence  of the Special Constabulary was  because

of  the  Emergency which first broke out in  Malaya

and then spread to Singapore. In order to safeguard

the  peace  and security of both these territories,

the  Special Constabulary was formed in Malaya  and

in  Singapore,  too.  They were  required  to  help

safeguard  Singapore and its waters,  and  also  to

guard it from undesirable elements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of dismissed special constables did

not  only  exist  in  Singapore  but  also  in  the

Federation when the Emergency conditions  improved.

Members   of   the  Home  Guard  and  the   Special

Constabulary  in  the  Federation  too  had   their

services  terminated,  or  those  units  had  their

strength   reduced  when  the  Emergency  situation

improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I know, the former Singapore Government

had  already  made  a  decision  to  terminate  the

services of the Special Constabulary. But they  did

not  have the guts to terminate their services then

because  they had to face the general elections  in

May.  For that reason, the "buck" was unfortunately

passed on to us. Those who used the services of the

Special Constabulary are not the present Government

but  the previous Government. Thus, the analogy  of

the  fence destroying the crops could appropriately

be applied to the previous Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the representatives of the Special

Constabulary had seen the Minister for  Labour  and

Law,  and  that  the  Minister had  given  them  an

assurance that every possible assistance  would  be

given  to  them.  He  had  assured  them  that   if

commercial firms required the services of  watchmen

or  some similar jobs, the Minister for Labour  and

Law  would  give  top  priority  to  these  special

constables  whose  services  had  been  terminated.

Thus,  although they had rendered services  to  the

previous  Government, the P.A.P.  Government  still

has a high regard for their services.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it was

necessary   to   disband  the   temporary   Special

Constables since the Emergency and temporary duties

for  which they had been recruited had come  to  an

end. The majority of those discharged were employed

on  searchlight duty in the Johore Straits  control

scheme, which operated until the end of last  year,

to  assist the Federation during the Emergency.  In

anticipation of their redundancy, the  Police  have

since  last  year absorbed a good number  or  these

temporary  Special  Constables  into  the   regular

Police   Force.  I  am  sure  that  those   Special

Constables  who  the Member for  Kampong  Kembangan

mentioned  have  received  awards  for  meritorious

services, would have been absorbed into the regular

Police Force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, a Guard and Escort Unit was recently

set   up   and  a  further  825  temporary  Special

Constables were absorbed into the Unit. The balance

of  250  Special Constables were considered by  the

police to have lacked the necessary qualifications.

And  by  qualifications, I  do  not  mean  language

alone. If language is considered the only criterion

for  selection, then, as my colleague,  the  Member

for  Bukit Timah has said, those who are  lame,  or

maimed,  or blind, can also be accepted. For  those 250 Special  Constables,  a  phased  programme  to

discharge them early this year was not accepted and

implemented by the S.P.A. Government (of which Dato

Abdul  Hamid  bin Haji Jumat was the  Deputy  Chief

Minister), because of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>



impending  general  elections, although  they  knew

that  these temporary Special Constables had to  be

discharged because the purpose for which  they  had

been  recruited  had come to an end.  There  is  no

question  of  their posts being filled by  Chinese,

because  all  the posts of the Special Constabulary

have  been  abolished. It is also not true  to  say

that  the  discharged temporary Special  Constables

were  all  Malays  or  that we  have  discriminated

against  the Malays. First and foremost, these  250

temporary  Special  Constables  were  selected  for

discharge  during the time of the last  Government,

and  if there had been any discrimination, then the

Dato,  the  Member  for Kampong  Kembangan's  Party

chairman,  had condoned it. But, nevertheless,  for

his  information, I would like to mention  that  of

those  discharged  there were  eight  Chinese,  six

Indians, two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>



Filipinos and two Eurasians. The Malays  were  the

largest  in  number because most of  the  temporary

Special  Constables were Malays. As  my  colleague,

the  Member for Bukit Timah, has pointed  out,  the

Minister for Labour and Law had tried his  best  to

help   those  Special  Constables  who   had   been

discharged.  He had asked the banks  and  firms  in

Singapore to employ them. For many of those who had

come  from the Federation, he had offered to secure

for them free warrants to go back to the Federation

by train.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.
