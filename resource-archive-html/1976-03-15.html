<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>FRINGE CAR PARKS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Request for free use)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  and  Communications if he  will  consider

allowing  those underutilised fringe car parks  to  be

used  for  free parking so as to induce more motorists

to  park their cars there and travel into and  out  of

the  Central  Business District by shuttle  buses  and

thus  reduce  traffic congestion  created  by  private

motor  vehicles leaving the Central Business  District

during the evening peak hours.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng Liang) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Sir, the hon.

Member's  suggestion of allowing free parking  at  the

fringe car parks is unlikely to attract more commuters

to  these  car parks. The present charges of  $10  per

month  or 50 cents per entry are nominal and  are  not

the  reason  for  the underutilisation  of  these  car

parks.  Most  of  the  motorists  who  have  taken  to

commuting by bus prefer to board the buses



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



directly from their homes rather than to park-and-ride

from  the  fringe  car  parks.  This  appears  to   be

particularly  true  of  residents  living  in   public

housing  estates as these estates are well  served  by

buses  to  the Central Business District  and  walking

distances to the bus-stops are generally short  within

the estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were originally 11 fringe car parks but three

were  discontinued since June 1975. Of  the  remaining

eight  fringe car parks still in operation, six  have

been  partly converted into day-and-night garaging  of

buses,  parking  of tour coaches, lorries  and  mobile

cranes, season car parking, and as a Government  Plant

Sales Centre. Other possible alternative uses for  the

fringe car parks are being considered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since

the  Minister  of  State  has refused  to  allow  free

parking in these fringe car parks as I have suggested.

I   presume   the  Ministry  has  plans   for   better

utilisation of these car parks. May I know what is the

plan?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have indicated

that,  out of the remaining eight car parks, six  have

been  converted into various uses. If the hon.  Member

is  interested in their detailed use. I have  all  the

figures  here.  For example, the fringe  car  park  at

Lorong  1. Geylang, is being operated as a fringe  car

park  on  working days. It is leased to the  Singapore

Shuttle  Bus  (Pte) Ltd for night garaging  of  buses.

Similarly the fringe car park at Serangoon Road, where

the  Singapore Bus Service Ltd is using it  for  night

garaging. Moreover, the remaining available space  has

been  leased to the Housing and Development Board  for

car parking by the residents living there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To justify our claim that these fringe car parks are

being  considered  for other uses,  let  me  cite  the

example  of the fringe car park at Kampong Java  Road.

We are thinking of converting a certain portion of the

car park into recreational areas such as tennis courts

or  squash courts to be built by the Singapore  Sports

Council. Another plan is to interest the







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



HUDC  in the site at Chancery Lane which could be used

as  a  possible  site for middle income  housing.  The

fringe car park at Whitley Road is used as a car  park

during the day. It is also leased to the Singapore Bus

Service  Ltd for day-and-night garaging of buses.  The

same  arrangement  applies to Holland  Road  car  park

where  part of it is used as a Plant Sales  Centre  of

the  Parks and Recreation Department. The Delta Circus

car  park is also leased to the Singapore Bus  Service

Ltd for day-and-night garaging of buses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, the fact is that the car parks

are  still under-utilised. So may I suggest that these

car parks be used as pasar ma/am sites?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the policy on

pasar ma/am lies with the Ministry of the Environment.

If  there  is  a  request from  the  Ministry  of  the

Environment  to use these car parks as possible  pasar

ma/am sites, the Ministry of National Development will

be too happy to consider it.

<div align="center"><b>(Construction of bus shelters)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for National

Development and Communications if he will consider the

construction  of two bus shelters at the  junction  of

Tampines Way and Tampines Road.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,I

am  glad  to  inform the Member for Punggol  that  the

construction  of  two  bus shelters  at  the  junction

mentioned is included in the 1976-77 programme.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>(Construction of pedestrian overhead bridge)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for National

Development and Communications if he will consider the

construction of a pedestrian overhead bridge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



at  the junction of Tampines Way and Tampines Road  as

this  place  is  accident-prone and several  accidents

have, occurred there.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

Tampines  Road  is  narrow  and  cannot  justify   the

construction  of an overhead bridge. The Public  Works

Department  recently carried out a study of pedestrian

and  vehicle  traffic  volumes  at  the  junction   of

Tampines  Way  and Tampines Road. It  was  found  that

during peak hours an average of 130 pedestrians  cross

Tampines  Road  at this point. There  was  an  average

delay  of eight seconds before they were able to cross

the  road.  By exercising a little patience and  care,

pedestrians can cross in safety. Accident records show

that  there were only five accidents at this  junction

in  1975, of  which  three involved  pedestrians  and

fortunately none was fatal. The situation will be kept

under constant review.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the

Minister of State, in reply, mentioned that there  was

a survey in 1975. But 2½ months of 1976 have elapsed,

and  so  would  the  Minister of  State  consider  the

feasibility  -- and  this is in conjunction  with  other

departments  --  of  providing  some  form  of  safety

measure at this traffic junction?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I have already indicated that

"the  situation  will be kept under constant  review."

The  Ministry  of National Development, together  with

the  relevant authorities such as the Traffic  Police,

will  be  too  happy to consider whether  any  interim

measure  could  be  taken  until  construction  of  an

overhead bridge is justified.

<div align="center"><b>RESIDENTS ON SPECIAL PASS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Applications for identity cards)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  and  Education if he has figures  of  persons

residing  in  Singapore  on  special  passes   without

identity cards and if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>



he  will  give the reasons why applications from  such

persons for identity cards have been rejected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs and Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Education (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as on 31St January 1976

there were 1,302 persons who were issued with Special

Passes  to  stay in Singapore. They cannot be  granted

permanent  residence because they do not  qualify  for

it.  However, on humanitarian grounds they were issued

with Special Passes to enable them to continue to stay

in Singapore for the time being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the law, only a Singapore citizen or a

permanent  resident is eligible for the  issue  of  an

identity  card. So long as these Special Pass  holders

are  not  granted permanent residence in Singapore  in

accordance  with Immigration rules, their applications

for identity cards will have to be refused.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Minister

aware  that  some people have lost their  eligibility

for  identity  cards because of the fact  that  their

names in their birth certificates were mis-spelt?  As

a  result of this error, when the holder of  the  old

paper  identity  card applied for the  new  laminated

identity card -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ho. I am still waiting for your supplementary question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, my supplementary question is

this.  Is the Minister aware that the complaint  about

rejection of applications for identity cards is due to

the  mis-spelling of the applicant's name in the birth

certificate?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am aware of

such cases. But if it is a matter of mis-spelling of a

name  in  the birth certificate, and if there  is  any

other   documentary  proof  that  the  applicant   was

actually  born  in Singapore, then of course  the  old

identity card would not be withdrawn. If there  is  no

documentary  proof, then there is no conclusive  proof

that this particular person was born in Singapore  and

he  would  not  be entitled to either  citizenship  or

permanent  residence. As a result, the  identity  card

which was issued by mistake would be withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



Nevertheless, on humanitarian grounds, he is  given  a

Special  Pass  to enable him to continue  to  stay  in

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just

a  matter of clarification. I am wondering whether the

Minister would care to give a few examples of what  he

means by "satisfactory documentary proof".



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I cannot give

examples.  But the point is that "satisfactory  proof"

would be documentary proof that will enable any person

to   come  to  the  conclusion  objectively  that  the

applicant  was actually born in Singapore.  Otherwise,

without that satisfactory proof any person who was not

born  in  Singapore  could  make  such  a  claim   and

therefore it would not be objective and fair to  grant

that person the benefit of the doubt.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in the case of those  people  who  are

studying in Singapore, may I ask whether their  school

leaving   certificates.  PUB  bills,   and   medical

certificates can be accepted as documentary evidence?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, school records, medical

certificates,  and  so  on,  may  form  part  of   the

documentary proof. But, nevertheless, they may not  be

conclusive  evidence  of  birth  in  Singapore.   Much

depends on the merits of each particular case, because

an  applicant may not have been born in Singapore.  He

may  have  been  brought  into  Singapore  to  do  his

schooling here, which does not mean that he  was  born

in  Singapore.  As  I have said,  each  case  will  be

treated  on its own merits, and documents like  school

records  may  help to establish one way or  the  other

whether or not he was born in Singapore.

financial  policy of the Government for the  financial

year  1st April, 1976 to 31st March, 1977 " [Minister

for Finance]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed



<br><br>2.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  the  last two decades or so, we in Singapore  have

faced a few crises



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>



and have overcome them. The resilient and hard working

people   of  Singapore  will  respond  positively   to

whatever problems we may have to face, if we take them

into  our confidence and explain to them frankly  what

the odds against us are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we became independent in 1965, against

unpredictable  odds,  we  were  able  to  launch   our

industrialisation programme successfully.  Every  true

Singaporean had put his shoulder to the wheel so  that

we   could  progress  comfortably  as  an  independent

nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in 1968 when the British announced their total

withdrawal  we were faced with a massive  unemployment

problem.  Together  with our  workers,  we  took  bold

decisions   that   created  a  climate   for   massive

industrial  investment. As a result of this  bold  and

unprecedented   cooperation  between  Government   and

labour, we  enjoyed a period of full  employment  and

prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps now, we are facing yet another crisis which

we  have  to face squarely and decide on a  course  of

action which though might be unpalatable in the  short

term, would accrue benefits to the Singaporeans in the

long run.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the euphoria of almost full employment two

years  ago,  we  are at the moment  facing  the  bleak

prospect  of serious unemployment. We have to  prepare

ourselves and plan constructively to create new  jobs.

In  the  last  two years, for the first time,  we  had

large scale retrenchments in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1973 we had almost full employment with no

retrenchment  at all. In 1974 registered  retrenchment

was  1 7.081. In 1975 9,500 and in the last two months

alone,  145  able-bodied workers were  retrenched.  We

must  not only help the retrenched workers to get back

their  jobs but we must also create more jobs to  help

the  unemployed and also create enough jobs for  about

30.000 school leavers who join the labour market every

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is projected that in the next two years we will

have to create a total of 84,000 new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



jobs  in  order  to  achieve a  target  of  reasonable

employment. This is going to be a gigantic task unless

the  Government, the workers and our entrepreneurs can

chart  out  a plan of action to attract new industries

and capital investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade unions in the developed countries argue that

their overseas investment has resulted in loss of jobs

for their own nationals. They are, therefore, mounting

pressure  on  their own governments and industries  to

prevent   the  export  of  their  capital   investment

overseas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our prospective investors from the developed

countries  will not come to Singapore  as  eagerly  as

they  have  done in the past. The potential  investing

nations  like  the United States, Western  Europe  and

Japan,  are  themselves  facing tremendous  opposition

from  their own trade unions against expansion outside

their  home bases. It is estimated that in the  United

States   alone  there  are  almost  8  million  people

unemployed.  This  is  almost  8%  of  their   working

population.  Developed countries in Europe  like  West

Germany. Britain and France, each have over 1  million

unemployed  workers,  and  Japan  is  in   a   similar

predicament.  With  the investment prospect  being  so

bleak, what do we do?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must make Singapore once again attractive to

overseas  investors.  We  must  make  sure  that   our

manufactured products are of high quality and  cheaper

than  those produced by our competitors. This  can  be

done  if  we can increase productivity and reduce  our

unit  labour  cost.  We made Singapore  an  attractive

place  for  investment an 1968. We can  do  this  once

again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier, our workers will respond

positively  if  we take them into our  confidence  and

explain to them frankly what the odds against us  are.

The  workers' response alone would not be  sufficient.

Similar  responses  should  be  forthcoming  from  our

executives,  managers, manufacturers,  industrialists

and  entrepreneurs. Sacrifices are called for not only

from   the  workers  but  also  from  the  executives,

managers, supervisors,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



businessmen  and civil servants: in other words  every

sector of our nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The almost full employment that we had in the past

and  also  the high standard of living we are enjoying

in Singapore, with reasonable wage increases, has made

the   ordinary  man-in-the-street  in  Singapore  over

confident   and  complacent  about  his  future.   The

attitude of "all is well" is over-prevalent. A greater

effort is needed to bring home to our people the stark

realities of life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manufacturers will have to continue to search

for  new  markets for our manufactured goods.  We  can

also   look   into  the  possibility  of   introducing

protective tariffs on selected items that are  locally

produced  in excess, due to depressed markets  abroad.

The  possibility  of  at least a limited  preferential

trading can be pursued within the ASEAN market. I have

in   mind   items  like  electronic  calculators   and

transistors which are being produced in Singapore  and

which  are also being dumped in the local market  from

overseas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manufacturers, especially the local ones, must

be  tough and high pressure salesmen. They must go out

to  compete  and to sell. They seem to be over-reliant

on  the  Government, asking for one concession or  the

other.  While  asking the workers  to  work  hard,  to

reduce  cost,  to  increase  productivity,  they  must

themselves set good examples of what they preach. When

workers  are  asked to economise and  cut  costs,  the

executives  and  managers should not  be  seen  to  be

changing  the  fleet of management Mercedes-Benz  cars

every three to five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of our biggest labour intensive industries is

ship-building  and  ship-repairing.  In  recent  years

shipyards  have grown rapidly in Jurong. Tanjong  Rhu.

Sembawang, etc.  Recently  we  hear   of   declining

prospects  in this particular sector, and  there  have

been  retrenchments.  This  is  a  serious  cause  for

concern. Fierce competition is being felt by our local

shipyards  from  Hong Kong, and especially  Japan.  In

order  to keep the Japanese workers employed  and  the

shipyards going, large ship-builders in Japan are  now

successfully competing with our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



shipyards  in the building of small barges and  small-sized craft. They are successfully bidding against our

local  shipyards in ship-repairing and reconditioning.

Our  shipyards, in order to remain competitive, should

be  able  to  provide faster service  and  competitive

costing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on the statutory boards

and   Government-owned   commercial   and   industrial

enterprises  either wholly owned or on a joint-venture

basis.  Recently the Minister for Labour, as  well  as

the  Hon.  Minister  for  Finance,  commented  on  the

desirability  of  improved personnel management.  This

improvement  in  personnel management  and  industrial

relations  is required not only in the private  sector

but  also  in  the  Government-owned  enterprises  and

statutory boards. They too in many instances lack  the

correct attitude in their industrial relations branch.

They  think they have the protection of the Government

as  Government-owned enterprises, and yet they  refuse

to  adopt the same attitude of the Government  towards

responsibility  to  their staff and  understanding  of

their  problems. We are aware of some Government-owned

enterprises  and their subsidiaries with unenlightened

industrial relations' attitude in their dealings  with

the  trade unions. I know of one statutory board where

a  senior member of the staff, in answering a query by

the  union raised in a polite letter in respect  of  a

promotion exercise, replies and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As you are fully aware of the provisions of the

Industrial Relations Act (Cap. 124), you will  realise

that it is futile for me to send the union any further

guidelines  of promotion since the union will  not  be

able  to  act  on them, However, their generality  and

simplicity  will only serve to insult the intelligence

of  anyone.  The delay in replying to your  letter  is

regretted, but it never ceases to amaze the management

on the  extent at which the union will go to  select

futile issues.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the view of this senior officer of a Government

statutory  board,  the query is a futile  issue.  Such

attitude  by  senior officers of Government  statutory

boards  would only bring disruption to good industrial

relations, to say the least.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has invested large sums of money in

some private enterprises as joint ventures in order to

promote  industrialisation and employment.  There  are

also  some  large  industries  wholly  owned  by   the

Government. Many of these wholly owned industries form

subsidiary companies and joint ventures on  their  own

for  supporting  services. While not criticising  such

enterprising expansion of these companies, they should

be   told   to   be  cautious  of  proper   financial,

supervisory  and  management  control  by  the  parent

company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These enterprises are increasing and expanding. Some

wholly  owned  enterprises  are  also  expanding   and

opening up joint ventures abroad. While congratulating

these  enterprises on their business  acumen  and  far

sightedness,  may I suggest that we are still  new  in

the international industrial competitive world and  if

our  enterprises  are  not  careful,  they  would   be

swallowed-up by bigger sharks in the industrial field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our own industries must first look into the

possibility  of expanding locally in order  to  create

employment   for   our   own   nationals, even    if

profitability   is   smaller  compared   to   overseas

investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of a large Government-owned industry which,

having  been exempted by law from obtaining  workmen's

compensation  insurance, continued to  insure  with  a

commercial  enterprise for workmen's compensation.  By

so  doing, it resulted in a financial benefit  to  the

commercial insurance firm and a loss to the  industry.

Having  realised  this at a later date,  the  industry

innocently  applied  to  the Ministry  of  Labour  for

exemption  only  to  be  told that  they  are  already

enjoying   such   a  privilege.  This   is   only   an

illustration to show that proper management control of

our own enterprises is called for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our top civil servants and other suitable Government

nominees  sit  on the Boards of these Government-owned

enterprises  and partnership companies. In  their  own

Ministries  they  are  already  over-worked  to  their

limit,  and  they could not possibly  be  expected  to

devote fully to the workings of these enterprises.  It

would be unfair to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



expect them to do so. The burden of responsibility  of

scrutiny  and  control of proper management  of  these

enterprises  must rest with the Ministry  of  Finance.

And with the present position of the establishment  in

the  Ministry of Finance where there is a shortage  of 196 Division I officers. I fear that the situation  is

going  to be extremely difficult, Large sums of public

funds are invested in these enterprises which are  not

accountable  either  to  shareholders  or, in   this

respect,  to Parliament. This makes the responsibility

of  the  Ministry  of  Finance, in  respect  of  these

enterprises, greater than we can reasonably expect.  I

hope  the Minister for Finance will give very  serious

consideration   to   the   possibility   of   `having.

sufficient  checks  and balances  in  respect  of  the

management of these Government enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one area which the Government has to look into

is  in respect of a revision of entertainment expenses

to various Ministries. In the past few years, the cost

of  living  has  gone  up  and  so  has  the  cost  of

entertainment.  In  order  to  make  amends  for   the

inflationary  cost  of living, adjustments  have  been

made   to   wages.   However,  I   notice   that   the

entertainment  expenses  provided  for   the   various

Ministries have remained static. Most of our Ministers

receive   State  guests  and  other  eminent   foreign

visitors in their Ministries. I have been told by some

eminent visitors from abroad that our Ministers  could

not decently entertain their guests. It appears as  if

that  some  guests of Ministers are only  served  with

soft drinks and in some instances Chinese tea even  at

an  hour  when  they should be served  with  lunch  or

dinner.  I  agree that they should not be lavish  with

their entertainment but, at the same time, they should

not appear to be Shylocks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was customary for the Minister for Labour, who is

here   now,  to  invite  some  prominent  trade  union

officials to dinner at the end of each year  when  the

top  officials  of the Ministry and the  trade  unions

could  meet  in  an  informal atmosphere  and  discuss

problems  of  mutual  interest. This,  I  notice,  has

ceased  in  the last year or two. This is perhaps  the

result of the niggardly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



entertainment expenses allotted. The Government should

revise  the  entertainment expenses  allotted  to  our

Ministries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some Ministers:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> May I, at this juncture,

congratulate  the Minister for Finance  for  producing

Appendix A of the Establishment List in Paper  Cmd.  4

of  1976  showing the vacancy position  in  the  Civil

Service at the beginning of December 1975. If you  can

recall,  Sir, I asked for such a List during the  last

Budget  debate  in  1975. Although the  Minister  then

stated that this was somewhat difficult, I am grateful

that  the  vacancy position at least is provided  this

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, during his Budget Statement, the

Minister for Finance has handed out his quota  of  tax

increases for this month. This month's quota has  been

the  increase  in  import duty on tobacco.  While  not

quarrelling on this tax increase, can I take  it  that

this  tax increase is the only one for FY 76?  It  has

become  the habit of our Government to increase  taxes

or  other  forms  of  revenue not only  during  annual

Budget but periodically in-between budgets. People  in

Singapore do not any more look apprehensively  towards

Budget  statements by the Minister for  tax  increases

because  we  have  a  habit of  increasing  taxes  and

revenue  collection in one form or another  throughout

the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When will this regular imposition of increased

collection of revenue by the Government and  statutory

boards end?



<br><br>3.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I rise

in  support  of the motion by the Finance Minister  on

the Budget policy for FY 76.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must congratulate him for the way he presented the

Budget  statement  and  for the  general  thoughts  on

financial  policy. However, I would like to make  some

comments  on his Budget statement. First of  all,  and

most  notable  is  the fact that the Budget  statement

this year was described variously and by varied people

as "painless,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



friendly,"  etc.  The Budget statement  is  obviously

painless   because  the  Ministry  of   Finance   has

perfected the art of taxing without appearing  to  be

really trying. The Finance Ministry has from time  to

time imposed tax increases and sometimes even without

reference  to Parliament. Quite often,  news  of  tax

increases  come  out  of  golf  courses  long  before

Members of Parliament realise that they are in for  a

new  tax  increase.  I think this  has  very  serious

repercussions, Mr Speaker, Sir, and I would  like  to

make  use  of this opportunity to delve  on  some  of

these thoughts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague, the Member for Telok Blangah, has

mentioned  earlier  on,  in Singapore  today  we  are

breeding a horde of exceptionally powerful top  civil

servants and may I call them "The Magnificent  Seven"

(or Eight, or Nine). I believe that if too much power

is vested in the hands of too few, we may be courting

trouble in the years ahead. As I understand it, these

top   civil   servants  have  been  given  tremendous

incentives  to  remain  at the  top  by  giving  them

directorships of various Government-owned  companies.

As  my  colleague, the Member for Telok Blangah,  has

mentioned  earlier  on, these  people  are   already

heavily  taxed in terms of time and energy  in  their

own Ministries and so how could they possibly give of

their  best to run these various companies which  are

wholly or partly-owned by Government? Sir, I wish the

Finance  Minister  could throw  some  light  on  this

policy  of  appointing  the same  people  to  various

companies.  If you look at company X, the  people  on

the  board  of directors are A, B, C,  D  and  E.  In

company Y, it is B, C, D, E and A. In company  Z, it

is C, D, E, A and B. And it goes on in that fashion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on a matter which I

think would be of common interest, The revenue of the

Republic  of  Singapore comes mainly from  taxes  and

that  taxes come from 20% or 30% of the wage  earning

population.  Therefore, it means that something  like

70%  of wage earners have, in one way or another, not

been paying taxes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



We  all  know  that if the Finance Ministry  were  to

apply  its genius (and there is no shortage of genius

in  the  Finance Ministry) taxes could very  well  be

borne  by a greater section of the population.  This,

therefore,  means that this 20% to 30%  of  taxpayers

need  not  shoulder  the  responsibility  of  revenue

contribution. I wish to draw particular attention  to

the  hordes of taxable hawkers, shopkeepers and  such

like  people who, year in and year out, have not been

paying taxes. Many of them are driving around town in

Mercedes Benzes, Jaguars; you name the biggest car on

the  road  and they have it. Yet the Finance Ministry

has  blatantly turned a blind eye to these people.  I

think  they should be taxed. I do not know  how  they

should  be  taxed. I feel humble to make  suggestions

but  I  trust  that the Finance Minister's  officials

will 1ook into this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the third matter is manpower

research.  From  time to time we have faced  problems

with  regard  to  manpower placement, projections  of

manpower  requirements and the supply for  the  years

ahead.  We are, in fact, facing such problems now  as

we  faced them sometime ago, the various problems  of

manpower shortage. I think it is primarily due to the

fact that there is no Central Manpower Planning Unit.

I understand that the Finance Ministry has a Manpower

Research  Unit.  So  has  the  Labour  Ministry,  the

Defence Ministry, and perhaps even the University  of

Singapore. Why can't these various manpower  research

bodies  be  combined into a Central  Research  Centre

whereby  projections can be made for the future?  One

Ministry planning something quite irrelevant to  what

another  Ministry is planning can lead to  a  lot  of

cross-purposes and wrong projections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A last matter which I think would be of current

interest  is  the mini-tax that the Finance  Minister

proposed   this  time,  and  that  is,  the  somewhat

friendly  10% tax increase on cigarettes and tobacco.

On  the matter of a rather moral judgment passed, the

Finance  Minister  called those smokers  "anti-social

elements".  I  am  sure he is aware  that  the  Prime

Minister, in  his  earlier  years,  used  to   smoke

something  like  50  cigarettes  a  day.  I  am  just

wondering whether in those younger



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



days  the  Prime Minister could be described as  anti-social. On the other side of the argument, the Finance

Minister  said  that  it would  be  wonderful  if  all

smokers were to, now and henceforth, be good boys  and

girls and therefore give up cigarette smoking for  the

sake  of  their health. May I suggest to  the  Finance

Minister that if it is his genuine intention and  also

that  of the Government to be concerned for the health

of  the  people,  then  he should  increase  taxes  on

cigarettes and tobacco by 200%, not 10%. Ten per  cent

is  a  tax  gimmick. I treat it at  that.  With  these

words, Sir, I hope that the Finance Minister will give

us  honest replies. I do hope that he will give us  an

assurance that at least for the coming year there will

be  no  new  taxes between now and the next Budget  so

that  we do not have to sit in front of the television

set every night to wait for the "9 p.m. Shocker".



<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Hon.  Minister  for  Finance  has  described  our

economy's  performance in 1975 as a  fair  one  though

disappointing  compared with the double  digit  growth

rates  of earlier years. I have studied carefully  the

figures  that he presented to this House, and I  reach

the conclusion that our economic performance last year

was a very poor one. Unemployment rose to at least 6%.

Our  two engines of growth, manufacturing and entrepot

trade,  went  into  reverse thrust,  though  signs  of

recovery  became evident in the second  half  of  last

year.  We  cannot  congratulate  ourselves  that   our

services  sector  provided some  compensatory  growth.

Hon.  Members  can  refer  to  columns  47-52  of  the

Economic  Survey where they can see that we  increased

our  GDP  last  year by making more  telephone  calls,

riding  in  more taxis and buses, living in  more  HDB

flats,  and using more electricity, gas and  water  in

our  homes. These things certainly improve our welfare

but  they  hardly provide us with any  wherewithal  to

sustain  our  future  standards of  living.  In  other

words,  we  were  living on the fat  of  past  capital

accumulation!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members can refer to Tables 2.3 and2.6 of the

Economic Survey (cols. 135-6 and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>



143-4)  where they will see the heavy contribution  by

the  Government sector in both consumption and capital

formation  last year. What is particularly  disturbing

is the negative rate of real private capital formation

of -7.5%. Despite the substantial increase of 21.9% in

the  Government  sector's capital  formation,  overall

capital formation turned Out to be -2.1%. This means a

diminution  in  the rate of growth of  our  productive

capacity and employment generation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to refer Hon, Members to Table XX

on cols. 95-6 of the Economic Survey entitled "Changes

In  GDP Deflators. 1973-75". Two important points  may

be  noted.  One  is  that,  while  imported  inflation

subsided substantially, our GDP deflator, which is  an

index  of inflation, still rose by at least 5 percent.

Table XIII on cols. 85-6 shows that our wages rose  on

the  average by 7 percent last year. The question that

must  be posed is whether our NWC recommendation  last

year and in previous years did not result in cost push

inflation last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that Hon. Members might wish to note

in  Table XX is the surprisingly low increase  in  the

deflator  for  the  Service  Sector  of  only  3%.  In

particular, the  deflator for  Wholesale  and  Retail

Trade,  Restaurants and Hotels rose by only 1 percent.

Given  the share of this sector of 28 percent of  GDP,

another  4  percent rise in the deflator would  reduce

our overall real GDP growth to about 3 percent. Now. I

am not saying that a mistake has been made but I would

feel  more  comfortable with some official explanation

for  the  much below average increase in the  deflator

for the Services Sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to our prospects for the current

year.  As the Minister for Finance has rightly  noted,

the economies of the U.S., Europe and Japan are in the

process of recovery from the worst recession since the

Great  Depression. Given the slack in  our  trade  and

manufacturing,  our  immediate  prospects  are   good.

particularly if we can find new markets for  petroleum

products.  Members will note that the value added  for

petroleum  products in 1975 was barely  two-thirds  of

that in 1974.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our medium-and longer-term prospects are more

worrisome.   Much   would  depend  on   the   economic

performance  of  the  advance  countries  and  on  how

potential  investors look at Singapore as a  base  for

their  activities. The economic outlook for the  world

economy over the medium and long term depends on  four

interrelated factors:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Price of Petroleum



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this morning's headlines, at least over the

short  and  medium term, I believe we can  expect  the

price  of  petroleum to rise inexorably. Hon.  Members

will note that OPEC was able to raise the price of oil

by  10% last year in the face of world recession which

had  reduced the demand for oil. This June or July  we

can  expect a 10-15% rise in the price of oil, for two

reasons. Firstly, world demand will rise significantly

with   economic   recovery.  Secondly,   contrary   to

expectations, most OPEC countries have  been  able  to

spend  substantial amounts of their oil revenue.  Hon.

Members  should  be warned not to mistake  the  public

posturing for real. Some OPEC governments are  in  the

process  of buying back oil concessions at  the  least

price possible; hence they would not wish to encourage

anticipation  of  further increase  in  the  price  of

petroleum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Prices of Food and Raw Materials



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second factor concerns the prices of food and

raw  materials.  Hon. Members will remember  how  food

prices  contributed  significantly  to  our  inflation

particularly  in  1973-74.  World  grain  stocks   are

generally  low  so that minor harvest  variations  can

lead  to  big  swings in food prices. Had  the  Soviet

Union  not reportedly slaughtered substantial  numbers

of  cattle and poultry last year, thus reducing  their

grains  import  requirements significantly,  our  food

prices would have gone up instead of going down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the world economy recovers, we can also expect

raw  material  prices to rise. Members will  note  the

extensive world debate about whether or not there will

be  shortages of food, basic materials and energy.  On

the basis of facts presented, it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



difficult  to  tell  who is right and  who  is  wrong.

However,  we should bear in mind that vested interests

are  involved. Interestingly enough, since the  energy

crisis  and the formation of other commodity  cartels,

the  Club  of  Rome has back-tracked from its  earlier

pessimistic  forecasts.  In  my  view,  however,   the

success of OPEC and the recent volatility of food  and

commodity prices, plus the inexorable march  of  world

population,  should be sufficient  causes  for  alarm.

Singaporeans should not expect the recent falls in the

price  of  rice  to  be  a  permanent  and  continuing

process. For the world as a whole, shortages of  food,

materials  and  energy will mean lower  standards  and

higher  costs  of  living  unless  counterbalanced  by

technological progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Technology



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my third point. I have been

watching the economic recovery in the U.S, with  great

interest.  So  far, the recovery has been  based  upon

replacements of inventory and some rise in consumption

demands,  but  very  little  investment,  The   weekly

magazine.  The Economist, has noted that "the  average

age  of  industrial equipment in Europe at the end  of

this 1974-76 recession is older than it was at the end

of   the  1970-71  recession;  while  in  America  all

capitalists   have  ambitious  contingent   investment

programmes for the future". So The Economist concluded

that  the  prospects are cheerful that the  industrial

countries   may  pull  out  of  this  recession   with

investment-led recovery. However, I would hesitate  to

leap to the same conclusion. Investments can be viewed

as comprising three components:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) replacement investment of aged equipment



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) investment to meet demands of increasing population and affluence for existing goods and services, and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) investment stimulated by new technology which result in new goods and services being demanded



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economists and governments usually act as though,

with  the right incentives via tax rebates and  lower

interest   rates,   new   investments   are    easily

forthcoming.  The first two categories of  investment

that I mentioned earlier do indeed respond



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>



accordingly.  However, the third  type  of  investment

depends  on  technological  innovations  about   which

economists  know very little. Yet. I strongly  suspect

that, without   such  innovative  investments,   the

industrial  countries will suffer from dynamic  under-employment as opposed to the static kind of  Keynesian

unemployment.  In my view, technical innovations  take

place  in  two stages. The first occurs when some  new

idea  strikes  some obscure scientist in  some  humble

laboratory. Years, perhaps decades or centuries later,

such new ideas may be implemented commercially via the

much vaunted Research and Development of corporations.

A breakthrough like the steam engine, jet engines, the

transistor and petrochemicals leads to the creation of

whole  new  industries,  resulting  in  much  economic

growth  and new employment because even old industries

benefit  from  the  input demand and expenditure  from

rising   incomes,  The  trouble  is  that  we   cannot

guarantee  sufficient innovations. Witness the  meagre

results  of  billions  of dollars  of  expenditure  of

brilliant  manpower and expensive equipment in  cancer

research.  In  the  current world  economic  recovery,

therefore,  the advanced countries and the  developing

countries  in  consequence, may suffer from  prolonged

unemployment, if there is inadequate investment of the

innovative  type.  If this should be  the  case,  more

inflation will result as Government frantically try to

prevent   unemployment   by   Keynesian   pump-priming

techniques of deficit financing and increases in money

supply.   Moreover.   Governments,   hard-pressed   by

unemployment,  may  try to export it  via  competitive

devaluations  of their currencies and  via  protective

trade  measures  The recent turmoil in European  money

markets involving sterling and the French Franc  is  a

symptom of what I am describing. Unfortunately, we can

only watch with anguish to see if new investments  are

sufficiently  forthcoming in the  advanced  countries.

Members   will   note  that  virtually  every   report

indicates   the   seriousness   and   persistence   of

unemployment in the industrial countries  for  several

years  to  come, and I believe the Member  for  Telok

Blangah made an earlier reference to the same point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. International Monetary Arrangements



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth point concerns international monetary

arrangements.  In November last year, the  leaders  of

the   six  largest  industrial  nations  met  at   the

Rambouillet   Summit  to  try  and  coordinate   their

economic  policies. Among the agreements reached  were

presumably those measures adopted by the International

Monetary  Fund's  committee  on  monetary  reform   in

January this year at Jamaica. In particular, the major

industrial  countries agreed to contain  gyrations  in

exchange  rates of their currencies by mutual  support

operations. The official price of gold was  abolished.

In addition the IMF will sell off 1/6th of its gold to

benefit  poor developing countries and return  another

1/6th  to member-countries. The committee also  agreed

to  boost  IMF  quotas by 33%, thus  increasing  their

borrowing capacity accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I view all these measures as inflationary. Already,

the  floating  of exchange rates has made  governments

feel  freer  in  disposing of their  foreign  exchange

reserves, since they are no longer committed to defend

exchange   rates   within  fixed  margins.   Moreover.

countries  feel  freer to pursue  their  own  monetary

policies  to meet domestic objectives without worrying

too  much about the balance of payments. The agreement

to   contain  exchange  rate  fluctuations   is   also

inflationary because it attacks the symptoms  and  not

the  causes  of  the  disease. As  long  as  divergent

domestic  imperatives  of unemployment  and  inflation

result  in  different rates of money supply  increases

and  budget deficits, exchange rates cannot be stable.

To  compound  difficulties, relatively  free  capital

movements  between countries will mean that  inflation

will  be  freely  exported and  re-exported.  If,  for

example,  a major industrial country were to  increase

its  money supply unduly compared to others, this will

cause  capital to move out, and its currency value  to

depreciate.  By the Rambouillet agreement,  the  other

major industrial countries will step in to prevent too

large a depreciation of the currency in question. This

results   in  unintended  increases  in  their   money

supplies as domestic currency must be used to  buy  up

foreign exchange.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abolition of the official price of gold

increases  the value of gold reserves by a  factor  of

three as the market price is at least three times  the

official  price  of  gold. This effectively  increases

world reserves by some US$80 billion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, from the analysis of the four factors of

prices   of   petroleum,  food  and   raw   materials,

technology and international monetary arrangements, we

can  conclude that while the world economy  should  do

well  this year, and perhaps the next, the longer term

outlook is clouded with much uncertainty. Inflation is

an abiding problem even though excess capacity of some

10-20%  has been reported. Bottlenecks will  occur  as

the  excess capacity is not uniformly spread  and  the

velocity  of  circulation  of  money  will  rise  with

increasing economic activity. Hence, unless the  world

has  a  good  harvest this summer and  OPEC  exercises

restraint,  we  can expect prices to be  on  the  move

again in the second half of the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then can we conclude about Singapore's economic

prospects? This year, and perhaps 1977, we  should  do

reasonably well, perhaps briefly even touching double-digit  growth rates again. However, unemployment could

become   a   serious   problem, if   sufficient   new

investments are not forthcoming. We should not  forget

that  we  are in keen competition with other countries

and  with other regions. We face what may be described

as  a  sandwich problem. In low technology areas, our

existing  industries can expect, tough competition  as

other  developing nations learn the ropes of industry.

In  higher  technology fields, we must  attract  firms

from  the  advanced countries and upgrade our existing

ones.   Both  are  not  easy  to  achieve.  It   would

consequently be fatal for us to indulge in euphoria as

we  recover from the recession. Instead, we should re-examine  our  work habits and attitudes.  Do  we  take

sufficient pride in our work, or do we care  only  for

quick  profits  and quick returns? Do we  deserve  the

wage  and  salary increases that we have had over  the

past several years? Our young



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



graduates  from the schools, colleges and universities

should  orientate  their attitudes  correctly  -  they

should  display  eagerness to learn  and  proper  team

spirit, take great pride in their work and expect  to

work hard for their promotions and wage increases.  In

times  of general economic boom even mediocre managers

and  executives can be successful; in times  of  tough

competition, only the ablest and the fittest survive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, if our economy is to stand up to the

rigours of international competition and if we are  to

weather  future recessions successfully, our  services

and  products must bear the hallmarks of  quality  and

reliability   and  our  people  and   leaders   should

demonstrate  the  capacity to bear sacrifices  and  to

respond  to  changing conditions with minimum  trauma.

Our  economy was hard hit in the last two years by the

world  recession, Let us make no mistake  about  that?

The  lesson  should not be lost on us as we  face  the

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should re-double our efforts to sell our goods

and  services abroad. In this connection,  the  recent

move  to  set up the export credit insurance guarantee

scheme  is a step in the right direction. The Minister

for  Finance also mentioned that, last year,  we  sent

six  major  trade  missions abroad  while  30  foreign

missions came to Singapore. I hope we can reverse  the

figures in future years!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now offer some comments about recent

developments in ASEAN. The Prime Minister said rightly

in  Bali recently that "the basic question is  how  to

ensure  continuing  stability by stimulating  economic

development to resolve social and political  problems.

Otherwise, increasing disaffection and discontent will

fuel    incipient    insurgencies   into    full-scale

revolutions".  In the other four ASEAN countries,  the

key   economic   problem   is   not   industrial   but

agricultural  in nature. Yet, despite a resolution  to

stabilise    commodity   prices   and   to   intensify

cooperation  in  the production of basic  necessities.

particularly for food and energy, more attention seems

to   have   been  paid  to  industrial   rather   than

agricultural  development in the  region.  The  urgent

need is to improve the lot of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



peasant if communist insurgency is to be contained. In

order  to  attract more investments into  the  region,

ASEAN as an organisation could jointly provide as well

as  seek  investment guarantees for long-term  foreign

investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I offer some comments on some non-economic policy issues in Singapore? I am particularly

concerned about the use of sterilization as a means of

getting children into choice schools and as a means of

obtaining marriage licences for non-citizens.  Fifteen

priests recently voiced their objection to these moves

in  an  open letter to the Prime Minister.  While  the

wording  of the letter is too strong, the moral  issue

is  a  genuine  one.  Government is rightly  concerned

about  excessive population growth but it  should  not

advocate  immoral means to attain its good objectives.

"Render  to Caesar the things which are Caesar's,  and

to  God  the  things which are God's" says the  Bible.

Priests   should   not  govern  but   neither   should

government  attempt  to  influence  individual   moral

choices.  Mr Speaker, Sir, unfortunately I was  abroad

during  the debate on the Abortion Bill. I  take  this

opportunity to register my strong objection  on  moral

grounds. I believe the Member for Punggol is  with  me

on  these issues. With these reservations, I  give  my

support to the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>3.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement

this  year  came  to this conclusion,  "the  financial

policy  outlined  in  this  year's  Statement   is   a

relatively unexciting one." Viewed from the context of

this  budget,  this  conclusion is  correct.  However,

certain exciting financial measures announced earlier,

such  as  increases in car registration fees and  road

tax,  and the way they were announced were not  to  be

found  in  the  Annual Budget Statement.  We  have  no

reason  to believe that such unusual measures and  the

way  they  were announced will not be repeated  before

the next Budget statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in his statement the Minister said

that on 1st February, 1976 the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



total number of vacancies for Division I officers  has

dropped  to 2,414. This is a large number of vacancies

for  Division  I posts. According to his  explanation,

the reason is that the salary scales in the Government

service  cannot  compete with the private  sector  for

such personnel. The point is if these Division I civil

servants  have left their service merely because  they

want  a higher pay, then I think it is better for such

self-seeking officers to leave, This may  be  for  the

good  of  the  Government and the public. However,  if

they  leave  the service not for monetary  gains,  but

perhaps  for the unfair allocation of duties or  their

superior  officers  have been too demanding  on  them,

then the Government should do something to rectify the

situation.  Otherwise, such vacancies  will  never  be

filled satisfactorily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to enhance our efficiency and to compete in

the  international  market, we cannot  just  hope  and

expect  the  workers  alone  to  work  harder  and  be

forbearing. At the same time, we should also hope  and

expect  our  Division I officers to be as  hardworking

and  forbearing as our workers, If we are  all  imbued

with  the  same  sense of national  consciousness  and

place national collective interests above our personal

interests, then there should not be such frequent job-hopping  from  the Government service to  the  private

sector,  Therefore,  I  hope  that  in  filling   such

vacancies  vital  factors such as personal  integrity,

character  and  dedication to service are  taken  into

account.  A  capable  civil servant  without  national

consciousness is not a good civil servant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the only tax increase is that on

tobacco. This measure should be welcome by the  public

for  the  reason  that  it will  discourage  cigarette

smoking and reduce hazards to health. However, as  the

Minister  has  pointed out, despite  warnings  on  the

hazards  to  health  and the ban on advertisements  on

cigarette  smoking, tobacco consumption is  increasing

and many young people are taking to cigarette smoking,

much  to the regret of the Finance Minister. I believe

many  parents  have the same feeling  as  the  Finance

Minister. We are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



all  aware  that  not  a  few  young  people  take  to

cigarette  smoking as soon as they are  inducted  into

the  National Service. Since the Minister  feels  that

tobacco is "poisonous" and smoking is an "anti-social"

act  and  besides it would "increase the risk of  lung

cancer  and  cancer of the nose". I hope  he  and  his

Cabinet  colleagues will try to find out, on  the  one

hand,  why our National Servicemen are taking  to  the

bad  habit  of cigarette smoking so soon  after  their

induction. On the other hand. I hope he will seriously

consider   legislation  to  place  an  age  limit   on

cigarette smoking. For example, just as we have  place

an  age  limit on eligibility to apply for  a  driving

licence,  or an age limit on persons who  want  to  go

into  a  bar,  we can place an age limit on  cigarette

smoking. Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that cancer is not

confined to a particular age group. Therefore, I  hope

the Minister for Finance will try his best to persuade

his  Cabinet Colleagues to give up smoking  early.  In

this  way, they could keep themselves healthy; on  the

other  hand they as elders could literally set a  good

example  to the younger generation. "in speech  as  in

practice".



<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

listened, with growing depression, to the discourse of

the  Member  for  Whampoa upon  our  bleak  future  in

economic  terms. Correct as he may be in his forecast,

the  point  still remains that since the  end  of  the

Pacific  War,  the last ten years -the  years  of  our

independence  - have been by far the most  comfortable

and  satisfying  for the bulk of our  citizens.  True,

there  have been one or two anxieties. In 1968  strict

labour legislation had to be enacted to enable  us  to

face up to the anticipated British withdrawal. In 1969

we   faced  for  a  few  days  the  threat  of   civil

disturbance, and, as has been pointed out  already  in

this  House, the immediate future does not seem to  be

too  good. But by and large 1965-75 has been a  decade

of  impressive and assuring performance. The people  - citizens and leaders - have worked hard to make for  a

swift and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



unprecedented  growth. Our GNP nearly tripled  in  the

last decade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's skyline has been transformed out of all

resemblance  to the old water-front scene  because  of

the  shining  new skyscrapers in the Central  Business

District  and  the high-rise apartment  buildings  the

Government  has  constructed everywhere.  The  general

standard   of  living  of  the  people  has  obviously

improved  with greater than ever consumption of  goods

and services beyond the basic survival needs, and at a

fair  level  of comfort. Money paid Out in  wages,  at

least by employers paying the payroll tax, in the last

financial year was about equal to that paid out during

the whole of the first five years of our independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite such progress, and partly because of it,

there  somehow  seems  to me to  be  some  fundamental

quality  or  qualities  lacking  in  the  Singaporean.

Basically  this  shortcoming consists  of  a  lack  of

concern  for others that amounts in some cases  almost

to  an obsession with selfish interests. Too often,  a

Singaporean  is  disinclined to look  beyond  his  own

immediate circumstances to the realities of the larger

world  around him. He has also generally not been  too

successful  in  striking  a  proper  balance   between

personal goals and group goals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what has been the cause of this unrelenting

devotion  to individualistic and (I am afraid)  short-sighted  goals? It was our own successful development,

and  the high expectations of the material quality  of

living it has engendered, that has perhaps resulted in

this  particular condition. It seems to  me  that  our

strategy   of   emphasis  on  certain  values   deemed

necessary  for development has resulted in a  kind  of

over-kill, inadequately tempered as this strategy  has

been   by   non-materialistic   considerations,   like

cultural   interest,   aesthetic   appreciation,   and

consideration of religious and traditional values.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what generally are the virtues, the qualities of

our development-oriented persons that we have only too

well succeeded in inculcating? They are chiefly (a)  a

powerful  need for achievement. (b) the urge  to  act.

(c) far-sightedness, in terms of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



opportunity for material advancement, (d) interest  in

career, not  necessarily  in  a  job  -what  may  `be

described  as  low  job primacy, (e)  high  motivation

towards  material returns, (f) occupational  mobility,

and (g) indifference to religious or cultural matters.

With  this  array, it is no wonder that  we  have  had

examples  of  young civil servants  leaving, after  a

while,  for  greener and richer pastures.  At  another

level,  job-hopping  was recently a  noted  phenomenon

among  our young people. And we have also, as a result

of  this development-orientation, a preoccupation with

a  task, with a job, with something to do and perform,

and  very  little  concern for  the  person,  for  the

individual,  for  other graces.  And  indifference  to

religious and cultural matters has not made things any

better  in this respect. And for this reason I applaud

what  the  Member  for Whampoa said in  the  last  few

sentences of his speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly, a factor contributing to our

inordinate sense of well-being and complacency is  the

kind  of praise that we have constantly received  from

outside.  Many of the views representing  what  others

say  about us all over the world are expressed by such

references as dazzling growth:

extraordinary techniques of statecraft; Singapore  has

broken  inexorably  with the  past  and  leaped  self-assuredly  into  the  future  with  a  roar  that   is

resounding  round  the world; our  life-style  has  no

parallel  in  Southeast Asia. We  stand  high  in  the

esteem  of the most developed countries of the  world.

We are the political light of the region. Singapore is

the  most  remarkable city on earth - and so on,  with

adulation far exceeding criticism. I wonder how  these

writers   and   journalists  who  have   echoed   such

resounding praise of Singapore would treat  us  if  we

get into serious difficulty, especially as a result of

the  possible over-confidence that such adulation  can

engender.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time our own newspapers are not backward

in taking up this same cue of pandering to the ego and

conceit  of the Singaporean. Headlines have said  that

Singapore  is  the best base for oil supply;  so  many

million  dollars have been spent to do this, that  and

the other. Singapore is the top



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



regional  centre  for  such and such  kind  of  trade.

Singapore  is the top tourist spot in Asia.  Singapore

is  a centre for technical expertise. Singapore is the

top  maker  of  "jackups", whatever  that  may  mean.

Singapore will be the first Asian country possibly  to

greet  the two millionth tourist in 1979. There  is  a

Singapore  way  to  a  richer  ASEAN.  These  headline

impressions  were  gathered from about  a  fortnight's

reading  of two English language newspapers. Even  our

road taxes have become the talk of the world!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this kind of ambience. Mr Speaker, Sir, how do

you  expect  a young emerging community  to  react?  I

shall  tell  you.  Mr  Speaker. Sir.  Recently  I  had

occasion  to  review essays written by  students  from

higher educational institutions in Singapore, who were

competing  for  scholarships to attend summer  schools

abroad.  Too frequently, when these students  referred

to  Singapore, they reflected a sense of  complacence

and superiority from Singapore's success. It seemed to

me  they felt that with Singapore the way it was,  the

whole world was their oyster. Do you think, Sir,  that

such smugness can help in developing a sense of social

responsibility?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many indications of inability or

reluctance to subordinate personal interest  to  group

interest.  Look  at the way industrial accidents  have

happened.  From  another angle, if  you  look  at  the

conditions in which workers are frequently transported

to  their  place of work, loaded in open lorries,  you

will  feel  here  another indication of  the  lack  of

concern for people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In various spheres of activity, further

illustrations may be found. In national service  there

may  be enough instances to show how the eagerness  to

look forward to the run-Out date (ROD) has resulted in

a  lowering of concern with continuing responsibility.

On  another  point, I have heard of cases of  national

servicemen  losing items of equipment issued  to  them

and,  instead  of taking the responsibility  for  this

loss,  they expropriate the missing item from somebody

else who is left to shoulder this responsibility if he

is unable to steal from somebody else



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



again.  Inasmuch  as  it has been found  difficult  to

retain administrative officers in the civil service, I

would not be surprised if the same difficulty is faced

in  the SAF of recruitment into the officer-class  and

retention of officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is skiving in the Special Constabulary: a

reluctance  to  do  the small national  service  stint

because of the boredom of the activity. Again, here it

is  not  the thought of service, the subordination  of

individual   interest   to   the   group   need,   but

inconvenience to self that is the paramount concern in

many instances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another way, complaints not too long ago about

the  poor standards of finish in the building industry

are  also  a pointer, Take for example, all  that  has

been said about the quality of finish in HDB flats. We

meet with many instances, when we order a service or a

good,  of  eagerness to get a job done and be finished

and  for  the bill to be settled as soon as  possible.

One  fairly  persistent example of  this  is  the  way

contractors do road surfacing work. Because of lack of

supervision  I  am  sure that in many  instances  such

contractors  are allowed to get away with sub-standard

work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the roads, you see how self-centred the motorist

is.  Instances of aggressive driving and lack of  road

courtesy  abound.  Sometimes this egotism  has  become

obsessive  as  when  misunderstandings  arising   from

motoring  incidents have led to ugly  scenes.  Once  a

Mercedes-flaunting young executive or businessman  was

booked  by a traffic policeman for a parking  offence.

The  owner  of  the  Mercedes  disdainfully  told  the

policeman  that he could pay quite easily the  traffic

fine  he  expected would be imposed, and promised  the

Traffic  policeman that he would come back to  indulge

his expensive parking habit again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My reference to the Mercedes has put me in mind of

top  civil  servants. In their case too, preoccupation

with their special concerns has sometimes pushed aside

more  civil  considerations, The  Head  of  the  Civil

Service has mentioned that in a number of instances



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



civil  servants have contrived to get laws  passed  to

enable  them to do their work more easily. I would  go

further  to say that, if necessary, the civil  servant

will now and then even ignore legislation in order  to

suit his own convenience. For example, a few years ago

we  had  a publicised instance of the law relating  to

advanced accounts not being observed, and this was the

subject of some newspaper comment and a reply from the

Ministry  of  Finance.  In this  case, audit  reports

pointed  out  the fact of advanced accounts  exceeding

the  authorised limits for the years 1965 to  1969/70,

but no attempt was made to seek Parliament approval to

raise the limit until 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then we have continued to meet with similar

instances  of the law not being observed.  Two  recent

examples  come  to  my mind: one, in  respect  of  the

valuation   of   our  investments  in  our   financial

statements, and another the failure to  show  certain

civilian  posts  under  Expenditure  on  Manpower  (as

required  by  law), instead of under  Other  Operating

Expenditure,  of  the  Ministry  of  Defence  Head  of

Expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes to make the law more applicable were not

instituted until these irregularities were reported to

Parliament.  In this connection. I am not saying  that

we should retain outdated regulations, but if what has

been  laid down by Parliament is considered not to  be

applicable  under changed circumstances,  then  action

should  be  taken to change regulations promptly;  and

not  just ignore these regulations (in some cases  for

several  years),  thus setting an example  of  placing

expediency  before correct behaviour. If such  actions

reflect  indifferent regard for the authority of  this

House, can  we  expect  the public  to  receive  more

consideration?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underlying all this, we have the background of our

very recent forbears being migrants who were primarily

interested   in  getting  what  they  could   out   of

Singapore. This is well-accepted and has been referred

to  more than once even by our political leaders.  Now

we  have  to  assess to what extent this attitude  has

percolated  down  to  the younger generation.  If  our

schooling has been successful, then our young people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



would  have  different  attitudes.  But  in  the  very

respect  of  a  sense of values directed towards  more

gracious  relations between people, our education  has

not   been  so  successful.  Our  education  has  been

successful   in  emphasising  the  very  developmental

traits that I have referred to earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, we must not take for granted that what is

learnt  in school receives reinforcement at  home.  In

fact,  values  inculcated in school may be  in  direct

conflict  with values at home. One exercise we  should

try  to embark on is to reach Out to the homes to  try

and  engender social support for the values learnt  in

school.  I  am  sure  there will  be  several  Members

dwelling and expanding on this point and similar ideas

when we come to the debate on Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of moulding the right attitudes in

our young people cannot be overemphasised, considering

the   wide   ramifications  of  the  result   of   our

educational efforts. Let us consider. A young man  who

is  about to cast his vote may well have had  all  his

years  of  education and further education  under  our

Government's  jurisdiction. In a few  years'  time  he

will  marry  and begin to have a family. How  will  he

bring  up that family, that second generation  of  our

Singaporeans?  Presently  our  young  people  are  not

against  the  Government; they are not  anti-national,

they  are not even anti-PAP. Despite a few who try  to

avoid national service more for reasons of wanting  to

avoid personal discomfort, generally the acceptance of

national  service  shows  that  the  people  are   not

against,  indeed they recognise the need for, measures

taken in the national interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is important to note is this. I do not

think  our  young  people are all fully  committed  to

exactly the same values as the Establishment. This may

be simply because many of them are not certain of what

it  is  that  is  desirable in terms of  the  kind  of

Singapore they want. What one can be certain about  is

that they want to feel that they are participants, not

merely people being directed and told what to do, They

do not want to be part of a system where they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>



are the ruled and others the rulers. They want to have

a say. That is why the People's Association appears to

face  difficulties because it is organising for  young

people.   Perhaps  the  young  people  want  to   find

themselves  in  a  position where  they  can  organise

things for themselves!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more thoughtful and socially motivated want to

participate   in   activities   aimed   at   community

improvement.  It  is in this way that  we  could  help

arrange  opportunities for young people to  understand

worthwhile,  genuine and practical relationships  with

one  another, not the vague, phony rapport and freedom

proclaimed in the advertisements directed at  the  new

generation.  We should help our young  people  find  a

useful  role for themselves, but they want to identify

this role themselves. Certainly we should not tolerate

laziness and skiving, complacence and truculence.  But

we should not treat our young citizens in the same way

as, in the past, the Ministry of Education has treated

our  teachers, many of whom have not yet got over  the

trauma of exposure to over-bearing officialdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our younger citizens have generally not known the

hardships  their  elders  have  experienced  in  their

lifetime.    These    same   older    folk    (perhaps

understandably)  in the flush of good  times  want  to

push  out  of their minds the trouble they have  faced

before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among our younger citizens, those who are reaching

their majority years will remember best these last ten

years  of good going, of more and more consumer  goods

coming  within  their  means  of  enjoyment:  clothes,

entertainment,  TV (including colour),  perhaps  cars,

leisure  outings. They have been assured of places  in

primary schools and enjoyed opportunity to proceed for

further and higher education. In many instances  their

parents  have bought flats built by Government;  these

same  parents  perhaps  with the  disapproval  of  the

Member  for Telok Blangah have spent sizable sums  and

considerable  effort to redecorate and  furnish  these

houses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serious political and national crises, conflict and

wars  are  quite  foreign to  the  experience  of  our

younger citizens. In the West, in socialist countries,

young  people are in some way constantly  reminded  of

how their countries have faced serious situations. For

example,  we ourselves have seen such films on  TV  as

Cities  at  War, World at War, even comedy  programmes

such  as  Dad's  Army.  Our young  people  view  these

detachedly. To a Western youth, they would  be  subtle

insights   to  a  more  turbulent  past  his  parents'

generation   experienced.   Other   things   such   as

memorials, monuments, ceremonies, and so on are  other

forms  of  reminders of grimmer times. Our own  youths

have remained in more blissful condition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The education and social upbringing of our young

people  have not conduced to encouraging them  to  see

their  world  as  a  larger place than  their  housing

estate    and    transcending   parochial    Singapore

circumstances. In this they have not been better  than

their  elders. Schools have stressed examinations  (at

this  level, this is the test of meritocracy). I  have

had  some  thoughtful young people in my constituency,

as  I  am  sure other MPs have in theirs,  complaining

that   newspapers  and  mass  media   and   Government

attention  have not focussed the notice  of  youth  on

concerns  beyond the circle of light  which  they  see

from  inside  their wells. I think we should  consider

carefully  before  blaming a  member  of  our  younger

generation for his limited perspectives, even if  such

perspectives  tend  to  make  him  also  an  egotistic

individual.  Especially when we think of the  sins  of

the fathers being visited upon their children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what can we do about such a circumstance that

has  arisen? Our Government has always worked  on  the

basis of attending to first things first. That is  why

there  has been so much emphasis throughout all  these

years  on economic and material development.  That  is

why  in respect of our education policy there has been

a  stress on the preparation for work, development  of

skills and so on. While we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



certainly cannot let up on our development thrust,  we

should  make  adjustment  for  development  of  values

important  for  society, for harmonious  living,  for

development of rounded and mature citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I think the time has now come for us to

think  of  a  policy  which will  lay  stress  on  the

inculcation  of  healthy  values  which  balance  self

against  the needs of the community, not only  in  our

pupils in school but also more broadly the message has

to be carried across to the adult citizens at home.  I

do  not  mean by policy that we should determine  what

kind  of people we want to produce in specific  terms:

we  cannot make people in the splitting image of  some

preconceived mould; we cannot make people in  our  own

image  and  likeness;  but we want  to  encourage  and

promote  actively the development of a healthy pattern

of  values. This aspect we have before left to develop

incidentally. Now we have to attend to this matter  in

a more deliberate fashion. I think the time is ripe, I

think the problem is urgent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all this, the two Ministries that appear to have

the  most important role to play would be the Ministry

of  Culture and the Ministry of Education. I would not

like to preempt on what may be said when the debate on

education  and culture gets under way, but I  am  sure

there will be plenty said and I would have one or  two

things to say myself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in moments of melancholy, in

respect of these thoughts I have expressed. I may feel

that  indeed a grave situation has arisen.  But  I  am

never  in doubt that the Government, with the help  of

its  Backbenchers,  will  take  successful  action  to

correct  the  situation  -  with  the  help   of   the

Backbenchers.



<br><br>4.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, whilst I rise to

speak  in  support  of the motion moved  by  the  Hon.

Minister  for Finance, I would like to make  reference

to  the  policy on taxation with regard to income  tax

and other matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noted that the revenue from Income Tax is

forecast  to  rise  by  9.1%  to  $1,200  million,  an

increase of $100 million. This is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



contained  in  Table II, page 3, of the Memorandum  on

the Main and Development Estimates of Singapore (Paper

Misc.  4 of 1976). In reply to my question on the  1st

of this month, the Finance Minister asked me to listen

to  his  Budget statement and to bring up this  matter

during  the  debate on his statement. And  the  matter

that  I  brought  up was the question  of  income  tax

reliefs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he said this, Sir, I envisaged that either

there  was  some hope to my question when he indicated

to  this House that he would give a full reply, or  it

may not be. Whatever it may be, Sir, I would still try

my best to make a case for his careful consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being optimistic that our Finance Minister is not

unsympathetic.  I  believe that this  appeal  of  mine

affects  both thousands of middle income group workers

as  well  as  revenue to the State's coffers.  To  the

former, present-day cost of living has shot up  beyond

all proportions, even though the Government is able to

contain  inflation  to a low rate.  Even  though  this

inflationary  rate  has slowed down,  prices  of  most

commodities, however, have not rolled back.  But  what

the  Finance  Minister may not  be  aware  of  is  the

decline  in  the purchasing power of our  dollar.  The

many  thousands of workers have to pay more for  their

refreshments  and meals; the thousands  of  housewives

have  to  pay more for their marketing. Worst of  all,

compulsory  CPF contribution of up to 15% takes  up  a

good  chunk of the workers' wage increases in the last

few  years. Perhaps I have to qualify my statement.  I

am not against CPF contribution. In fact, I am all for

it  because  this  is  a  good policy  as  it  enables

contributors to the CPF to make use of whatever  funds

they  have in the CPF to buy HDB flats, and  now  HUDC

flats. Sir, I know Members are aware of the hard times

ahead as stressed by the Finance Minister, and I would

like to believe that whilst workers have been exhorted

to  work  harder  and expect little increase,  on  the

other  hand  Government can help to  relieve  them  of

having to tighten their belts too much by raising  the

tax reliefs on personal and earned income which at the

moment are $2,000 and $1,000 only. Members will recall

that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



Finance Minister introduced an amendment to the Income

Tax  Act  in November last year (Bill No 52/75).  This

Bill passed by Parliament gave those who are 55 or  60

years of age bigger personal tax reliefs ranging  from

$2,000 to $3,000 respectively. I do not `dispute  that

these  people should benefit from it, but I  certainly

believe that with such difficult times ahead, (in this

manner,  the  Members  for Telok Blangah  and  Whampoa

probably  share  my view) the Finance  Minister  could

easily  accommodate  the  younger  taxpayers.  On  the

presumption  that $1,000 as tax relief is  granted  to

say.  25.000  taxpayers  in the  middle  income  group

bracket,  this may cost a shortfall of $25 million  in

revenue; but Hon. Members will not disagree when I say

that  it  will bring true relief to the many thousands

of the middle income workers and their families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I envisage that the Finance Minister in reply would

most  probably  say that we are most generous  in  the

granting  of  tax  reliefs,  for  example, those  who

maintain  their aged parents are entitled to a  relief

of $750 for each parent living with them; another $300

for  maintaining a garden properly. Allow me to  point

out  that  more  than half of the  population  of  our

country  are  now  living in HDB flats  and  that  the

question  of relief for the maintenance of gardens  is

out.  Vet  HDB  flat dwellers have to pay  conservancy

charges which go towards maintenance of open spaces in

HDB estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, I believe that the Government can play a

greater  role through granting bigger tax  reliefs  to

the  wage earners, especially in these hard times. Ten

years ago, when not many people lived in HDB flats,  a

worker earning $300 per month could easily maintain  a

family of three children, as rental was cheap and cost

of living pretty low. Today if a worker earns the same

amount,  he  has  to  contribute to  the  CPF  and  to

maintain his family. This sum has to go towards paying

for  his  flat at monthly instalments or  rental,  PUB

bills,  daily needs, children's education,  transport,

etc.  Therefore. Members can easily conclude that this

is inadequate. This is the reason why I am making this

impassioned  plea to the Finance Minister to  consider

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



matter.  Hon. Members would be interested to  note  an

article  in  the  Straits  Times  of  5th March, 1976

headlined "Only one in 8 earning $600 or more" wherein

it states that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nearly 75% of the 873.000 workers employed in

Singapore  last year earned less than $400  per  month

according to a Government survey on the labour force'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a question of narrowing the gap between

the  haves and have-nots; I am not referring to it but

this is a matter of paramount importance vital to  our

survival  viewed from a point where inflation  in  the

last  few years has eroded consistently the purchasing

power  of  our  dollar.  I  welcome  the  Government's

exhortations to the people reminding them of the  need

to  be thrifty and to work harder and not to expect  a

bonanza in return; but may I ask the Finance Minister,

is it not a fact that charity begins at home?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the assumption that should such tax reliefs be

given, there would be a fall in revenue collection  as

pointed  out earlier; may I hasten to suggest  to  the

Finance  Minister  that he can levy  through  indirect

taxation on those luxury items which are not basic  to

everyday  needs to recover revenue lost  through  such

tax  concessions. I believe that such  measures  would

bring little ill-effect on the people. In making  this

suggestion, permit me, Sir, to reiterate that  I  have

no wish to tell the Hon. Minister what he should do as

fiscal  matters are his prerogatives and  problems.  I

merely wish to request him to consider not my plea but

the  general feeling of many people about this matter.

Although  the  Budget Statement has been well-received

and  it has been termed as "No Shocks Budget" by  some

quarters,  may I say that the shocks had already  been

made through several tax measures announced at the end

of  last  year  and the very beginning of  this  year.

Naturally that is the reception - no shocks.  But  the

shocks   were  made  before  and  after   the   Budget

Statement.  And probably as the Member  for  Kim  Seng

envisaged, maybe in the middle of this financial year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of CPF contributions that I wish to

touch on, Sir, is the question which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>



has  been asked by some quarters, and that is  at  the

moment  a  ceiling of $4,000 is allowed to a  taxpayer

for  relief.  I am sure the Minister is aware  of  the

fact  that  NWC  increase as well as CPF contributions

have been increased too in the last few years. I would

like to suggest that there should be no ceiling on tax

exemption  for CPF contributions, otherwise  it  would

mean paying tax on the CPF contributions in excess  of

$4,000.  In  this  respect,  life  insurance  premiums

should  also  be  taken  into consideration  as  these

policies are meant to benefit the beneficiaries of the

holder of a life insurance policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of Customs & Excise duties, I believe

that  the  base of income tax should be  extended  and

spread more evenly and as widely as possible. In  this

respect  it would be pertinent to point out, as  shown

in  the Table on comparison of revised estimates FY 75

and estimates FV 76 in the Memorandum, the two largest

increases by way of percentage are items 7 and 8 (Road

Tax and Motor Vehicles -- Ad Valorem Registration Fees

at  $20.4  million and $9 million or 23.3%  and  22.0%

respectively) as against an overall increase  of  8.2%

under Class I -`Transfer Receipts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of AVRF, I do not see excise duty for

locally assembled cars. I am disappointed to see  this

because the impression I gather from the imposition of

surcharge  and  increase  in  road  tax  for   private

vehicles  were  meant to discourage car  ownership  - despite  this, the forecast of revenue  for  road  tax

would  increase from $87.6 million in FY  75  to  $108

million in FY 76. Why is this so?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  are  well  aware  that  Singapore   is

importing more motor vehicles from Japan, followed  by

Europe,  where prices seem to be much lower  than  our

locally  assembled  cars. The latter  is  enjoying  no

excise  duty  which I brought up in a previous  debate

when  import duty/AVRF were increased. I strongly urge

the Finance Minister to look into this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would like to touch on is the

Telecommunications Authority of Singapore. There is  a

forecast drop of 1 .4% out of 8.2% revenue (Class I  - Revenue) to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



be  derived from TAS and telephone bills; in this case

TAS  is  seen as being unable to cope with the  demand

for   telephone  facilities.  This  is  not   a   rash

statement.  I know of many applicants who are  on  the

waiting list. Perhaps, it would be in order to ask why

there are long delays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind therefore, there appears to be some wrong

forecast  in  the  number of lines needed  in  various

housing   estates  both  in  the  public  and  private

sectors.  I  suggest that this problem be looked  into

because  I  cannot  agree  with  the  forecast  of   a

decrease.  In  fact,  there  should  be  an   increase

instead.  As I have pointed out just now,  by  way  of

illustration, this TAS card states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We acknowledge receipt of your application dated

4th August, 1975, the contents of which are receiving

attention of the Sales Department



<br><br>More than six months have elapsed. I am glad that both

the   Hon.  Minister  for  National  Development   and

Communications and his Senior Minister  of  State  are

present. I would like this problem to be looked  into,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion. Sir, may I suggest a table to be

known  as "changes in cost". I would like the  Finance

Minister   to  consider  having  such  a  table.   The

Government has enunciated the principle that,  as  far

as  possible, users of public services be made to  pay

for  such services without being subsidised by general

taxation.  So  we have seen increases in the  hospital

fees,  school  fees. HDB conservancy charges,  refuse,

etc. However, the timing of these increases appears to

be  erratic  so  much so that the  public  are  caught

unawares and they are consequently unable to make tidy

adjustments   or   even   psychological   adjustments.

Moreover,  Government has to explain anew  every  time

increases are made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could not a more orderly procedure and time-table be

adopted  so  that people know that at a  certain  time

each  year,  certain fees or charges will  be  revised

according  to certain standards, like changes  in  the

index  of  cost? Moreover, in order to  reduce  public

resentment.  I  suggest  that  Government   ought   to

consider appointing suitable representative panels  of

competent  people to review the proposed increases  so

as to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



ensure  that the public are not unduly taxed and  that

every   means   is  taken  to  increase   governmental

efficiency.



<br><br>4.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise in support of the motion standing in the name  of

the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Finance Minister has struck a sombre note

in  his Budget Statement laid before this House on 1st

March 1976. Recent political events and trends in  and

around  our  region, coupled with world-wide  economic

problems and difficulties, are beginning to make  even

more  difficult  our national efforts to  promote  and

advance   the   welfare   and  well-being   of   every

Singaporean.  There can already be  discerned  warning

signs of political and economic storms ahead of us. We

can  either  wither  in  the face  of  the  storms  or

survive, depending on how much political will, courage

and  national cohesion we can harness from amongst the

2.2  million Singaporeans. But first we have to  shake

off  the  euphoria that has lulled the senses  of  the

Singaporeans because of the past few years of relative

affluence and prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past few years, not a single day has

passed  without our hearing or reading  the  newspaper

columns about complaints and grumblings about the  bus

service,  increases in road taxes, inadequate personal

reliefs in income tax, and a host of other grievances.

Grumbling by Singaporeans over personal inconveniences

and discomforts has grown from a national past-time to

a  national obsession. I' am not saying that  some  of

these  complaints are not valid. I am not saying  that

the  Government,  in  what it  conceives  as  national

interests  over  the years, has not  been  obliged  to

adopt unpleasant policies and measures which give rise

to   individual  and  sectional  complaints  from  the

public.  What I am wondering is whether our  obsession

with criticising the internal policies and actions  of

Government over a period of years has not numbed us to

the  sense  of  the dangers that lie before  us  as  a

nation  of  both  the political and  economic  fronts.

Singaporeans may find some difficulty



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



in  relating  their personal problems and frustrations

to  the more serious regional and global political and

economic  events that inevitably will  have  more  far

reaching  implications  for  us,  and  in  making  the

necessary adjustment to accept sacrifices for the long-term  interests of our country and ourselves  and  our

fellow citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have in the past risen to the occasion and have

met  far  more  difficult challenges previously  as  a

community  and  as a nation. The older generations  of

Singaporeans know what hardship means because they had

personally experienced hardships in their lifetime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, we have a younger generation of

Singaporeans,  who have grown up during  a  period  of

comparatively good times and have become accustomed to

a pampered life without knowing what is real hardship.

The  comparatively easy life that they have led up  to

now  has  insulated them from the harsh  realities  of

life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir,I, therefore submit, the challenge

that is really before the Government in the course  of

the  next  decade  when we must,  as  a  nation,  sail

through many violent political and economic storms, is

whether  the  Government will be able to mobilise  its

forces and make use of all available avenues like  the

schools   and  other  educational  institutions,   the

community  centres, the media of radio and television,

to  inculcate  in  the  population, particularly  the

younger  generation  of  Singaporeans,  the  sense  of

political  and economic realism and quick reflexes  in

response  to any political and economic changes.  This

challenge. Mr Speaker, Sir, is as crucial to the long-term  well-being  of  Singaporeans  as  the  need   to

intensify  our  national efforts to  create  more  and

better jobs through economic growth and development.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I propose to take the suspension

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker.

Sir,  I rise in support of the motion standing in  the

name of the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like at the outset to join fellow Members in

the  view  that, relative to the economic  adversities

experienced  by  similarly exposed  economies  as  the

result  of  the global recession in 1975, our  economy

has  performed  satisfactorily  at  4.1%  growth.  Our

economy has thus demonstrated a resilience acquired by

the diversification of activities, particularly in the

service sectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This performance we expect would generate some more

confidence  in  the  economy  and  with  it, greater

economic  enterprise  to meet  the  needs  of  a  more

relaxed world, we hope, in the near future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are today 156 years old as a community of peoples

who converged on to this island for a living, 16 years

old   as  a  people  under  the  management  of   this

Government, and  10 years old as a  sovereign  nation

responsible for its own successes or failures. We have

reason to be satisfied with what has been collectively

achieved  in  16  years.  Central  planning  based  on

national  priorities, a dependable administration  and

regulated private enterprise have been key factors  in

the  economic  strategy for survival and success.  But

the  principal force which bolsters this  strategy  is

our manpower. If our manpower can continually increase

its  economicability in both the  public  and  private

sectors, our industrialisation will take off  and  the

resulting economic momentum can be sustained. There is

already  generated  in the manufacturing  and  service

industries  sufficient potential for  the  final  lift

but, markets aside, the primary back-up factor is  our

manpower.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manpower must be able to cope with the

requirements   of   the  manufacturing   and   service

industries at all levels of technology. This calls for

long-range manpower planning to mesh with the economic

directions into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>



the years ahead. Of course there are areas in which it

might  not be prudent to make forecasts as changes  in

science  and technology in the world are taking  place

with   astonishing  rapidity.  But  adequate  manpower

planning  there must be. This is possible because  the

variables involved in manpower planning are relatively

uniform and manageable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore correct that Government should be

spending  $41  million on industrial training  through

the Industrial Training Board and Economic Development

Board  to enhance the economicability of our manpower.

However,  certain questions may be asked in regard  to

the  effectiveness of ITB as it is presently organised

and  managed.  What  is the rate of  drop-out  in  the

course of training? What is the rate of trainees  who,

having  completed training, do not seek employment  in

the  industries?  And what are the  reasons  for  this

situation  aside  of  the explanation  that  wages  in

industry  are  not  attractive? I do  not  expect  the

Minister  to supply me with the answers in his  reply.

But neither have I asked these questions merely to  be

rhetorical.  By these questions. I wish  to  make  the

point  that these moneys which are to be spent by  ITB

and  EDB  for  financial year 1976 should produce  the

expected results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads to that aspect of the problem of manpower

which disturbs all of us - the reluctance of our young

workers  to  accept  employment  these  days  in   the

industries. That they will, in the course of time,  do

so,  is anticipated. But at this point of our economic

growth  we cannot afford to risk the competitive  edge

of our economy being blunted either by youthful labour

copping out of employment for diverse reasons  or  for

the reason that industry has failed to meet their wage

expectations.  With  immigrant  labour   standing   at

100.000   up,   parents  who  are   supporting   their

unemployed adolescent or adult sons who choose  to  be

unemployed   had   better   rearrange   the   domestic

expectations  of  these young men  so  that  they  are

persuaded  into gainful labour for their  own  benefit

and for the lasting economic good of the country.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours is a youthful, vibrant generation of workers.

Those  between  1  5-34  years  above  constitute   an

extremely  high percentage of the economically  active

persons   in  society  numbering  873.000,   If   this

manpower,  our  young  workers,  can  reconcile  their

estimation  of their own worth with the wage  capacity

of  our  industries under the guidance of the National

Wages  Council, and offer good labour for  wages, our

economy  will continue to demonstrate its  resilience,

and collectively we, as a people, will benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said a few words on the question of our

manpower, I wish to refer to another problem which  is

basic.  I will refer to a specific development in  the

field  of  transport and education and, thereafter,  I

will  allude to the shortcoming in the Administration.

There emerged in Parliament in 1974 a hefty debate  on

traffic  congestion  in  the city  area  and  the  bus

transport  system. Following this debate a  number  of

measures  preventive  and penalising  in  nature  were

taken  in  quick  succession. They  caused  much  pain

because  these measures offered the choice  of  sudden

inconvenience or payment. Motorists cringed and  paid.

The  record, that  is, the Hansard, shows  that  the

Backbenchers had already vigorously posed the  problem

of  traffic  congestion and the need for a  sound  bus

transport system as far back as December 1968. Between

1968  and  the end of 1975 no jolting measures  beyond

widening  roads  were  undertaken  to  cope  with  the

problem.   On   the  contrary,  high-rise  development

concentrated in the city. Mass transit commuters  grew

in  numbers.  Then, in a flash as it were, realisation

struck.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of education, critics in the Back-bench

abound.  Again  since 1 968 there were repeated  pleas

for  coherent long-range planning in education.  There

was  sufficient articulation to show that  the  system

was  not  working. An effort in replanning would  have

involved a reconsideration of the economic, social and

cultural  premises  upon which the system  was  based.

This could have thrown up areas of indiscretion, over-zealousness,  irrelevance,  administration  myopia  or

plain  blind-alleys  in education.  Instead  only  the

system was structured and restructured. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>



compartments and corridors were redesigned  when  what

was  required  was  a survey of the building's  entire

layout  and location in relation to the mainstream  of

the  country's educational future. Then again  in  an'

instant,  so  to  speak, there  was  discovered  grave

defects  in education and there was felt the  need  to

remedy these defects in a hurry. These developments  I

have  described  in traffic congestion  and  education

stress the point that there was lacking the effort  to

monitor  the  effects of policies after implementation

and  the  coordination  of  the  effects  of  policies

implemented by Ministers. I put the view that if there

had  been  any  such  effort,  obviously  it  had  not

succeeded,  But on the other hand, if it had,  urgency

of  traffic congestion in the city area and the  slide

into  illiteracy in education would have been apparent

in the early stages and the situation remedied in good

time  without  having to resort  to  a  succession  of

remedial measures which are causing confusion and eco-spasms   in  some  families  as  parents  attempt   to

understand  the meaning of education policies  and  as

they budget to retain the small family car.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government is known to execute its plans for the

prosperity  and security of the country in  accordance

with  the order of priorities it determines from  time

to  time.  Foremost in the list of national priorities

would  be  matters pertaining to the  economy  of  the

country  and  security. But there are  societal  needs

which may not qualify for priority rating on the basis

of   national   urgency  but  which  are  nevertheless

important  social  requisites in  the  development  of

society. These are disregarded today to the poverty of

our   children  in  human  values  tomorrow,  If   the

direction,  along  which  our  society  is  urged,  is

towards   opportunities   for   the   acquisition   of

sufficient  needs, social security and the intangibles

which make the good society, then these needs must  be

met  so  that  our people will be able to  give  their

lives  and  souls  meaning and  contentment.  Suitable

community    centres   are   places   which    provide

opportunities  for interaction among  people.  So  far

down the scale of priorities are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>



community  centres that Government expects  people  to

help  pay  for  the  establishment  of  even  one  key

community  centre  in  each  constituency.  There  are

needed   suitable  TV  programmes  for   the   masses,

programmes which are constructive in the art of living

in congestion and constriction, a feature of the times

we  live in. And other requisities which I shall  deal

with in the debate on the Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to make the comment that there may be

developing a tendency of the Government to ignore  the

need  to  be  rational in its explanation  of  actions

which tax or restrict the public. The case of the  10-year  old  car  is  notorious. The  argument  that  is

offered  to the public is that if the owner  can  meet

the  tax, then  the car is fit to be driven.  So  the

conclusion  drawn is that our roads are fit  only  for

those  who can pay to drive their old cars or who  can

afford to buy new cars. Such actions of the Government

do  not  assist  in strengthening in our  society  the

realisation that we can survive and prosper only  when

the  people and the Government act in concert  in  the

interest of the common good. These are times when  the

people must clearly understand the whys and wherefores

of Government actions affecting their lives because we

are  moving into an increasingly regulated life-style,

and must do so if every one is to have his modicum  of

the good things. People still cherish the style of the

recent  past- the pre-recession, pre-inflation  period

and  will  find  some difficulty in adjusting  to  the

economy of living which has been made necessary for us

by  issues  which are global in origin and effect  and

beyond  our  control. But I say, Sir, as much  as  the

people should not take the Government for granted, the

Government  cannot  afford  to  take  the  people  for

granted.



<br><br>5.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for

Finance  has  described his Budget  Statement  to  the

House as "a relatively unexciting" one, This may be so

if you are not a smoker or you have not been expecting

either shocks or surprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to the large majority of wage earners, the

announcement first of all by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>



Secretary-General of the NTUC and now the Minister  of

the  need  for an adjustment in our wage  policy  must

certainly cause a certain amount of unhappiness. For a

number of years now our workers have come to expect  a

substantial   annual   adjustment   in   wages.   Such

expectation   in   the  past  was  not  unjustifiable.

considering  the  fierce rate of inflation  prevailing

and the satisfactory rate of growth in our economy. As

things  stand today, we are suddenly awakened  to  the

fact that unless something is done and done quickly to

relate wage increases rather more closely to the  rate

of  productivity,  particularly in  the  manufacturing

sector, we shall soon lose our competitiveness in  the

export market. The gravity, of the situation has  been

very  eloquently put forward both by the Minister  for

Finance,  the  Minister for Labour and the  Secretary-General  of the NTUC. I have no doubt that the message

will  have  been  driven home loud and  clear  to  all

unions and their members affiliated to the NTUC.  With

a responsible and enlightened union leadership such as

we  fortunately have in Singapore today, I  feel  sure

that the position will be accepted by all workers even

though some may take it somewhat grudgingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In urging our workers to tighten their belts, it is

in  my view imperative that the Government should take

every step to ensure that the purchasing power of  our

workers  will  not  be  eroded by unjustifiable  price

increases in goods as well as services of an essential

nature   in   the  forthcoming  months.   Whilst   the

Government  has  done  reasonably  well  in   bringing

inflation under control, the various measures taken by

the  Government to stimulate the economy in the months

ahead may yet spark off another round of inflation, if

we  do  not  watch out. For a start I would  urge  the

Government  to  keep a closer watch on all  Government

and statutory charges. The Budget this year, as in the

previous  year,  may be considered  to  be  relatively

painless, but experience has taught us that this state

of  painlessness may not last too long before  we  are

treated  to a whole series of shocks by way of  higher

taxes  and  charges. The combined sum  total  of  such

revised  taxes and charges, taking into  account  both

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



direct  and  indirect effect, quite often far  exceeds

the  wage  increment of an average worker in  any  one

particular  year.  Such frequent increases  have  also

contributed  in  no small measure to  pushing  up  the

costs of our manufacturing products and to that extent

reducing our competitive edge in the export market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In emphasising the importance of improving the

quality  of  our workers, the Minister has  said  that

this  must  be  matched  by better  entrepreneurs  and

managers and that thorough continued modernisation and

innovation,  management  must improve  production  and

administration, financial    control,     personnel

management and marketing methods. Sir, I cannot  agree

with him more, but to his observation I would add that

to  maintain  our competitive position the  Government

should  also  strive  to achieve greater  productivity

rate in the civil service through constant improvement

in  the standard of administration and the quality  of

service. It may be wishful thinking on my part  but  I

do sincerely hope that we can look forward to the days

when increased Government revenue will be achieved not

so  much  by  the jacking up of rates and charges  but

rather as a result of greater efficiency in Government

administration  and that Government expenditure  of  a

recurring nature may be kept constant, if not reduced,

by  minimising unnecessary wastage either in terms  of

materials or manpower.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I am therefore pleased to note

that  frank  admission of the Minister that  a  recent

analysis  by  his  Ministry  revealed  that  both  the

Government and statutory boards had been too lavish in

their use of professionals and technically trained men

(Sir,  these are the exact words of the Minister).  He

has  promised to reverse the position. To the  private

sector,  this is indeed welcome news as the  competing

demand  from Government for such categories of persons

over  the  last  few years has not  only  reduced  the

supply  but  also contributed to the rising  costs  of

such personnel to the private sector. Consequently, it

has  considerably slowed down the management's efforts

to carry out any measures aiming at modernisation or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



innovation. Sir, in the latter part of the  Minister's

speech  he refers to a total number of 2,414 vacancies

in  Division I of the civil service when he speaks  of

more  effective use of budgetary allocations. In  view

of  the  Minister's  announced intention  to  be  less

lavish in the area of manpower, I am wondering to what

extent recruitment of Division I officers will now  be

affected.  As  I  see it, whilst it is,  essential  to

ensure  adequate numbers of officers in all levels  of

the  civil  service, numbers alone will not in  itself

bring  about  better  efficiency. The  inculcation  of

correct   attitudes,  sufficient   exposure   to   the

practical  realities  of  life,  coupled  with  proper

training programme, organisation and methods that  are

constantly reviewed and kept up-to-date with  changes,

should   be   the   correct   emphasis   in   ensuring

effectiveness in the Administration's use of budgetary

allocations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, it is perhaps relevant to draw

the attention of the House to the fact that year after

year  there has been substantial shortfalls in  actual

development expenditure as against provisions voted by

this House. The comparative figures for the last three

years  will  be of interest to Members (See footnote).

This    only   serves   to   demonstrate   that    the

Administration's ability to use budgetary  allocations

approved by Parliament is perhaps not as effective  as

what  we  would like it to be. Bearing  in  mind  that

Government spending is increasingly being resorted  to

as  a fiscal measure to stimulate the national economy

or  to counter-inflation, there appears to me to be an

urgent  need  for  the Government to ensure  that  the

administrative  machinery  is  adequately  geared   to

respond quickly to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



demand of changing economic circumstances at all times

so  that  money voted by this House may be efficiently

used and controlled in order to achieve the direct  as

well  as the indirect objectives of Government without

undue delays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In studying the Economic Survey Report, I cannot

help  but feel that our economy, up or down, has  over

the  last few years become more and more dependent  on

the    public   sector;   activities   of   Government

departments, statutory  boards  and  Government-owned

enterprises, such as SIA and NOL, have  provided  the

main  thrusts and stimuli to our economic growth, with

the  private  sector playing a decreasing  role.  This

development although inevitable to some extent  is  to

my  mind not entirely healthy and may in time lead  to

loss  of entrepreneurial enterprise and skills in  the

private sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many enterprises have been embarked upon by

Government,  initially with the primary  objective  of

providing the necessary lead and encouragement to  the

private  sector  but  as time  goes  on  the  original

objective  is lost sight of and what is  left  of  the

motivation  is  no  more than just  profit-making,  at

times  at the expense of and in conflict with  private

sector  development. Perhaps, if we  are  not  already

doing  so,  we ought to periodically review thoroughly

the activities of all Government-owned enterprises not

just  to  assess their viability or profitability  but

also   to   ascertain  to  what  extent  the   primary

objectives  set  for  them  have  been  fulfilled  and

whether  their activities have not resulted, and  will

not result, in disincentives to the private sector  to

either  enter  o  expand in the  same  directions.  An

example of the primary objectives not being pursued by

a  Government-owned  company is to  be  found  in  the

operation of the Singapore Pools

(Private)  Ltd. The original intention in  setting  up

that company was that the money made therefrom was  to

go  towards  the construction of the National  Stadium

and  to  promote sports in Singapore. But from what  I

have  been  able to find out although Singapore  Pools

has several million dollars of surpluses lying idle in

their  bank accounts, it has to-date only given a  sum

of  approximately  $800,000 to  the  Singapore  Sports

Council whereas the Council still carries on its books

a  repayable  loan of $3.15 million.  Sir,  there  are

other  examples  but  I  think one  is  sufficient  to

illustrate the point that I am trying to make.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would like to join my

colleagues in congratulating the Minister for  Finance

for taking us through a truly difficult year and of  a

sensible  and down-to-earth budget which, if  properly

implemented,   should   go   a   long   way    towards

consolidating our position economically.



<br><br>5.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, despite

the  increasing  cost of services and  materials,  the

Minister  for  Finance was able  to  present  a  "soft

budget"  with a tax increase only for cigarettes.  For

this,   everyone   in  Singapore  must   rejoice   and

congratulate him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have again a "soft budget" that will not affect a

great  part of our population. We have gone through  a

rough period caused by inflation and many parts of the

world  have  suffered from inflation too,  But  we  in

Singapore, through the able leadership of the Minister

for  Finance,  and  above all an  excellent  and  able

Government, have conquered inflation  and  have  been

able  to control the cost of living to such an  extent

that we have this present "soft budget". We have had a

very  low  growth rate. Although there  were  promises

made  about an upturn in the economies of many of  the

industrial countries towards the latter part of  1975,

this growth did not really take place. Fortunately for

Singapore  we are seeing a certain growth rate  taking

place, but very slowly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of a number of tax concessions in

the  Budget Statement is an excellent move.  It  is  a

move  that will no doubt benefit the commercial sector

directly.  But  indirectly it will  benefit  Singapore

more,  for  we  look  forward to a healthy  commercial

sector  in  Singapore to produce a healthy and  strong

Singapore  financially.  It  is  my  hope  that   more

concessions of a similar nature could be introduced so

that  we  will be able to earn more foreign  exchange,

more interest from the industrial countries, and after

all this will benefit our country in return.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are several matters which I wish to

draw the attention of the House. It was announced that

the  increases in road tax for motor cars was  not  to

get  more revenue but to reduce the number of cars  on

the road, especially old cars that often break down on

the road. I wish to point out that the condition of  a

car does not necessarily depend on its age. It depends

on  how much it has been used and how well it has been

maintained. To say that all cars over 10 years old are

not  road-worthy and therefore should  be  discouraged

from  running on the road is to presume that only  old

cars break down on the road. In fact, new cars of  all

makes, including  the luxurious  Mercedes  Benz,  are

often  seen  stalled along the road-side,  with  their

bonnets lifted up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the intention is to reduce the number of cars on

the  road,  then the Registrar of Vehicles  should  be

instructed  to assess each owner's need  for  the  car

before allowing it to be registered. This is not a new

idea.   It  was  done  in  many  countries,  including

Singapore, just after the Second World War  when  the

demand for cars exceeded the supply and priorities had

to be laid down. Alternatively, if the intention is to

enhance road safety by ensuring that all cars  on  the

road  are  roadworthy, then the Registrar of  Vehicles

should  be instructed to have all cars above 10  years

old  to  be  inspected annually. Imposing a  surcharge

does not make the car any safer. In fact, it makes the

car  less safe because owners will have less money  to

spend  on  maintenance. The irony is that old  drivers

are certified fit by a medical examination and not  by

paying a surcharge on their driving



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



licences,  but old cars can be accepted as road-worthy

not by an inspection but by paying a surcharge. I hope

that  this  anomaly could be corrected, so  that  some

people  who cannot afford the luxury of new  cars  but

nevertheless  need cars for earning a  livelihood  may

retain their old cars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, not every car owner need to drive his car

into  town. There are many people living in the  rural

districts  who do not drive their cars into town  more

than once a week. Removing their cars do not help very

much  in  reducing the number of cars going  into  the

Central   Business  District.  Besides,  forcing   the

removal of old cars from the road by a surcharge  hits

not   only  the  car  owners  but  also  other  people

indirectly, i.e, those in the motor-repair shops,  the

spare  parts shops, the tyre shops, the battery shops,

the  secondhand  car dealers, the spray-painters,  the

upholstery  makers  and all those connected  with  the

maintenance of motor cars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point I wish to stress is the ugly

tendency found in various departments in Singapore. We

seem  to  be  introducing taxes or  bills  in  various

forms;  in small, small quantities. But let  me  quote

one  maxim. Little drops of water make a mighty ocean.

The  taxpayer  feels the pinch, bit by  bit,  and  his

earnings  seem  to be slowly dwindling.  He  sees  his

savings  and his earning power dwindling as the  years

go  by. Steps must be taken to see that this does  not

continue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I wish to comment on is the

education system. For many years our education  policy

has  been  changing, and changing so  rapidly  and  so

drastically that the school principals are frustrated,

the   teachers   are   confused,  and   the   students

confounded, I am not saying that running the  Ministry

of  Education is an easy job. On the contrary, I  have

the highest respect for the Minister for Education and

all  his predecessors for they have been subjected  to

pressures   such  as  population  increase,   economic

survival,   social  advancement,  and  even   parental

interference, So the schools were run not  to  provide

an education for our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



children and to prepare them for a meaningful and rich

life, but to provide them with sophisticated technical

training  in  order to enable them  to  excel  in  the

modern  rat race. The result is that those who succeed

in  this  mad scramble, which starts from the  primary

schools,  become human robots while those who  do  not

make the grade become social misfits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I sympathize with the Minister for

Education and all his predecessors, but I believe that

unless  we  can provide our young children in  primary

and   secondary  schools  with  a  better  educational

foundation,  and not just a technical foundation, the

values of loyalty, integrity and honesty will have  to

be  sacrificed in the long run. We shall then  have  a

heartless  society  operating under  the  law  of  the

jungle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One contributing factor to this deteriorating

condition is the removal of the cane from the teacher.

I  understand that in some schools if the teacher were

to  touch a child, she should be prepared for  a  long

complaint from the parent, probably with a demand from

the Ministry for an explanation. Under such conditions

no conscientious teacher could give of her best to her

students.  The  authority and dignity of  the  teacher

should  be quickly restored and the student should  be

taught  to accept his position in the school,  in  the

home arid in the society. The only way to achieve this

is to teach him discipline. I am not surprised if some

of  our repenting delinquents say that if they had not

been  spoilt by their teachers and their parents  they

would not be in their present predicament. Mr Speaker.

Sir,  if we are not to accept this blame, I urge  that

we  should  educate  our  children  for  the  sake  of

education and not for the sake of giving in  to  these

different pressures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we seem to be losing our international trade to

a  certain extent. Many ships do not call in Singapore

as  before.  Steps must be taken to ensure  that  more

ships  call  at our Port, Finally, I wish  to  support

this  "soft  budget" that has been  presented  by  the

Minister for Finance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok (Boon Teck):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the 1976 Budget Statement has been received with a sigh of

relief  by many who expect the 1 976 Budget to reflect

the  chain of unsettling events during the past  year.

But  while  the  budget does not contain  any  drastic

changes  in  the  tax liability for Singaporeans,  the

sombre tone of the whole budget hardly gives cause for

rejoicing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Singapore workers' point of view, the only

note  of  optimism struck in the 1976 Budget Statement

is  the disclosure that the rate of inflation has been

successfully stabilised during the past year. But  the

question  of inflation is only of secondary importance

in  relation to the general health of our economy.  As

analysed  in the 1976 Budget Statement, events  during

the  past  year  have brought about a  change  in  the

availability of markets for the manufactured  products

in  Singapore  and in the availability  of  funds  for

investments in Singapore. It would also appear in  the 1976  Budget Statement that the prospects for  a  more

favourable economic condition in Singapore are matters

of  hope  rather than of expectation. The  workers  in

Singapore  have the advantage of being  forewarned  by

the  Secretary-General  of the National  Trades  Union

Congress   to  brace  themselves  for  more  stringent

economic  conditions during the next  two  years.  The

Government of Singapore, by making constructive  plans

to  overcome  the difficult circumstances  confronting

Singapore  during the next few years, has  effectively

demonstrated  its  qualities of capable  and  decisive

leadership which has been largely responsible for  the

rapid  economic development of Singapore in less  than

two  decades.  No rational person, whether  inside  or

outside  this House, can fault the emphasis  given  in

the 1976 Budget Statement to the development of skill-intensive   projects  and  the  training  of   skilled

manpower  as  well  as  the  continued  promotion   of

Singapore as a financial centre for the region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these projects and proposals can but only be

intended  for  the general benefit of all Singaporeans

in  that  it  seeks to make our economy remain  viable

through creating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



sufficient employment opportunities for our increasing

workforce  in  the next few years.  It  is  with  this

consideration  in  mind that I speak  with  confidence

that  the workers of Singapore will give their fullest

support  and  cooperation  to  the  efforts   of   the

Government to safeguard the economy of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By doing so, I must hasten to correct whatever

misimpression  may  have  been  formed  over   certain

comments made by the Minister for Finance in the  1976

Budget  Statement.  To the extent  that  the  apparent

proliferation   of   non-wage  items   in   collective

agreements and contract of service has served to  make

the cost of labour in Singapore prohibitively high  in

relation to that prevailing in certain other countries

in  the region, the attention drawn by the Minister to

the  problem  must be appreciated by  workers  in  the

spirit  in  which the comments were made. But  at  the

same time comments by the Minister have given rise  to

sniggering  remarks  by employers  about  unreasonable

claims by trade unions such as the payment of $1  .000

by  way  of funeral benefit. It is, however, desirable

that  Members  of  this House should  have  a  correct

perspective of those fringe benefits commented upon by

the  Minister  for Finance. It is generally  the  rule

that  where  workers  have the benefit  of  favourable

salary  scales  or wage scales, their fringe  benefits

are nothing out of the ordinary. But where workers  do

not  enjoy the benefit of good salary scales  or  wage

scales,  there is a tendency for deficiency  in  their

wages  to  be made up in the form of fringe  benefits.

such  as  the funeral allowance cited by the  Minister

for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Wages Council was established in 1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most, if not all the various kinds of fringe

benefits  secured by Unions for the benefit  of  their

members  were  done  after the Industrial  Arbitration

Court  was  established  after  the  passing  of   the

Industrial Relations Ordinance.1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I say that there might have been some attempts

to  circumvent the NWC recommendations after 1972  but

the House



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



must  remember  that it was to a very limited  extent,

because  most  of  the fringe benefits  were  obtained

before 1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to consolidate the various allowances

and have them integrated into the salaries is a matter

to  be  sorted  out  by the Unions and  the  Employers

concerned, with the assistance of the Labour Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, this House can rest assured that the

NTUC  and  its affiliated trade unions will  seriously

lock  into  the  whole question of  wages  and  fringe

benefits with the view to drawing up a rational policy

in  the  light  of  the  circumstances  disclosed  and

analysed in the 1976 Budget Statement. The workers  of

Singapore  are  appreciative of  the  need  for  their

employers to remain in business in order to  pay  them

their  wages and to provide more employment for  their

children.  But  just as workers have  every  right  to

expect,  as  taxpayers, capable  leadership  and  good

planning  from the Government of Singapore, they  have

the  same  right  to  expect, as employees, efficient

management  and good example from their  employers  if

Singapore is to overcome its problems in the next  few

years.



<br><br>5.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Chiang Hai Ding -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chiang Hai Ding (Ulu Pandan):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir,

since the last Budget session, very significant events

have   occurred  in  our  part  of  the   world,   The

consequences of these are still being worked out  even

though some of the effects are already felt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to the fall of the Indo-Chinese states to

the Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can try to lay blame on this or other party.

However, not  much  is  gained  by  the  pointing  of

fingers, the  wringing of hands and the  shedding  of

tears,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lessons may be learnt, For those of us who live in

South-east  Asia,  it is imperative that  we  disabuse

Hanoi  which  believes that history is  on  its  side,

because     the    Indo-Chinese    call     themselves

"progressives" and call others "reactionaries".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Minister for Finance referred to ASEAN in his

Budget  Statement. We in ASEAN are  quite  strong.  We

have  not been devastated by war. On the contrary,  we

have  been able to cooperate with each other and  with

others  outside our region ever since  we  signed  the

Bangkok Declaration in August 1967. We have slowly but

definitely engendered a sense of regional cohesion and

solidarity  among  our  political,  bureaucratic   and

business  elites. Last week, we read that  bankers  in

ASEAN  want to hold a convention and even establish  a

federation. The recently appointed Malaysian  Minister

of  Finance,  Tengku Razaleigh, is  President  of  the

ASEAN Chambers of Commerce and Industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insofar as the fall of the Indo-Chinese states

brought   the   five  of  us  ever  closer   together.

culminating in the Heads of Government meeting in Bali

last  month, the events of the last 12 months  can  be

said to contain a silver lining.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further to what I have said, we constitute a not

inconsequential  grouping  of  people  and  resources.

Population-wise, our combined  total  of  almost  250

million  exceeds that of the United States, is  double

that  of Japan and almost five times that of the three

Indo-Chinese  states.  In  area,  we  are  double  the

combined  area  of  the nine EEC countries.  Resource-wise,  we  have  petroleum in abundance.  98%  of  the

world's abaca fibre, 90% of the tropical hardwood. 85%

of  the  natural rubber and palm oil. 80% of  coconuts

and  62%  of  tin. Poor countries we may be  now,  but

poverty is not our heritage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, while it is true that ASEAN countries are

encountering  insurgency problems, it  is  worthwhile

remembering  that  in  almost  every  case   we   have

experienced  and defeated Communist threats,  each  in

our  own way. If the Indo-Chinese Communists have been

strikingly  successful in holding at bay  the  world's

mightiest   military  power,  it  is  also  worthwhile

remembering  that  they  were fighting  a  nationalist

struggle  on  their own soil, which the Americans  and

their  allies  were  not.  Any  crossing  of  national

frontiers by foreign soldiers today escalates that war

and precipitates predictable responses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lessons of our recent history have been taken to

heart,  and  our  Heads of Government at  Bali  firmly

reiterated  their commitment to economic  growth  with

social  justice to overcome the challenge of  domestic

insurgency threats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, let us not mislead ourselves to think that

problems  are  our  monopoly. It is just  that,  being

closed societies, less is known about the problems  of

the  Indo-Chinese states. They have fought a long  and

agonizing   war   which  has  just   ended,   National

reconstruction  will  be a herculean  task.  An  Indo-Chinese  friend in days gone by used to tell  me  that

his country suffered from having two mothers-in-law  - the  Chinese  and the Russian. It appears  that  other

Communist  parties  in the region are  also  similarly

afflicted,  Needless to say, these  mothers-in-law  do

not see eye-to-eye with each other to the discomfiture

of the long-suffering daughters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all this said and done, we in ASEAN cannot

be  accused  of not proffering friendship to  the  new

regimes  in  their task of rebuilding their  shattered

economies.  Nor should we be provoked  to  respond  in

like  manner  when Hanoi calls for a new confrontation

in South-east Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our very name. Association of South-east Asian

Nations, means that membership is not limited for  all

time  to  only  our five states. But new members  must

help  strengthen the association and not weaken it  by

encouraging subversion and disruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our continued social well-being and political

stability  are  founded  on  our  people's  faith   in

themselves  and our commitment to work for  our  long-term  future.  We have all chosen the free  enterprise

system,  although  modified  to  suit  our  particular

circumstances.  We  regard it as the  most  rapid  and

least   painful  path  to  economic  growth   of   our

respective countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This economic growth depends on a climate of

confidence which will lead investors to invest capital

and  enterprise. The view on the ground  in  ASEAN  is

infinitely more promising, than that from the board



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



rooms  of  Europe, United States, Japan and elsewhere.

Only  here in South-east Asia does the investor get  a

feel  for the men and women who make this place  work.

Only  here  in  South-east  Asia  can  he  sense   the

excitement of societies in transition, gearing-up  for

the  breakthrough which will uplift them from  poverty

to the abundance that is their heritage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The historic Bali meeting has taken place. The Kuala

Lumpur follow-up has also produced concrete proposals.

What more can we do as a group?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to national investment and trade

promotion  missions  abroad, let us  also  send  ASEAN

missions, Other people and groups overseas such as the

EEC,  the  United States, Australia and  New  Zealand,

think  of  ASEAN  as a group. So, let us  also  "sell"

ASEAN as a group. When many projects are attracted our

way, various projects must inevitably end up in  each

of our laps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, when overseas economic missions visit

one  of our countries, let us encourage them to  visit

as  many  of  the other ASEAN countries as well.  Last

week,  a  Canadian mission did just that.  This  trend

should also be encouraged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By all means let us compete, within limits to make

ASEAN  an  even  more attractive place to  invest  in,

compared  with other places. We are, after all, named

as one of the world's fastest developing regions. With

these  cooperative actions we will  draw  even  closer

together, generate  greater investor  confidence  and

investment opportunities, to realise the opportunities

in ASEAN for our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We each contribute our individual strengths. For

example. Singapore has a ready source of financing  in

the Asian Dollar market. When it originated in 1968 it

siphoned off floating US dollars to Tokyo and  London.

Today the flow has been reversed and such dollars flow

principally from Europe to finance development in  the

Asian  region, including ASEAN.  Today  Singapore  is

rated  as  the seventh in a list of ten top  financial

centres  of the world, the second in Asia after  Tokyo

and ahead of Hongkong. Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>



has  also  encouraged  the  financing  of  development

projects  in the region by reducing the tax earned  on

profits  from  offshore  investments.  We  have   also

recently   liberalized   our   exchange   rules    and

regulations  to treat ASEAN as part of  the  scheduled

territories,  thereby  permitting  free  and   liberal

transfer of funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister in his Budget Statement has

made  further  tax  concessions to develop  the  Asian

Dollar  market.  We  have done  these  things  without

negotiating   with  our  colleagues   for   reciprocal

advantages.   Our  Government  has  demonstrated   its

earnest desire to build upon the achievements of ASEAN.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will now have a permanent secretariat for ASEAN.

We  should  now  be even better able to cooperate  and

coordinate  our efforts to build a strong,  prosperous

and  resilient region in which our people can live  in

amity and peace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have pleasure in supporting the

Budget Statement.



<br><br>6.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like  to  join Hon. Members of  this  House  in

congratulating  the  Hon.  Minister  for  Finance  for

presenting another fair and reasonable Budget  on  1st

March  1976 for the financial year 1st April, 1976  to

31st March, 1977,  which would  encourage  local  and

foreign investors to proceed with their investment  on

various industrial projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. Minister for Finance in his Budget

Statement  did  mention  that  there  should   be   an

adjustment  in  the  present  wage  policy.  He   also

indicated  that  the National Wages Council  ought  to

consider  whether it should not include all  forms  of

wage increases, including annual increments, incentive

allowances  and  bonuses, in the  computation  of  the

annual  NWC  wage supplements, to arrive at  a  single

total annual wage increase.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, should there be an adjustment of wage policy, I

would request that there should be a thorough study on

this  important matter. There should not  be  a  hasty

conclusion. The NTUC and the Employers' Groups  should

be  fully  consulted and to arrive at a fair solution.

Whatever  recommendations the NWC would  give  to  the

Government  on adjusting the wage policy, they  should

not  be detrimental to the welfare of the workers  and

their  take-home  pay  should  not  be  reduced.   All

necessary  fringe benefits enjoyed by the workers  now

should not be withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers are fully aware that the cost of labour

should not be too high or else investors would  go  to

other countries where labour cost is cheaper. If  this

happens, there   will   be   further   increase   of

unemployment  in  Singapore. On the  other  hand,  the

workers  must get adequate wages to meet  the  present

high  cost  of living due to the global inflation  and

the  high  prices of essential commodities, foodstuffs

and manufactured products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a survey on labour force last year

compiled  by  the Ministry of Labour and the  National

Statistical   Commission,  the  total  work-force   in

Singapore  was 873.000 workers and about 75%  of  them

earned  less than $400 a month. The unemployment  rate

reached  4.5% last year with 39.500 people unemployed.

However, I am glad to know that the service sector  is

still  providing  new  jobs  for  the  workers.  Also,

employment  in  the  commerce,  financing, insurance,

business   services,  social  and  personal   services

sectors is increasing as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my calculation of the expenses incurred by a

worker  to  support  a family of  five  persons, i.e.

himself,  his  mother, his wife and  two  school-going

children  for  a  month, will be as follows.  Assuming

that  his  salary is $400 a month and after  deducting

15% for CPF contribution, i.e. $60, the net balance is

$340.

<pre>

  a. HDB 3-room flat rental,

     electricity, water, gas, etc.       $ 85.00

  b. Marketing - foodstuffs               150.00

  c. Rice for 5 persons                    25.00

                                        --------

                    c/f                  $260.00

                    b/f                  $260.00



  d. His daily lunch at work

     $1.50 x 24 days                       36.00

  e. His daily bus fare

     80 cts x 24 days                      19.20

  f. Newspaper                              7.20

  g. Bus fare for 2 school-going

     children, $15 x 2                     30.00

  h. School Supplementary Fees,

     $2.50 x 2                              5.00

  i. One loaf of bread daily               15.00

  j. Coffee powder, sugar and

     butter or jam                          8.60

                                         -------

        Total:                           $381.00

                                         -------

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will appreciate that a worker with a family

of  five  persons  earning  $400  a  month  and  after

deducting  his  CPF contribution of $60  will  have  a

balance  of $340 which is not sufficient to  meet  his

monthly expenses of $381. Also, you will notice  there

is  no provision for entertainment, like going to  the

cinema,  or for ordinary medical bills if one  of  his

family is down with flu or fever, There is nothing for

him  to provide for unforeseeable financial needs such

as  when  he is temporarily out of job; or someone  in

his  family  is seriously ill requiring  admission  to

hospital, or even a sudden bereavement in the  family.

This  clearly  shows that a worker earning  a  monthly

salary  of  $400 and with a family of five persons  to

support, after deducting his CPF contribution will not

be able to meet his monthly family expenses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore. Sir, when the NWC gives recommendations

to  the  Government on adjustment on wage  policy,  it

should  bear in mind that annual bonus or annual  wage

supplement  together  with some  fringe  benefits  are

still  necessary for the workers to help them to  make

both ends meet in their monthly family expenses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, should there be a review on the fringe benefits

by  the  NWC covered by collective agreements for  the

bargainable  employees, it should also look  into  the

fringe  benefits given to local and foreign  executive

and  managerial staff. The NWC should know what is the

total cost of fringe benefits given to them and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



actual cost for the bargainable employees, believe the

payment of fringe benefits is part 36.00 and parcel of

labour cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to quote the transport allowance

given by the Caltex (Asia) Limited follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) All foreign managerial staff are provided with a

car and a chauffeur at the expense of the Company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) All Departmental Heads are given the same

privilege as No. 1 above.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) All Senior Executives are given a transport

allowance of $420 a month and they can still  claim

mileage   allowance  for  using   their   cars   on

Company's business beyond a certain mileage limit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) All Junior Executives are given $150 transport

allowance.  They have now abolished it,  but  have

compensated it with a payment of $180 added into their

salary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The bargainable employees, such as labourers,

clerks, technicians, supervisors, are given either $50

transport allowance a month or to use the Company's

contract bus transport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Now a few new bargainable employees are not

given  any  transport allowance. They  also  cannot

use the Company's transport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Union's transport grievance with the Company has

not been resolved and our Union will have to bring the

matter to the Ministry of Labour for settlement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from what I have just said, you will agree that

managerial  and  executive staff  are  getting  better

fringe benefits than bargainable employees. So  it  is

unfair  to say that the fringe benefits given  to  the

workers have caused labour costs to go up. In fact, a

good  portion of the costs of fringe benefits is  also

given   to  the  local  and  foreign  managerial   and

executive staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not angry or jealous of the local and

foreign managerial and executive staff getting  better

fringe benefits than the bargainable workers, We agree

they deserve to enjoy such fringe benefits. However,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



should  the  NWC  review the fringe  benefits  of  the

bargainable  workers, it should look  into  the  total

cost  of  the  fringe benefits given to the  following

three categories of employees: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Foreign managerial and executive staff,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Local managerial and executive staff, and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) All the bargainable employees covered by a Collective Agreement.



<br><br>After a careful and thorough study of the actual total

cost  of the fringe benefits given to the above  three

categories  of employees, then only will  the  NWC  be

able  to  give a fair and proper recommendation  on  a

review of all the fringe benefits given by a company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, family planning is a necessary practice for all

married  workers  in Singapore. They must  accept  the

reality  of  life that the world does not owe  them  a

living. They must agree to have a small family of  two

children  only, irrespective of whether they are  boys

or girls. When they have two children, they must stop.

Earning  a salary of $400 a month, a worker is  really

asking  for trouble if he has many children. He cannot

afford  to give his family a fair standard of  living.

There  is  every  possibility that he will  frequently

worry  over  financial  problems,  resulting  in   his

falling  sick, in poor health and inefficient  at  his

work. A wise worker will have a family of two children

only. He will continue with higher studies, especially

on  technical  subjects, to improve his knowledge  and

skill  in  order  to get a better salary  and  quicker

promotion or for better jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the crime rate has been increasing in

Singapore.  The  Police has been  doing  its  best  to

reduce  the crime rate. The public must be more  civic

conscious and assist the Police to catch the culprits.

Without  public cooperation and assistance the  Police

will find difficulty in solving crimes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the latest newspaper reports a few sex

maniacs are raping and molesting young girls and  even

children. The Police must smash the operation of  blue

films and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



pornographic literature. Those involved in  this  mean

business should be punished severely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For raping young girls or children, all rapists who

are  convicted  under  the law  should  be  completely

castrated by surgery, in addition to punishment  under

the law, This will save other innocent young girls and

children from becoming victims of these sex maniacs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to read in the newspapers that the

Government has permitted married couples to use  their

CPF  contributions to purchase HUDC flats. I think  it

is  not  fair  to deprive the bachelors and  spinsters

from  buying  HUDC  flats, After all,  they  also  pay

income  tax like other married couples. Also,  a  good

number  of them would like to stay with their parents.

brothers  and  sisters, In fairness to them,  I  would

request  the  Government to allow  them  to  buy  HUDC

flats,   just  like  other  married  couples,  without

further  delay. Or else, the Government is  indirectly

forcing them to get married as quickly as possible  in

order to qualify for purchase of HUDC flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HUDC flats, especially those with prices ranging

from  $55,000 to $80,000, are most popular and in  big

demand,  May  I urge the HUDC to build more  flats  of

this  type and to cut down the building of the higher-priced flats which cost more than $80,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still many applicants on the waiting list

for HDB and HUDC flats. I hope the Government will  do

its  best  to build more flats to meet the  demand  so

that  the  private  developers will not  increase  the

prices  of their flats or houses to fantastic  levels,

as  had  occurred during the last economic boom.  They

have already made enough profit and they should not be

allowed to enjoy it again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to HDB flats, the purchasers have been

complaining  of  the low standard of the  construction

work. A lot of money and inconvenience is involved  in

repairs  or  renovation.  The  purchasers  are   quite

willing  to  pay a little more for the flats  provided

the  building quality of the flats is good and  up  to

the  standard.  I hope the HDB will rectify  the  poor

construction of the flats and exercise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



careful  supervision  over  the  construction  of  new

blocks of HDB flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Bus Service has improved a lot.

There  are more buses running the various routes;  the

waiting  time  for  buses has been lessened.  One  can

hardly  find  any rude behaviour on the  part  of  the

conductors, the driving standard of the bus drivers is

good.  I  am quite satisfied with the present standard

of service. I think the female conductors are doing  a

good  job. They perform their duties just as  well  as

the  male conductors. There is still room for  further

improvement, however, especially the following: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Most of the windows of buses are damaged and need

constant repair. The window frames and glass are very

dirty and require cleaning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The bus deck needs regular sweeping to keep it

free of used tickets and other accumulated rubbish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Something must be done for the students,

especially  in the evenings when they  are  on  their

way  home. During, this period most of the buses  are

crowded  and  the  students have  no  chance  to  get

aboard. More buses should be put on the road  in  the

evenings  so  that the tired and hungry students  can

get home earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Some bus drivers have the bad habit of not

stopping at the bus stop to pick up commuters who have

signalled them to stop, especially when two  or  three

buses arrive together. In such instances the driver of

the  second or third bus will drive away even the  bus

has only a few commuters in it. This bad habit must be

stopped  immediately  to avoid  inconvenience  to  the

commuters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am quite sure the workers and the people of

Singapore  will accept the advice given by  Mr  C.  V.

Devan  Nair, the Secretary-General of  NTUC, in  his

address  to  the Second Triennial Delegates Conference

of  the PIEU and SILO at the Singapore Conference Hall

on  Saturday, 28th February, 1976.  With  the  present

global   inflation, slow   industrial   growth   and

unemployment, it  is necessary  to  have  a  new  pay

strategy  for  the workers so as to attract  investors

here and to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



gradually achieve full employment. Belt-tightening  is

necessary  for  all  categories of  workers  from  the

private  and public sectors. In order to achieve  full

employment  in  1976 and 1977, a total of  84.000  new

jobs   have  to  be  created.  So  far,  there  is   a

possibility of achieving about 40,000 new jobs in  the

manufacturing,  construction,  transport  and   public

service's  sectors  in 1976 and 1977,  which  are  far

below our target.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, investors will only invest in a country where

there  is political and economic stability, industrial

peace, and workers who are willing to learn  and  are

hard-working,  wages  are  fair  and  with  reasonable

fringe  benefits, prices  of  goods  for  export  are

competitive   with   other   countries, manufactured

products  are  of a good quality, and where  they  can

make substantial profits out of their investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the sake of long-term national interest and

for  the  good  of our present young  people  and  the

coming new generation, the workers of Singapore should

accept the wisdom and guidance of NTUC on the new  pay

strategy   as  well  as  wage  policy  in   collective

bargaining including fringe benefits. Again,  we  have

to make a further self-sacrifice and to put reasonable

claims to employers for new collective agreements.  We

have   to  cooperate  with  the  Government  and   the

Employers'  Groups  in a mutual  tripartite  drive  to

attract  local  and  foreign investors  to  invest  in

Singapore for the benefit of all. The workers get jobs

with decent wage and good condition of service and the

investors get substantial profits in return for  their

investment here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot afford to be selfish and refuse to

take  steps  to  tackle  the present  slow  industrial

growth  and unemployment situation. We must not  allow

the  present unemployment figure of 39,500 to increase

further. We must all be united and do our very best to

achieve  full  employment  as  soon  as  possible   by

encouraging  the investors to build more factories  or

plants so that our young school leavers can get jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has already been said about the necessity

to increase productivity, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>



unfortunately nothing has been said about the  formula

for  incentive  payment to the workers  for  increased

production, not only in the manufacturing  sector  but

also  the  administrative sector  as  well.  Sir,  all

employers  are  in support of increasing  productivity

but  very few are willing to pay the incentive payment

to  the  workers for the good job they  have  done.  I

submit  that  employers who refuse  to  pay  incentive

payment  to the workers for having achieved  increased

productivity,  are shamefully exploiting  the  workers

and  this  should be stopped. Sir, employers not  only

refuse  to  pay incentive payment to the  workers  for

their effort in increasing productivity, they are also

not  interested to form a joint Productivity Committee

with the Unions. I understand there are only a handful

of Joint Productivity Committees in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to prove my point, our Union has already

submitted  claims to the Shell Group of  Companies  on

20th November, 1975,  including  a  clause  for  the

formation of a Productivity Committee, which reads  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Company and the Union shall form Productivity

Committee comprising members from Management and Union

to  monitor  productivity and  introduce  productivity

schemes  in  the  Company The Company  shall  disclose

fully  the  results of productivity  and  shall  share

equitably  the  fruits  of  productivity  with   their

employees'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the final reply from the Shell Management on

23rd February, 1976, as follows -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Productivity Committee

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rejected, as matter within ambit of

Department/Worksite Committee'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Union disagrees with the Shell Management's

contention that a joint Productivity Committee to deal

with  policy  matters, especially on  the  formula  to

measure  productivity and the quantum of  payment,  is

within  the  ambit of Departmental/Worksite Committee.

These  policy  matters should be  dealt  with  at  the

Union's Branch and Executive Council level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Union's stand is simple. If employers are

reluctant to form a Joint



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



Productivity  Committee  in  order  to  disclose   the

results  of Productivity and to introduce productivity

payment  schemes,  then they cannot  expect  increased

productivity from the workers. Perhaps the NTUC should

take  up  this matter with the Government to  consider

the  enforcement of a Joint Productivity Committee and

Productivity Payment Scheme through legislation in due

course.  Employers  should appreciate  that  there  is

nothing  free  in this world. If they  want  increased

productivity  from the workers, they  must  compensate

them accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully agree with what the Chairman of the

National Productivity Board. Mr G C. Thio, had said in

his   address   to   the  Symposium  on   Productivity

Agreements. Worker Motivation and Sharing the Gains of

Productivity,  held  at  Hotel  Equatorial   on   16th

February. 1976, and I quote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We should, therefore, give due attention towards

developing   team  spirit,  cooperation  proper   work

attitudes   and   efforts,   worker   motivation   and

incentives  which are part and parcel of a  successful

scheme  in  maximising productivity movements  in  all

Sectors  and  to  sharpen our  competitive  edge  over

others



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If workers felt they are not getting a fair share of

the  benefits of higher productivity, they  would  see

little reason for exerting themselves for giving their

cooperation and support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of apportioning the gains from increased

productivity  equitably  by  a  spirit   of   goodwill

understanding and willingness to give and take.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers fully understand the importance of

increasing productivity, to better the quality of  the

products,  to  see  that  the  prices  of  goods   are

competitive to other countries, and to accept the fact

that  investors  want substantive  profits  for  their

investment.  Commonsense tells us that if  we  achieve

all these qualities, consumers in other countries will

buy  more  of  our Singapore-manufactured  goods.  The

investors will get better profit and will expand their

business and there will be job security and more  jobs

for the younger people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the people of ASEAN countries are very happy

that  their leaders have met recently at Bali  and  at

Kuala Lumpur to foster



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



better  understanding and to establish  political  and

economic cooperation. So far, the conferences have had

successful results. I am glad that Singapore has  been

selected  to  manufacture diesel engines. I  sincerely

hope  that  all  ASEAN-designated industrial  projects

will  be  implemented  as  soon  as  possible.  I   am

confident  the next ASEAN Foreign Ministers Conference

in  Manila will achieve further good results. With the

present ASEAN political and economic cooperation,  and

with   the  implementation  of  the  major  industrial

projects,  I am sure local and foreign investors  will

be  encouraged  to  make  their  investment  in  ASEAN

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to join my colleagues

in  this  House in giving full support to  the  Budget

Statement  presented by the Hon. Minister for  Finance to Parliament on 1st March, 1976.



<br><br>6.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it will be

a  breach  of  etiquette if I do not join  other  Hon.

Members  in  their chorus of compliments to  the  Hon.

Minister  for Finance for his "painless and  no-shock"

Budget Statement delivered on 1st March, 1976. However,

I do so not without some reservation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No-shock and painless" indeed it was, for it has

become  a common budget delivery procedure for several

years  now, that the pain and shock always take  place

in  between  budget statements. The latest  shock  was

delivered on last New Year's Eve, Perhaps it might  as

well be so, because intentional or not, the timing  of

the  announcement  of  the new taxation  measures  for

motor  vehicles  provided  excellent  opportunity  for

active  exchanges  of  dismay and disgruntlement  over

dinner tables at numerous New Year's Eve parties. That

was  one  perfect  way  to generate  discussion  at  a

convenient time. I must congratulate the Minister  for

his  choice of the timing in administering this  shock

treatment, although at the same time it also  betrayed

his political insensitivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the wound has begun to heal under his

tender budget dressing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



Eventually, the scar may not be visible and  may  even

emerge  as  a new status symbol. It serves  no  useful

purpose, therefore, for us to revive discussion on the

subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due credit must be accorded to the Hon. Minister for

his   elucidating  assessment  of  the  state  of  the

Republic's  economy. This ought  to  have  a  sobering

effect  on  the population, and Hon. Members  will  no

doubt  apply  themselves to debating the more  crucial

issues  on  Singapore's  economic  well-being  in  the

difficult years ahead. For our citizens, the sooner we

get  ourselves  out of the euphoria of  the  past  few

years  and get down to appreciating the hard facts  of

life,  the  better  we  will be  prepared  in  gearing

ourselves for the lean years ahead of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The years of plenty have gone. There is little we

can do to alter the course of the ups and downs of the

world's  economic  order. But we  are  not  completely

helpless.  There  are  a number  of  ways  within  our

control which we can positively exploit. One of  these

is to increase our productivity.



<br><br>6.35 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of higher productivity has been the

subject  of  frequent exhortations by  many  concerned

quarters.  Ironically, whilst both the  employers  and

workers   are   agreed   on  the   need   for   higher

productivity, neither party seems to be able to  offer

any tangible solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several ways of measuring the level of

productivity.    An    economist    would    determine

productivity by the value added per man-hour: that is,

the  gross  value  of output minus the  value  of  all

intermediate  input, such as the  cost  of  materials,

wages  and  overheads, and divide it by the number  of

man-hours  put in. This method of measurement  appears

to  be  rather impersonal and does not consider  other

factors  like  the sources of input,  quality  of  the

products, prices, and markets for the output.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the employer's point of view, the practical

gauge  for productivity lies, of course, in the margin

of profits. The employer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>



is  naturally  ever conscious of the  need  to  reduce

costs  in  terms  of  materials and  wages,  and  when

opportune,  through increase in the  prices  of  their

products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the workers, the question of whether higher

productivity  will mean that they will  have  to  work

harder,  or  if  they will enjoy the fruits  of  their

labour, is uppermost in their minds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economist's definition of productivity is the

sum  total of all the rational considerations  for  an

efficient order of things. However, in a society  like

ours,  where monetary rewards and returns  become  the

only incentive for one's effort, the attitudes of  the

workers and the employers naturally prevail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Survey has pointed out that the

increase  in our GNP was only about 3% to 4%.  Various

attempts   have   been  made  to  rectify   the   poor

performance, but all efforts seemed to centre on  what

have  been  mistakenly  considered  as  the  two  most

important factors, that is to say, the various ad  hoc

modifications  to  the system of  production  and  the

amount of effort put in by the workers. Unfortunately.

the entire exercise has been no more than skimming the

surface without knowing the root causes that have  led

us to this sad state of affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exhortations on harder work find little reception in

our  workers and these are only effective, if at  all,

during  the time they are being lectured to. In short,

this  is  nothing  more  than a  half-hearted  salvage

operation of a situation which is unacceptable  to  us

but which we had helped to create for ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The root of the matter lies in the work ethic - values such as job satisfaction and pride of

employment. These are precisely the very values  which

our  education system, or more correctly a combination

of  many  short-lived systems have failed to inculcate

in the minds of our present generation of workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us have enough courage to face up to this painful

truth. A young worker of today,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



say,  between  the  age of 23 and  25  years, is  the

product of our education policy and system. He is  the

show-piece  of our education planners' fantasies.  But

others  may  even look upon him as a social liability;

he  has a soft mind, supported by a heart which easily

falls  prey to the temptations of the good things;  he

is  not  even proficient in his first language, being

the   victim  of  our  so-called  bilingual  education

policy.  He  shuns meaningful jobs which  draw  better

pay,  opts for more cosy employment, and he  wants  to

start  life at the top. Further probe into his profile

reveals an equally sad picture. He has been trained in

the technical skills to meet the needs of the economy,

but  he  has  not been taught in his school  days  the

correct attitudes and values of work. The syllabus  in

school  provides  the  skill  training  but  not   the

associated  work  values.  He  might  even  have  gone

through  the moulding mill in National Service,  where

he  was posted to a Hokkien platoon, having found that

his  bilingual  education was of no  help  to  him  in

understanding his sergeant. May I remind Hon.  Members

at  this  stage that most of us in this House are  the

products  of a primarily mono-lingual education,  many

are  today  effectively bilingual or even tri-lingual.

Those who are not, as yet, are extremely proficient in

at least one language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately for these people, they have been spared

the agonies of the Playway Method or the Primary Pilot

Project (PPP), the Multiple-Level Teaching Method, the

Group-Teaching  Method,  the  still-born  Restructured

Education  System, or the new Restructured  Education

System,  which  is a reversion to the  old  vocational

school  system. Gentlemen, we are back to  square-one.

Had   we   been   exposed  to  all  these  conflicting

experiments, our educationists would have  come  close

to    producing   their   first   "Frankensteins"   in

frighteningly great numbers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they may yet succeed finally, if they persist My

fear is not unfounded and it has been confirmed by the

Hon.  Senior  Minister of State  for  Education.  Hon.

Members  will remember his announcement in this  House

that he intended to incorporate the Primary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>



Pilot Project into the formal education system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trial-and-error" has been a convenient excuse for

failures, but in the case of our educationists, it has

become a practised virtue, The Playway Method (PPP) is

nothing new. It was introduced many years ago and  was

then known as "The Activities Method". This scheme was

subsequently dropped, I suppose, for good reasons, The

departure  was  temporary, however, as  it  re-emerged

under a new name, but care was taken this time to call

it  a  "Pilot Project" in case of another failure.  In

the event, it too became a failure. I congratulate the

Senior   Minister  of  State  for   his   courage   in

incorporating   a  "Tried  failure"  in   the   formal

education system. The Chinese language has an idiom to

cater for this kind of situation, it says: "change the

soup but not the medicine" (huan tang bu huan yau). In

modern  medicine, it means: change the flavour of  the

pill's coating, but not the medicine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not intend to subject the House to detailed

illustrations of the multiplicity of systems  which  I

have  enumerated. Hon. Members who are in the teaching

profession  will  no  doubt be able  to  enlighten  us

better.  But  I must remind the Ministry of  Education

that it is about time that it gets out of the twilight

zone  and  begin  to distinguish between  fantasy  and

reality. PPP and other educational novelties may  well

serve  the needs of those countries from which we  had

copied  the  systems. We cannot afford the  luxury  of

experimenting to satisfy the whims and fancies of  the

idealistic  educationists,  who  had  presented  these

imported systems as their own innovations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no time for trial and error. We have only

two   million  digits  to  juggle  with   whilst   the

originating  country of these ideas  has  hundreds  of

millions   from  which  to  choose  their  leadership,

executive personnel and workers. We cannot afford  the

high casualty rate in experiments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps in this debate we may hear from the Minister

his  views  as to why everyone else - the  principals,

the  teachers, the parents and the students,  but  not

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



Ministry of Education - must be blamed for this  sorry

state  of  affairs. It has never occurred to  the  top

hierarchy  in the Education Ministry the  need  for  a

thorough   examination   of   their   own   proposals,

management  system, the contents of the  syllabus  and

most important, the whole purpose of education itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be unfair for me to say that the education

system  as  a  whole  has failed altogether.  We  have

succeeded   in   producing  the   professionals,   the

managerial personnel, and the skilled workers. But  it

is  important  that  in  the  process,  we  must  also

inculcate   the  night  kind  of  values  and   social

responsibility which provide the cultural ballast,  as

the  Prime  Minister has often said, for any community

to move on to higher planes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the need for some changes when a new

leadership  takes command of a situation,  because  if

the  system  left behind by the previous incumbent  is

allowed to continue, then he fears accusation of being

deficient in innovative thinking. But to change simply

for  the  sake of changing can be disastrous.  Let  me

quote two minor examples: Hygiene was removed from the

curriculum to save time for other subjects; but it had

to  be  reintroduced later under the  name  of  Health

Science  after the outbreak of a number of  infectious

diseases; Civics was regarded as a complete  waste  of

time  but suddenly someone rediscovers its value,  and

of late it has also acquired a new name -Education for

Living. Sometimes I mistake it for "Education for  the

Living".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This on-off-on-off merry-go-round must stop. May I

liken  to  a  little  note which I wrote  recently  to

describe  a  certain  situation,  It  says:  `Re   the

cancellation of the last order, please note that  this

cancellation has now been cancelled.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has gone wrong? It is easy to attach blame on

others,  but let us examine the following to  see  how

our educationists fared in exonerating themselves:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question (1): Are not the principals to be blamed?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fact: This generation of principals are put

there  in  their  places by our own administration.

They  are  often  only  the executors  of  policies

decided by the Ministry headquarters. They are  not

consulted  in the policy formulation process.  This

situation  is  compounded by  having  to  implement

without detailed guidelines on the new policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question (2): Are the teachers to be held

responsible?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fact: The bulk of the teaching profession are

graduates of our own Teachers' Training College  or

what  is  now  known as the Institute of  Education

(another   `change   soup   no   change   medicine'

exercise). If they failed in their job, is  it  not

possible that we have not trained them properly and

adequately?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question (3): Is this generation of students hopeless and helpless?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fact: There is now better living and study

environment,  HDB  flats  are  going  up  every  30

minutes  or  so, better nutrition, better  teaching

aids,   educational  television,   extra-curricular

activities, better syllabus (so it is claimed)  and

better text books. Why and how come?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question (4): The parents have not done their bit?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fact: This generation of parents are better

educated  than  the previous generation.  They  can

offer  better help and guidance in their children's

work, But what happens to the other half of the day

when the child is not in school and supposed to  be

at  home?  Both of his or her parents are  at  work

contributing  to  the GNP, What  about  a  full-day

session  to  keep them off the streets and  confine

them to an environment more conducive to study?  At

the  moment, a number of schools are running  on  a

one-session  basis and below the normal  enrolment.

Perhaps, this is one pilot project the Ministry  of

Education can attempt.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question (5): Once out of school, the children

will  revert back to their dialects, how can  they

improve  their  literacy? This is  a  very  common

question being asked all the time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fact: This has been so for the last 1 50 years

since the first school was built in Singapore. Did

not the Ministry take this into consideration when

they   decide  on  the  contents  of  the   school

syllabus?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question (6): Are we going through a

transitional    period    in    our    educational

development?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fact: In a recent informal conversation with an

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education Ministry luminary, I was told that our

educational system is going through a transitional

period,  I salute him for his courage in defending

his  Ministry, but after 17 years since 1959, are

we   still  in  transition?  I  wonder  when  this

transition will end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion: As in Mathematics, the Q.E,D, to

these  questions  is  obvious.  The  Ministry   of  Education stands indicted,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are still in doubt that the Ministry

is  actually in such a bad shape, further  evidence

is  herewith provided. SBS was in such a mess  that

we  had  to move in a Government Team of Officials.

The  Ministry  of  Education has  just  received  a

Government Team of top Administrators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this injection of new vigour and fresh blood,

I  am  sure  Hon.  Members in this  House  and  all

parents will share with me the hope, even that vain

hope, that the Senior Minister of State, who by his

public  confession is an administrator  and  not  a

politician,  will have the stamina to continue  his

good  work  in clearing up the mess,  so  that  the

parents, teachers, principals and the students  can

be  spared  the agony of being guinea-pigs  for  so

many  years  to  the  fantasies  of  the  arm-chair

idealists, May I conclude on this lighter note:  `A

new broom sweeps clean, but the old one knows where

the dirt is,'

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>



Budget  Statement this year, as expected,  is  a  mild

one.  There is only one item of tax increase, and that

is on cigarettes and tobacco. This is also interpreted

as  a  further step to frustrate smokers, in the  hope

that they will be reminded that smoking is bad and  to

give up smoking. The intention, of course, is good. To

the  general  citizenry, the budget is no  longer  the

only  document for the pronouncement of tax  increases

or  the introduction of new taxes. As everybody knows,

the  month  of  March is not the  only  time  for  the

announcement  of tax increases or the introduction  of

new  measures. Notwithstanding all these  remarks,  at

this  juncture  when we are not very  certain  of  our

economic  future, this Budget which on the whole  does

not propose any tax increases is welcome by all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, looking back over the past decade, since our

independence we have done a great deal in the field of

building  construction for everyone to  see.  We  have

skyscrapers  and factories mushrooming  all  over  the

place.  We  have a busy port. There has  been  general

economic  prosperity. Singapore has become a servicing

and  financial  centre, an Asian Dollar Market  Centre

and an oil-prospecting centre for South-east Asia.  Of

course, as a country lacking in natural resources, our

survival   depends  on  our  economic  viability   and

stability.  There  have  been  indisputable   economic

achievements over the past decade and we were able  to

create thousands of jobs not only for our own citizens

but  also for foreigners to fill the gap in our labour

force.  In  battling  the oil  crisis,  Singapore  has

proved  that she has the economic capacity to  survive

and  recover, and not allow herself to be put  in  the

position as in other countries where they are  saddled

with  large scale unemployment. This is something that

we should be proud of,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for a country to stress certain aspects of

development neglecting the others will lead to  social

imbalance  and  aberration.  The  obvious  result   of

stressing  only on economic development is evident  in

some  Government departments being mercenary - minded,

where junior officers try to please their superiors by

making more money for their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>



departments  and where senior officers try  to  please

their  Minister  by  the same means  in  the  hope  of

getting  promotion or even double or treble promotion.

To the public, Government departments become a Yar Men

into  which  they cannot enter without money.  As  the

Member  for  Jalan  Kayu  had  said  here  last  year,

nowadays  public servants seem to have forgotten  that

their   primary  function  is  to  serve  the  people.

Instead,  they  think of making more money  for  their

department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I regret to say that from my own observation,

there  is an increasing tendency on the part of  civil

servants to glorify themselves by making more and more

money, and there is no abatement in this tendency. For

example, the  Housing  and  Development  Board   has

abolished  the  half-hour parking rate.  Instead,  the

motorist has to pay a minimum of 40 cents for an entry

into  the  car park. This has resulted in  the  social

vogue of money-worship in the society. Everybody wants

to  get  rich, and quick for that matter, Deceits  and

mutual  fooling abound. So friends can be turned  into

stepping stones for one's uplift. There is a  lack  of

humanity in our society. When you have money you  have

fame and status, and you will be respected. Those good-for-nothing idle flatterers will attach themselves  to

you.  Whatever  means by which you obtain  your  money

does   not   really  matter,  be  it  theft,  robbery,

smuggling  or illegal lottery, nobody cares. Graduates

from  the  universities will ask these questions  when

they  apply for a job: How much salary will I be paid?

How  many  days' leave in the year, and what  are  the

fringe  benefits? Workers are not contented with  what

they  get.  They are all the time on the  lookout  for

better  paid jobs and greener pastures. They will  hop

over for such new jobs, if available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young people are so fond of aping Western styles

that  they must wear cowboy jeans, go to the cabarets,

bars  and  coffee houses and even to the gay quarters,

and  worse  still, take to drugs. After wasting  their

money  on these luxuries, when they do not have enough

money, they turn to crime, robbery and theft. In spite

of  the stringent laws that we have, the crime rate is

still



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>



mounting.  What  has gone wrong with  our  society?  I

think   this   is  a  matter  that  deserves   serious

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the country that we want to build is

not   one   that  puts  on  a  false  facade,  veiling

hypocrisy, where everyone goes under a mask,  instead

of  showing his true face, with empty form but without

a  soul.  The quality of the citizen that we  want  to

mould  is not one who is selfish and self-centred.  If

our country consists of only a group of passengers who

are  money-worshippers, then the future of our country

will  be  bleak and that is something for us to  worry

about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this points to one important aspect, that is we

have   so   far   only  emphasised  on   the   visible

construction  of  our country and we  have  done  very

little, if at all, about the invisible construction of

nation-building. The moulding of a national character.

the  soul, the quality and character of our  people  - all these constitute the invisible construction that I

have  referred to. Invisible construction is  achieved

mainly  through  education and culture.  We  inculcate

patriotism  and  correct human behaviour  through  the

process  of  education in our schools.  Students  stay

longer  at home and outside schools. Parents are  busy

doing their business or making money and so they  have

little  time at home for their children's studies  and

thought-formation, In a society there is bad influence

all  around,  The little things that they have  learnt

about life in school is inadequate to counter the evil

and  greater influence that they have been  confronted

with  in  society.  In other words, the  students  are

influenced  more by society than by the  teachings  of

their  teachers, So perhaps extending the school hours

may  help,  but  at the present moment  our  education

system does not permit this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reversal of the social ethos depends on the

cultural  strength of our country, and this cannot  be

done overnight. So far we have done very little in the

cultural field. The Ministry of Finance has allotted a

very  small  sum of money for the Ministry of  Culture

for cultural activities. It seems to be rather



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>



stingy. This year there seems to be an increase in the

allocation  of  funds,  and  this  amounts   to   only

$105,000.  With such a meagre sum of money,  what  can

the  Ministry of Culture do? Perhaps the  Ministry  of

Finance   thinks   that  culture  is  a   money-losing

proposition  and so there is no point in spending  too

much  money  on it. Of course, we admit that  cultural

work  requires money but this is money well  spent  on

invisible construction for our national good which  we

may  not see immediately but over the long time we can

see the benefits,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that economically we have the capacity

to  survive. In defence, we have various land, sea and

air  forces  to look after our security. In education,

every child has an equal opportunity. But in terms  of

culture.  I  do  not  think  we  have  placed   enough

emphasis.  We  have  travelled ten years  towards  the

construction   of  a  republic.  We  have   laid   the

foundation for nation building. We have done  a  great

deal  in physical and visible construction but in  the

invisible  aspect we have done little. The next  stage

in  our nation building should lay stress on invisible

construction.  Otherwise,  as  I  have   pointed   out

earlier,   our   nationals  will  all   become   "ugly

Singaporeans".  If  we have to live  among  the  "ugly

Singaporeans",  then  I  am  afraid,  life   will   be

meaningless and survival will be pointless, because we

may all become "ugly Singaporeans" I



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as a first step I would like

to  propose  that  the  Government  should  set  up  a

National   Academy  of  Arts  to  enable  considerable

numbers  of our children with special artistic talents

to   receive  proper  training.  What  opportunity  of

advancement will they have without such an academy? We

have  some private academies, but these academies have

not  at  the present moment received adequate  support

from   the   Government.  So,  they  have  to   charge

exorbitant fees and as a result of such high fees only

the  rich  can afford to send their children to  these

academies for artistic training and pursuit.  Children

of  poor families will have no chance. So how  can  we

promote cultural and artistic activities?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with a National Academy of Arts, we shall on

the  one  hand be able to promote interest in  culture

and  art  and  on  the  other hand,  provide  training

opportunities for our talented youths, irrespective of

whether they are rich or poor. The National Academy of

Arts   will   become  the  centre  for  our   cultural

development. I think this is a pressing need which  we

must  look  into. It is my hope that the Minister  for

Finance will consider this proposal seriously,



<br><br>7.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  despite difficult times in 1975 Singapore's real

growth  of  4.1%  is a credit to the  people  and  the

Government. But much has to be engineered to  maintain

present  growth rates in more difficult  times  ahead.

Our  strategies need to be more sophisticated,  taking

into  consideration our better standard of living  and

quality  of  life  when compared to the  economic  and

social challenges we faced in 1959. 1965 and 1968.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to attract new investments, expand present

ones  and increase productivity. Productivity  is  not

only  the responsibility of workers. It has to  evolve

from  the  board  room  with the  enthusiasm  that  is

expected of the shop floor. Improved work methods must

be  formulated and better machines designed to improve

work output.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very closely linked with productivity is quality and

tendencies  to  inspect quality must  be  obliterated.

Quality  must  be  built into  our  products  and  not

inspected.  A desirable work ethic must be  inculcated

to  enable us to compete effectively in world markets.

Middle management quality consciousness leaves much to

be  desired  and unless this is enhanced, improvements

in production cannot be anticipated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter that needs to be dealt with

urgently  in  order  to increase productivity  is  the

better  utilisation of leisure. Leisure is that period

of  non-working  time of an individual.  This  accrues

after  deducting working hours, time taken for  travel

to and from work, time spent at home preparing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>



meals,  eating,  recuperating, time  spent  on  family

matters  and so on. The apportionment will, of course,

vary  with sex and age. For shift workers, this  is  a

special  problem. Much has to be done to  ensure  that

workers'   leisure  is  usefully  spent  by   creating

opportunities  for the useful utilisation  of  leisure

hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leisure provides a balance, eliminating the fatigue

caused   by  work  and  increasing  productivity.   It

provides  a contrast, encouraging workers to  seek  in

sport,  tourism, hobbies and so on, some  compensation

for physical or psychological fatigue. It makes for  a

better balance between life and work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leisure should not merely help to maintain a

worker's   health   and  thereby   conduce   to   high

productivity. It should, in addition, be a  factor  in

social  adaptation, compensating for the isolation  of

the  worker in present-day industry, and even lead  to

the  advancement of a worker's career. To  a  steadily

increasing degree, leisure activities are being looked

upon as a cultural duty and a symbol of social status.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loss in productivity is also a result of accidents

at  work.  Greater stress on occupational  health  and

safety  will  result  in a safer working  environment,

Greater emphasis must be placed on accident prevention

and   not  injury  prevention.  More  scientific   and

systematic  systems  must be evolved  to  be  able  to

predict accidental occurrences. A comprehensive  early

warning system developed can look at the total pattern

of accidental happenings in each workplace, whether or

not  they  cause injury or damage. From data obtained,

an  effective  system of accident  prevention  can  be

worked out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, our tourist industry has

grown  favourably, and for our own good it  must  grow

further.  This  can  only be ensured  if  we  enhanced

Singapore's image among tourists. The present state of

affairs  in  unethical trade practices, if  continued,

will be a negating factor for our tourist trade. These

unethical practices, needless to say, spill  over  and

affect Singaporeans as well.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with public transport initially, not the

SBS,  Mr  Deputy  Speaker. Sir. There  has  been  some

improvement  in  the  buses;  they  break  down   less

frequently, cause less traffic congestion and seem  to

have  employed more congenial staff, but the Singapore

Taxi   Service.   Tourists   and   Singaporeans   have

complained  of  overcharging and blatant  cheating  by

some recalcitrant taxi-drivers who blemish the others.

Commuters  wanting to ride into the CBD  pay  for  the

daily area licence. $3 before but now $4, and the Hon.

Minister knows how much more later on, which had  been

paid  for  earlier in the day over and over  again  by

previous passengers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the question of overcharging. Extra

charges are sometimes levied for going short distances

due to, as is claimed by some taxi-drivers, a possible

loss  of a more lucrative fare. Extra charges for also

longer   distances  to  compensate  the  tedious   and

monotonous  long  drive. Extra charges  too  from  the

airport  and  the  port to any destination, for  more

illogical reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another grave problem is the traumatic wait on the

streets frantically waving at every empty taxi, to  no

avail.  The  seemingly contented look of  these  taxi-drivers  give  the  impression of an  excellent  day's

takings  in their coffers. Here, the semaphore-sending

figure  is  usually a Singaporean who is considered  a

less   lucrative  fare,  However,  those   `look-like-Singaporean'  tourists, and our  multi-racial  society

includes many, due to their `not-tourist-like'  attire

because of their lack of interest in photography, have

many-a-time turned signallers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, these unethical practices

exist  also  in many of our shops. Being  a  shopper's

paradise   for   tourists  as  well  as  Singaporeans,

hundreds  go  on  shopping sprees daily  and  a  large

majority  are  swindled. The honest  trader  finds  it

difficult  to survive in this atmosphere.  Redress  in

the  form  of a claim in court can be both  unpleasant

and  unrewarding. This is all the more aggravated when

the claim is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>



relatively  small. As such, these retailers  get  away

with their sins.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary, therefore. Sir, to establish a

Small  Claims  Court, a  people's  court  where   the

aggrieved can sue someone without paying money  for  a

lawyer. Much can be achieved for the consumer, whether

tourist  or  local, to ensure  his  fair  and  honest

treatment at the hands of the entrepreneur.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. Government's anti-inflationary and anti-profiteering measures in 1975

were  successful,  NTUC, CASE and other  organisations

helped  tremendously to ensure this success,  However,

although greater consumer awareness has been achieved,

through  consumer information and services,  there  is

still exploitation of the consumers by sales persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very few of us do not depend to some degree on the

reliability  of  callers  to  our  door  such  as  the

breadman,  the newspaperman, the grocer, the gardener,

the  meter  reader and many more. Similarly,  a  great

many  people depend to varying degrees on door-to-door

sellers  of  other goods. In fact, door-to-door  sales

persons  have been a part of the commercial scene  for

some  years.  Over  the years, many organisations  and

individual  sales persons have provided  reliable  and

valuable  service to householders. These sellers  have

been of very great assistance to those who, because of

physical handicap or age, have been unable to  venture

into the market place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, door-to-door selling or direct

selling,  as  it  is often called, has  attracted  the

attention  of  some  unscrupulous high-pressure  sales

persons who, using unethical methods and, after a high

degree  of  practiced skill, will try  to  sell  goods

which  the consumer neither needs nor wants  or  which

the consumer can ill-afford.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislative safeguards are therefore needed to

ensure  that  consumers, who cannot afford  the  time,

money  or  otherwise  for  themselves  to  be  skilled

through  practice  and learning to  combat  such  high

pressure sales techniques, are properly looked after,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If goods are bought on credit, for instance, this

piece of legislation could provide for a "cooling-off"

period  to  enable  the consumer to  think  about  his

purchase  and,  if  so decided, change  his  mind  and

cancel the sale.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

1975 was a year of world-wide recession with the major

advanced industrial countries suffering on the average

a decline in growth of 2¬%. In such bad circumstances,

Singapore, an island nation without natural resources,

can  still  maintain a real growth in  gross  domestic

product  of 4.1%, It is indeed a fair performance  and

considerable  achievement. The 1976  Budget  Statement

presented  by  our Hon. Minister for Finance  in  this

Chamber  on  1st  March 1 976 clearly shows  that  our

political,  economic and social situations are  sound,

stable  and steady. But, Sir, how long can we maintain

and  enjoy  this  sound situation  in  this  turbulent

world?  I  am  sure  nobody will be able  to  predict.

Therefore, I think we all agree that we cannot  afford

to take things for granted. We should not relax and be

complacent about our achievement, We should unite  and

work doubly hard so that we can continue to enjoy good

living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the coming year, foreign investments in

Singapore may be gradual and slow. Factors that  bring

about   a   slow  down  and  a  decrease  in   foreign

investments are beyond our control. For instance:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The economic recovery of the advanced industrial

countries takes time. Therefore, foreign investments

in Singapore are expected to be slow and reduced;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The increasing acts of insurgency in the North-East and South of Thailand and in Malaysia have caused

hesitancy in the minds of foreign investors and cause

them  to  adopt a more cautious or a wait-and-see

attitude. Therefore, we can foresee that, except for

short-term investment, there is unlikely to be any

hope of large-scale, long term investments before the

entire political and economic situation of the region

becomes clear and stable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, as we all know, high wages and low

productivity  will further discourage investments  and

aggravate the unemployment problem. Though this factor

is  very  complicated and difficult, it is within  our

control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, considering these circumstances, we can foresee

that  Singapore in the coming year will face a serious

unemployment problem. The Minister for Finance has  in

his  Budget  Statement touched on  the  adjustment  of

wages  policy.  This  is  a  useful  reminder  to  our

Singaporeans. If we want to avoid the surging wave  of

unemployment,  we  should,  besides  exercising  self-restraint  and  not asking for higher wages,  redouble

our    efforts,   be   more   hardworking,    increase

productivity  and be prepared to accept  heavier  jobs

with lower wages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure we all agree that we should attract

foreign investments if we are to provide jobs for  our

people.  Regarding those investments which  Government

has  substantial  equity participation.  I  think  our

Government has a duty to see:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That our people at all levels of work in these

industries   are  genuinely  given  opportunities   to

upgrade  their skills, both technical and  managerial,

and  to  acquire  the  know-how  of  these  industries

brought in by foreign investors;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That after a period of time, by systematic

phasing, some of the more important posts at the upper

echelons  should  be "localised" by  appointing  local

incumbents to be groomed for these key posts.  It  has

been  found  in practice that in some of the  existing

industries foreign expatriates have tenaciously  clung

on  to their posts by making all sorts of excuses  and

ruses to remain as long as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not want foreign investors to take too

much  advantage by giving all sorts of excuses and  we

do  not also want to be the economic slaves of foreign

investors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, through ASEAN cooperation and as a group, I

believe that we have a better investment climate  than

Latin America, the Middle East or Africa. Therefore, I

believe



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>



that  our future investments from foreigners are still

bright.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Budget Statement is not perfect. I am

afraid that the per capita income distribution is  not

ideal  as  the  trend is not directed towards  equity.

This  may create a wider gap between the rich and  the

poor. Therefore, I would like the Minister for Finance

to look into this matter seriously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, Sir, though I have made certain

comments.  I  still support the 1976 Budget  Statement

because  it is meant to achieve greater viability  for

the  Republic, to make it a financial centre,  and  to

promote the Asian Dollar Market, and to make Singapore

the  centre  of export-oriented and more sophisticated

industries with scientific and higher technology.



<br><br>7.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

the  Budget  now before the House is as reasonable  as

can  be  expected in the circumstances  prevailing  in

Singapore  and  in  the world. Of course,  if  one  is

determined to find fault with the Budget as  presented

by  the  Minister for Finance, it is conceivable  that

one  may  be able to criticise with justification  the

Budget  on some ground especially the failure to  give

more tax relief in respect of personal incomes. But  I

myself  am not particularly inclined to criticise  the

Budget on any such ground, and I am personally of  the

view  that we all should be thankful for a Budget that

does not seek to increase taxes, particularly on basic

commodities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is that, while we have every reason to be

grateful  that  the  present Budget  proves  the  past

policies  and  leadership  of  our  Government  to  be

correct,  we  may get into the habit of thinking  that

our  Government  can be relied upon to  do  everything

necessary  and  proper  for our  future  interest  and

welfare.  Such an attitude of mind, coupled  with  the

increasing  participation by  the  Government  in  the

socio-economic   activities,  may   cause   individual

Singaporeans



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



to become complacent as to their own role in promoting

the well-being of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sad to say, such complacency is becoming more

apparent  among  some Singaporeans. If  anything  goes

wrong in Singapore, these people simply blame or curse

the Government for not preventing the thing from going

wrong. If the Government does something to prevent the

same  thing  from  going  wrong  they  criticise   the

Government for not doing so in a different way. It  is

all  very  well  and  easy to put  the  blame  on  the

Government.  But  it  must not be forgotten  that  the

Government is not a miracle worker and that there  are

definite limits to the power of the Government  to  do

all  the  things which the Government wants to  do  or

ought to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make my point clear, let me illustrate the matter

with  a reference to a noticeable trend among some  of

the professional and the elite classes of Singaporeans

who indulge themselves in a form of escapism. While it

may  be  exaggerating  to  describe  the  trickle   of

Singaporeans seeking to emigrate to other countries as

a   brain-drain,   the  fact  remains   that   certain

Singaporeans  consider  themselves  to  be  completely

dissatisfied  with  the socio-economic  conditions  in

Singapore as to have the desire to start a new life in

a strange country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they leave it at that, that would be the end of

the  matter  as far as I am concerned, But  they  have

seen   fit   to  blame  the  Government  for  creating

conditions  which are intolerable to  them  and  which

have  forced  them to emigrate from Singapore.  In  so

blaming  the Government, they seem to have the support

and  sympathy  of their friends and acquaintances  who

belong  to the same professional and elite classes  of

Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In brief, their grievances seem to be that Singapore

is too highly disciplined a society for them and their

children,  They do not seem to care that without  such

discipline  Singapore  would not  have  been  able  to

continue  to  be a viable, independent Republic.  They

also  seem  to  forget that they also enjoy  far  more

privileges and perks than most Singaporeans  and  that

with such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



greater   privileges   come  correspondingly   greater

obligations towards the society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My purpose in referring to the few Singaporeans who

seek greener pastures rather than face up to realities

is   to  draw  attention  to  the  attitude  of   mind

underlying  the  whole matter. On the  one  hand,  the

Government  is  blamed by the emigrating  Singaporeans

for  not allowing them to lead a way of life which  is

prejudicial  to the interest of the other Singaporeans

by reason of Singapore's socio-economic circumstances.

On  the  other hand, the Government is also blamed  by

the   stay-put  Singaporeans  for  not  imposing  more

restrictions on the emigrants so as to force  them  to

live up to their obligations to the society from which

they have benefited so much.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such an attitude of mind, the Government makes

a   very   handy  scape-goat  for  every   conceivable

grievance. Either the Government is blamed  for  doing

too  much or doing too little. Those who are aggrieved

that they cannot lead what they consider a fashionable

way  of life choose to blame the Government for  being

unduly restrictive rather than adapt themselves to the

socioeconomic  circumstances of Singapore.  Those  who

are  angry  with  the Government for appearing  to  be

unduly liberal towards the former group of persons  by

not making them do their duties to Singapore choose to

ignore  what  they themselves can or ought  to  do  to

promote   greater  self-identification  with  national

interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is, most Singaporeans seem to have fallen into

the habit of expecting the Government to do everything

for them. Thus, for them the Budget Statement seems to

represent  not  a  comprehensive  statement   by   the

Government of what the Government intends to do or not

to  do  in respect of the economy of the nation  as  a

whole but as a specific refusal or omission to do what

respectively  concern  them  most  during   the   next

financial year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is most undesirable and unhealthy to have

an  attitude of mind which views the Budget solely  in

terms  of  the Government's obligations to the  people

but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>



ignore  the  question of personal obligations  of  the

people  themselves to the Republic. The  Budget  is  a

financial  statement which cannot and  does  not  take

into  account  the  degree and extent  of  the  inter-personal  activities of those performed  by  voluntary

civic   and   social  workers,  ,even   though   these

activities greatly help to oil the functioning of  our

Society. My point briefly is that the success  of  any

Budget   is  ultimately  dependent  on  the   personal

initiative  and capacity for sacrifice of  the  people

for whose benefit the Budget has been drawn up.



<br><br>7.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Kuo Chuan):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that the depression, recession, (or by whatever

other euphemism one may choose to call the phenomenon)

of   1973,   1974  and  1975,  has  left  Singaporeans

relatively  unscathed is a tribute to  the  collective

resilience  and organised response of the  people  and

Government  of  Singapore. It testifies  also  to  the

foresight   which   went   into   the   planning   and

implementation of the economic strategy that  provided

the  framework which has happily helped  us  withstand

the  shocks of the past few years. The problem now  is

to  strengthen the same framework and to  enhance  the

economic security of not only Singapore, but of South-east Asia as well. If we have saved Singapore once, we

shall  now have to bend our energies, in concert  with

like-minded people and leaders in ASEAN, to make ASEAN

secure as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister has, characteristically,

defined  the  formula  adopted to  meet  our  economic

problems  as  "the  tried and  tested  mixtures".  The

Government  and the public sector are to  continue  to

provide the necessary facilities and services required

to  sustain  growth. The private sector is  given  the

task  and  the  opportunity to increase and  diversify

production and secure new markets. It is a mesh and  a

mixture  that has hitherto succeeded in releasing  the

creative and productive energies of the people without

undue  regimentation. In political terms it  has  also

enabled  us to keep extremist and adventurist politics

at bay.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no absolutes in practical politics and

there  is no such thing as a social framework  perfect

for   all   time.  Everything  is  relative  and   all

progressive societies are in a constant state of flux,

change  and evolution for the better, Some new  states

are lucky in having leaders who have the knowledge and

the   skill   to   bring  about  social   change   and

modernisation peacefully; others have leaders who  can

only  move  with  violence and repression.  For  these

latter,  politics  is  more a matter  of  passion  and

belief than one of scientific precision. Sir, we have,

I  hope, escaped passion and dogma and  have  settled

down to work with scientific rationality.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Selvadurai, it is 7.30 now and

the Minister for Finance has to reply. Mr Hon.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I am grateful for the opportunity  given

to  me  to reply to the very lengthy speeches  I  have

heard since 2.50 p.m, this afternoon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say, first of all, that I am gratified at the

general support of Members for the financial policy of

the  Government.  Some  Members  have  expressed  this

support  without reservations, while others have  been

perhaps  less  uninhibited in  suggesting  that  there

should  be  reservations to this support. In  fact,  I

expected  more brick-bats to be thrown  at  me.  After

all,   in   a  world  of  rising  expectations, when

Singaporeans  have become accustomed to  double  digit

growth rates, even a real growth rate of 4.1% must  be

considered a come-down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose to deal with the comments of Members

by  subject rather than by individual representations.

I  must  thank  Members for their views and  comments,

especially   those  with  particular   insights.   For

example,  the Member for Ulu Pandan, with his academic

training   and  former  profession  in   History   and

diplomacy,  is  able  to  see  ASEAN  in  very   broad

perspectives  of  time  and  of  distance,  whereas  I

confess  I  find some difficulty in seeing  the  ASEAN

wood



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>



for  the  trees  of inter-ministerial discussions  and

negotiations. At the same time. I also  envy  him  for

the  very keen eye that his new profession of  banking

has  given  him  on  the practical  use  that  greater

cooperation  and new economic opportunities  of  ASEAN

will  have  for  him as a banker. As a  former  banker

myself,  I  join  him  in the  hope  that  ASEAN  will

produce,  and fairly soon, beneficial development  not

only  for  Singapore  but  also  for  the  very  large

economic unit that he has described as ASEAN. I  think

that the recent meeting of Economic Ministers in Kuala

Lumpur gives us great cause for this hope.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other Member who mentioned ASEAN was the

Member  for  Whampoa.  I  think  he  was  under   some

misapprehension  when  he referred  to  the  attention

which  we  gave  to industrialisation rather  than  to

agriculture in ASEAN. I am of the opinion that he  was

not  correct.  The  emphasis,  even  among  the  ASEAN

industrial projects chosen, was on fertilisers to help

in  agricultural  development.  Nevertheless,  he  was

correct in thinking that for Singapore the project  we

have  chosen is more concentrated on industry than  on

agriculture,  although the diesel engine is  eminently

suited  to  the  use  of agriculture  as  part  of  an

agricultural factor or other implements such as pumps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to go on to the comments on growth

and  prospects for Singapore. I always listen  to  the

Member  for Whampoa with interest when he speaks  with

his  usual expertise on economic subjects. I think the

Member  commented on the poor growth and analysed  the

figure  of  unemployment which he gave as 6%,  and  he

went  on  to speak of the poor growth in a  number  of

sectors.  I agree with him that we cannot be satisfied

with  the performance of Singapore in 1975 and I  hope

that, in fact, the growth in 1976 will be better.  In

my  Budget Statement. I have not given any figures for

my   estimate  of  growth  in  1976  because  so  many

economists,  not  to speak of Finance Ministers, have

gone  wrong in their economic forecasts that I do  not

think that this has any great value, But for those who

are  interested in looking at crystal balls,  I  think

the  figure  which  the Ministry of  Finance  computer

comes out with after making a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>



number  of  assumptions is nearer 8%. But, of  course,

with  qualifications  that  if  shipbuilding  and  the

petroleum  refining  industries  do  not  come  up  to

expectations, then we may get a growth of 6%,  On  the

other  hand, there are other figures which  have  been

given by the Monetary Authority of Singapore which are

more optimistic. In fact, in these matters perhaps  it

is  very  easy to pick on any figure you want and  you

can  have  it justified on the computer by making  the

appropriate assumptions. Nevertheless, I think  it  is

not incorrect to say that we could expect to be better

off this year than last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Whampoa also made a number of

comments  and queried the reasons for the deflator  in

the services sector. I do not have the explanation for

this,  but  if he likes I will write to  him  on  this

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also enjoyed the Member's comments on

international   problems  such  as  the  international

monetary arrangements at Rambouillet and elsewhere.  I

may  say  that his remarks on the inflationary effects

of the international money and gold discussions strike

a responsive chord in me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong was dismayed by the Member for

Whampoa's  forecast.  He  was  in  favour  of  a  more

optimistic  outlook because of our success in  meeting

previous adverse economic conditions in the past  such

as the rundown of the British forces.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> That is not the impression that I

tried to give.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> But that was the impression I

received  on  hearing the Member's speech.  Perhaps  I

should  read  his  speech when  it  becomes  available

either in the press or in Hansard.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> I was dismayed all the same, where

future projections are concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Anyway I agree with the Member on

the need for character in our young people and for the

need  to  develop their moral fibre. I hope our  young

people  will listen to his exhortations. I also  agree

that  we  should deplore the tendency that we have  of

extolling our achievements in the press. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>



deplore also with him the effect on our youth of these

rather  vainglorious assertions  of  our  high  growth

rates  and other matters. The Singapore ego is  pretty

well developed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with the Member for Katong on the

development  of  character in  our  people,  not  only

because  I  believe, like many people  concerned  with

economic  development, that the work ethic is  a  much

envied advantage of certain societies but also because

of the intrinsic value of character-building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next Member who spoke on growth and prospects

was  the Member for Moulmein who was inclined to  take

the sombre aspects of our future prospects. I hope the

younger generation was listening when he urged them to

face  the challenge and accept the hardships that  the

older  generation did in the past. I think most of  us

here are members of the older generation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A considerable number of other speakers spoke on

this   particular  topic.  The  Member  for  Serangoon

Gardens was, I believe, satisfied with the performance

of  4,1%  in  1975  and  hoped that  it  will  inspire

confidence.  I certainly hope that this  will  be  the

case.  The  other Members I have got  down  as  having

spoken on his subject are the Members for Jalan  Kayu,

Anson.  Boon Teck, Jurong and Potong Pasir. I  do  not

have full details of what they have said. In any case.

I do not have the time to reply to them in view of the

limited time I have at my disposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the next topic. I listened with pleasure to the

Member  for Potong Pasir when he spoke on his  special

subject,  the  consumer and consumer prices.  I  would

like  to  commend CASE on its recent work in  bringing

down  the consumer prices in hawker foods, as well  as

other  Members in this House who have also  been  very

actively concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another topic which I have written down here is

industrialisation and this appeared to have caught the

interest  of  many  Members.  The  need  for   further

development of our industrialisation programme appears

to  be generally agreed. I appreciate the analysis  of

the Member for Telok Blangah of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>



problem  now facing Singapore. He calls it, and  quite

rightly.   "another   crisis".   He   spoke   of   the

retrenchment and the unemployment in 1975 and even  in

1976,  although I must say that we have had a somewhat

more  optimistic report for February this year.  This,

he  thought, should be met by all the  manufacturers,

entrepreneurs, civil  servants  and  workers  getting

together to overcome this problem. He called for every

sector  of  our nation to come together. At  the  same

time  he thought the industrialists should be assisted

by  being given tariffs and also preferential  trading

arrangements,  perhaps  in ASEAN,  At  the  same  time

manufacturers also must be tough in trying to get  new

markets. I cannot agree more with this message because

in  my  Budget  Statement I also  indicated  the  same

attitudes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same message was also given by the Member for

Whampoa  who  suggested the need for  the  economy  to

stand up to the rigours of the changing conditions and

of  workers and management to redouble their  efforts.

He  spoke  also of the decline in investment  and  the

need to stimulate this, The Member for Jalan Kayu also

agreed  to the need for managerial and entrepreneurial

improvement  but he also emphasised the need  for  the

civil service to do likewise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of the Members spoke on topics related to

industrialisation. For example, the Member  for  Bukit

Ho  Swee  spoke  of  increasing  productivity  through

incentive  schemes; the Member for Potong Pasir  spoke

of  the  need  for  investment and  productivity;  the

Member   for   Thomson  spoke  of  the  prospects   of

industrialisation by the fact that  there  were  lower

investment, greater instability  in  the  region  and

other difficulties, including wages policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of Members spoke on the manpower unit and

manpower  training. The Member for Kim Seng  suggested

that there should be a Central Manpower Research Unit.

I  can  assure  the Member that the manpower  research

which  is needed for such planning is centred  in  the

Ministry  of Finance, but we of course always  welcome

whatever



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>



assistance  we  can  get from any quarter.  There  are

other  needs  for  manpower planning  in  the  various

Ministries (of course, in the University also) such as

the  Health  Ministry  for  their  own  purposes;  the

Ministry of Labour, for unemployment statistics, would

of  course  have  their own unit. But all  statistical

data are coordinated by the Statistics Department  and

our Statistical Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens spoke of the need

for  adequate manpower planning as well as of manpower

training.  He  displayed  some  disquiet  on  manpower

training in the Industrial Training Board, and he also

spoke  of  the  reluctance  of  our  young  to  accept

employment  in industry. The Member for  Thomson  also

spoke   of  a  systematic  encouragement  of  training

skills,  As  can be seen from my Budget  Statement,  I

agree  with most or all of these statements.  I  think

they  will  be  pursued  by my Ministry  in  promoting

industrialisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more controversial item is the subject of wages

policy.   The  Member  for  Jalan  Kayu  disputed   my

statement  that  the  Budget  Statement  was  not   an

exciting  statement; especially  in  regard  to  wages

policy  it  would cause some feeling. He endorsed  the

policy  which I think has been agreed by the  Minister

for  Labour, myself and the Secretary-General of NTUC,

He  suggested the need for keeping inflation down  but

warned against higher taxes and its effect on the cost

of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Boon Teck also spoke very strongly.

on  this  policy  and the need of  training  in  skill

intensive  projects  and praised the  support  of  the

workers towards Government. He referred to my comments

on  the proliferation of non-wage items and the effect

on competition. With regard to funeral benefits, among

other  things,  he suggested that this  was  desirable

where  wages are inadequate. I accept that  allowances

and  benefits  must be considered with  the  wages  in

judging whether the whole is adequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Ho Swee also spoke on wages

policy  and  suggested that a full study  and  a  full

consultation  with  workers should  be  made  on  this

matter. I accept that the NTUC should be consulted and

I think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>



they  have  been, but the National Wages  Council  can

also  be  a channel for such consultation. In  such  a

forum  the  figures he quotes on jobs and on  workers'

income  can  be studied as to adequacy.  In  the  same

forum also, the comparison with executive benefits can

also be discussed with regard to its effect on cost. I

am  glad,  however, that all Members are  prepared  to

consider the need for examination of the wages  policy

in   order  to  ensure  the  competitiveness  of   our

industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related to industrialisation were a number of

topics.  One was exports. Only one Member,  I  am  not

quite sure which, spoke on our Export Credit Insurance

Corporation, although quite a number of other  Members

appreciated  the  need for more export  markets  being

found,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir spoke of an unrelated

subject,  which  is that of tourists in  our  economic

development   programme.   He   mentioned    unethical

practices.  May I assure him that the problem  is  one

which  has  engaged our close attention, as  are  the

malpractices by taxi drivers and others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied touched upon the problem of

brain-drain from Singapore. I do not think  that  this

particular  problem is at present  of  a  sufficiently

serious  nature  for  us  to  discuss  it  as  in  our

financial policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to the comments on expenditure. The Member

for  Jalan  Kayu spoke of the shortfall in expenditure

against  amounts  voted,  and  suggested  that'  there

appeared  to be an urgent need for a machinery  to  be

adequately  geared for this work, This is, of  course,

one  of  my  daily  concerns  -  how  to  ensure  that

development expenditure for anti-recessionary measures

can  be  stimulated. He commented also on the dominant

position  of  the  public sector  and  said  that  the

original objective of not to compete with the  private

sector  was  being forgotten. I myself  would  welcome

greater  activity in the private sector,  particularly

in  these recessionary times. In fact, the stimulation

of public expenditure has been made mainly because the

response from the private sector has been inadequate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I will cut short the remarks on various

other  matters and come to the main topic of interest,

which  was taxes. Many Members appeared to prefer  the

agony  of  taxes  to  be imposed  on  definite  times,

particularly during the time of the Budget.  I  cannot

give  any assurance that Budget time will be the  only

time when taxes will be imposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a fairly full reply to the Member for Punggol

on  the necessity for not giving further allowances in

personal and earned income and also on CPF allowances.

I think these are really the strategies of a financial

policy  and I am sure there is another opportunity  to

debate this question. The main reason is that,  as  he

has already anticipated, a small increase of $1,000 in

personal  or  earned  income relief  would  cause  the

Government to sacrifice about $26 million per annum in

revenue. I am afraid I am unable to spare that kind of

money.   Our  objective  should  be  an  increase   in

individual income so that the tax burden for  all  our

social  and  security services are borne  by  as  many

people as possible to spread the load. As it is,  only

236,000  or  26% out of a work-force of about  900.000

workers  pay personal income tax, but the  benefit  of

Government  services  are enjoyed  by  all.  In  other

countries,  for example, the United States,  a  higher

proportion of the workforce pays tax. In the US, there

are 84 million taxpayers, or 90% out of a workforce of

about  93 million. In Australia there are 5.6  million

taxpayers,  or  95% out of a workforce  of  about  5.9

million.  In Japan there are 31 million taxpayers, or

60% out of a workforce of about 52 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved.
