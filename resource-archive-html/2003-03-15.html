<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head W of

the  Main  Estimates be reduced by $100." - [Mr Chay  Wai

Chuen].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</b> Sir, I had three cuts

relating to the taxi industry.  I spoke on one yesterday.

May I proceed to the other two?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Proceed with the other two, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, my cut relates to taxi fares

and  the pricing mechanism.  Recently, during the  debate

on  the  Road  Traffic Act amendment, we heard  from  the

Minister for Transport that we had the highest number  of

taxis  per capita among major cities of the world.   That

taxi  should  be  considered as  a  premium  door-to-door

service  but our fares are relatively low that  it  makes

sense for two or three persons to take a taxi, instead of

the  bus or MRT.  Soon after that, on 13th February 2003,

there  was a major article in the Straits Times  agreeing

that  our taxi fares were too low.  Now, is there a  hint

that  taxi  fares  are  likely to increase  in  the  near

future?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what will cause fares to increase? The

Government no longer sets taxi fares.  Under the  present

circumstances,  judging  by  the  popularity  of   taxis,

commuters  are  generally happy  with  the  current  fare

structure, taxi drivers are still making a decent  income

although  some  are grumbling that income  has  declined.

There are many drivers queuing up to drive taxis and taxi

companies are raking in huge profits.  It seems that  the

only  unhappy party may be the Government,  as  it  means

that  taxi  service is not priced properly leading  to  a

loss of potential revenue for the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether that is good enough reason for an

increase in fares.  Although the Government does not  set

fares  any  more,  it can still cause taxi  companies  to

increase  fares  by increasing their cost of  operations.

The  new  licence fee of $25 per taxi per  month  imposed

recently is a small component.  If it wants to, there are

many  other  areas where the Government can levy  charges

and fees, such as COE, diesel charge, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, taxi drivers are charged about $60 per

day  to rent the taxi.  If the driver takes in more  than

that, it is his

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



income.  If less, he takes home nothing and may even have

to  come  out from his pocket.  If increases in fees  and

charges cause taxi companies to pass them on to the  taxi

driver by way of a higher daily rental for the taxi,  the

taxi  driver  will  stand the risk of a  bigger  loss  if

business is unusually bad.  I think it is not healthy  to

subject individual taxi drivers to greater financial risk

and  liability,  and  hope that  any  increase  would  be

charged  to the taxi companies directly instead of  being

passed on to the taxi drivers or the commuters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have the highest number of taxis per

capita,  yet during peak hours and rainy days,  there  is

not  enough  to meet demand.  There are perennial  public

complaints  about the non-availability  of  taxis  during

such  times.  However, during non-peak hours,  there  are

taxis  aplenty  cruising  our  streets  or  waiting   for

commuters at taxi stands.  Therefore, any increase in the

already  high population of taxis will affect the  income

of taxi drivers adversely.  The solution to this problem,

as  advocated by the LTA, seems to be variable pricing to

meet  demand,  and by that, it appears that  the  LTA  is

subtly referring to (although not openly pushing for) the

phone booking fee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if you are prepared to pay more by calling for a

taxi, according to the stipulated quality of service, you

will  most  probably  get your call  answered  within  30

seconds,  confirmation for the booking within  5  minutes

and  a taxi at your doorstep within 10 minutes.  That  is

for those prepared to pay the extra, that is, the pricing

difference.  For others, it means a long wait  along  the

roadside, or in a queue at a taxi stand.  If this is  the

preferred  solution, then I think we should publicise  it

and  tell  commuters  not to waste time  waiting  by  the

roadside or taxi stand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we adopt this solution, I believe the situation

for  those  wanting to hail a taxi from the roadside,  or

taxi stand, will only worsen in time.  The QoS or quality

of service does not help to alleviate the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>



situation.   The five qualities of services require  that

phone  booking service levels be met, otherwise a penalty

of  up  to $100,000 per contravention will be imposed  on

the taxi operator.  Now, we know that demand for taxis is

high  during  peak hours.  For fear of not  meeting  this

QoS,  taxi  companies, especially the smaller ones,  will

naturally  want to take their taxis off the  streets  and

keep them on standby to make sure that they can attend to

phone bookings.  If not, if their taxis are all committed

picking up passengers from the roadside, and they are not

able to attend to the calls, they will be fined.  CityCab

is  offering  the lowest booking fee now to attract  more

calls.   But if their phone booking becomes more  popular

and they are swamped with calls, how long can they manage

with a small fleet and not run foul of the QoS?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I think the writing is clearly on the wall - better pay the higher price if you want to get a taxi,

otherwise  take  the  bus  or MRT.   Those  unwilling  or

ignorant,  especially  the  tourists,  will  continue  to

complain and have a bad impression of our taxi service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I move to my cut regarding competition in

the taxi industry.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You have got to go faster, Mr Ong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> I wonder how competition can be

introduced  at this late stage where there is  already  a

dominant market leader which has the clout to set pricing

and  market trends.  The situation is aggravated  by  the

merger  of Comfort and TIBS taxis.  The smaller  existing

companies  and  any  new entrant would  not  be  able  to

compete  and  would  find that there is  not  much  point

taking  on the big boy head-on.  They would simply follow

what   the  market  leader  does.   Like  former  Finance

Minister, Dr Richard Hu, explained before in relation  to

pump prices, domestic petrol pump prices are set by Shell

which has the largest network of petrol stations and  the

others simply follow.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, since we are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>



in  good time, may I seek your indulgence to do one  cut,

just two minutes?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No. You have missed the bus. You

have to wait for the next bus.  Mr Seng Han Thong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I will drive

very fast.  First, let me declare my interest.  I am  the

Advisor  to  the  three  Taxi  Drivers'  Associations   -

Comfort,  CityCab and TIBS.  Thus, in Singapore, whenever

I  board a taxi, I do not need to pay, but I have to  pay

when I get down, as usual.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the new regulatory framework for the taxi

operators,  taxi companies are to pay a levy of  $25  per

taxi  per month to the Government to finance the cost  of

enforcing  taxi service standards.  This means  that  the

taxi  industry needs to pay the Government  $5.7  million

per year to enforce service standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Government is trying ways and means to

lower the business costs, I see this move as going in the

opposite  direction  and driving  up  the  cost  of  taxi

driving.    The   taxi   drivers  are   concerned   that,

eventually,  they need to bear part or all  of  the  $5.7

million.   The commuters now foresee that the  additional

cost  will  be  passed to them and  I  believe  the  taxi

companies must be thinking of how to pass this additional

cost to either the taxi drivers or the commuters.  So the

question I would like the Minister to clarify is: must we

impose  a direct increase of $5.7 million operating  cost

on  the  taxi  operators?  If the issue is  taxi  service

standard,  is  the $25 levy per taxi per month  the  only

viable  solution?  I would strongly urge the Minister  to

review this creative way of enforcing service standard by

imposing  a fee rather than an incentive.  Are  our  taxi

services  that bad that require $5.7 million annually  to

make it better?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the Government is seeking vigorously to

enforce  a  taxi service standard, may I ask whether  the

Government  will  consider providing a clear  arbitration

and  appeal  framework for the taxi drivers  without  the

need to go to the civil court?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>



Currently,  we  have the Traffic Police  driving  licence

demerit points system, the taxi companies' demerit points

system  as  well as the enforcement unit of LTA  managing

the disciplinary procedures of taxi drivers.  So the only

way  out  for taxi drivers to appeal against  any  unfair

judgement on them is to go to the civil court.  The  cost

is  high, let alone rental cost as well as loss  of  time

and time wasted.

<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, with

the  taxi  industry  now being liberalised,  it  is  with

hopeful anticipation that standards of services will rise

with   competition.   Taxi  operators,  instead  of  just

renting vehicles out, can now be expected to do more  for

their  taxi  drivers who, in turn, will be encouraged  to

give a better personalised service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from granting rebates and incentives to

drivers,  I would like to ask the Minister for  Transport

if  he  can  consider a scheme where taxi  operators  can

improve  the  industry by working with  the  Ministry  of

Transport to create a dispute and resolution (D&R)  panel

from  which  players within the taxi  industry  can  have

their  problems heard and resolved before being penalised

by the authorities and taxi operators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the dispute and resolution panel can

be  independent from the taxi operators and report to the

Ministry  of  Transport.  Fellow members may  consist  of

members from the taxi operators and taxi drivers as  well

as  other  professionals nominated  by  the  Ministry  of

Transport.   In  a  liberalised industry  where  manpower

moves freely from one company to another, we must try  to

separate  the  actions  involved  in  disciplining   taxi

drivers from those hearing the complaints.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panel can take up complaints and disputes

between  individual taxi drivers and the taxi  operators,

customers and other road users.  For example, one of  the

common woes that taxi drivers have is being asked to stop

at   places   where  it  is  in  violation   of   traffic

regulations.   If an unreasonable passenger insists,  the

taxi driver has little choice but to comply,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>



worried   that  he  might  receive  a  complaint  against

himself.  His action puts him in a difficult position  as

he  might  risk  chalking  up  demerit  points  with  his

compliance as he would have violated traffic regulations.

However, should he eventually receive a complaint by  not

listening to the customer, or attract a fine for stopping

illegally,  the  driver can now  be  assured  of  a  fair

hearing to his problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A taxi driver once told me that, apart from having

to pay a traffic fine and receiving demerit points on his

driving licence, he has to, on top of all this, also  pay

a  penalty  amount to the taxi operator.  The  D&R  panel

will provide a listening ear for taxi drivers instead  of

leaving  them  at  the  mercy of the  taxi  operators  or

traffic   authority   and  risk  having   their   licence

withdrawn.  The panel will discourage one from being  too

litigious.  It is a less expensive, less punitive and non-adversarial method of dispute resolution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting up the panel allows taxi operators to

concentrate  on providing good taxi services rather  than

to  spend their resources in resolving conflicts, in  the

process  eroding its image as a good provider  of  public

transport.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Irene Ng is not here. Mr Ang Mong

Seng.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

taxi  service  is one of the three main forms  of  public

transport  in Singapore.  Apart from taxis, we have  air-conditioned buses and the MRT to provide very comfortable

public  transportation for our people.  Of  course,  taxi

service  is much faster, more comfortable and, of course,

it costs more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some commuters are complaining that there are not

enough  taxis  on  the  road, and are  asking  for  more.

However, I feel whether or not we should have more  taxis

will  depend on the demand and supply in the market.   If

the  demand  is  not so high or the high demand  is  only

restricted to peak hours, then during the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>



off-peak  hours there would be an over-supply  of  taxis,

and  the  operating  cost will go  up.   Eventually,  the

higher  operational  cost  will  be  passed  on  to   the

commuters.   The commuters will have to bear  the  brunt.

So, we have to think of the consequences.

<br>11.15 am

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example. Recently, I was in

Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon. I observed that there were a  lot

of  taxis  but only about 30% of them were occupied,  the

remaining  70% were not. As we know, taxi fares  in  Hong

Kong  and  Tokyo are much higher than Singapore.   Do  we

want  to  end  up  like them?  Can the Minister  tell  us

whether there is any plan to increase the number of taxis

in Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, recently, much has been said about

encouraging the  commuters to make use of the radio  taxi

service.  It is a very good system.  But to use the phone

service, you have to pay a  $3 surcharge.  If we want  to

advocate wider use of radio taxi service, should  we  not

consider  lowering  the surcharge, perhaps  halve  it  to

$1.50?  This will  encourage more people to use the radio

taxi service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, as Mr Seng Han Thong has mentioned, we are

imposing  a $25 licence fee on each taxi.  By right,  the

taxi  operators shall bear the cost of this  $25  licence

fee, but can we say for sure that they will not pass this

on  to  the  taxi drivers?  I would like to know  whether

this  is  an  ad  hoc  measure or  will  this  be  levied

perpetually.  If the taxi service has already  reached  a

certain  standard,  and  there is  no  further  need  for

improvement, should not this $25 levy be lifted?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, it is

commendable  that  we are putting in place  a  system  to

monitor  service standards for the taxis,  ie,  the  QoS.

Taxi   operators  would  no  doubt  be  assessing   their

operations  and  procedures  to  ensure  that  they   are

compliant,   especially   in  the   face   of   increased

competition from new entrants.  The question I am  asking

is whether there are adequate measures being put in place

to ensure that the livelihoods of older

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>



taxi  drivers - the majority of whom are wholly dependent

on   taxi   driving   -  would  not  be   unintentionally

compromised.  There would be occurrences of drivers  that

would  need time to cope with the changes.  For  example,

even  as  technology is rolled out to our taxi fleets,  I

have  known  a  taxi driver who had been driving  for  17

years, he was dropped because he could not cope with  the

new  text messaging system.  Would others suffer the fate

of summary dismissal, after failing a language test?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of poorer alternative employment

prospects  for  older workers, we must  ensure  that  the

transition  to high-tech systems required to achieve  the

higher  benchmarks of service delivery must be done  with

some compassion and, in the event that doubts arise as  a

result  of  disagreement  between  the  drivers  and  the

operators,  the Minister should look into adequate  cost-effective  recourse to be available to the drivers,  many

of  whom  have  not got the adequate financial  means  to

contest effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for  Information,  Communications  and  the  Arts  (Encik

Yatiman  Yusof):   Sir, during my MPS, I  came  across  a

number  of cases involving taxi drivers who were  alleged

to  have  committed  offences ranging  from  discourteous

behaviour  to  arguing with passengers and  overcharging,

among others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On receiving the complaints, the taxi companies or

LTA  would investigate.  The taxi drivers were  asked  to

give  explanations,  mostly  in  writing,  and  when  the

drivers,  in  the  opinion  of  the  investigators,   had

committed  an offence, they would decide and  impose  the

penalty.   In  many cases, it means that the taxi  driver

would  either face suspension or, worse still, lose their

licence if they exceed the demerit points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the decision is conveyed to the taxi driver,

there  is  no satisfactory avenue for him to  appeal,  so

they  approach the MPs.  In my experience,  out  of  more

than  three dozen or so appeals that I had handled, there

was only one success.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>



While I understand the reason is, among others, to uphold

the credible standard of taxi service in Singapore, I can

still emphathise with the drivers because, in most cases,

the  taxi  drivers feel that this is not  fair.   As  the

number of retrenched workers who seek employment as  full

or  part-time  taxi drivers increases, the  current  taxi

drivers  are made more vulnerable to losing their  source

of  income.   To overcome this problem, I would  like  to

suggest  that  we create some kind of transparent  appeal

process through an arbitration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, Mr Andy Gan, had more or less

suggested  the composition of the arbitration  panel.   I

agree  with  his suggestion.  I would like  to  know  the

Minister's view on this matter.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Transport (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, first, let me thank all the Members who have spoken

on a very broad range of transport issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address some of the broader land transport

issues  before replying to the specific points raised  by

Members.   One perennial concern of Members, and  of  the

public too, is that we have an affordable, quality public

transport system.  I, too, share this concern.   The  key

to  achieving  this objective is to ensure that  we  have

adequate  competition within each of the  land  transport

sectors.   And  if  it  is not possible  to  have  direct

competition, to ensure that there are adequate regulatory

safeguards  to  ensure  that the  service  providers  are

incentivised  to  be efficient and cost-effective,  while

meeting the stipulated quality of service requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have over the years evolved the competitive

framework for taxi, bus and MRT services, while  ensuring

that  commuters' interests are safeguarded.   This  model

has  largely served us well.  But it does not  mean  that

there is no room for further improvement.  For this year,

one  of  the  priorities of my Ministry is to  completely

open  up the taxi industry.  We will allow market  forces

to  determine  the taxi supply and the fare  levels.   In

fact, we started in 1998 by allowing the taxi

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>



companies to set their own fares.  However, we still have

regular complaints about the mis-match between the supply

and   demand,   especially  during  the   peak   periods,

particularly in the CBD area.  There are also  complaints

about poor service standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two months ago, I informed the House that we would

be  deregulating the taxi industry completely  under  our

new  licensing  framework.   Come  June  this  year,  new

players  can  enter  the  market  and  compete  with  the

incumbents  for a slice of the pie.  They can  then  help

provide for a better match between supply and demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even as we deregulate, we must still ensure that

taxi companies deliver good service to the commuters.  We

will do this by licensing them and requiring them to meet

the  Quality of Service (QoS) standards.  This is  a  new

approach, and I would urge Members to allow some time for

the QoS to work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will complement this licensing framework with a

taxi driver Vocational Licence Points System.  I will  go

into  that  further,  because quite a  few  Members  have

touched on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to answer the specific

points raised by Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay suggested an alternative approach to

imposing a premium on the North East Line (NEL) fare.   I

would like to inform Members that the fare structure  for

NEL  has  not  been  decided yet.  This  is  because  SBS

Transit, the operator, has not submitted its proposal.  I

expect  SBS  Transit to submit its fare proposal  to  the

Public Transport Council (PTC) within the next few weeks.

Only then will the PTC know what the company is proposing

as the fare structure for NEL.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I had explained to Members a few months ago,

NEL,  being  fully underground, will cost  more  to  run,

compared  to  the  existing  MRT  lines  now.    The  NEL

operator  is  therefore more likely to have to  charge  a

higher fare in order to cover

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



the higher operating costs.  In fact, this possibility of

a  higher fare on NEL was highlighted by Mr Mah Bow  Tan,

the  then  Minister for Communications in 1996,  when  he

announced the decision to proceed with the NEL project.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay has asked that, instead of a differential

fare  for  NEL,  we explore the option of  maintaining  a

uniform   fare  structure  for  the  entire  MRT  system,

including NEL.  This is, of course, possible. As  pointed

out  by  Mr  Chay, we will need to allocate some  of  the

revenues from the MRT lines to NEL.  This means that  the

fares on the existing MRT system will need to increase to

cover the higher operating costs of NEL.  PTC would  have

to  consider this proposal very carefully.  The other MRT

commuters,  especially  those who  do  not  use  the  NEL

system,  may  object to having to pay more  in  order  to

cover the higher costs of NEL.  Nevertheless, I will  ask

the  PTC  to keep Mr Chay's suggestion in mind  when  SBS

Transit submits its proposal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay next asked about the safety features of NEL.

Sir,  LTA has ensured that NEL has all the safety systems

of the current MRT system, plus additional safeguards and

safety  features.  The key feature of NEL is that  it  is

fully automated.  Train experts believe that this adds to

the  safety  of  the system.  This is because  experience

around  the  world has shown that most the accidents  are

caused  by  human  factors.   For  these  reasons,  fully

automated  systems  are  becoming  increasingly   popular

worldwide.   Other  safety  systems  on  NEL  include  an

Automated Train Protection System that ensures that there

will  always  be a safe distance maintained  between  the

trains.   In  addition,  the trains  have  built-in  fire

detection  systems, and there are two CCTVs on  board  in

each  car.  This will enable the operators in the control

room  to  monitor  what is happening, as  well  as  allow

passengers to communicate with the control centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the system will be constantly monitored by

multiple  sensor  systems as well as  by  highly  trained

specialist controllers in the Operations Control  Centre.

I would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>



like  to  assure Members that LTA and the  operator  have

been  extensively  testing  the  operational  and  safety

systems  over the past few months.  They have  to  ensure

that   the   system   fully  satisfies  LTA's   stringent

requirements for operational safety before it is  allowed

to  commence revenue service.  The operating licence also

requires the operator to implement a comprehensive safety

management system to the satisfaction of LTA.   As  such,

LTA  designed  and ensured that NEL has  all  the  needed

safety   systems  required  for  its  safe   and   smooth

operation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to Mr Yatiman's cut. I am

glad  that  Mr  Yatiman likes what LTA has  done  in  the

stations  of  the  North East Line.  As mentioned  by  Mr

Yatiman, LTA has integrated works of art by local artists

in  the  architecture.  They reflect the cultural, ethnic

and  historical  settings  of the  neighbourhood  of  the

stations.   By  doing  this, LTA  has  created  a  unique

identity for each station.  This makes the stations  more

interesting, and enhances the commuting experience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yatiman has asked whether this can also be done

for  the new Circle Line stations.  I understand that the

budget for the Circle Line is extremely tight, and it  is

already  a big challenge building the Circle Line  within

the  budget set for the project.  Nonetheless, I will ask

LTA  to  review and see if there is any way that  we  can

take up Mr Yatiman's suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang suggested that LTA extend the MRT

system  into Tuas and build new stations on the  existing

MRT lines to serve the industrial estates that adjoin the

MRT  lines.   I can assure Mr Yeo that LTA is  constantly

working  on improving the public transport system serving

the  various  parts of Singapore, especially  areas  with

high   population   or  high  employment  concentrations.

However,  we  must  remember that the MRT  line  is  very

costly,  both to build and to operate.  For this  reason,

new  and extension MRT lines are constructed only if  the

economic value they bring to the nation exceeds the  cost

of  developing and operating the station.  Otherwise,  we

will be wasting precious national resources.  I will  ask

LTA to study

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>



whether  an  extension to Tuas makes economic  sense  and

whether  the operation of such a line can be  viable.   I

will  also  ask  PTC to study the need  to  increase  the

number  and frequency of bus services to Tuas  from  Boon

Lay Interchange to meet what Mr Yeo had pointed out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang also spoke about the possibility

of introducing new stations along the existing lines.  In

the  case  of  Dover  station, which he  quoted,  it  had

already been provided for when we built the existing East-West  MRT line.  It was therefore possible to build  this

station  without  too much complication.   For  locations

where  provisions have not been made earlier,  LTA  would

have  to  explore  carefully whether the site  conditions

allow   this.   But  more  importantly,  even   if   site

conditions allow, a cost-benefit analysis will still have

to be conducted on its viability.

<br>11.30 am

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min spoke on buses. He made two points

in  his cut.  First he asked LTA and PTC to be more  open

to  proposals for special bus services to serve the niche

markets.   Sir, Mr Ong may wish to note that PTC supports

the  provision of such services and that this is  already

being   done.   These  niche  services  include   premier

services  like  express buses and the Bus-Plus  services.

There  are also special services targeted at serving  the

public during specified times and for specific locations.

For  example,  we  have  special  shuttle  services  from

condominiums or industrial parks to link them to the  MRT

stations or even to hawker centres, as Mr Ong has pointed

out.   As at February this year, PTC had approved a total

of 114 such non-basic services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who is interested in providing such a special

service can obtain the application form from the PTC, or,

if  they wish, they can even go to the website for a copy

of the application form.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Ong asked about the progress of the

PTC's  review on bus service standards.   I am  happy  to

inform Mr Ong that the review is actively underway.  PTC

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>



is  taking into account public feedback and is trying  to

identify  some best international practices in  measuring

bus service performance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the proposed standards are robust,

the  PTC  will  also conduct a trial audit on  these  new

standards once they are finalised.  The results from  the

trial audit will then be used to fine-tune the standards.

Sir,  I  think  it  is important that  in  reviewing  the

standards,  PTC  balances very carefully between  meeting

rising  expectations of the public and the need to  avoid

over-imposing  additional costs on  the  operators.   PTC

expects  to complete its review and to announce  the  new

standards later this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on now to the cuts on the taxi

industry.  Mr Chay spoke about the need for greater  fare

differentiation and felt that it would not come about  if

we  merely  left  it  to  the taxi  operators.   Sir,  he

suggested  that LTA consider intervening to  bring  about

this  outcome.  I think the words that he used were  that

we  should put in place "some micro mechanisms".  Sir,  I

agree  with  Mr  Chay  that  taxi  drivers  need  to   be

incentivised  to  be at where and when  they  are  needed

most.  He used the word "fare differentiation".  It is  a

big  word.  In simple terms, it means that not  all  taxi

trips, even if they are of equal distance, should attract

equal fares.  Where and when the demand is greatest,  for

example, in the CBD and during the peak periods, or  even

when  there  are  thunderstorms,  passengers  should   be

prepared  to  pay more.  In fact, today,  Sir,  there  is

already  some  degree of fare differentiation.   This  is

achieved   through  the  application   of   a   peak-hour

surcharge, a CBD surcharge, airport surcharge  and  other

taxi surcharges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having just liberalised the taxi industry, I

would  be  reluctant to now turn around and  micro-manage

it.   The  setting of fares and the design  of  the  fare

structure  are really matters for the taxi  companies  to

consider and decide.  I do not think their management  is

lacking in imagination.  In fact, I think it will be a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>



sad  day for Singapore if the Government has to teach the

businessmen on how to operate their businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said that, I can ask LTA to look into

the possibility of linking some of the Quality of Service

(QoS) requirements to our taxi service levels, especially

during  the  peak periods  - the key is  to  measure  the

outcome rather than prescribe the micro measures for  the

industry  to follow.  In the meantime, LTA and  PTC  will

join  the  Member's call to urge the industry  to  better

match supply with demand especially in the CBD during the

peak periods.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min spoke on the quality of taxi

service.   He  asked why taxi companies are  required  to

provide a taxi-booking service, and why not allow  budget

taxi  operations  to be set up that are not  required  to

offer telephone booking services.  Sir, this begs an even

more  fundamental  question,  ie,  where  does  the  taxi

service stand in the public transport framework?  I  must

explain  to  the Member that taxis are not  considered  a

means  of  mass transport. We have very limited land  and

this means that buses and the MRT must form our modes  of

mass   transport.   Taxis  are,  in  fact,  a   form   of

personalised transport.  Taxi commuters enjoy a  door-to-door  service, one that is more akin to travelling  in  a

chauffeur-driven private car.  Ideally, taxis should  not

be  cruising  around  looking  for  passengers,  as  they

contribute to road congestion and air pollution. But this

is  a  traditional practice, and I do not intend to  stop

it.   But  we can, over time, encourage better  usage  of

taxis  and our limited roads by encouraging commuters  to

make a phone booking.  It gives all commuters who need  a

taxi  urgently  the  assurance  that  they  can  get  one

quickly,  even during peak periods. That is why  we  have

made  it compulsory for new entrants into the taxi market

to  also  provide a phone booking service and it  is  not

meant to protect the incumbents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in requiring taxi companies to provide phone-booking services, LTA is mindful of the cost. That is

why LTA will only prescribe minimal requirements and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>



not  the  specific technology to be used for the  booking

and  despatch  system.  Mr Ong may be worried  about  the

cost.  LTA has told me that the start-up cost of a simple

radio-phone booking system for a fleet of about 400 taxis

is between $250,000 and $420,000.  Sir, this works out to

about $600 per taxi, which is less than 1% of the cost of

a taxi.  The cost per taxi will, of course, reduce as the

taxi  company  increases the fleet size.  Therefore,  the

setting  up  of  a phone booking service will  not  be  a

barrier to entry of new taxi companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ong next went on to talk about taxi fares.

He  is  concerned that taxi fares look set to rise.    He

has  been  reading the "tea leaves" in between  the  last

time he spoke in Parliament about the taxi fares and  the

appearance of an article in the Straits Times  that  said

the  taxi  fare in Singapore is too low.  Sir, he  thinks

that  actually  it  is  the Government  that  is  unhappy

because  this represents a loss of potential  revenue  to

the  Government.   I want to assure Mr  Ong  that  he  is

totally  wrong that we are unhappy with the  fare  level.

Neither  LTA  nor my Ministry has any share in  the  taxi

fare  revenue.  So  we are quite neutral.   It  makes  no

difference to us whether the fares are increased or  not.

Our  primary  interest is only to ensure that  those  who

badly need a taxi are able to get one and that there is a

better balance between supply and demand during the  peak

periods.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked again that we publicise our preference for

commuters to phone for a taxi and tell them not to street

hail.   Sir,  as  I stated a few minutes ago,  yes,  over

time,  we  would  like more commuters to  use  the  phone

booking service, especially those who want a taxi  badly.

But  for  those who are prepared to wait by the roadside,

they  can still continue to do so.  There is no need  for

us  to stop this practice.  But commuters who do so  must

understand  that  we cannot assure them  of  the  waiting

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong is also worried that the QoS would force taxi

operators  to  take their taxis off the road  by  putting

them on stand-by.  He cited CityCab's decision to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>



reduce  the charge for a phone booking and he is  worried

that  if  they get swamped with calls, they will  not  be

able to manage with their current fleet size.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the existing taxi operators are more

enterprising  than what Mr Ong is prepared to  give  them

credit  for.  I am sure that if the demand is strong  for

both the phone booking and street hail, they will find  a

way  to  balance the two and not to totally ignore street

hail  commuters.  This is because if they do ignore them,

they  will only encourage new entrepreneurs to enter  and

to meet this unfilled demand.  If CityCab is swamped with

phone bookings, I think this would be a happy problem for

them.  They  have the freedom to expand their fleet  size

now.  Previously, we restricted them to a certain number.

Now they are free to expand as and when they like.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong then went on to talk about competition in the

taxi  industry.   Sir,  he  expressed  concern  that  the

Comfort-Delgro merger would create an even more  dominant

player  and that having this very dominant player,  where

they  can  determine their price and the taxi trends,  it

would  deter competitors from coming in or from having  a

different price structure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ong is indeed correct to be concerned with

the  merger.  In fact, I was too, which was  why  when  I

heard about it, I straightaway asked my staff to find out

from  Delgro and Comfort what were their intentions  with

regard  to CityCab and Comfort taxis.  Comfort and Delgro

have  since explained publicly that after their  proposed

merger, their respective taxi operations will continue to

operate  separately.  Each will have  its  own  board  of

directors  and  management.  But they  will  be  able  to

obtain  synergies  in  their  back-end  operations.   For

example,  they  can  do bulk purchases  of  fuel,  tyres,

vehicles, etc.  This would give them greater economies of

scale  and  result in cost savings which  I  think  would

eventually be passed on to commuters.  But we  will  have

to   continue  to  watch  the  merger  very  closely  and

carefully.   LTA now has powers to ensure  that  dominant

players  do  not  engage in anti-competitive  behaviours,

which is what Mr Ong is concerned

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>



about.  I can assure Mr Ong that LTA will not hesitate to

take  appropriate actions should the dominant players  be

found to be doing so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to pricing, I think despite the

fact that we have a dominant player, this would not deter

companies from varying their prices.  In fact, TIBS today

has  a  slightly  different price structure  compared  to

Delgro  or Comfort and CityCab.  I am sure, with  greater

competition, they will continue to innovate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Seng Han Thong, Mr Andy Gan, Mr Yatiman

Yusof and Mr Wee Siew Kim expressed concerns about having

adequate  protection  for taxi drivers,  especially  when

there  are disputes or when there are complaints  against

them.   They asked for a more transparent appeal  process

for  the taxi-drivers and they suggested that we have  an

arbitration panel or a dispute resolution panel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, let me state that it is in the taxi

companies' interest to ensure that they treat their  taxi

drivers  carefully and build up good rapport  with  them.

This is because while taxi drivers need the companies  in

order  to  get their taxis, the taxi companies  need  the

drivers  equally much because, without the drivers,  they

will be in trouble.  The satisfied and happy drivers will

also be able to provide a better service to commuters and

the  benefits  will again eventually  flow  back  to  the

companies.  Treating the drivers well also helps the taxi

companies retain their good drivers.  I am glad that  the

taxi   companies  do  indeed  recognise  this   symbiotic

relationship  as  seen by the fact that  they  have  gone

ahead  to  introduce many measures to help their  drivers

financially.  For  example, they have passed  on  to  the

drivers the diesel tax savings, they have offered  rental

rebates  and they have passed down the bulk discounts  on

the  purchase of diesel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while most taxi drivers do a good job, from

time to time, there will be some who fail to deliver good

customer service or, more importantly, infringe upon some

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>



rules and regulations.  But I agree with Members that  in

such cases, the disciplinary framework on the part of the

taxi  companies and LTA should be transparent,  fair  and

not arbitrary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy to inform Members that LTA is, in

fact,  revising the disciplinary framework.   Under  this

revised  framework, there will be a clear delineation  of

responsibilities  between LTA  and  the  taxi  companies.

LTA will deal with complaints relating to infringement of

rules  and  regulations by the taxi  drivers,  eg,  over-charging by the drivers.  LTA will accordingly award  the

demerit points under the Vocational Licence Points System

(VLPS).   On  the  other hand, taxi companies  will  only

handle  the  complaints relating to customer service  and

they  will not be empowered to issue demerit points under

the VLPS.  Sir, to make it transparent, LTA would publish

a schedule of fines and demerit points and the guidelines

for  suspending or revoking the vocational licence.  This

will enhance the transparency of the framework.  The taxi

drivers  will  have a clearer understanding  about  their

responsibilities and what is expected of them.

<br>11.45 am

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the fairness of the system, under the

present  system,  when a passenger or commuter  lodges  a

complaint,  LTA  or  the taxi company  will  examine  the

complaint and they need not necessarily call up the  taxi

driver  or  the passenger for an interview.   Under  this

revised system, LTA will require both the complainant, as

well  as  the  taxi driver, to turn up for interviews  so

that  the  full facts can be ascertained.  And only  when

LTA  has  been clearly satisfied that there has  been  an

infringement  of  the  rules  and  regulations  will  LTA

proceed  to  penalise the taxi driver.  The  taxi  driver

will still have an appeals process.  He can appeal to LTA

or,  if  there  is  a suspension of the licence,  he  can

appeal to the Minister for Transport as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the part of the taxi drivers, they will also

be required to carry out

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>



the  interviews  accordingly.  Sir, notwithstanding  this

new system of requiring interviews to be carried out,  we

recognise  that  the disputes between  taxi  drivers  and

companies  will still arise from time to time, but  there

are  already avenues in place for taxi drivers to resolve

their  disputes  with their company.  The aggrieved  taxi

drivers   can  approach  their  respective  taxi  drivers

associations for help.  And, in fact, that is one of  the

key  roles  performed  by the taxi drivers  associations.

This  approach has worked fairly well, and I think  there

is  no  need  for the Ministry to step in  to  set  up  a

separate dispute and resolution panel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Seng Han Thong and Mr Ang Mong Seng spoke

about the $25 a month fee.  They are concerned about  the

quantum  and  they  are  also  concerned  that  the  taxi

companies  may just pass this on to the taxi drivers  and

to commuters.  Sir, let me first explain the need for the

taxi licence fee and put the fee quantum in perspective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The licence fee is linked to LTA's objective and its

efforts  to  improve  the level  of  taxi  service.   The

licensing  regime will require LTA, as the regulator,  to

closely  monitor  the performance of taxi  operators  and

their compliance with the QoS.  LTA will also investigate

and  enforce  against errant taxi drivers under  the  new

Vocational  Licence  Points System.   As  these  are  new

activities,  additional  manpower  resources  and,  hence

funding, will be required.  The licence fee is to  enable

LTA to fund these new activities.  The licence fee of $25

per taxi per month works out to less than 1% of the gross

turnover of the taxi companies.  It amounts to less  than

three  cents  per taxi trip, against an average  fare  of

around  $7.00 per trip.  The impact on the taxi operating

cost  is,  therefore, extremely small.  Sir, in addition,

the  taxi companies themselves have been making very good

profits.   In  fact,  Comfort  last  year  experienced  a

significant increase in the profit level.  I  would  also

therefore hope, just as the Members have spoken, that the

taxi  companies do not pass on this taxi licence  fee  to

the drivers as well.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as LTA will need to set up an audit enforcement

framework  immediately, the work would be more  intensive

in  the  first two years of this system.  The $25 licence

fee  is  based  on  the  budget  of  this  initial,  more

intensive, phase of the regulatory work.  I am  happy  to

therefore inform Mr Ang that LTA will review the  quantum

of  the  licence fee and look into reducing it after  two

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have answered all the questions put

up  so  far.  I will ask my Senior Minister of  State  to

answer the other questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Mr Chay.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, the

Minister  raised an important point and I  want  to  just

clarify.  I did not ask for the fare structure of SMRT to

be raised.  I said there should be feeder rebates between

the  systems  so  that when the North  East  Line  passes

passengers  over to the SMRT line there will  be  certain

gains  for SMRT.  Therefore, for such gains, there should

be  a rebates scheme whereby the cost is defrayed on  the

NE  Line.   This kind of mechanism has to  be  looked  at

before  we  straightaway  go  for  fare  increases,  just

because there is some additional cost.  We must look  for

economies of scale and I am sure SMRT will benefit a  lot

by the feeder of passengers from the NE Line.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, it works both ways. NE

Line will be passing passengers on to the SMRT system and

vice-versa.   So, if there are rebates, the same  rebates

will flow both ways, but these will be factors which  PTC

will definitely be looking into.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Of course there will be rebates

that flow both ways, but I am sure there will be a lot of

gains for the SMRT lines.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> A

clarification.  On the complaint procedure, I  understand

that the new complaint procedure ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Chin, is that a clarification

or question?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Clarification on the

complaint  procedure.  I understand  that  the  complaint

procedure involves getting the complainant to come and be

interviewed by LTA officials and so on.  Is that correct?

Because  there would be tourists who would just  complain

and leave the country.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, LTA will require the

complainant to come forward, as far as possible.   If  he

is a tourist then we will just have to judge based on the

complaint lodged by the tourist and we will still talk to

the  taxi  driver to get his side of the story.   In  the

past, this was never done.

<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan (Senior Minister of State for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):</b> Sir, let me first reply to the two cuts by Mr

Wee  Siew  Kim  yesterday.  Mr  Wee  spoke  on  licencing

conditions  that we impose on public transport operators.

He  said  that  we should avoid over-stringent  licensing

conditions  as  they  will  inevitably  lead  to   higher

operating costs and transport fares.  I agree with Mr Wee

that every regulation has a cost and that we should avoid

over-stringent   licensing   conditions.     Hence,    in

formulating  rules and standards, we go for  the  minimum

that  will ensure an acceptable level of service,  safety

and  operational efficiency.  The operating principle  is

to  keep  the  cost  of  public  transport  low,  without

sacrificing standards of safety and comfort.  But as  the

needs  and expectations of commuters do change with time,

regulations  will  also have to evolve  with  time.   For

example,  air-conditioned buses were considered  a  frill

when we were young, but this is now a basic item.  So, we

have  to raise the standards to allow for air-conditioned

buses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee added that regulators should work closely

with  transport operators on such regular reviews as they

have  useful ground experience and would be in  a  better

position to advise on which licencing condition should be

further  relaxed.  I totally agree with this  partnership

approach.  In fact, it was through such industry feedback

that  we  decided, not too long ago, to extend the  life-span of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



public  buses  from 12 years to 15 years.  The  extension

saves  the  bus operators a lot of money, with downstream

benefits for commuters.  We will continue to consult  the

transport operators on such matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee's second cut was on transfer rebate. He said

that  transfer  rebate  should be regularly  reviewed  to

ensure  equitable treatment for all.  I  agree  with  him

that transfer rebate should be based on the principle  of

equity.   Specifically, Mr Wee wanted to be assured  that

commuters using feeder services, without any transfer  to

a  trunk service, should not be unduly penalised.  Let me

explain how the transfer rebate came about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years ago, feeder fares used to be lower than the

minimum  trunk  fares.  Actually, they were under-priced.

In  other  words, the fare was lower than  the  operating

costs  of the feeder bus operator.  This was clearly  not

sustainable as a viable bus operation requires  fares  to

at  least  cover the cost.  Effectively, feeder  services

were being cross-subsidised by trunk services.  This  has

to  be  rectified.  A simple solution was  to  raise  the

feeder  bus fare to the right level, and be aligned  with

the minimum trunk fares which were correctly priced.  But

if  we  simply raise the feeder bus fares to the  minimum

trunk  fares, commuters who transfer between  feeder  and

trunk  services  will be overcharged.  To overcome  this,

transfer  rebates were introduced.  So this  has  allowed

the  Public  Transport  Council to  gradually  align  the

feeder  fares  with  the  minimum  trunk  fares,  without

raising the cost of transfers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we adjust feeder fares, the transfer rebates were

correspondingly raised.  The end result is that  the  net

feeder  fare  payable by the commuter remains  unchanged.

It  is  easier  if I can give you an example.   When  the

feeder fare for air-conditioned buses was increased by 10

cents  to 60 cents in the year 2001, the transfer  rebate

was  also raised by 10 cents, from 15 cents to 25  cents.

So the end result, the net feeder fare payable remains at

35  cents.   Incidentally, Members may wish to note  that

this is the same fare, as what the bus operators

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>



charged   in   1994  when  feeder  services  were   first

introduced.    In  short,  the  current   transfer   fare

structure does allow for a fair matching of cost to fare,

and  nobody  is unduly penalised.  But I agree  with  him

that   we  should  regularly  review  the  structure   as

circumstances change so as to preserve equity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me reply to Mr Ong Kian Min's question

on  an aborted LTA project costing some $40 million.   He

was referring to the bus travel information system.  This

was  a project initiated by LTA in 1999.  The purpose was

to  let  commuters know with better accuracy the  arrival

times of buses.  Let me give Members the background  that

led to this project.  At that time, several bus companies

were,  on  their own, developing what they called  "Fleet

Management  Systems" computer software  to  manage  their

fleet.   The  purpose  was to locate the  whereabouts  of

their  buses,  and there were thousands of them,  at  any

particular point in time.  LTA saw an opportunity to ride

on this Fleet Management Systems by (a) making it nation-wide through integrating them, because there were several

systems  and operators; and (b) adding a new  feature  to

predict bus arrival times for the benefit of commuters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention was good but, unfortunately, LTA and

the   bus  operators  had  severely  under-estimated  the

complexity  of the project, in particular,  the  computer

software  to interface the different bus company  systems

turned  out  to  be a lot more complicated,  a  lot  more

difficult.   As  a result, the project experienced  major

delays  and  would  have  resulted  in  significant  cost

overruns  if the project were to run to completion.   So,

at  a  recent  meeting, not too long ago,  the  Board  of

Directors  of LTA reviewed the project.  After evaluating

its  prospects, weighing the revised costs and  benefits,

the LTA Board decided to abort the project.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, about $10 million, and not $40 million as

reported  by  the media, has been spent on this  project.

What  were the main cost items?  They were (a) a  nation-wide radio communications system; (b) the equipment for a

central computer

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>



system,  and  (c)  the computer software.   Although  the

project  has  been aborted, fortunately, the efforts,  in

this  instance,  put in have not all  been  wasted.   The

equipment  which has been acquired will have  useful  use

elsewhere.  Specifically, LTA will be modifying the radio

communications system to support its existing  Expressway

Monitoring  and Advisory System (EMAS).   In  fact,  this

modification will then save LTA about $2.2 million  every

year in data transmission cost, as it will then no longer

need to rely on a third party wireless service provider.

12.00 noon

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong also asked if there were feasibility studies

done  before  LTA  embarked on this project.  Yes,  there

were.   As  LTA  would  be breaking new  ground,  it  did

several  smaller  scale trials in 1995,  1997  and  1999,

before  the project went full scale. The trials  were  on

smaller  scales involving only a few buses.  In the  1999

trial,  the  team  was  able to achieve  accuracy  levels

ranging  from  87%  to 99%, which were quite  acceptable.

Unfortunately, major integration problems arose when  the

project was scaled up.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Fang Ai Lian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would

like to focus my comments on vehicle and fuel taxes,  and

their  impact on transportation costs as well as business

costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, financial measures, whether they

come  in  the  form  of  incentives,  disincentives   and

penalties,  have always been used to achieve  social  and

other  objectives.   For example,  we  have  the  foreign

worker levy to control the population of foreign workers,

and  we  also  have incentives given to couples  to  have

larger  families.  But I think nowhere do we  find  these

measures  being  widely used than in the  case  of  motor

vehicles  to control road traffic congestion.   Over  the

years,  we  have  seen  penalties after  penalties  being

introduced  and levelled against car owners  as  well  as

users.  This broad and complex range includes excise tax,

road  tax,  ARF,  COE, fuel and vehicle taxes,  and  also

parking   fees.   All  these  have  added   on   to   the

transportation cost.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>



These  have made it very expensive and, hence, have  also

affected  business  costs,  because  transportation  cost

forms a quite significant portion of business costs,  and

will therefore erode our business competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart from having a very complex system, it

has  also  produced a few quirks.  For example,  I  would

like to cite the example of second hand vehicles.  It  is

much more profitable to scrap than to sell them as second

hand  vehicles.  This is sheer wastage, because cars  can

be  used  beyond five years.  They can be used for  10-15

years,  or more than that.  Quite apart from wastage,  we

also have a significant capital outflow because we import

cars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second quirk is that businesses which use diesel

for  their  equipment have also to  bear  the  burden  of

diesel   tax  when  they  do  not  contribute   to   road

congestion.   My  comment here is that we  are  now  very

experienced  in knowing what sort of measures  we  should

have  to  achieve  a smoother traffic  flow,  because  we

really  do have a very good road system.  We do not  have

road  congestion  and all these promote  Singapore  as  a

business centre.  But I think we need to consolidate.  We

need   to  simplify  our  system,  concentrate  on  those

measures which work towards achieving a smoother  traffic

flow  and  really unravel the very complex web  of  fees,

charges  and taxes, indirect as well as direct.   At  the

end of the day, a simpler system would be much superior.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, I speak with concern

regarding the proliferation of ERP technologies currently

adopted  by  several  private car park  managements.   At

these  car  parks, a person does not need to do anything.

A  camera  somewhere above records his entry and  deducts

from  his cash card automatically when he exits.  He does

not even get a receipt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is there to prevent abuse and fraud when

such  technologies become easily available?   Can  anyone

easily duplicate or get hold of such a deducting

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>



system  or  machine  and  then go  around  car  parks  or

somewhere  and illegally collect money from  unsuspecting

car  owners?  I hope the Minister can address this public

concern.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim:</b> Sir, Sengkang LRT is operating well

for the past eight weeks now.  It has brought convenience

to  the  residents.  Quality service along the  frequency

and reliability dimensions has been enhanced.  Truly,  we

must commend the LTA for bringing to life the White Paper

on  Public Transportation of 1996.  While the light  rail

system  now has provided enhanced reliability and to  the

dot  predictability,  one must not forget  that  the  LRT

system, by and large, is expensive to build and maintain.

Cost must always remain paramount at the forefront of our

thinking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether there have

been  continuing  studies  and considerations  for  other

forms  of  transportation, so that future generations  of

Singaporeans can continue to look forward to increasingly

more    efficient   and   cost   effective    modes    of

transportation.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would

like  to  commend the Ministry on the work that has  been

done in both ensuring the disabled and elder friendliness

of  the North East Line, and also on the ongoing work  in

retrofitting  existing stations  so  that  they  will  be

accessible  to  the  semi-ambulant and wheelchair  bound.

However,  in the public transport system, it is  actually

of  little  use if only segments of the system are  elder

friendly,  as the user is then still unable  to  complete

his or her journey from one point to the other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the MRT stations as an illustration, having

the  stations internally totally accessible to the  frail

and  wheelchair bound is useless if the connecting  buses

are  inaccessible, or if the frail or semi-ambulant elder

is  unable  to  get to the station, because  of  overhead

pedestrian  bridges,  underpasses,  raised  pavements  or

kerbs  surrounding  the station.  I  am  not  quite  sure

whether overhead

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>



pedestrian bridges, underpasses, pavements and kerbs  are

under the purview of the Transport Ministry or MND.   But

I  do  hope  that  whichever  it  is,  the  planning  and

implementation of access across systems and precincts are

being well coordinated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to buses, I understand that the Ministry

has  assessed that it will not be practical to  introduce

such wheelchair accessible features as kneeling buses, as

it  is  anticipated that this would slow down  the  whole

system  too much.  However, there are many other  simpler

features that our buses can have that will make them much

more user friendly to ambulant senior citizens, and these

include zero step boarding, stepless aisle buses or steps

of lower height, properly placed rubberised handgrips and

such features.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, again, that the Ministry has prescribed

steps  height  of 360 mm or less  for all new  buses.   I

want to ask whether, in fact, all the buses in our system

have already been converted by now.  It was sometime  ago

that this was prescribed.  If not, when is it anticipated

that this will be achieved?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bigger bus service numbers will also be helpful for

senior   citizens   to   quickly  and   easily   identify

approaching  buses.  And also software features  such  as

bus  workers'  skills  and attitudes  in  providing  some

assistance or simply being mindful not to accelerate  and

decelerate too quickly coming into and leaving bus  bays,

and  allowing enough time for the older passengers to get

seated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusion of cost of wheelchair lifts and

installation of such lifts from the OMV of a vehicle when

computing  the  ARF  in  the budget  this  year  is  most

welcome.  And this is targeted at the vans used  by  VWOs

to provide transport service for the elderly and disabled

clients.   But, in many developed countries, it has  been

recognised that it is actually far more cost effective to

transport  the  disabled and elderly by mainstream  taxis

with special transportation service, often carried out by

the mainstream taxi operators.  They can provide door-to-door

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>



service  round the clock and give travel assistance  such

as  helping  the  passenger in and out  of  the  vehicle.

Essentially,  all  that it takes is some  basic  training

although, of course, added features in the cabs like grab

handles  to  aid entry and exit, swivel seats  and  wider

door openings are also very helpful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxi fares in Singapore compare very favourably with

many  other  developed countries.   But  for  the  poorer

elderly,  various countries have a variety of  subsidised

systems.  London has a taxi card system.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Lee, your time is almost up.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Many Ministries and agencies have

to  come  together  to realise a truly  elderly  friendly

transport  system.   I would like to  ask  the  Transport

Ministry  whether there is a directed effort.   Is  there

somebody  in  charge  to  push  and  coordinate  all  the

activities  of  all the agencies, so  that  we  can  move

towards  a comprehensive elder friendly transport  system

expeditiously in a planned rather than ad hoc manner?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would like to carry on from where hon. Member, Dr

Jennifer  Lee,  left off.  I would like to  take  up  the

plight and plea of older persons, otherwise known as  the

elderly,  in  heeding  the  call  of  the  Government  to

practise  active ageing, including remaining or rejoining

the workforce where possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many senior citizens who would like

to be in employment, but who find difficulty in doing so.

They cite a number of factors.  One of these is commuting

by mass public transport.  While eligible senior citizens

are  appreciative  of the concessionary public  transport

fares for off-peak travel, they find the applicable  time

period  for travel restrictive.  They mentioned that  for

them, because of reduced employment income, they have  to

rely  on the mass public transport to commute to and from

work, and many have working hours that require them to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>



ride  the  buses,  MRT  or LRT during  peak  hours,  thus

incurring higher transport costs, especially in  view  of

the  recent  fare hikes.  Then there are  those  who  are

still  fit  and healthy and who can take public transport

at  all  times of the day that the mass public  transport

system is in operation.  They do not think it a danger to

be  part of the rush hour human traffic.  Besides, senior

citizens  are sensible persons.  They would not  wish  to

jeopardise   their own safety nor that of others.    They

would know that for themselves whether it is safe or  not

for  them  to travel during peak times.  So there  is  no

need to confine them to off-peak periods.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such circumstances, would the Minister kindly

initiate   a   review   of  existing   public   transport

regulations that impede opportunities for senior citizens

to  be  gainfully  employed and to enjoy  active  ageing?

This  is  also  in line with the thrust of  the  Economic

Review  Committee's recommendations regarding  employment

of  older workers.  I know that this has been brought  up

before  in  this House and the older persons  would  just

like the Minister to please review and assist them as far

as possible, and thus make their day.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, I would like to move on to a

free  do-it-yourself  mode  of  transport,  ie,  cycling.

Often  times,  we  have heard that the  unkind  Singapore

weather is not conducive to cycling and that seems to  be

the  reason  for not promoting cycling as a more  popular

means of transport.  But I believe that the habitants  of

any  place  on  earth have to learn to  cope  with  their

environment.   In  discussing for more  to  be  done  for

cyclists,  we  seem  to have a mental  picture  of  quiet

country   roads,  where  the  sun  is  shining  but   the

temperature is a cool comfortable 15 degrees Celsius  and

the humidity is low.  We seem to believe that cycling can

only  be  done  in  such an ideal environment.   But  the

reality  is that even in a cycling country like  Holland,

the  sun does not always shine every day.  Cyclists  have

to  learn  to face the rain, the cold and even the  snow,

but  many  people  there  still  cycle  as  a  means   of

transport.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>



They  face  different,  but equally unpleasant,  problems

with the elements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we just have to adapt and learn to cope with

the  weather.  We should take a deeper look at how we can

make  it easier for those who may want to cycle,  if  our

drivers are less harsh on cyclists and our roads safer.

<br>12.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from cycling to and from work, we should also

consider   the   needs  of  the  recreational   cyclists.

Nowadays,  I see more and more serious cyclists,  donning

their  brightly  coloured racing suits and  riding  their

expensive  bicycles on weekends in areas such as  Holland

Road and Bukit Timah.  At present, I see many of them are

expatriates.  Nevertheless, this is a happy sight and  we

should  encourage  more  people to  participate  in  this

healthy  affordable  sport.  I  would  like  to  ask  the

Minister  to  consider  setting  aside  for  the  use  of

cyclists  during  weekends the left  lane  of  three-lane

roads  in certain suitable areas and making some  efforts

to  educate motorists to look out for and have due regard

for  these cyclists.  I believe this will be a good start

and,  over  time, the attitude and behaviour  of  vehicle

drivers  towards cyclists will change for the  better  to

make our roads safer.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, there has

been  a  spate of complaints by pedestrians on what  they

call the "bicycle menace" on pedestrian footpaths.  I can

emphathise with them.  Just last night, I was almost  hit

by a cyclist racing by from behind.  But I can emphathise

with  cyclists  too, as most roads are too dangerous  for

them,  especially the main roads.  Cars and  buses  often

zoom  by very closely to the cyclists, endangering  their

lives,  and  taxis are particularly treacherous  as  they

swerve  suddenly to the kerb with little notice, to  pick

up passengers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, pedestrians angry with cyclists on pavements

are  really barking up the wrong wheel.  They  should  be

directing  their unhappiness at the wheels of bureaucracy

of LTA.  The LTA does not factor in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>



the  need  for bicycle lanes in its road planning.   With

more  taking to cycling, they should widen the roads  and

build  an  extra  lane  for cyclists  in  certain  areas,

separate from the pavements for pedestrians.  Indeed,  in

Tampines,  it is not uncommon to see cyclists, especially

women, transporting their children to school on bicycles.

The  Government has replied that there are  already  park

connectors, but these tracks so far mainly only link  our

major  parks and nature sites.  And the purpose  for  the

park connectors is for leisure cycling and not as a means

of transport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to connect them to roads to allow

residents  to  ride  to places that  they  frequent,  for

example, schools, markets, shops and to their homes.  The

Government has also said before that town councils should

be  the ones to look into providing cycling tracks within

their   HDB   estates.   I  agree  that  town   councils,

especially with the support of their MPs, should  be  the

right  channel to advise the LTA on the areas  that  need

bicycle  lanes.  Indeed, in Tampines, we are  looking  at

how  to build cycling lanes and cycling tracks to connect

to  the park connectors.  But, in the end, we still  have

to  seek the approval of the LTA.  And there is a lot  of

red  tape  involved.  The park connectors are  under  the

National Parks Board; the roads are under LTA; the common

areas in town councils are under the town councils.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would think that the right agency - the lead

agency  -  in building bicycle lanes should be LTA.   LTA

should  be  the  one  planning for and providing  bicycle

lanes  as  part of the public transport for Singaporeans.

At the same time, as more Singaporeans take up cycling, I

feel  that there should be a concerted effort to  educate

them  on  road  safety.   I  think,  very  frankly,  many

cyclists  do not know the traffic rules very  well.   But

you  cannot really blame them, because they do  not  take

driving theory tests, like the way that drivers have  to.

But  I am not saying that they should take tests.   I  am

saying  that there should be education mounted  to  teach

cyclists what are the rules.  Frankly, at one time I  was

cycling to work everyday, from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>



Upper  East Coast Road to Kim Seng Road, never  mind  the

weather  -  very  hot, but I cycled  to  work  because  I

enjoyed cycling and I was training.  One night when I was

cycling  home,  I  was  knocked  down  by  a  taxi  in  a

roundabout.   Frankly, I was not sure whether  I  or  the

taxi  driver was in the wrong.  But later when I took  up

driving  and  I  had to go through the  theory  tests,  I

realised  that the taxi driver was in the  wrong;  so,  I

felt better.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Ng, you have to cycle faster

because your time is nearly up!

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Today, there is a big

controversy  about  whether  cyclists  could  use   zebra

crossings.   So  I  think  there should  be  some  effort

mounted to educate cyclists on road safety.  And I  worry

now,  because of the outcry about cyclists on  pavements,

cyclists  will  now feel compelled to go onto  the  roads

without  being  prepared  to  take  on  the  dangers   of

competing with the big vehicles for space on the roads.

<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Sir, there is a hotchpotch of

cuts.  Let me take them chronologically.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin with the cut by Mrs Fang Ai Lian. In

principle, I agree with her that taxes and levies  should

be  as  simple as possible for easier administration  and

compliance.  She asked whether we could continue to  work

and  simplify  further our vehicle taxes.  Actually,  our

vehicle  taxes  are not that complicated.  When  vehicles

are   registered,   they  are  subject   to   a   nominal

registration  fee  of  $140.  In addition,  there  is  an

Additional  Registration Fee (ARF)  and  an  Excise  Duty

(ED).   Both serve the purpose of curbing car population.

After that, you just pay the annual road tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collectively, these taxes allow us to achieve a

balance between cost of ownership and cost of usage.   Of

course,  it  cannot be a static picture, and my  Ministry

will  always  work with Ministry of Finance to  fine-tune

this  balance.  Over the years, we have done so.   But  I

take  the  point  of  Mrs Fang that  the  situation  does

change,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>



and  if  it  does,  I think we should always  be  on  the

lookout.  Especially, she mentioned about quirks here and

there, which have distorted the consumer behaviour.  Then

we  should  try  to fix them.  I am open to  suggestions.

And  some  of those quirks that she mentioned, I  do  not

have  personal knowledge of them, but we will  look  into

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she did make a point that we sometimes

inadvertently contribute to business cost, and  she  gave

the example of diesel tax.  For diesel tax, we do not add

to  business  cost.   Goods vehicles  and  buses  run  on

diesel,  are not charged diesel tax at all, and precisely

for  the reason that she gave, which is we wanted to keep

business cost low.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia spoke about the increasing use of ERP

technology  in  car parks and so on, and he  was  greatly

concerned  about  security and whether some  people  will

come along with some gadget and zap away all the money in

our  cashcards.  This is certainly a valid concern.   Let

me  give  a little bit of background to provide a  bigger

picture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cashcards were introduced in 1996, when we took a

big step into the cashless society.  We were not alone in

this movement but we were among the early adopters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many reasons for promoting cashcards.

Basically, handling cash is a very inefficient and costly

business.   To  businesses, going cashless  spells  lower

cost   and  higher  productivity.   To  consumers,  going

cashless  means greater convenience.  A cashless  society

is, therefore, an ideal worth pursuing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to gain consumer acceptance, security concerns

of  the type that Mr Steve Chia talked about have  to  be

robustly  addressed.  People will be  willing  to  use  a

cashcard  only if they can be assured that they will  not

get unduly short-changed or have their money zapped away.

That  is  why the usage and security of cashcards,  or  a

more correct

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>



technical term, stored value cards, are governed  by  the

Banking  Act.   Only banks are allowed  to  issue  multi-purpose stored value cards.  And MAS imposes very  strict

rules and regulations on them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we have taken these concerns seriously,

cashcards  have  become widely accepted by  Singaporeans.

It  is  now  very much part of our life and we  literally

cannot  leave home without it.  There are now 10  million

cashcard  transactions per month in Singapore - quite  an

achievement!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my Ministry, a key usage is for electronic road

pricing  (ERP) payments.  How do we ensure  security,  in

our  case,  for  ERP  transactions?  The  ERP  system  is

audited  regularly, both by the internal audit department

of  the  LTA  as  well  as  its  external  auditor.   The

processes and transactions are all subject to audit.  For

example, the charge tables are meticulously checked  both

before and after they are downloaded into the system.  In

addition,  the live transaction data are also checked  as

they come into the system to confirm that the ERP charges

deducted are correct.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia observed that increasingly car parks

are  adopting the ERP technology, much to the convenience

of   motorists.   For  example,  I  have  been  attending

performances in the Esplanade, it is such a breeze - just

drive through.  But Mr Chia can be rest assured that  the

system  is secure.  He just has to remember to  insert  a

valid  cashcard into his in-vehicle unit.  In  fact,  you

can  check  it yourself quite easily, if you are  worried

about  the  system being faulty, or whatever.  Just  take

out  your cashcard, check what is your cash balance,  and

when   you  go  through  the  toll  gate,  do  it  again.

Sometimes, I do that, just to be sure, and it  works  all

the time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he made a new point and asked: are there gadgets

that  you  can  carry and go to the car  park  and  start

zapping away the money?  You can try.  But I do not think

it will work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me reply to the cut by Mr Wee Siew Kim on

alternative public transport.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



I  agree with him that we should always be on the lookout

for  cheaper,  less costly, alternative modes  of  public

transport.  We are not fixated on MRT or buses.  But  the

fact  remains  that,  based  on  current  technology,   a

judicious mix of MRT and buses still serves our interests

best.   But  we are not alone in this game.  Every  other

city has to grapple with this problem.  So, we have other

cities'  experience to study and to learn from.   But  we

will continue to monitor what is happening elsewhere, and

see if there are better solutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to the cuts by Dr Jennifer Lee and

Prof.  Ngiam.   Dr  Jennifer  Lee  asked  if  our  public

transport system is friendly to the elderly.  Let me make

it quite clear.  The top priority of our public transport

system is to cater to the needs of the masses.  It cannot

be  helped,  because  large  numbers  have  to  be  moved

speedily   from  point  A  to  point  B,  and   that   is

fundamental.  If we cannot meet that objective, we  would

have  failed.  Nevertheless, our public transport  system

does  try  to  accommodate the needs of the elderly,  the

feeble  and  the  disabled, for as long as  it  does  not

severely compromise the needs of the masses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee talked about buses - when will we get all our

buses   elderly-friendly?   I  think  we  are  doing   it

systematically and progressively.  When buses  are  being

replaced,  they  are required to become elderly-friendly.

I  think  this is a practical way going forward,  because

the other alternative, which is, big bang, overnight, ask

the  few thousand buses to be replaced, that will be high

cost.   Somebody has got to bear that cost.   I  remember

vividly  our  three-cent debate not too many months  ago,

and this will cost more than three cents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked what is the progress to-date. I checked.

I  think,  right now, about one-third of SBS Transit  and

TIBS fleet of buses are elderly-friendly with low floors.

Yes,  she talked about bus drivers, that they have to  be

more  careful when they have the elderly and the disabled

on   board   and   should  not  do   sudden   brakes   or

accelerations.   I checked.  Yes, this  is  part  of  the

training for bus drivers.  Actually

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>



this  is common sense, but sometimes, common sense  needs

to be reiterated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for MRT, the same thing. We are progressively

upgrading our stations.  To-date, we have completed  five

stations,  one  of  which  is  Novena,  which  is  in  my

constituency, coincidentally.  But the other 40  will  be

progressively completed by 2005.

<br>12.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxi is a very important mode of transport for the

wheel-chair  bound.  I totally agree with her.   Some  of

our taxi operators have begun to be doing that.  In fact,

yesterday,  while driving here from MITA, at the  traffic

light junction, I saw one of the Comfort taxis with  that

Handicare  Cab  Service logo, a very  kind  looking  taxi

driver  and very proud of this logo.  They are  providing

very  good  service  for  those who  require  handicapped

friendly taxis.  But we will continue our efforts to work

with  the  various operators to see how we can  make  the

transport system to be even more friendly to the  elderly

and the disabled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with her that this is a project not MOT

alone  can deliver.  And I thought I made that point  too

some  months ago when a similar question was raised here,

ie,  to  ensure that it is seamless travel  all  the  way

requires contribution from everybody - MND, MOT - but  we

will do our part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Ngiam joined in the debate and talked about

fare concessions.  And I thought we discussed that too  a

few  months  ago.   Fare concessions  scheme  for  senior

citizens  is  operated  by  the  operators;  we  are  not

involved.   As rightly pointed out, once we get involved,

we   have  to  do  it  nation-wide  and  cross-subsidise.

Somebody  has  got  to  fund  the  subsidy.   For  us  to

intervene  to  say  that  the operators  must  have  fare

concessions  and do it 24 hours, seven  days  a  week,  I

think  the load would then have to be shouldered  by  all

the  commuters.  Whether that is fair, I think that there

will be people who feel otherwise.  But what we can do is

that we will encourage the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>



operators, as I think the Members do, and all  the  other

civic organisations as well.  And I think the level  that

they  have  reached today is a reasonable one.   Off-peak

traffic  is less any way and, as we all know,  seats  are

perishables.   So the cost of subsidy is very  much  less

during  off-peaks.   But to turn it into  a  peak  period

concession,  that  is  a completely different  kettle  of

fish.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Ngiam's concern is: are we, because of not

providing concessions during peak hours for the  elderly,

making it difficult for the elderly to get a job?   I  do

not  think  so.   I  think the barriers  to  the  elderly

getting  a  job  are many.  I do not think  concessionary

fare  is  the  make or break barrier to their  employment

opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now talk about bicycle lanes, raised so

passionately  by Mr Ong and Ms Irene Ng.   Like  both  of

them,  I enjoy cycling too.  But we are practical people,

I  am  engineer-trained.  When we manage  mass  transport

policies  to move large number of commuters in  the  most

efficient way, we have to give priority, not to bicycles,

but  to MRT and buses.  LTA is involved in road reserves.

We  do not take charge of the whole Singapore island.  We

only  take charge of about 12% of Singapore island, which

is called road reserves, and those are our assets.  So we

have  to  manage  this 12% very carefully.   If  12%  can

become  40%, then, yes, we have many more road  space  to

give to some other users.  But when we are constrained by

this  12%,  we have to be careful.  Yes, in cities,  like

Beijing,  Hanoi, you will see on TV thousands of cyclists

and,  because  of  that, they set aside  special  bicycle

lanes.   That is because they are at a stage of  economic

development  where,  for the masses,  bicycles,  in  most

cases,  are  still the most affordable.  I do  not  think

Singapore  is  in that situation.  We have  already  gone

past that stage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at Beijing, which I visit quite

frequently, as the middle class expands and the  standard

of  living goes up, they are now rapidly putting in MRTs,

upgrading their buses and expanding their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>



roads.   It  is a matter of time when they will  also  be

taking  away  the  bicycle lanes.   So  this  progressive

switch  from  bicycles to buses and MRTs for the  masses,

you  can  see  it  all  over the  world  and  is  closely

correlated with GDP growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not discourage people from commuting by

cycling.   In fact, just this morning, when I  came  from

the  Ministry of Transport in Alexandra Road to here, not

a  long distance - because I remember this cut - I was on

the look-out for cyclists, and there were half a dozen of

them, some young, some old, and they were cycling on  the

roads,  not  on the pavements, in a very common  sensical

manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my message to cyclists is to continue to cycle.

Our  roads are safe relatively, but please exercise  some

common  sense.  Because if you are careful, look out  for

traffic,  do  not cycle in Orchard Road, but  most  other

roads,  I  think it is all right.  If you do not exercise

common  sense,  sometimes  you  get  into  trouble.    My

daughter  was cycling in the park the other day  and  she

also had an accident.  So I asked, "What happened?"   She

said,  "A friend called her on her mobile."  She  had  to

answer.   Of course, please have some common  sense.   My

message  to motorcyclists is the same too:  Live and  let

live.   This  is a lane that we all have to  share.   And

whenever  you see a cyclist or motorcyclist in  front  of

you, just slow down.  Better be slow than sorry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have covered all the cuts.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, can I seek your

permission for two clarifications?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> The Minister has not

answered my questions.  Who actually monitors the use and

proliferation of the ERP technology, not the issuance  of

the  cashcard?  And the second clarification is: can  the

Minister assure citizens that it will not happen, and not

to say that it is not likely to happen?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> The ERP technology is licensed by

LTA.  Therefore, we own the licence.  When the technology

is  expanded to include parking charges, they have become

our  licensees.  So through that system,  you  have  some

sort  of  control.  But cashcard, as I  explained  in  my

answer, is regulated by the Banking Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member talked about a new technology and whether

somebody  can  come around and swipe away cash  from  our

cashcards.   I  am  not aware of such technology.   So  I

cannot  talk  about whether somebody will come  out  with

such an idea; I do not think so.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang:</b> Clarification, Sir.

I  did  not say it is a make or break factor.  But it  is

one  of a number of factors that will help in the overall

decision of the older persons seeking employment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> As I said just now, I am an

engineer.   So  when faced with a problem, I straightaway

zero  in  on what are the factors, rank them in  priority

and  attack  them.   We  will  try  to  tackle  the  most

important   barrier  first.   Yes,  there  are  countless

barriers  to  employment.  Right now, there  is  economic

recession, jobs are down anyway, and so on and so  forth.

So  there  are  many, many problems, especially  for  the

elderly getting a job.  I do not think fare concession is

such a big barrier that we have to put in our efforts  to

solve  it  and, with that, you can solve the unemployment

for the elderly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, we have been told that PSA

has   done   it  again.   It  increased  its  twenty-foot

equivalent units (TEUs) by, I think, about 7% or 9%  last

year, amidst all the hullabaloo about losing its top  two

customers.  We also read that PSA has been giving  severe

discounts to its customers and extra service during  this

period under review.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does all this show? It shows that sensitivity

to  customers  is very important in attracting  customers

and  sales  revenue.   If  we had  been  more  responsive

earlier, perhaps we would not have lost the top

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>



two  customers  which account for at  least  20%  of  the

business and so much of the downstream businesses in  the

economy.  How does the Minister ensure that the  port  is

responsive to industry-wide and global changes?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not talking about IT, or network, or good

management, etc.  Big time shipping companies and private

port  operators or terminal operators with sales  revenue

bigger  than  PSA  earned possibly in  a  more  difficult

environment  also have good IT systems, good network  and

good  management.  We are talking about listening to  the

voice  of  the  customers and repositioning ourselves  to

anchor  and  serve  our  customers  to  collaborate  with

partners   in   new  ventures  under  changing   industry

environment.   The  shipping  industry  and  the   global

manufacturers  are  moving towards  network  connections,

just-in-time  logistics to maximise  efficiency.   Supply

chain efficiency and just-in-time logistics can power the

port customers, shipping lines, the terminal operators to

be  partners.  And private port operators can also manage

a  network of ports and this can drive shipping lines  to

adjust routes and schedules for mutual gains.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not even IBM or Microsoft can control the forces

which  drive  industry-wide changes.  It is industry-wide

changes  which drive dinosaurs out of business when  they

react  too  slow.  IBM lost the key business  because  it

thought  the contractor Microsoft was offering  something

that would not be a challenge to it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Port management is also changing. For the past four

years,  I  have  been arguing in this Committee  for  the

privatisation of some of our port terminals.  The  answer

has always been that PSA is different, or we are doing  a

good  job, we are the transhipment port, and so on.  Last

year,  the  answer  was we would  consider  it.   Are  we

collaborating   with   industry  players   and   building

alliances  to avoid being muscled in, as the episodes  in

the last two years showed?  Are we a world-class industry

player or just a world-class transhipment centre?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, a

more competitive and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>



challenging  economic environment is  spurring  not  only

regional  countries to attack Singapore's maritime  turf,

but  also attracting international players to compete  in

our  regional  markets.  While it is heartening  to  note

that  our container throughput grew by almost 9% to about

17 million TEUs last year, in spite of having lost Maersk

and Evergreen, we can no longer take this year-after-year

number one position for granted.  It is apparent that our

surrounding neighbours are truly giving us a run for  the

money.    They   have  improved  their  port   operations

efficiency and are building new ports with the  state  of

the  art facilities and have openly stated that they want

not just a slice but a big chunk of our business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Chay has said earlier, our port must rise to

the   occasion  and  review  the  business  model   which

contributed  to our success in prior years  and  overhaul

this  to suit the current challenging business landscape.

We  must  craft the response and differentiate  ourselves

from  the  rest, not only to defend our leading position,

but  more  importantly,  to set ourselves  several  steps

ahead   of   the   competition  in  the  current   fierce

environment.  We cannot allow ourselves to be  locked  in

past thinking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest, Sir, that we critically re-examine our

strategies  and work towards positioning ourselves  as  a

flexible  multi-tasking  and multi-modal  excellence  hub

which  integrate sea, land and air transport.  We  should

continue to enhance our competitive advantages,  such  as

fully operationalising the cargo tracking technology that

we  have invested in which enables cargo arriving at  our

ports to bypass customs inspection and be transported  by

road to and flown expeditiously out of our airport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our commitment to implement the container security

initiatives  as  the  first in Asia,  which  include  the

deployment of state of the art X-ray machines at our port

terminals,  should also be fully taken advantage  of.   I

would  also like to suggest that we review and loosen  up

customs

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>



treatment  wherever feasible so that we  can  fully  take

advantage of the various free trade agreements  which  we

have  already signed with various countries and with many

more on its way.

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, last year, PSA

lost  two  of  its  major  customers  to  Malaysia.   But

according  to reports, in February this year,  our  total

container throughput has increased by 29%.  However,  out

of  this  29%, only 4% was derived locally while 25%  was

from  its operations at other ports, eg, those in  China.

If  this  is the trend, then the throughput of containers

in  Singapore will be moved overseas.  Would we then lose

our  ranking  as the second busiest port  in  the  world?

Would  this also result in a second round of retrenchment

in PSA?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, recently, the Malaysian government

announced  that it was going to remove the  causeway  and

replace it with a funny-looking bridge so that ships  can

pass through the Johor Straits.  I would like to ask  the

Minister,  under  such circumstances,  would  it  further

affect the development of our port and its performance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim:</b> Sir, the loss of two major

shipping  customers  had jolted the port.   Measures  and

initiatives taken in response had resulted in a  respite.

However,  the  threats  from  regional  ports  have   not

disappeared.   Their  aspirations to  supplant  us  would

inevitably  lead to renewed and re-intensified  bouts  of

competition  once  they have time  to  build  and  expand

capacities, and had adjusted and digested their new-found

business  volumes.  I would like to ask the Minister  for

the  initiatives that we have underway to ensure that  we

maintain  our  pre-eminent position, and to  prevent  the

onset of complacency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, in the face of competition from port

operators, they are in a position to offer package  rates

that  are applicable to a string of ports located astride

the global shipping routes.  What

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>



would  we do differently, now that competition  is  on  a

more  global  basis?  Our "little red dot"  may  have  to

consider linking up with other dots along the world trade

routes,  and offer a comprehensive package,  if  that  is

what   shipping   customers  now  view   as   competitive

advantage.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Sir, with the knowledge and

expertise that we have built up over several decades, and

having  proven  ourselves as a premier port  globally,  I

would like to suggest to the Minister for Transport  that

we  consider  marketing our port expertise  to  countries

which  are desirous of embarking on excellence  and  also

internationalising the port operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunities are clearly opening up in the emerging

wider  hinterland  of China, Indo-China  and  India.   In

order  not to over-stretch our resources, MPA could  also

consider  collaborating  with  private  organisations  to

license its intellectual property and capitalise  on  the

vast business opportunities in the overseas markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's context, we need to stay engaged with the

world  market  as  a  means to remain relevant  and  keep

ourselves constantly updated with new competencies, so as

to  stay competitive in a world-class league.  The global

arena  is also the test bed for our port institutions  to

evaluate its competencies in an international setting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the experience and capability acquired over

the  years  and  Singapore's strong standing  in  various

aspects   of   port   management  and  our   port-related

institutions,  such as the MPA and PSA,  I  am  sure  our

expertise  is highly valued and recognised by  foreigners

the  world over.  We should ride on this global wave  and

export  our  expertise as a further means of contributing

to our GDP.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim:</b> Sir, Singaporeans are justifiably

proud  of  the  pre-eminent  positions  occupied  by  our

airport and our seaports.  The reliability and efficiency

of   these  hubs  have  contributed  enormously  to   the

successful and huge strides our

trade  and  industry sectors have made to plug  into  the

world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the multiplier effects the air and sea

hubs   have  on  our  economy.   Needless  to  say,  many

enterprises  in  Singapore  continue  to  depend  on  the

continued  growth of these hubs for continued  existence.

Hence,  the  success  of the hubs  cannot  be  singularly

judged  within  the boundary fence of the  port,  or  the

confines of the airport.  A narrow measure of performance

would  fail  to recognise that the performance  of  these

hubs must be viewed in a much broader context.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister if the regulatory

oversight  of these key hubs and drivers of  our  economy

could  be  further augmented with performance  indicators

that  measure  the  impact on the enterprises  along  the

value chain downstream of the ports and the airport.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, I notice that nowadays fewer

cruise  ships call at the Singapore Cruise Centre at  the

World  Trade  Centre.  I was also told that Star  Cruise,

which  used to call twice weekly at the Singapore  Cruise

Centre,  has now reduced the number of calls and  is  now

using  Changi  Ferry Terminal, which  is  operated  by  a

Malaysian  company,  to  bring passengers  to  board  its

cruise  ships  anchored at Tanjung Langsat  in  Malaysian

waters.   It seems that by doing this, it is much cheaper

for  the cruise operator than berthing its ships  at  the

Singapore Cruise Centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have we priced ourselves out of this market? Is

this   a   case  where  a  Government-controlled   entity

mistakenly  thought  it had a captive  market  and  could

impose whatever fees and charges, and customers who  want

to use the Singapore port had no other choice?  This loss

of  the cruise business has severe implications for other

tourism-related  industries.  I would  like  to  ask  the

Minister  whether  there are any  plans  to  regain  this

market.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, let me take the cuts one by

one.   I will start off with the points made by Mr  Chay.

In some ways, Mr Wee Siew Kim also made similar points.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay asked how do we ensure that PSA remains

responsive to its customers, and he asked how do we  make

sure that we have a global network of ports that fits  in

with  the trend of shipping lines going more into  supply

chain  management, and how do we make sure that we remain

a world-class player.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how we make sure that the port is responsive to

customers  is  something  which  PSA  alone  has  to   be

responsible for, because PSA is a corporatised  body,  it

has  its  own  Board of Directors and its own management.

It has to set its own strategies and address the business

challenges as it sees fit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from the loss of the two shipping lines in

the  last two years, I think PSA has changed its mindset.

There  has  been a change in management and a significant

change  in  mindset.  As such, PSA has been reaching  out

very actively, especially over the last six months or so,

to  its key clientele, to see how best it can meet  their

needs.   I  understand that the discussions  include  the

possibility of dedicated terminals operated jointly  with

its  key  clientele.  So, PSA has been making  a  lot  of

efforts and we are seeing the results.  For example,  PSA

was actively engaged in negotiations with Hanjin Shipping

Line  of  Korea.   This was reported in the  press.   And

despite  a lot of competition from other ports,  PSA  has

managed  to enter into a long-term agreement with Hanjin.

Again, this shows that PSA has managed to be flexible and

to remain highly competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the network of ports, this is also what

PSA has been doing over the last six or seven years.   As

a  result, PSA today has an overseas network of 14  ports

in eight countries, and I understand that PSA is actively

striving to further enlarge this network of ports.   What

is  crucial is that it intends to build a global  network

of  ports  that are strategically located along  the  key

international shipping routes.  In this way, it can offer

basically a world-wide service to their partners, who are

sailing worldwide.  It will also allow

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>



PSA  to  link  all  the  ports  electronically  onto  one

platform.   If  it can do that, this will  save  its  key

shipping  clients the cumbersome administrative paperwork

and  allow  those companies to focus more  on  their  key

business  requirements,  ie,  managing  their  ships  and

supply chain management services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I think PSA is indeed rapidly restructuring and

transforming itself, and I am quite hopeful that it  will

be able to retain its position as a global player.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad said that the port must be able to

rise  to  the  occasion and must be  able  to  craft  its

responses to meet the competition effectively.  He  asked

that  we  position  ourselves to take  advantage  of  our

position as a hub, in terms of both air and sea hubs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is exactly what we are doing. We are now

exploiting the synergies that can be developed  from  the

multi-modal transport arrangements.  For example,  today,

cargo can be shipped from the region to either PSA or  to

Seletar and, from there, because we have a very good road

network, they can be trucked very quickly to the airport.

Again,  because of the tremendous connectivity at  Changi

Airport,  these  cargoes  can  leave  very  quickly   for

international  destinations.  So, today, we  see  flowers

and,  in fact, even tropical fish coming from the  region

being  exported  through Singapore.  We are  now  working

closely  with EDB and CAAS on how we can further  develop

these multi-modal shipping arrangements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area that we are looking at also is our

cruise  hub.  As Mr Ahmad Magad knows, we have  a  cruise

centre  which  is  quite active.  In  recent  years,  the

Singapore Cruise Centre has also benefited from the  fact

that we are an aviation hub.  So, now we see more of  the

cruise  lines running fly-cruise packages.  They  fly  in

passengers to Changi who stay maybe one or two days here,

and  then  they  leave  through  the  port  for  regional

cruises.  So this is another exciting idea which  we  are

looking  at, which is really a multi-modal transportation

package.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ahmad Magad also mentioned that he would

like  us to review our customs procedures so that we  can

better benefit from the FTAs that we are signing.  Indeed

we are doing so.  We are working closely with Customs and

the   relevant  agencies  to  ensure  that  our   customs

procedures  and our IT systems allow for the  smooth  and

convenient  movement of goods between Singapore  and  our

respective FTA partners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Ang Mong Seng expressed concerns that PSA's

growth appears to be more focused on their overseas ports

and, if that is the case, whether we will run the risk of

losing  our position as the No. 2 container port  in  the

world,  and  whether this would in turn lead to  a  fresh

round of retrenchments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think Mr Ang probably did not interpret the

figures  very  clearly.   Yes, PSA  has  grown,  both  in

Singapore and globally.  Yes, the global growth has  been

higher  in terms of percentage.  But that is because  the

global  throughput of containers is starting from a  very

low  base.  So, from a very low base, it is very easy  to

grow  by a high percentage.  For example, Guangzhou  port

grew by 40% last year, and that is because it started  as

a  very  small  port.  But in terms of  actual  container

growth,  it  is  really  not very big,  compared  to  the

container growth in PSA Port.  PSA Port last year grew by

8.8% to 17 million TEUs, ie, there was a growth of over a

million  TEUs in Singapore alone.  As I explained  to  Mr

Chay,  PSA has been more innovative and flexible in their

approach to customer service.  I am quite confident  that

PSA  in  Singapore will be able to hold its own and,  not

only that, continue to grow.  And if they can do that,  I

do  not  think we need to fear that there will be another

round of retrenchments.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang asked about the bridge that has been

announced  to replace the Causeway.  He asked  about  the

impact.  Sir, the bridge will allow only small barges  to

connect Pasir Gudang to Tanjung Pelapas.  This is because

of  the clearance required and the bridge will only be 25

metres

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>



high.  So  only small barges can sail under  the  bridge.

Even  then, it would take the barges slightly  longer  to

sail from Pasir Gudang to Tanjung Pelapas as compared  to

sailing from Pasir Gudang to PSA.  I think the impact  of

the  new  bridge on PSA is therefore not expected  to  be

serious at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad talked about leveraging on our port

expertise.  He asked that we consider marketing our  port

expertise abroad, especially to China and India,  and  he

asked for MPA to collaborate with other countries because

MPA  also  has  significant expertise.  Sir,  I  want  to

assure  Mr  Magad that that is exactly what PSA  and  MPA

have  been doing.  PSA has been actively expanding, as  I

have  mentioned just now, they are now in eight countries

with 14 port projects.  In fact, China is one of the  key

focal  points  of PSA's efforts.  In China now,  PSA  has

four  ports  in  Dalian, Fuzhou  and  Guangzhou.   And  I

understand  that PSA is actively looking  for  more  port

locations in China.  In India too, PSA has two ports and,

again, it is actively looking to collaborate on more port

projects in India.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPA too has been active internationally. It

provides training assistance to other port authorities in

port    management,   oil   spill   response   and    the

implementation of  IMO conventions.  This  last  part  is

quite   extensive  because  there  are  a  lot   of   IMO

conventions  and they are amended from time to  time.  So

there  is  a  lot of updating and training required.   We

play  a big part in providing this training, not just  to

Singaporeans  but  also  to  trainees  from  the  region,

including from Africa as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee Siew Kim asked about the multiplier impact of

our air and sea hubs.  He asked us whether we measure the

success  of  our  air  and  sea  hubs  in  terms  of  the

downstream multiplier impact, ie, do not focus  too  much

on  the  profits of just PSA and the airport but look  in

terms of how we grow the air and sea sectors, so that the

multiplier  impact  on the economy can  be  achieved.   I

think he is probably referring to the many SMEs that  are

involved in these two sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with Mr Wee that indeed the multiplier

impact is very important, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>



that  is  why we do focus a fair bit on our air  and  sea

hubs.   The air and sea sectors alone contribute to  5.6%

of  our whole economy. So the benefit is not just to  PSA

and  CAAS but, really, there is a huge impact on the rest

of  the  economy.   If you look in terms  of  the  entire

transport  sector,  which  includes  the  land,   storage

facilities,  etc,  it contributes  to  9%  of  our  total

economy.  This is one of the key pillars of our  economy.

Being  a  key local activity, SMEs do benefit a fair  bit

from these two sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are definitely committed to growing the two

hubs  and  not just looking at making sure that  PSA  and

CAAS  are able to generate reserves and surpluses.   That

means  we  are looking at how we increase the volumes  of

business at both the PSA and the airport.  On the port, I

have  already spoken quite a fair bit in reply to Mr Chay

and Mr Ang on what PSA is doing.  On the airport, I think

it  is important for me to point out one factor and, that

is,  Singapore is actually not a natural air hub.  We are

not  geographically located in the right  place  and  our

domestic market is really too small for us to be  an  air

hub.   But we have become an air hub. This is because  of

the  tremendous efforts that we have put in in the  past,

in   terms  of  growing  the  infrastructure  and  making

Singapore  into a business hub which then contributes  to

the development of the air hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But new technology and equipment will pose

significant challenges to us in the growing  of  the  air

hub.  For  example, the new long range planes will  allow

flights  between  Europe  and  Australia  to  take  place

without the need for an intermediate stop. At the moment,

we  are  a  very convenient intermediate stop.  With  the

long  range planes, they can actually over-fly Singapore.

So  how  do  we respond to this challenge?  I  think  the

answer  is  we have to be really nimble, alert  and  make

sure  that we continue to offer value-added services that

make  it  worth their while for the airlines to  stop  in

Singapore  and  for visitors who still want  to  come  to

Singapore, especially businessmen visitors.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things we are doing to develop the air

hub  is the development of the Airport Logistics Park  at

Changi,  or  ALPS.  This  is  located  strategically   in

Changi's  free trade zone and ALPS will then be  able  to

leverage  on the excellent connectivity and the  superior

handling  efficiency  of  Changi Airport.  The  logistics

companies  can enjoy very rapid turnaround  with  minimal

customs formalities.  The opening of ALPS will definitely

help  strengthen our position as a leading air  logistics

hub,  and  we will definitely look into working with  the

other agencies to see how we can further develop our  air

and sea hubs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min spoke about the cruise centre. He

stated  that  Star  Cruise has reduced  its  callings  at

Singapore and is instead ferrying passengers from  Changi

Ferry Terminal to Tanjung Langsat.  He asked whether this

is another example of how we have priced ourselves out of

the cruise market and asked how do we plan to regain this

market.   Sir,  the real picture is quite different  from

what  Mr Ong had painted.  First, let me assure the House

that  Star  Cruises is still operating from the Singapore

Cruise Centre.  It currently has three cruise ships  that

call  regularly  at our port - the Superstar  Virgo,  the

Megastar Aries and the Megastar Taurus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be useful for me to explain to Mr Ong some

of  the developments in our cruise industry.  In 2002, we

had 740 calls by cruise ships. This was a significant 40%

drop  compared to the year before.  So, in a way,  he  is

right  that  there  has  been a  decline  in  the  cruise

industry.  Was this due to competition from Malaysia  and

high PSA charges?  I think the answer is an emphatic  no.

The  drop  was  due  to  two  factors.   First,  we  must

understand that the cruise industry is a leisure industry

and the leisure industry is very, very much dependent  on

how strong economic growth is.  And the fact that we have

very  weak  local and regional economies means  that  the

clientele  for  the  cruise industry has  declined,  both

local  as well as foreign clientele.  Secondly,  we  also

had  the  heightened security concerns  amongst  holiday-makers after 911.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>



So  these two factors together resulted in the number  of

cruise  ship  calls  dropping  by  40%.   In  fact,   the

reduction in the calls by Star Cruises was only  30%.  So

the  other cruise lines suffered a bigger drop,  compared

to Star Cruises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the entire cruise industry worldwide is also

experiencing a slowdown.  According to the UK independent

research  company, Ocean Shipping Consultant, the  global

cruise  industry is expected to see continued weak market

conditions over the short to medium term.  It is expected

only  to  start  recovering in the second  half  of  this

decade.  So, basically, we are all in the same boat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong suggested that perhaps the high berthing

charges could be a possible factor. Again, let me  assure

him  that this is not so.  Our berthing rates for  cruise

ships  have remained unchanged.  Since 1991, we have  not

changed  the rates at all. This is because we  know  that

the  cruise business is very sensitive to cost,  and,  as

such,  MPA  regularly  reviews the  berthing  charges  to

ensure that we remain competitive.  The ship that Mr  Ong

referred  to  is actually the Superstar  Aries.   Let  me

explain  that this ship is normally home-based in  Taiwan

but  because this is the off-season in Taiwan, the owners

have  brought it back to this region.  They have  brought

it  back  for  only three months from January  to  March.

They  have  parked  it  at Tanjung  Langsat.   But  while

parking  there,  the ship still makes  destination  calls

from  Singapore. So it comes to Singapore and from  here,

it   goes  on  cruises  to  Malaysia,  Phuket  and  other

destinations.   It did 12 cruises from Singapore  in  the

past  two  months  and  for March, they  will  have  four

cruises.  So it is not that they are not using Singapore.

It  is  just  that this is a surplus ship, so  they  have

parked it in Tanjung Langsat presumably because it  is  a

lot cheaper to just park it there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have answered all the questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chay, are you withdrawing the

amendment?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> I thank the Minister and his

Senior Minister of State for their answers, and beg leave

to withdraw the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2). Dr Chong Weng

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head W of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code WA 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the impending move of the Traffic Police to

LTA,  I would like to raise this cut under this Ministry.

For  taxi drivers who have accumulated 24 demerit  points

within two years, especially for those with points  owing

to  the  fault  of their passengers, I appeal  that  they

should  be  given extra six points.  Perhaps,  these  six

points  may be for a period of just six months.  In  this

way,  taxi  drivers  will not be penalised  unduly,  just

because  of  the  non-cooperation  of  some  unreasonable

passengers.  Also, the time spent by a taxi driver on the

road  is  many  times  more as compared  to  the  others,

perhaps  we  should  consider  allowing  them  these  six

points, especially in these difficult times, as many taxi

drivers are also sole breadwinners of their families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister actually has already replied to my cut

on  the taxi disciplinary board and thus I would like  to

beg leave to withdraw this amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

although  we  understand that the purchase  and  sale  of

cars,  whether passenger cars or commercial cars,   is  a

transaction between the buyers and sellers, I  feel  that

there  should  be  proper regulation for  this  trade  to

ensure there is transparency in the transaction so as  to

protect  the  consumers, because every purchase  involves

tens  of  thousands of dollars, and these are hard-earned

money  of  our  citizens.  We should ask all  sellers  to

clearly spell out all the relevant  information regarding

the vehicle on sale, so

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>



that there will not be future conflicts and complaints.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years, among the complaints received

by CASE, some one-third of them relates to car purchases.

I  hope that the situation can be improved.  For example,

some  purchasers have complained that there were inherent

problems  with  the car the moment it  came  out  of  the

showroom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also quite a lot of complaints concerning

the   car  financing  plans.  Many  dealers  told   their

customers  that  they  would have  no  problem  obtaining

financing  from  the  finance  company,  and  coaxed  the

customer   to   pay   a   deposit   for   the   purchase.

Subsequently, they found that the finance company  turned

down  their  loan  application for some reason,  and  the

deposit was then forfeited.  I suspect some dealers  have

been  using  this trick to cheat the customers  of  their

deposit  which  could amount to a few  thousand  dollars.

There   should   be  more  transparency  in   all   these

transactions to protect the interest of the consumers.

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Dr Chong suggested that taxi

drivers  be subject to a higher demerit points  cap  than

other  motorists.  As he correctly pointed  out,  demerit

points are managed by the Traffic Police under the Driver

Improvement Points System (DIPS).  The purpose  of  DIPS,

as  we  know,  is  to  promote safe driving  and  to  get

dangerous  drivers  off  our road.   Demerit  points  are

levied  on all motorists who commit offences, eg, beating

the  red  light at junctions.  Increasing the cap,  I  am

afraid,  would send the wrong signal.  Yes, I agree  that

taxi  drivers  are  heavy road users, but  they  shoulder

heavier  responsibility too, as they have the passengers'

safety  in their hands.  We should, therefore,  expect  a

high,  not  lower, standard of safety from taxi  drivers.

More importantly, the law must be applied equally on  all

motorists.   To differentiate them for penalty  would  be

invidious and unconscionable.  But I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>



take Dr Chong's point that there could be occasions,  eg,

he   quoted  the  example  of  non-cooperation   by   the

passengers, which may lead to a penalty being imposed  on

the  taxi driver.  In those circumstances, they  need  to

look  into  it - in this case, by the Traffic  Police,  I

presume  - before they decide whether demerit points  are

to be imposed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Mr Yeo Guat Kwang's cut, he would like us to

consider regulating the motor dealers to cut out,  as  he

put  it, "unfair trading practices", so as to protect car

buyers.   Although  he talked about  motor  dealers,  his

comment   could   have  applied  to  any  other   trading

activities.  But regulating trading is really a very  big

step to take.  If we make more rules to regulate trading,

we  will  increase business costs, which would eventually

be  passed on to consumers and that is why the Government

has  always  resisted taking such a big  step.   But,  in

response  to  feedback from CASE and several  Members  of

this  House, MTI has been working with CASE on a consumer

protection Fair Trading Act.  I understand that under the

proposed  Act,  consumers  will  have  some  recourse  if

sellers,  and that would include car dealers,  engage  in

unfair  trade  practices.   However, as the intention  of

the  Act  is  to  protect small consumers  who  lack  the

resources  or expertise to protect themselves,  there  is

likely  to  be a cap on the amount that the consumer  can

claim.   But I agree with Mr Yeo that the industry should

promote greater transparency and self-regulate to cut out

unfair practices.  They should try to avoid the situation

whereby  the Government is forced to step in to  regulate

tightly.   The best way to prevent this is  for  them  to

maintain a high standard of practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA has been working with the Motor Traders

Association  and the Automobile Association of  Singapore

to  promote  transparency in the buying  and  selling  of

motor  vehicles.   LTA  is  also  working  with  CASE  to

encourage  more  motor traders to  join  the  CASE  Trust

Accreditation Scheme.  Dealers who have signed  onto  the

scheme  would  be  required to observe  a  code  of  good

practices.  Nevertheless, I will ask LTA to discuss  this

subject further

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>



with  CASE and the industry associations to see  if  more

needs to be done.

3100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the 1996 White Paper on A World Class Land

Transport   System  (page  42)  stated  that   LTA   will

consciously reduce the burden and anxiety of waiting  for

buses.   LTA  has embarked on a pilot project to  display

bus  arrival times at two selective bus-stops.  Over  the

next   two   years,  LTA  will  work  with  the  relevant

organisations to expand this project.  Today,  six  years

later,  commuters are still suffering from a bus  waiting

complex.   Then, recently, the newspapers  reported  that

just   months  before  the  project  was  to  have   been

completed,  LTA  is dropping the $40.3  million  plan  to

provide  commuters with bus arrival times  at  bus-stops,

interchanges  and the Internet.  This, according  to  the

report, is due to software and integration problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have the following questions: (1) How much

has LTA spent in developing the system so far?  (2)  What

is the software and integration problem?  (3)  Why is LTA

unable  to  resolve the integration problem and  did  LTA

foresee  the problem before calling for the tender?   (4)

What  is  specified in the tender in regard  to  software

development   and   integration?   (5)    What   is   the

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are living in an uncertain world. Events and

circumstances are shifting and changing fast.   Sir,  the

issue  I would like to raise with the Minister for  Trade

and  Industry  is what should be Singapore's  fundamental

economic policies in the light of a changing world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was barely 10 years ago that Japan was considered

the world's No. 1.  That book of the same name by Harvard

professor, Israel F Vogel, published in 1980, was  a  top

seller   then.    Japanese  companies  were   buying   up

everything  in sight, including top US golf  courses  and

the   Rockerfeller  Centre.   Today,   Japan   has   been

languishing  for over 10 years, laden with a mountain  of

domestic debts and a sickly economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearer home, and a more comparable example, is Hong

Kong.  They are now in deep trouble, it seems.  Hong Kong

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>



recently  announced  that they would  incur  deficits  of

HK$70  billion.   The official reserves  will  drop  from

HK$303  billion  to HK$185 billion, or  about  only  S$41

billion, by year 2005/2006.  Analysts have even predicted

that Hong Kong would die.  Hong Kong has touted itself as

the  gateway  to  China.  This strategy backfired.   Hong

Kong  becomes  increasingly  marginalised  as  MNCs  seek

direct entry into China with huge FDIs.  Hong Kong  faces

hollowing  out  of  its manufacturing industries  to  the

cheaper  Chinese cities nearby, such as Shenzhen,  Zhuhai

and Guangzhou.  Their services sector faces the threat of

Shanghai, which is fast eroding Hong Kong's position as a

major financial centre.  Shenzhen has a population  of  7

million  people and Shanghai has a population of over  14

million people, and still growing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how about Singapore? We are a small city with

only  4  million people.  Our domestic market  is  small.

Singapore   is   becoming   an   increasingly   high-cost

manufacturing centre.  We are lacking in sufficient  pool

of   people   with   gung-ho  and  enterprising   spirit.

Government is too dominant in the business sector.  Faced-off  against  the growing mega-cities like Shanghai,  how

can we handle such threats?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China and India are two potential growth areas. Are

we  doing  enough to plug into these two countries?   How

much  have we done to establish closer trading ties  with

these countries?  The Government has identified the  need

to focus on nurturing the twin engines of growth, namely,

manufacturing and services sectors.  I wish to remind the

Minister  not  to neglect other sectors as  well.   Every

amount  of  contribution helps, eg, the  smaller  sectors

like  tourism, retail and logistics are also good sectors

to earn foreign income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very fearful that a super-Asian nation

like  Japan and a dynamic and vibrant Asian economy  like

Hong  Kong have seen their fortunes turned for the worse,

literally overnight.  Even in the US,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>



President  Bush  has  announced  the  roll-out  of   US$3

trillion,  that means US$3,000 billion budget, with  long

term  tax  cuts to spur growth.  Therefore,  we  must  be

perpetually watchful over Singapore's long term survival.

Can  the Minister gaze into his crystal ball and tell  us

if  we  are doing right?  What can go wrong, and what  we

can do about them?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Ho Geok Choo is not here. Mr

Leong Horn Kee, please.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, on investment promotion, I

would  like  to ask the Minister what is the  outlook  of

investment promotion for Singapore in the next few years?

We have heard, over and over again, that China is said to

be  a huge suction for foreign direct investments (FDIs).

It  is estimated that 20% of all FDIs in emerging markets

around  the  world currently goes into China.   In  2002,

China  attracted  US$50 billion of  FDIs.   What  is  the

impact  of  the attraction of China in terms of  FDIs  on

Singapore?   How  much FDIs and what type  of  industries

have  we in Singapore to be able to attract so far?  What

are the new desirable industries that we wish to attract?

Is  the EDB facing increasing difficulty to attract  MNCs

to Singapore?  I would also like to ask the Minister what

is   the  estimated  new  employment  creation  from  the

investment  commitments we have received so  far.   These

new   jobs   would  help  to  alleviate  the   employment

situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister about the idea that

ASEAN  itself is a huge market of 500 million people  and

therefore  could be a good region to attract  MNCs.   How

can  we cooperate on this concept amongst ASEAN countries

so as to counter the attraction of China for FDIs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concept is to promote Singapore as an

alternative  location to China.  Many MNCs often  do  not

want  to put all their eggs in one basket, ie, to  invest

only  in  China.  Hence, many MNCs may want  to  have  an

alternative  production or operating headquarters  centre

outside  of  China.   Singapore can, indeed,  be  such  a

centre.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I raised the

issue of cost competitiveness many times before, and also

during the Budget debate a few days ago.  I feel that the

response so far does not give a comfort feeling  that  we

have  identified  the solutions of  all  the  factors  of

costs.   During  the Budget debate, of course,  I  got  a

straight  "No" answer from the Minister for Finance  with

respect  to  my  suggestion on differential  pricing  for

industrial  land. The Minister felt that we already  have

sufficient initiatives in place to address the  issue  of

high  cost  of  land.  The Minister also  said  that  the

Government will ensure sufficient and affordable land for

industrial  use,  and will always be  available  to  keep

Singapore  competitive  in  the  long  term.  During  the

debate, I also highlighted the issue of the image that we

have  created  outside Singapore, and I  brought  up  the

example of a project which would have been competitive in

Singapore, but the customers that I spoke to preferred to

do  it  in China or in countries like Philippines, simply

because they felt that Singapore could not do it.  And  I

felt that it is competitive because it was mainly capital

cost that was involved, and the labour content was really

very  small.  But the issue of land could then  become  a

significant factor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of image and perception that we have

given to others regarding our cost being high could be  a

big  issue  for  us.  And one lesson that I  have  learnt

throughout my working life is that the perception can  be

as  bad,  if not worse, than reality.  With this  as  the

backdrop,  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Minister  a  few

questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on industrial land, I believe that the

Minister  for  Finance really meant that  the  Government

will  continue to provide affordable industrial  land  to

JTC.  Can I ask the Minister what are the JTC initiatives

and  plans  to assure the affordability of factory  space

over the long term?  Also, whether JTC and its 100% owned

subsidiary, Ascendas, have indeed passed on  all  of  the

savings from property tax

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>



rebates  to  their tenants.  I have often heard  feedback

that Ascendas did not quite do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, what initiatives does the Minister have to

address  the  high  cost  image  and  to  eliminate   the

unhealthy perception problem that we are facing?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I also brought up the issue of many hidden

taxes,  Government charges and fees, and if they are  all

added  up will make our overall effective tax rate  looks

worse  than  many countries  -  taxes like property  tax,

petrol  tax,  COE, road tax and so on,  which  have  been

brought  up  by  many  Members.  Is  the  Minister  still

convinced that we are indeed cost competitive if  we  add

up all these factors of cost?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Wee Siew Kim, you can take your

two cuts together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim:</b> Sir, Singapore industries can look

forward  to  harnessing the cheaper factors of production

of  labour  and land on the islands of Bintan and  Batam.

On top of the proximity to Singapore, the two islands are

not unfamiliar to most Singaporeans, having become choice

holiday getaways.  Now that our Government has taken  the

initiative  to include the two islands in our FTAs,  this

augmentation  to  our industrial base would  continue  to

anchor  manufacturing as the key driver for our  economy.

However,   some  SMEs  that  had  studied   this   latest

development    cite    logistical   and    cross-boundary

administrative issues or transfer of goods and  materials

as   continuing   impediments  to  achieving   the   full

integrative  potential  of  Bintan  and  Batam   as   our

manufacturing hinterland.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for the expeditious

streamlining   of   procedures   with   the    Indonesian

authorities  to  facilitate the  movement  of  goods  and

services.   In  a  cut on the Ministry of Transport,  the

Minister  for Transport had assured that we are  tackling

the  customs procedures for importers and exporters,  but

this  is the Singapore side.  Let us extend these to  our

Indonesian friends as well.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the transfer of the security measures

and  precautions  and  knowledge  that  we  have  already

attained to the islands would give additional comfort  to

our   export  markets  that  our  extended  manufacturing

hinterland comes with the same assurance that  they  have

come to expect of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even as we expand our manufacturing hinterland,

it  is  our  goal to spur entrepreneurial development  in

Singapore.  Through innovations, we hope to generate  the

fuel   that  propels  our  manufacturing  base.   It   is

recognised that in prototyping new products, testing  new

products  and proofs of concepts, enhancements  to  bring

forth  new  versions  of  products,  require  a  base  of

supporting  industries.  These are the people  who,  with

engineering ingenuity and skilful hands, craft and  bring

to  life  the ideas.   These too are the same  supporting

industries that have cut their spurs being key  suppliers

to  the  MNCs  that have located their manufacturing  and

design  centres  here.  Hence, SMEs that are  engaged  in

these downstream activities may need to be identified and

given  special attention and incentives.  I ask that  the

Minister  consider that when we approach the twinning  of

topics  of  promoting entrepreneurship and manufacturing,

we  give  special attention to alleviating the challenges

facing the SMEs in our supporting industries.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, over the

years, we have had to reinvent ourselves in terms of  our

offerings to tourists to Singapore.  Where we were once a

shopping haven for luxury products, we now often hear the

refrain  that we are expensive, or that our products  are

tired.   Even when visitors ask their Singaporean friends

for  ideas on what to see or where to go, the suggestions

do  not come readily, except when it comes to food or the

usual  suspects   -   the  zoo, Sentosa.   This  is  well

manifested  in the challenge for us to push  the  average

length of stay beyond the 3.19 days and raise the tourist

expenditure above $758.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Tourism Board itself declares

that there is no such thing as a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>



typical  visitor, and that there is a huge  variation  in

needs.   At the same time, we have had to adapt to sudden

shocks,  such as the September 11 disaster which affected

long-haul  markets  and reshaped travel  patterns.   Yet,

when  we  plan, not surprisingly, we consider the  longer

term  effects.   In  this regard, I  note  that  the  new

initiatives proposed by the STB represent an intention to

shift  the  emphasis  beyond  volumes,  such  as  tourist

arrivals or top line numbers, as I would refer to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I note that there is still a tendency to

focus  on  make-overs and single products on  a  discrete

attraction basis.  The same appears to be true,  ie,  the

lack  of  a  holistic approach to accommodation capacity,

such  as  the seemingly ad hoc proposal to offer HDB-type

experiences.   What is yet more worrying is our  tendency

to  look after only the hardware aspects, rather than the

software  issues.   I do not know, for  example,  whether

Chinatown  is  a  case in point  -  huge fanfare  at  the

opening,  encouraging  start but, understandably  now,  a

pitiful stage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many visitors like to go where the locals go.

Many  would  love exploring the HDB commercial  areas  or

dining at the coffee shops, whilst enjoying the MRT  trip

along  the  way.   Stand-alone tourist  attractions  have

their  place in the overall scheme of things,  but  where

there is little association with the Singaporean identity

or  lifestyle, they lose their shine rather quickly.   We

have enough failures like Haw Par Villa to learn from.  I

therefore   like  to  ask  the  Minister  the   following

questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, have we explored sufficiently the natural

charm and heritage of Singapore when developing ideas for

both tourists and Singaporeans?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, how do we translate the new initiatives

into  economic  reality,  so  that  it  will  not  be   a

superficial make-over exercise, and how will progress  be

tracked and assessed?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, what structural changes are needed within

the hospitality sector, eg,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>



in  the  projections  for the different  class  of  hotel

capacity?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, I would like to

raise  an issue with regard to Malaysian Airlines  having

China  girls as stewardesses to boost tourist  visits  to

Malaysia.  According to the Oana-Xinhua report, MAS plans

to employ some 100 China cabin crew this year.  The tell-tale  sign  is not about the cabin crew, but  rather  the

increasing attraction of Malaysia as a favourite  tourism

destination   for  Chinese  travellers.   It   has   been

forecasted that MAS' sales volume for 2003 is expected to

double  that  of  next year.  It has been  reported  that

during  the Chinese New Year holidays in early  February,

sales  increased by 60% compared to that of the  previous

year.   Sir,  surely we can add value to  Malaysia's  new

found  strategy  of attracting China tourists.   How  can

Singapore  attract  this group from China?   How  can  we

ensure  that  this group will not bypass  Singapore?   Is

there any arrangement with the Malaysian Tourism Board to

package a bi-neighbour attraction package perhaps,  which

destinations  could include both Malaysia and  Singapore.

Will  Singapore  take the initiative  to  offer  a  joint

programme  which  can work both ways in  this  particular

area,  since tourist arrivals from China are growing?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst offering Singapore's hotspots, we can also

offer   to  market  Malaysia's  hotspots  through  direct

tourists to Singapore.   This way, we will work towards a

mutually  beneficial arrangement.  How  many  other  such

arrangements are there today with Malaysia?  Is there any

special tourist attraction that we can offer?  For  sure,

we  are no shopping haven, neither do we have the wonders

of  the world.  Sure, we have Sentosa, the Esplanade  and

the  lights.   What more can we have that  will  offer  a

difference?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time that we started to look also at our

competitiveness at the tourist dollars and  our  standard

of   customer  service.   Chinese  tourist  arrivals   to

Malaysia  from  January to November 2002  numbered  about

517,000.  Projecting  from this  figure,  the  year  2002

figure  will be about 560,000.  The Singapore figure  for

Chinese tourists

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>



for  January to November 2002 numbered 611,000  visitors.

This  will  be projected to about 660,000 for  the  whole

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, Malaysia recorded a tourist revenue figure

of  RM24.2  billion, about S$11.1 billion, an average  of

RM$1,890  per  visitor.  If Malaysia  is  earning  S$11.1

billion  from  this  sector, it  can  illustrate  to  the

Malaysians that, mutually, we can grow the pie,  so  much

more  if  only we combine our efforts.  Perhaps Singapore

can  be  the coordinating hub to link Malaysia  with  the

other  regional islands in Indonesia for the tourists  to

visit.   Not  only  will  increased  tourism  boost   the

economy,  but  it will also help to create jobs  for  the

retrenched.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister enlighten the House as to whether

there   are    existing  programmes  with  the  Malaysian

counterpart?   If not, is there any intention  to  pursue

one?   Also,  are  we  embarking on  a  massive  customer

service  training for our service providers, in  view  of

the  increasing service excellence programmes  that  both

China and Malaysia are embarking on?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Miss Penny Low, you can take your two

cuts together.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, each year,

the  Singapore Tourism Board spends much effort and money

looking into ways to attract the big spending tourists to

Singapore.   Whilst it makes economic  sense  to  attract

high  tourist dollars, the diversity of Singapore can  be

appreciated  by tourists of all classes.  If efforts  are

made to attract all, I believe the numbers would all  add

up  to sustain Singapore as a top tourist destination  in

the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, I was delighted to read the Straits Times

article entitled "Welcome to Hotel HDB".  It is meant  to

be a sort of budget hotel, aimed at the China market.   I

applaud the move by the Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, there is another group of globetrotters, who

has  been  somewhat neglected and certainly deserves  our

attention.   They are the backpackers.  Perhaps  in  this

part

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>



of  the  world,  backpackers are perceived  to  be  "poor

travellers",   and  not  much value  add.   This  is  not

necessarily  true.   In fact, in Europe,  Australia,  New

Zealand  and other countries, backpacking and  caravaning

is  a  prized travel choice, and a way of life for  some.

Backpackers  in  good numbers can contribute  substantial

tourist dollars  and provide employment for many.  In all

major  cities  in the world  -  London, New York,  Paris,

you  name  it  -  there are niche markets which cater  to

these backpackers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backpackers have more to offer than just tourist

dollars.  Backpackers add to the vibrancy and dynamism of

cities  of  the world, adding colour and flavour  to  the

cities.    In   many   cities,   backpackers   contribute

significantly to the creativity and culture of the place,

as they bring along with them different world views and a

keenness  to  exchange  ideas at a  heartlander's  level.

Tourists are always attracted to places with all kinds of

tourists,  and  certainly this  is  not  a  group  to  be

neglected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While many backpackers may be fresh graduates out to

conquer the geographical world, many of them graduate  to

conquer  the  corporate  world subsequently.   Therefore,

giving  them a good impression of Singapore may  one  day

become a deciding factor in the relocation of themselves,

or their companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, there have been reports of lodges

that  provide  accommodation to these  backpackers  being

closed  down  due  to  their  inability  to  renew  their

licences.  The famous Peony Mansion, Lee's boarding house

and many other popular backpackers lodge are now history.

Many  of those around are also in a deplorable state  and

look  more  like crammed bunkers with dirty  toilets  and

very little sanitary attention.  I have spoken to some of

the  operators along Bencoolen Street, and they have told

me  that  the premises sit on gazetted land that  may  be

recalled  at  short notice.  As such, it  was  not  worth

investing in the place, even though there were profits to

be made from running it.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>



Some  of  the  operators' licences were subsequently  not

renewed,  as  it was said that they could  not  meet  the

standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I would like the Minister to comment on

whether  there  is  a policy to discourage  or  encourage

backpackers;  whether these owners or licensees  had,  in

fact, not met the standards set and hence unable to renew

their  licences.   If the latter is the case,  then  what

measure  is MTI taking to help the licensees upgrade  and

keep  their licence?  Will there  be efforts to grow this

market  and,  if so, what should we be expecting  in  the

near  future?   Last but not least, could the  Hotel  HDB

concept be expanded to become a backpackers Lodge HDB?

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next cut is on medical services hub. When I

first  heard of the call for Singapore to be  a  regional

medical  services hub, I had a feeling of deja vu.   This

call was first heard in the early 90s, which saw millions

of  dollars going into dressing up public hospitals,  and

words   like   "restructured",   "semi-privatised"    and

"privatised"  hospitals became fashionable.   This  year,

the  budget  of the Ministry for Health is up  by  33.9%,

much  of  which  will go into financing of  new  hospital

buildings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am hopeful that our efforts this time will

be  successful, I would like to seek assurance  from  the

Minister that our efforts and resources will not be spent

in  vain  this  time.   The fear is  that  while  we  are

building ourselves into a regional medical hub to attract

top-end  clients from the region, so are  our  neighbours

like  Malaysia, Thailand and, very likely, Shanghai.   In

fact, in 2001, Thailand's Bumrungrad Hospital saw 225,000

foreign  patients,  which  is  more  than  that  of   all

Singapore hospitals combined.  Cost was a critical factor

as  these  countries  are able to  provide  good  medical

services  at cheap rates.  Talent may be the  other,  but

talents  are  mobile.  Hence, could the Minister  comment

on:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Our competitive edge vis-a-vis our neighbours,

and the difference then and now?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What are the steps planned to build Singapore

into  a  medical hub for the region?  How do we  plan  to

counter this competition and stay ahead?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What steps have we taken so far to woo more

foreign patients to seek consultation in Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, will this emphasis on high-end service,

which means more expensive machines and facilities,  also

translate  into  locals having to pay higher  dollar  for

medical services rendered?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the experience during this downturn, should we

not  focus  on  basic medical so that  locals  can  enjoy

adequate  medical  services at reasonable  rates,  rather

than to up the ante for all concerned?  Would it also  be

better  for  Singapore  to concentrate  on  building  its

capability,  capacity and experience in coping  with  the

ageing population?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides attracting overseas patients, another

important  area where we can look at is the provision  of

an  educational centre or a learning centre  for  foreign

doctors,  medical workers and researchers.  We have  over

the years built a world-class infrastructure, systems and

best  practices.  Our physicians and doctors  are  highly

proficient.    In  fact,  we  have  some  of   the   best

practitioners here.  A good starting point  would  be  to

establish  a  world-class learning centre  that  attracts

doctors from the region to come here to gain insights  on

our  top-end practices, and have them develop and enhance

their expertise here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will boost our image as a first-class medical

hub  of  the region where not only patients come for  our

service, but also having a world leading learning  centre

for  the medical profession of the region.  Perhaps, with

the  recent  emphasis on education, bio-medical  research

and  life  sciences, plus a few medical breakthroughs  in

recent years, it will not be too farfetched to include in

our  vision,  to fashion Singapore into a hot  house  for

medical breakthroughs.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, every time I speak on

compiling macro statistics,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>



I remember my request to the Minister for the publication

of  gross  national product (GNP) statistics, in addition

to  gross  domestic product (GDP) figures  on  a  regular

basis.   He  has yet to do so, I believe.  But  my  point

goes  beyond  asking for GNP numbers to be published.   I

believe  that  the  Government can play  a  key  role  in

broadening  the  perspectives of all Singaporeans  beyond

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the right Government signals have significant

implications.  Why else are Singaporeans disinterested in

what  is going on outside of Singapore?  We speak of  GDP

growth  whenever we want to dwell on our  economic  well-being,  but  our domestic market should not be  our  sole

focus;   otherwise,  our  working  norms  revolve  around

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many Singaporeans' minds, working abroad is not

seen as an opportunity to widen the horizon but an option

for  those  who  cannot find jobs here in Singapore.   We

regard  postings  outside  of  Singapore  as  the   least

preferred   alternative  and  expect  to  be   adequately

compensated.   It  is  thus  not  surprising  that   many

Singapore   companies   expanding   overseas   frequently

experience difficulties recruiting Singaporeans for these

posts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just in today's Business Times, we read about this

same  difficulty  in getting Singaporeans  out  of  their

comfort zone.  Apart from not realising our potential  as

good  managers,  we  also  forgo  the  opportunities   of

learning  more  about  the global market  that  Singapore

operates in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a major economy that we all know of, many of

the  citizens have not travelled or worked outside of the

country,  and  have no particular motivation  to  do  so.

They  can probably afford to do so as their GDP  is  many

times   ours.    There   is  ample   industry   and   job

diversification  within  their  domestic  market  itself.

But,  Sir,  we  do not have this luxury.  We,  therefore,

need   to   go   beyond  visiting  other   countries   to

understanding the different economic and cultural norms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, apart from repeating my request to

the Minister for regular

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>



publication of GNP-type statistics, I would also like  to

request  for  indicators  and  messages  that  are   more

consistent  with  our  efforts  at  globalisation.    For

example,  it will be useful to know how far our companies

have  ventured, what businesses we have engaged  in,  and

what  business associations and networks are particularly

important.  This should not be one-off PR exercises but a

constant  feature.  Ideally, over time, our  geographical

borders  should  blur when Singaporeans  contemplate  the

economic participation.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, may I take this opportunity to

applaud  MTI's vision and hard work in securing the  many

FTAs,  industry and trade agreements.  However, the  real

work  begins when the deals are sealed.  By this, I  mean

that  the full benefits of FTAs and other agreements  can

only be reaped when our businessmen join MTI's bandwagon,

to  explore all possible business opportunities and  take

full  advantage of it.  I understand that  this  will  be

MTI's top agenda, but the process must be expedited so as

to   reap  the  first  mover's  advantage,  since   other

countries  are  also busy concluding similar  agreements.

Even   more   so   is   that   a  widespread   awareness,

understanding and eagerness to actively explore  business

opportunities will help give hope to our people, lift the

spirit and mood of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest some ideas to connect policymakers

with entrepreneurs of most, if not all, types and sizes:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) We could hold various seminars via the

associations,  and even at grassroots  level,  so  as  to

increase  reach  as  well as depth.  This  can  encourage

entrepreneurship from the very basic level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Organise more target-oriented publicity via the

mass media.  For example, country-specific opportunities,

industry-specific  opportunities,  and  highlight   those

which   enable   Singapore  to  have  a  comparative   or

competitive  advantage due to lower  or  no  trade  duty,

charges, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Organise more trade missions and exchange

programmes to include a wider group of entrepreneurs  and

participants.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Establish liaison office in Singapore and the

relevant countries (eg, via IE Singapore), with dedicated

staff to help answer queries, provide background research

and facilitate high level introductions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could MTI comment on when they will be rolling out

the various programmes and what more can be done?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a separate note, can MTI also comment on how the

FTAs  can  increase  the  efficiency  in  our  production

networks, especially in the context of our high value-add

manufacturing and services, and expand on the demands  of

our new twin engines of growth?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the EU-Singapore FTA, since the Minister

commented  that it is a very important one  to  Singapore

and it is a very difficult one to conclude at the moment,

what   is  the  Ministry  doing  to  overcome  the   EU's

reluctance or focus?  Does Singapore present itself as  a

strong business case for EU?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, how can various sectors of the

society,  ie,  parliamentarians,  business  leaders   and

others, help to cast Singapore in a favourable light,  so

that  we  can  be  in a better position to  conclude  the

various trade and business agreements with other nations?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Inderjit Singh, take both your

cuts together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, my topic is on China and

India.   We  all have heard many times in the  House  and

also  elsewhere the Minister sharing with  all  of  us  a

defined  strategy  for  China.   Some  examples   are   - investing   aggressively  in  China,  moving   low   cost

manufacturing  or  the  low value-added  activities  from

Singapore  to China, providing our services and expertise

to China, because that is what is probably lacking there,

training  of  our  scholars in China to  ensure  that  we

develop  a good network for the future, and also  working

on an ASEAN-China FTA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I have is: how confident is the

Minister  that  we  will  be  successful  in  our   China

strategy?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is on how China will respond to

us.   Are we a preferred partner or just another business

contact for China?  If we go with a mindset that we think

that China is going to respond to us favourably, compared

to  everyone  else, and if China does not feel  the  same

way,   then  we  may  have  difficulty  in  pushing   the

strategies that we want to push.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is on India. Do we have a defined

strategy,  just like what we have for China, to  tap  the

opportunities that are available there?  And, if so, what

is  that strategy?  One question that many have asked  me

is  whether  the  Government is serious  or  half-hearted

about going into India.  Another question I have is:  are

we  too  late entering into India?  Finally, how are  the

Indians  rating  Singapore as a partner?   And  are  they

willing  for  us  to be a preferred partner  to  tap  the

opportunities?   I  know  these questions  are  wide  and

varied,  but,  I think, if we understand  how  China  and

India  feel about us, it is going to be easier for us  to

execute our strategies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, moving on to the issue of world class companies

or    globalising    Singapore   companies,    I    agree

wholeheartedly with Mrs Lim Hwee Hua that it is important

that  we globalise our Singapore companies.  We also have

heard  from  many  local companies that when  we  started

talking  about the second wing for our economy,  many  of

them  did  regionalise.  But when the Asian crisis  came,

they  got  hurt, and therefore they have backed  off  and

pulled back on their efforts.  So we really need to think

of  new initiatives that can help us to more aggressively

globalise our companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all talk about the clustering of companies, big

and  small, going to the region.  Can I ask the  Minister

whether there is any progress in this area?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, many

businessmen  nowadays  bemoan the difficulties  of  doing

business  in Singapore.  These sentiments are the  result

of  not just the current economic downturn, but also  the

impact of global

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>



competition.  The fact of the matter is that our domestic

market is just too small - only 4 million people.  On top

of  this,  the  MNCs,  the  international  companies  and

businesses will come into our backyard and take away  our

domestic  customers.  Singapore companies must  therefore

globalise  or face the threat of survival.  How  can  the

Government,  as  the  leading member of  Singapore  Inc.,

help?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that IE Singapore should step up its effort

to    increase   Singapore's   share   in   the    global

conscientiousness for her products and services.  The ERC

recommendations   in  this  respect   should   be   fully

supported.  Our presence should be enhanced through  more

active  participation  in events  like  trade  shows  and

exhibitions.   At  such  shows,  for  example,  CeBit  or

Comdex,  it  is  not unusual to find entire  halls  fully

occupied  by Taiwan, represented by both large and  small

companies.   The  Korean presence is  also  very  strong.

Many more of our SMEs must be encouraged to take part  in

such  events.  Perhaps our Government agencies could help

to lower costs by buying space, hotel rooms, air tickets,

etc, in bulk and through grants and subsidies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, IE Singapore should also actively consider

setting  up  offices  in  more cities  to  look  for  new

business   opportunities  whenever  there  is  sufficient

interest.  These offices can act like representative  and

agent  offices to handle enquiries and channel them  back

to  the  appropriate companies in Singapore.   References

like  trade, product or company handbooks should be  made

freely  available in these cities.  More  remote  cities,

for example, those in China, India and even South America

and  Africa, could be explored.  They can be our business

scouts  and pioneers to open up new territories  for  our

enterprise.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If resources are a problem, our Majulah network

could   be   fully  exploited  to  obtain   support   for

information gathering, contacts, and assistance with  the

initial work that needs to be done when a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>



business  first starts up in a new city.  A  scheme  with

volunteer  businessmen  can be  instituted.   I  know  of

companies who are quite established in certain cities  in

China  where  IE  Singapore is  not  represented.   These

companies may be quite willing to assist IE Singapore  in

its efforts to help other Singapore companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I agree with the ERC when they pointed out

that  what Singapore needs are a few more global  brands.

Strong brands allow companies to enjoy high gross profits

and  continued  customer support.  We  are  already  very

successful  with SIA and Creative Technology.   Could  we

get  more?  How can the Government help?  Global branding

requires  global awareness, global presence,  and  global

recognition,  and  this is not easy to achieve.   Support

and  assistance from the Government can go  a  long  way.

Even  SIA  needs Government's help, in terms of  securing

air   services  agreements  from  other  countries.   The

Government    should    therefore   seriously    consider

identifying  a few Singapore products and  help  them  to

grow   both  locally  and  internationally.   Take,   for

example, Tiger Beer, our earlier policy on import of beer

has enabled it to grow strongly in Singapore.  How can we

now   help   it   to  grow  overseas?   Although   widely

acknowledged  as  one  of the best beer  by  expert  beer

drinkers,  its  brand presence in Europe and  America  is

still weak, if not non-existent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other recent examples with international aspirations

are  Tee  Yih Jia Food and even Super Coffee.   They  are

making increasing presence abroad.  Government and  GLCs,

such  as  SIA,  can  help  in promoting  their  products.

Perhaps,  we  can start by serving Tiger  Beer,  Tee  Yih

Jia's  roti  prata  and Super Coffee exclusively  at  our

Embassy  functions abroad.  Would the Minister look  into

these suggestions?

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, I would like to add on to the

points  made  by Dr John Chen regarding the  role  of  IE

Singapore  and  their officers.  There are some  overseas

centres and advisors in some 36 locations

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>



around  the  world.  Its role is to help Singapore  based

businesses enter foreign markets and thereby contributing

to the growth and internationalisation of local companies

into world-class enterprises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paramount for successful entry to a foreign market

is  the  intimate understanding of the country.   As  Sun

Tze's  Art of War states: 'Know thyself, know thy  enemy.

Hundred  battles  fought,  hundred  battles  won.'   This

knowledge  includes its culture, its social and political

structures,  its business and market structures,  and  so

on.  In order to give our entrepreneurs an insight and  a

headstart, qualitative briefing by the relevant  officers

of IE Singapore must extend beyond newspaper cuttings and

widely   available  published  articles.   In  fact,   IE

Singapore,   by  setting  up  offices  at   the   various

locations, has the economies of scale and is perhaps  the

best  agency to conduct such research and collate  first-hand  market intelligence that is crucial to the survival

of our entrepreneurs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback from business community has been that such

pertinent and relevant qualitative briefing had not  been

very  forthcoming.   Instead, the experiences  were  that

they  have  been merely given publicly available  reading

materials, directory listings of businesses or Government

contacts and not so useful information about the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot do the business for our

entrepreneurs,  but we can facilitate our  external  wing

with  qualitative  market intelligence to  enhance  their

presence  in  a  foreign land.  Can the  Ministry  please

comment  on  what  can an entrepreneur expect  when  they

approach  IE  Singapore?  And, two, how are IE  Singapore

officers   chosen,  meaning  those  who   are   stationed

overseas?  And what is their role?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to enhance our chances of success, our IE

officers  must have skill sets that will extract  maximum

information  from  the  respective  countries  they   are

operating in.  IE officers must do more than just  acting

as  a  facilitator or writer of research articles.   They

must be more proactive and business oriented, as my

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



colleague,  Dr John Chen, has uttered.  In fact,  our  IE

Singapore officers must also adopt, not just a high-tech,

but  also a high-touch approach.  I would like to propose

that  such  officers  be  recruited  from  a  variety  of

disciplines and have good grounding in sociology, or even

anthropology.  Frequently, knowing the business can  only

get one so far.  It is knowing the clients that makes all

the  difference.  Hence, the officers must be well versed

with  the  nuances  of the country,  the  key  individual

players,   the  economy,  government  red  tape,   common

mistakes  made  and how to avoid them.   In  short,   the

officers  must play the role of our intelligence officers

for our local businesses venturing overseas.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Sir, it is clear from the comments of many

MPs  that the economic uncertainty caused by the prospect

of  war  in Iraq weighs heavily on everyone.  Even  after

the  Iraqi crisis has been resolved, I do not think  that

the global uncertainty will completely clear.  The reason

is this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iraqi issue has been very divisive

internationally.  And it has caused probably  irreparable

damage to the western alliance and there are bound to  be

far-reaching  political and economic  implications,  long

after  the  war has ended.  Perhaps, this was waiting  to

happen.   The  western alliance was formed to  counter  a

common threat, that of the Soviet Union.  That threat has

now  disappeared, and we are beginning  now  to  see  the

crack   in   the  alliance.   And  Iraq   is   only   the

precipitating force to break up something which, perhaps,

eventually must come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this means is we are in for a more prolonged

period of uncertainty.  And the question before us is how

do  we  adjust  ourselves to a  new  situation.   In  the

meantime,  as  many  MPs have pointed  out,  we  see  the

emergence of China and India as global powers.  And there

is  also the new threat of Jihadi Global Terrorism.   And

underlying all this are powerful technological forces  at

work, undermining old structures, miniaturising the means

of destruction and changing the nature of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



life itself.  We cannot be sure what the world would look

like  10 years from now.  But one thing we know, and that

is, the past is no more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee asked if we have a good strategy

to   take   into  account  this  fast  changing  external

environment,  and this has been a concern of  many  other

MPs  as  well.   What is within Singapore, we  have  some

control over, including our overall business environment.

And  we must watch our cost, upgrade our skills, increase

our  productivity and develop local companies.   We  have

limited  influence over developments in the  region,  and

beyond the region, we are just price takers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERC Report, which has been debated in detail in

this  House,  addresses in detail  the  internal  factors

which  are  within  our control.  On the  issue  of  cost

competitiveness,  raised by Mr  Inderjit  Singh,  my  SMS

Tharman  will go into the questions he raised, in detail,

afterwards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On MTI today, several MPs, including Mr Leong Horn

Kee,  Mr  Inderjit Singh, Mr Wee, Mrs  Lim  and  Dr  Chen

raised questions about our external linkages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ERC Report, I would like to make one point,

which bears upon the questions raised by many of our MPs,

which  is  how do we stay competitive in the  new  world.

Many  investors and analysts study closely the ERC Report

and they know that, far from ducking difficult issues, we

tackle   them   head-on.   PERC   noted   carefully   the

seriousness  of  our  purpose.  And many  MNC  CEOs  told

Chairman, EDB, that it is a remarkable report, and a  few

went  so  far  as  to  say  that  they  wish  their   own

governments could do the same.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may argue sharply over issues, and we should, but

in the end, as a people, we are united and our collective

will  is  strong.  And this gives us a solid  reputation.

For   this   reason,   we  continue  to   attract   major

investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer Mr Leong Horn Kee's questions, EDB is

confident that it can attract

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>



$8  billion of manufacturing fixed asset investment  this

year  and  $1.9 billion of total business  spending.   In

fact,  we  have  been  attracting  the  lion's  share  of

investments  coming to Southeast Asia  in  the  last  few

years.  Our reputation is our greatest asset.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee, Mr Inderjit Singh and Miss Penny

Low asked questions about FTAs.  The aim of our  FTAs  is

to  strengthen  our  links to our key economic  partners,

especially the US, Japan and Europe, which are  our  main

sources of investment and technology, and also our  major

markets.   They  help our manufacturing  sector  to  stay

competitive  with  respect to China and other  countries.

For  example, our FTA with Japan makes it more attractive

for  petrochemical companies to invest in  Jurong  Island

because it can export many products tariff-free to Japan,

and  that  FTA, as Mr Lim Chin Beng noted yesterday,  has

already  increased the volume of trade  between  the  two

countries,  and  made Singapore an even  more  attractive

platform for the export of electronic products.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US-Singapore FTA, which will be signed in

Washington  in May, will save us hundreds of millions  of

dollars  a  year  in tariff savings.  And  we  are  still

working on FTA with the EU, as I elaborated in Parliament

last month.  And to answer Miss Penny Low, the EU takes a

position that there should be no new FTAs till after  the

Doha  round.   But I am still working on my good  friend,

Commissioner Pascal Lamy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Leong Horn Kee pointed out, we must ensure

that  our businesses benefit from the FTAs.  I agree with

Miss  Penny  Low  that Government officials  must  always

consult  the  private sector and make sure that  business

concerns  are adequately addressed during the process  of

negotiation.  MTI has been working with business  groups,

like   the  Singapore  Business  Federation,  to   gather

feedback on what our demands should be, and we explain to

our business community how their members can take full

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>



advantage  of  the FTAs that we have concluded.   In  the

coming  months,  the SBF will be organising,  with  MTI's

support,  a comprehensive outreach programme in different

languages,  consisting  of talks,  briefings  and  sector

specific workshops.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking to the future, to answer Mr Leong Horn Kee

and  Mr  Inderjit Singh, China and India will  become  as

important to us as the US, Japan and the EU are now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr John Chen also asked whether we are doing enough

in  the case of China.  We are strengthening our links to

both  countries  and steadily building  up  our  economic

portfolios  and networks and, one day, our  children  and

grandchildren  will  benefit  from  these  networks   and

investments, the way the Dutch, the Swiss and the British

continue  to  benefit  from the investments  which  their

forefathers made a long time ago in the US.  So this is a

mission  with  long-term implications  for  our  survival

chances for decades to come, and which is why we give  it

the highest importance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China is a big story and is already the most

important  destination  of  our  outward  investment   in

cumulative  terms,  overtaking Malaysia  six  years  ago.

Last year, our non-oil domestic exports to China grew  by

a  whopping  40%.   IE Singapore, EDB  and  STB  are  all

increasing their presence in China, and to facilitate the

sharing  of information among Singaporean businessmen,  a

point  raised  by many Members here, a Singapore  Chamber

was  established in Beijing last year and, in  Singapore,

Network   China  was  formed.   And  the  flow  will   be

increasingly two way.

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When China's Vice-President, Hu Xintao, visited

Singapore  in  April last year, he proposed that  Chinese

companies   partner   Singapore   companies   in    their

externalisation policy, what they call their zou  chu  qu

policy.  So, when I visited Hangzhou in August last year,

I proposed to the provincial government that they might

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>



want  to  consider  establishing  a  Zhejiang  Centre  in

Singapore,   because  Zhejiang  is  one   of   the   most

entrepreneurial   provinces   in   China,    particularly

businessmen  from  Shaoxing, Ningbo  and  Wenzhou.   They

followed  up  in  double quick time, and they  have  been

putting  the heat on us.  Just a few days ago, the  Vice-Governor was in town with a large business delegation  to

announce  the launch of this Centre.  We hope that  other

Chinese provinces will follow suit, because this is  good

for  us.   And,  as China invests in Southeast  Asia,  in

order to secure resources and markets, I believe many  of

them  will see Singapore as a natural base of operations,

including the listing of their companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true - what Mr Leong Horn Kee and other

Members have said - that China's competitiveness presents

a  big  challenge, particularly in some industry sectors.

But  China's prosperity would eventually bring prosperity

to  all  of  Southeast Asia, as was the case historically

during all the previous dynasties - the Tang, Song, Yuan,

Ming  and  Ching.   China has become a huge  importer  of

products  from  Southeast Asia, and Chinese  tourists  in

Southeast  Asia are increasing rapidly, as  Members  have

noted.   In Singapore, we expect one million arrivals  by

2005.   Our  children - provided there is  peace  -  will

inherit  an  Asia full of opportunities,  from  Northeast

Asia,   to  Southeast  Asia  and  to  India,  linked   by

expressways, by road, rail, air and sea links, and by the

Internet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong and Mr Inderjit Singh asked about our

strategy for India.  India is on the move, perhaps not as

fast  as China, but making steady progress year by  year.

In  the  last 10 years, India grew at an annual  compound

growth  rate  of 6%, which is very good, considering  the

fact  that, once upon a time, they talked in terms  of  a

Hindu  growth  rate  of 2, 3 or 4%.  Now,  they  blithely

target  7-8% to make a 'dent on poverty', to use a phrase

which   has   now   become  in  vogue   in   the   Indian

establishment.  We have been alive to these  developments

and,  in  fact,  from  the time   former  Prime  Minister

Narasimha Rao began his new policy of reform and  opening

up in 1981, we have positioned

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>



ourselves strategically as a long-term partner of India.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our links are developing nicely. IE Singapore and

STB  have  been increasing their presence in  India,  and

many  other  things  are being done.  Next  month,  Prime

Minister Goh will be visiting India, and we are likely to

launch   negotiations   for  a   Comprehensive   Economic

Cooperation  Agreement, which includes a FTA.   Even  two

years ago, the idea of an FTA with India would have  been

unthinkable.  But, today, we are going to negotiate  one.

India is increasingly looking eastwards, and increasingly

watching  what  China is doing.  As they look  eastwards,

they see Singapore as a natural facility and partner.   I

hope   that   the   Comprehensive  Economic   Cooperation

Agreement with India will make us an extension  of  India

into East and Southeast Asia.  It is good for them and it

is good for us.  EDB has been attracting Indian companies

to  Singapore.   Already, 17 out  of  the  20  Indian  IT

companies with export revenue operate in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With occasional tension between India and Pakistan,

Indian   IT  companies  need  disaster  recovery  centres

outside,   and  they  see  Singapore  as  being   ideally

positioned  for  that purpose.  Following Polaris,  iFlax

Solutions  and others, Satyam, one of the leading  Indian

software  companies, announced recently its  decision  to

establish  such a centre in Singapore.  In an  emergency,

hundreds  of  their professionals will fly to  Singapore.

Their  computer  systems will already be  operating,  and

they  will come in on pre-approved passes so that  we  do

not  waste  time  processing the applications.   And  EDB

believes  that more Indian software companies will  come.

The reason is simple.  Their customers - who are the MNCs

in  America, Europe and Japan - want assurances that even

if there is conflict between India and Pakistan, there is

an  alternative.   So, when these software  companies  go

overseas,  they say, "Look, this is what we  can  do  for

you, and our insurance is Singapore."  It burnishes their

product.   It  adds value to their product, and  it  adds

value to Singapore.  And this is only one way in which we

can help India in its development.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area which Indian Deputy Prime Minister

Advani  pushed very hard when he was in Singapore was  to

get  Singapore  to help develop tourism  in  India.   The

whole  of  India,  with  all its  mountains,  plains  and

historical  sites,  attracts  fewer  than  three  million

tourists a year!  So, there is huge potential.  There  is

a  lot of infrastructure which is required, but this is a

long-term  undertaking, which we intend to partner  India

in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As China and India recover their historical

positions  as major economies in the world,  we  have  to

integrate our economies in ASEAN so that we are not  left

behind.   Both today and yesterday, during the debate  on

MFA,  many Members are worried for ASEAN, whether we  are

moving fast enough and in a determined enough way.   But,

in  fact,  despite  the Asian financial  crisis  and  the

global  economic downturn, ASEAN has not done too  badly.

This  year,  ASEAN  is  likely to  make  major  moves  to

strengthen   the  organisation  and  to   ensure   better

implementation  of decisions taken.  Our  bilateral  FTAs

have  helped to catalyse trade liberalisation  in  ASEAN,

and  between ASEAN and other regions.  ASEAN is now being

courted  by  all the major powers, such as China,  Japan,

the  US, EU, Australia and New Zealand.  We are in a good

position.  We have no submarines, no ICBMs.  We  threaten

nobody.   We can be friends with everybody.   I  mean  no

nuclear  submarines.   We  have conventional  submarines.

And  this is the best position for ASEAN to be in,  in  a

multi-polar world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last November, in China, the leaders of ASEAN signed

a   framework  agreement  to  establish  an   FTA,   with

provisions for an early harvest.  This is an agreement of

historical importance which all of us should fully  grasp

because,  when we talk about our portfolio in  China  and

what  we hope to do in China in the future, this FTA will

change  the  entire landscape.  By the time it  is  fully

implemented  by 2010, it will create by far  the  largest

Free Trade Area in the world, of two billion people.  Our

businessmen,  scholars, tourists  and  students  will  be

travelling up and down

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>



from  Northeast  Asia down to Southeast  Asia.   It  will

transform  East  Asia  not  only  economically  but  also

politically and culturally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China is prepared, partly out of goodwill, to engage

the countries of ASEAN flexibly, to take into account the

fact that the 10 countries of ASEAN are at very different

stages  of  economic development, and it has indicated  a

willingness to have bilateral Free Trade Agreements  with

member  countries within an overall ASEAN framework.   We

will certainly consider this for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economic links to Indonesia are growing again

after the Asian financial crisis.  Last year, we were the

No.  1  investor in Indonesia.  Others watch  our  moves,

because  they know that we watch Indonesia very  closely,

and they take note of our guarded confidence in the long-term  economic prospects of Indonesia.  Mr Wee  Siew  Kim

emphasised  the  importance  of  seamless  links  between

Batam,  Bintan  and  Singapore.  In  fact,  I  have  been

working  very closely with Indonesian Minister  Ibu  Rini

Suwandi on the various administrative aspects on customs,

trade  facilitation  and so on, and  we  have  made  good

progress.   Yes, there are still problems, but  they  are

being solved one by one, and more Singapore companies are

investing  in  the Riaus.  Some of our SMEs have  shifted

operations there to take advantage of much lower land and

labour  cost, which is a persistent problem that we  face

here.  For example, Nam Lee, a factory which Ibu Rini and

I  visited  just  a  couple of months  ago,  manufactures

wrought iron doors and gates for apartments in Singapore.

Since then, it has increased its capacity 50%, because it

has found Bintan to be very attractive and  makes it very

competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Integrated Sourcing Initiative under the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, which means that some

components  manufactured there will  count  as  being  of

Singapore  origin, will be of particular  helpfulness  to

the Riaus.  I encourage our SMEs to look at possibilities

in those

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>



islands,  because it can help them to reduce  their  land

and labour cost dramatically.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nine provinces of Sumatra are also keen to have

closer direct economic links with Singapore.  Subject  to

Jakarta's  approval, the Governors  have  invited  me  to

bring  a delegation of officials and business leaders  to

meet  them informally in Padang in a few months' time  to

discuss how we can work more closely together.  There  is

a  natural  synergy  between the two sides  which  should

benefit  us.   To  help  our businessmen  to  operate  in

Indonesia, IE Singapore will be establishing, in the near

future, Network Indonesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo spoke about our relations with

Malaysia, particularly in tourism cooperation.   We  have

been having hiccups in our relations with Malaysia.   But

despite  these  hiccups,  our economic  relations  remain

strong, and I work closely with Minister Rafidah on ASEAN

matters  and,  when there are practical problems  between

the  two  sides, we solve them.  Of course, it  would  be

much  better, and certainly much more reassuring for  our

businessmen,  if  the  political relationship  were  also

better.   We  do promote joint tourism, and  the  tourism

boards do work closely together.  But, unfortunately, the

efforts  are sometimes negated by Malaysian media reports

which, from time to time, make it seem as if we are about

to go to war.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Thailand - and I should mention Thailand also

because  it  is  a core country in ASEAN -  our  economic

links  have been raised to a new level by Prime  Minister

Thaksin  and Prime Minister Goh, and we are now exploring

new areas of cooperation with the establishment of an air

hub  at  Chiangmai,  the import of Thai  foodstuffs,  the

integration of our auto-industry sectors, and the  mutual

recognition of standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An integrated ASEAN can be a major manufacturing

base  in the world for a whole range of goods, and be  an

alternative manufacturing base to China for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>



Japanese,  American and European companies, and  this  is

how we should position ourselves, because no one wants to

put all his eggs in the same basket.  Many CEOs have told

us that Singapore, in alliance with our ASEAN neighbours,

can  match China in many areas of manufacturing.  The CEO

of  Agilent  Technologies, Ned Barnholdt,  said  recently

that  he expects Asia, especially Singapore and Penang  - he  has over 3,000 workers in Singapore and over 6,000 in

Penang  -  to  increase  its share  of  Agilent's  global

production from about 30% to 40% in two years.  So, he is

placing his bets on Southeast Asia.  Just a few days ago,

Pasquale  Pistorio, CEO of ST Microelectronics, announced

plans to invest an additional US$250 million in Singapore

to  expand  its wafer fab capacity, fully confident  that

from  here he can compete with China.  Of course, we  can

only  maintain the share of manufacturing in our  economy

if  we  keep  on upgrading and improving our  system  and

efficiency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten years ago, MTI expected that the disc drive

industry in Singapore would be hollowed out, and  we  are

still expecting that 10 years from now.  But what is  the

situation  today?  The situation today is that  we  still

produce  about one-third - sometimes higher and sometimes

lower  -  of total global production of hard disc drives,

albeit with a smaller workforce.  How?  By going for high-end  products  and  by  being highly  automated  for  the

cheaper  lines.   So, when Seagate shut down  its  Penang

factory two to three years ago, some bits went to  China,

the high-end bits were re-consolidated in Singapore.   We

must  keep  pushing this, and we have every intention  to

maintain manufacturing as a pillar in our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDB, IE Singapore and SPRING will continue to

promote  the cluster approach, and this is one  important

way  to  address  Mr Wee Siew Kim's point  about  helping

smaller companies in the supporting industries.   We  are

helping  local  companies  to  form  clusters.   I   know

sometimes they wish that the Government can give  them  a

leg-up  by favouring them in tenders.  We cannot do  this

because  it  is  against  the WTO Government  Procurement

Agreement.  In any case, it is not a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>



good  principle because, if you are protected,  you  will

never be globally competitive.  But we do help them  form

clusters, giving them advice, sometimes providing grants,

and  helping  them  to compete in international  tenders.

This  is  the  best  way to help our SMEs  in  supporting

industries.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New sectors, like the biomedical sector, would also

help  us.   Last  year, the sector was a star  performer,

with  manufacturing output rising nearly 50%,  to  almost

$10  billion.  The sector now accounts for about  18%  of

the  total manufacturing sector, in terms of value-added,

which is not bad at all. The jobs created are high value,

well-paying  jobs and the total number of jobs  increased

by  about 11% last year.  The biomedical sector will also

boost  the  standard  of  healthcare  in  Singapore   and

establish  Singapore as a premier medical  hub  within  a

seven-hour flying radius.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low asked how our healthcare industry

compares to Thailand and Malaysia.  Our costs are  higher

but  we  are  at the high end of the market  because  our

standards are higher.  But we must watch our costs and we

must make sure that we stay competitive, if necessary, by

bringing  in more foreign doctors, nurses and technicians

to  supplement  our own limited supplies.   The  ERC  has

identified this area as a promising area of growth.  Will

it  cause local healthcare cost to go up?  Well, we  have

got  to  watch for side effects. The Health  Ministry  is

concerned  about this. We have got to make sure  that  in

promoting  healthcare services, we do  not  inadvertently

cause unnecessary hardship to Singaporeans.  But the fact

that  we  are  an international medical hub will  benefit

Singaporeans.   It  is  like Mayo Clinic  in   Rochester,

which is a small town up, far away, in the middle of  the

prairies.   The people of Rochester enjoy a  standard  of

healthcare  unimaginable  in  any  prairie  town.    Why?

Because  Mayo  Clinic is there.  And why is  Mayo  Clinic

there?  Not because of the patients that they can find in

Rochester  but  because  they  are  a  worldwide  medical

centre.  In the same

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>



way,   there   is  no  necessary  contradiction   between

Singapore  as  an  international  healthcare  centre  and

Singapore   providing   cost-effective   healthcare   for

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also not neglect traditional sectors like

tourism,  logistics  and retail, as  Mr  Leong  Horn  Kee

reminded us.  Mrs Lim Hwee Hua spoke about tourism in the

hospitality sector. With the rapid growth in  the  middle

classes  in Asia, especially in China and India, this  is

an industry with a lot of potential.  Look at Bali.  Ever

since  the  December 12th bombings, it is  now  targeting

Asian tourists.  Yes, they spend less, but one day,  they

will  be  spending more.  Throughout the Asian  financial

crisis and the global economic downturn, tourist arrivals

from  India  and China grew double digits.  Recently,  in

the  last  few months, we noticed a sudden surge  in  the

arrivals  from Japan.  When we analysed the  numbers,  we

found  out that more Japanese retirees and more  Japanese

students   have  been  travelling  to  Singapore.    Why?

Because we are seen to be a safer destination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, even though we lack natural wonders - anyway we

are  a  small city-state - there are many things we  have

which  commend  ourselves to people  from  all  over  the

world.   Of  course, we should think of new products,  we

should  burnish  existing  products.   In  the  case   of

Sentosa,  there  is  a  quiet  revolution  going  on   to

completely transform the island.  Many things are not yet

visible,  but  within 2-3 years, you  will  find  a  very

different  Sentosa.  There was a time when  we  had  gate

hours at Sentosa because it was inconvenient for visitors

there  to  stay  on  after 10 pm. Now, we  are  marketing

Sentosa  as a 7/24 destination for both Singaporeans  and

foreigners.  Recently, a Hong Kong company, run by Victor

Cha,  put in millions of dollars to upgrade a really top-class  restaurant in the Beaufort and to open a new  spa,

the first spa in a tropical setting in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to seize these new opportunities, we have

recently reorganised STB to transform it from being  only

a tourism promotion agency into an economic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>



development  agency.  Our indicators  will  be   economic

indicators and not just tourism arrival numbers.  Tourism

still  accounts  for about 10% of our economy  and  total

employment.   STB has a joint venture with  a  number  of

hotel   groups   to  establish  an  international   hotel

management school.  And as part of the effort to  enhance

our tourism products and infrastructure, STB will set  up

a  $100  million  tourism investment fund  for  strategic

projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua is right that we should cater to

different  segments to make sure that  there  are  enough

rooms  allocated  for  the  different  segments.   It  is

impossible to predict these numbers accurately,  so  what

we have done is to allow the market to operate by letting

off  more  and  more white sites. So we  let  the  market

adjust to what the real demands are.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low wanted to know our attitude towards

backpackers.   Well, many of us were backpackers  in  our

youth  and  we should encourage our ITE, polytechnic  and

university graduates to backpack when they graduate,  the

way  New  Zealander  youths and Israeli  youths  backpack

after  they graduate, sometimes for months, in  order  to

see  the world and understand the world before they  come

back  to  work and set up a family.  It is  good  for  us

because it broadens our mentality.  We know that when  we

traipse  in  various continents, we form  our  views  and

these  attitudes last for a long time.  So, in  the  same

way,  we should welcome backpackers into our midst, treat

them  well.   I will ask STB to look into the details  of

whether  the licensees have been properly regulated.   If

we want to provide good standards, we should not have sub-standard accommodation.  If we need to have youth hostels

and  if  we  need to convert HDB blocks, we will  do  so.

Even though the numbers are not big, it adds something to

the local economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs asked how Singapore can maintain its global

competitiveness when our costs are sometimes higher.  Let

me   mention   two  important  factors.    One   is   our

intellectual  property  (IP)  infrastructure.   We  offer

strong protection of IP,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>



especially  patents,  copyrights  and  trademarks.    And

Singapore  will  become  a centre  for  the  trading  and

management  of  IP  in  the region.   Recently,  a  major

pharmaceutical company told EDB that it is expanding  its

operations  in Singapore and scaling down its  operations

in   other   locations  because  of  our  protection   of

intellectual property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I visited Olivia Lum at her factory a few

months ago, she explained to me the elaborate precautions

she  takes to ensure that her most important intellectual

properties  (IP)  are in Singapore,  and  not  elsewhere,

because  elsewhere, they may be stolen.  This  is  a  key

advantage  that  we  have, and is an  advantage  that  we

inherited from the institutions bequeathed to us  by  the

British  -  legal  standards,  accounting  standards,   a

judicial system that enforces contracts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look into the future, a lot of the value of

assets  in the world will not be in the physical reality,

but  will  be  in  the coding and in  the  ideas.  Today,

between  ASEAN  and the US, 1%, by weight  of  the  total

trade is carried by aeroplanes. But that 1% makes up  60%

of the value of the trade.  In other words, by sea, it is

40%.   More  and  more in the future, the global  economy

will  weigh less and less.  For America now, hundreds  of

billions  of  dollars are carried electronically  and  in

human brains, and this is our future too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For both manufacturing and services to become more

innovation- and knowledge-driven, we must make sure  that

ideas   and   IPs  are  protected  and  that  there   are

opportunities  for  these  ideas  and  properties  to  be

commercialised in Singapore.  Our comprehensive  approach

to  IP protection is thus a major strength.  If we do all

that  we have set out to do under the ERC, we will be  an

entrepot  for  ideas and intellectual  properties.   This

will   generate  good  jobs  for  Singaporeans  and   add

substantial value to our economy.  We must make sure that

we  educate our young in the schools about the importance

of   intellectual  property,  to  safeguard  intellectual

property, not to resort to piracy, and the attitudes that

we  have  towards  physical property,  we  must  transfer

towards intellectual property.  Yes, it may cost them a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>



bit more money to buy the original software and DVDs, but

it makes a big difference to the future of our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our cosmopolitan culture is also another crucial

competitive  advantage and which will set us  apart  from

other cities in Asia.  Without so many foreigners helping

us, many of them helping us because they like us, we will

not have the economy that we have today.  What we want to

do, and this has a bearing on the concerns raised by many

MPs  about  the  mindsets  of Singaporeans,  is  we  want

Singapore  to be a home away from home for the  Japanese,

Americans,  Europeans, Chinese, Indians and  Australians.

So  when  they  come here, they find  a  people  who  are

welcoming,   welcoming   of  them   as   co-workers,   as

backpackers  and tourists and, maybe sometimes,  even  as

sons-in-law and daughters-in-law.  And because they  feel

welcomed here, they want to use Singapore as their hub of

operation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, Dr Tony Tan chaired EDB's International

Advisory  Panel and some members told him that  the  most

important  thing  that  we have done  was  to  build  the

Esplanade because it represents an icon of what we  stand

for.   We did not build the Esplanade just for ourselves.

We  built  it  as a regional facility and is a  statement

about what we consider to be important.  If we want to be

a  brain  centre, a centre for talent, then the Esplanade

expresses  in  a very attractive way what  our  attitudes

are.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few years, MTI reorganised every one of

its  statutory boards, including changing some  of  their

names   in   order   to  achieve  this  fundamental   re-orientation.  Where it is cost-effective, we will set  up

overseas  offices to help our businessmen  all  over  the

world.  I assure Miss Penny Low that we recruit officers,

not  only  for their IQ, but also for their  EQ  and  for

their culture and language skills.  I also assure Dr John

Chen  that our statutory boards know that a crucial  part

of   their   mission  is  to  help  Singapore   companies

globalise.  Of course, some of our officers are still

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>



young  and  lacking  in  experience,  but  they  are   an

enthusiastic bunch and they are learning fast.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua reminded me that I owed her an

answer  on  reporting of GNP. We do  report  GNP  numbers

annually.   We  have  considered  reporting   them   more

regularly,  say, at quarterly intervals, but this  cannot

be  done in a practical way because these GNP numbers are

not  as  easy to collect as GDP numbers.  And because  of

the  time  lag,  they  are not very accurate  quarter  by

quarter.   In order not to convey a wrong impression,  we

have  decided to confine the reporting of GNP numbers  on

an  annual  basis.  Just for the information of  Members,

the  statisticians now refer to it as GNI, and  not  GNP,

because  the  income  concept  captures  the  idea   more

accurately than the product concept.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee asked how Singapore would compare

with Shanghai and Hong Kong in the coming years.  As  all

of  us who visit Shanghai regularly would note, it is  on

its  way to becoming the greatest city in Asia, which was

its  position  before the Pacific War.  It  will  recover

that  position, and I have no doubts in my mind  that  it

will  become  the  New  York of  China,  because  of  the

eventual  size of the Chinese economy.  In  the  case  of

Hong Kong, if you read the speech by Chief Executive C  H

Tung  recently, he sees Hong Kong's future in  the  Pearl

River  Delta,  which already accounts  for  some  40%  of

China's  total  exports, and they talked about  a  bridge

linking Hong Kong to Zhuhai and Macau.  So I believe that

will be Hong Kong's position.  Yes, as Mr Leong Horn  Kee

told us, they face difficulties now, but the Hong Kongers

are  a  tough  people and, one way or another,  they  are

going   to   bounce  up  again  and  benefit   from   the

developments in China.

<br>2.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What of Singapore? I believe Singapore would become

the  London of Asia.  In other words, our hinterland will

be  a multi-national hinterland.  We serve a diversity of

cultures  and markets.  We will be a centre  for  talent,

for ideas, for IT

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>



management.   We  will  be  the  healthcare  centre   and

education  centre,  centre for  R&D,  a  centre  for  the

creative  services.  Low taxes, a facilitating regulatory

environment, use of the English language, a multi-lingual

facility,  and,  most importantly, citizens  who  operate

multi-channels  in their brains and in their  hearts,  so

that  anybody who comes here finds himself not  far  away

from home.  I believe if we put our minds and efforts  to

it,  this will be a position which is ours for the taking

in the coming years and decades - Singapore as the London

of  an  Asia, which for the next 20-30 years will be  the

most  dynamic region in the entire world.   Many  of  the

entrepreneurs in that Singapore will be Singaporeans, and

many  more  will  be  foreigners who  have  come  to  the

conclusion that we are the best place to be in in Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me clarify a story in yesterday's Straits Times

reporting  that Government contributed little or  nothing

to  the  initial success of local entrepreneurs like  Ron

Sim  and  Kenny Yap.  We have to be realistic.   EDB,  IE

Singapore  and  SPRING cannot be handing  out  taxpayers'

money freely to anyone who asks.  There are 100,000  SMEs

in Singapore.  So, even though we try very hard to reduce

the  number of forms, we will still need forms, and there

must  still be criteria.  Of course, we will try to  make

our  criteria as objective as possible and, where  it  is

possible, we will try to use a market test.  But, in  the

end   we  have  to  concentrate  our  efforts.   We  have

facilities  for companies in different stages  of  growth

and  I will be the first to admit that, in deciding which

companies  to  help,  we  do not  always  get  it  right.

Sometimes  we  get  it wrong.  But it is  right  that  we

should  help  Osim and Qian Hu when they  show  signs  of

taking  off.   For companies like Tee Yih Jia  and  Tiger

Beer,  they  have no difficulties getting help  from  our

economic agencies because they are well-known brands.  Of

course,  we want as many Singaporean brands as  possible,

and  where  we  can help companies achieve  international

branding, we do so.  But, you all know it is not easy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a comment that EDB favours MNCs. Let me

clarify this.  Although EDB

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>



does  encourage technology start-ups as part of T21,  EDB

has  to concentrate on the big accounts, because the  big

accounts   matter   a  lot  to  us.   Without   the   big

investments,  the  pharmaceutical  companies,  the  wafer

fabs,  the petrochemical complexes, we will have  a  much

poorer  economy, and there will be much less feeding  for

SMEs.   If  EDB had not worked its guts out to  bring  in

Texas  Instruments, Matsushita, HP, many  years  ago,  we

would  not have today's economy, and we will not be  here

today to talk about our hopes for the future.  And it was

right that they had someone posted to Apple to make  sure

Apple was happy in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the public sector can do many things. But, in

the  end, what we do is what a gardener does.  We  water,

we  fertilise,  we  weed.  The key is  having  the  right

seeds.   If  we  have the right seeds,  local  seeds  and

imported  varieties,  beautiful  things  will   grow   in

Singapore and there will be a bountiful harvest  for  all

of  us.  But without good seeds, no amount of watering or

fertilising  will  help.  And,  in  that  sense,  we  are

reinventing  what  Raffles did  in  1819.   He  turned  a

fishing   village  into  a  bustling  entrepot  by   good

administration, protecting property, enforcing  contracts

and opening the doors to traders from all over the world.

And they came, and it grew and it grew.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will do the same for the digital economy, and

this will give every Singaporean his place in the sun and

hundreds of thousands outside will want to come  in.   We

are getting there, despite the current downturn.  EDB  is

succeeding in making Singapore a Global Entropolis.  Many

countries   have   already  established   centres   here,

including  Germany, Japan, China, India,  Australia,  New

Zealand,  Israel, Chile, Norway and Korea, and many  more

are  considering Singapore.  Their SMEs and start-ups are

here  to  exploit opportunities and to make  use  of  the

presence  of the 6,000 multi-nationals which are  already

here.   We  hope many of them will link up with  our  own

local SMEs and that creative sparks will fly and make the

whole sector much more diverse and interesting.  We have,

as  a  matter  of policy, decided that for  our  overseas

delegations,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>



we will bring foreign companies based in Singapore along,

so that when they are together with Singapore businessmen

in  the  coaches, in the hotels, they talk to each other,

exchange ideas and maybe things will happen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our objective in doing all these is not to depress

value  in Singapore, which is Mr Leong Horn Kee's  worry.

Our objective is to increase value so that our assets are

worth  more,  so  that just being a Singaporean  commands

each of us a premium in the global market place, and  all

this is because of what we are and what we stand for.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Inderjit Singh.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I have already raised the

points earlier.  So, I am going to skip this cut.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, many Members in this

House have been lamenting the high cost of doing business

in  Singapore during the Budget debate.  The  ERC  Report

also seems to suggest that our cost of doing business  is

high.  However, we have also heard contrary opinion  that

business cost is manageable.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the anecdotal evidence, have the various

Government  agencies gathered more facts and  information

regarding  this matter?  Have we conducted  an  objective

benchmarking  exercise  to  compare  the  cost  of  land,

utilities,   Government  fees,  etc,  against   competing

countries?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should conduct such exercises at regular

intervals, say, every three years, to check our  business

cost  structure.   The study should also  normalise  such

costs to take into account our higher productivity.   For

example,  we can check what and how much are the  various

cost  components to produce, say, one disk-drive  or  one

mobile  phone. If the land cost component  is  too  high,

then  we can take steps to reduce it.  Likewise,  if  the

utility costs are too high, we can also reduce them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On land and factory cost, the Government policy has

always  been  to charge local market price.  My  question

is:  as  the largest land and factory supplier, how  does

the  Government determine what the market price  is?  Not

long  ago,  a  company told me that  it  had  rejected  a

factory  offer  by  JTC because of its price  and  bought

another factory from the market several months later at a

substantially lower price.  In an economic downturn  such

as  the present one, there are JTC and HDB factories that

are empty.  How does the Government then determine market

rent  for  these and other factories that are unoccupied?

Is  downward  adjustment  of  market  rent  for  existing

lessees fast enough?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point to note is that JTC land is often

leased  with  strings attached.  These conditions  placed

upon  the lease, such as subjecting transfer of lease  to

JTC's  approval,  make  it  less  attractive  as  a  loan

collateral due to the inflexibility imposed.   This  adds

to the lessee's financing cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me also address one more point on

Government fees.  I understand that most fees are decided

based  on  a  cost  recovery basis.  DPM  has  said  that

otherwise,  the taxpayer will have to pay more  tax.   My

question  is: are the costs calculated based on the  most

efficient operations model?  How often does the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>



Government  review  the work involved  in  processing  an

application and ensure that it is the most efficient?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also add: do the calculations take into

account   the  additional  taxes  collected  when   these

approved businesses become successful in later years?   I

would like to suggest that the Government take a business

chance.  Show by example the meaning of entrepreneurship.

Lower these fees to encourage more business applications.

Set them at a level to discourage frivolous applications,

not  more than that.  My argument is that in a few years'

time,  the  Government will be more than compensated  for

its  own  entrepreneurial  spirit  of  lowering  fees  by

collecting  a  larger  tax revenue  from  the  additional

businesses that would be set up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, would the Minister respond to my views?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, since the 1997 financial

crisis, the immediate action of the Government was to cut

the  cost  of business.  The first to be cut was workers'

CPF  and wages.  The question mark hanging in my mind is:

who is the culprit for the high cost of business?  Is  it

Government charges or high wages of workers, or both?   I

look  to the ERC Report for guidance.  Chapter 2  of  the

Report on lower costs and staying competitive, which runs

to seven pages out of a total of 199 pages of the Report,

did  not provide any clue to my question.  Chapter  7  on

Wages   and   the   CPF,   under  the   sub-title   "Wage

Competitiveness",  it  is  stated  that  "our  wages  are

already  much  higher than many countries.  Nevertheless,

we  are  still  competitive because our  productivity  is

higher too, so adjusted for productivity our labour costs

are not excessive."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also read The IFER Report: Restructuring of

Singapore  Economy published by the Institute  of  Policy

Studies   (IPS).   After  making  some  comparisons,   it

concluded  that "labour costs in Singapore  are  not  too

high in relative terms."  So, I am puzzled.  Since labour

cost  does not seem to be a problem, then why is workers'

CPF not restored?  I hope the Minister can enlighten me.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the IFER Report also pointed out the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Government artificially jacks up land

prices resulting in high cost of business.  Examples  are

the   tender  system  and  reserve  price;  JTC's   lease

agreement for industrial land rental is subject to upward

revision   every  year;  Government  grants  to   foreign

investors  and concessionary rates given to  large  local

companies  help to support the demand for  factories  and

land at high prices and high rentals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The foreign worker levy does not serve the

objective of providing more jobs for Singaporeans who  do

not  want  to  take up the jobs anyway, but  resulted  in

higher cost for employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The policy goal of asset enhancement led to

higher labour cost and other distortions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Excessive charges of Government departments. It

gives  examples  like  the Maritime  and  Port  Authority

charges  $2,500 for a boat ride by a company's  staff  to

inspect  a minor oil spill incident.  URA charges  $1,200

per  application  submission.   And  the  Singapore  Land

Authority sells plans by sets instead of allowing  single

plans  to  be purchased.  Other examples are: PSA  making

more  money  per container than shipowners; and  a  prime

mover  costing $35,000 in Malaysia can cost  as  much  as

$120,000 in Singapore because of COE and ARF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think I have time to list out all that

is  in  the  report,  but I hope that the  Minister  will

respond  to  the  above and the analysis  of  the  report

which, among other issues and suggestions, also concluded

that  the  Government  should try to contain  Singapore's

costs, especially in relation to land, labour, regulation

and  transportation, where business  costs  are  inflated

unnecessarily  by  policies which are outdated  or  which

have unintended consequences.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Heng Chee How, you can take both

cuts together.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, a proper

understanding  of  factor  productivity  is  crucial   to

sustaining competitiveness and real wage growth.  Nominal

wages  in  a  country  like China  can  be  very  low  by

international comparison, and this has contributed to the

view that China is able to take away investments and jobs

from  other locations around the world, because of  their

low   cost   including  low  nominal  wages.   A   closer

examination will, however, reveal that it is not the  low

nominal  wages  alone that matter, but  the  unit  labour

cost, ie, labour productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If China's labour productivity, taking into account

its  wage  levels, places it increasingly ahead of  other

countries,   then  that  will  be  the  source   of   its

competitiveness.   So too for all other  countries.   Put

another way, countries with higher wage levels than those

of,  say,  China  must  fight  on  the  basis  of  higher

productivity and lower unit labour cost, rather than  try

to  compete  with  the likes of China  on  lower  nominal

wages.   And  unless  they do so, they  will  risk  being

overtaken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, prosperity, ultimately, is underpinned by

productivity. And unless Singapore's productivity matches

that  of developed nations and maintains a gap with those

of  developing countries, then we cannot sustain the high

standard  of  living.   The  importance  of  continuously

pushing  productivity  growth therefore  cannot  be  over

emphasised.   I  therefore urge MTI to continue  to  give

emphasis  to  this area of productivity   -   to  promote

productivity    and   implementation   of    productivity

enhancement amongst companies in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as to my other cut on industrial land policy, I

have  already spoken about it in the main debate.  So,  I

do not want to speak on it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right. Mr Ang Mong Seng.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, when we were

promoting  industrialisation  in  the  1970s,   the   JTC

succeeded in developing a very large  and typically Asian

industrial estate. It attracted not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>



only  foreign  investors but also local SMEs  to  set  up

factories there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the lease granted by JTC was for a

tenure  of  30  years  which  would  be  expiring   soon.

According  to  JTC's  policy,  if  the  lease  is  to  be

extended,  it would run for another period of  30  years,

which means the existing lessees would have to put  in  a

lot  of  capital investment to extend it.   In these  bad

times  and  the  prospects of the next  few  years  being

uncertain, the local SMEs operating in the JTC industrial

estate  are in a dilemma. To extend the lease means  that

they  will  have  to pour in lots of money  in  terms  of

capital  investment. Not to extend means they would  have

to  fold  up.  I  hope that the JTC would  exercise  some

flexibility in dealing with the matter. Must the lease be

necessarily  extended  by  another  30  years?   Can  the

Minister  not consider  giving them a shorter  lease  of,

say,  five  years,  without  any  commitment  of  further

investments, so that they will be able to tide  over  the

present  difficult time?  If JTC persists in its original

policy  of requiring fresh investment as a condition  for

the  mandatory 30 years' extension, then many of the SMEs

will  not  be  able  to  carry on  with  their  business.

Consequently,  a lot of employees will lose  their  jobs,

and  the  performance of the entire manufacturing  sector

will also be affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, according to the terms of the lease,

there  would  be a 5% increase in the rent  annually,  in

good  and bad times.  It will be increased automatically.

At  this difficult time, I think we should review whether

there should be this annual 5% rent increase.

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Sir, I speak in support

of  raising the service standards of the retail sector in

Singapore.   The  state of the retail industry  has  been

much   lamented  during  this  economic  downturn.    The

retailing industry is an important one for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retail sector contributed $5.2 billion to GDP in

the  fourth quarter of 2002, and employs close to  75,000

workers,  between 3-4% of our workforce.  Most  retailers

attribute the drop in consumer spending

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>



to  the  economic downturn.  This would  not  be  totally

untrue  seeing how Singaporeans have been cast under  the

gloom and doom of sustained economic hardship, structural

unemployment  and  the possibility of  war.   However,  I

propose that we take a closer look at the problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from the economic downturn that had

contributed  to lower consumer spending, I  believe  that

the  service standards in the retail industry are equally

to  blame.  As it stands, overall value added per  worker

in  the retail trade sector is about $30,000.  This is  a

third of the manufacturing sector.  A survey conducted by

SPRING   Singapore  has  revealed  that  60%  of  service

companies  do  not have clear work performance  standards

and  procedures  in place.  In fact, most companies  only

have  broad guidelines, resulting in different  standards

of service across the industry.  Retail workers are often

left  to  their own devices.  The situation is no  better

for retailers in the HDB heartlands.

I  commend  the Minister's decision to push  through  the

formation of the Retail Academy of Singapore.  I  believe

that  we  need to retrain our retail workers as  fast  as

possible.  We cannot afford to leave service standards as

they are.  Otherwise, consumers here will shop elsewhere,

like   Malaysia,  Thailand  and  other  popular   holiday

destinations.

<br>3.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore consumers are becoming increasingly

sophisticated.  They are becoming more and more demanding

and  discerning,  whether in terms of  service,  quality,

convenience and variety.  I myself have been astounded by

the  poor  service quality demonstrated  by  some  retail

workers  here.   There  is  very little  customer-centric

mentality  among  our sales people,  a  lack  of  product

knowledge  and a correspondingly poor service  level.   I

have  no  doubt that leaving things as they  are  in  the

retail  industry will mark the beginning of the  end  for

retailers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Retail Academy of Singapore will add

value  on  top of the national skills recognition  system

for the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>



retail  industry.   I hope that it will increase  service

standards and provide the blueprint for hands-on training

on   the  job.   Combined  with  the  various  assistance

schemes,  ranging  from the Retail  Essential  Assistance

Scheme  and  the Franchise 21 Assistance Scheme,  we  are

moving  in  the  right  direction to professionalise  and

revitalise the retail industry in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to emphasise, however, that no amount

of  training  would do when it comes to service,  if  the

service  provider has a bad service attitude.  A waitress

who scores five A1s in subjects of table setting, service

techniques,  order taking, familiarity of  the  menu  and

hygiene,  but  puts  on  a long face,  and  comes  across

grouchy  will do no service to the restaurant.  It  would

then  be ludicrous and, indeed, laughable to have offered

a  course titled "When to Smile" or a course titled  "How

to Seem Friendly" to address this deficiency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to relate ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You do not have much time to relate.

You only have got a few seconds more.

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong:</b> I will move forward. I look

towards Hong Kong and what our very own Singaporeans, who

have  visited and shopped in Hong Kong over the last  few

years,  have  to  say is testimony to the improvement  of

service  quality there.  Just as our Minister  for  Trade

and  Industry has mentioned, there must be a  fundamental

reorientation  in  the service attitudes  of  our  retail

workforce.  I hope the Retail Academy will fulfil this.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, in

Singapore,  consumers  are expected  to  exercise  caveat

emptor  when purchasing goods or procuring services.   As

such,  there  is  no  one  single all-embracing  Consumer

Protection  Act  in Singapore to protect  consumers  from

unfair   and   unscrupulous  practices   of   businesses.

However,  based  on the thousands of consumer  complaints

received by CASE, Singapore Tourism Board and the  media,

we  can  see  that we need a Consumer Protection  Act  to

protect some consumers in Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, three groups of consumers are vulnerable to

unfair  and unscrupulous business practices, namely,  the

elderly,  the  illiterate and young  children.   We  have

heard  of  many  hard selling door-to-door salesmen,  who

have  conned many elderly and housewives.  This is  still

prevalent  in Singapore today.  In fact, I have  received

feedback from my grassroots leaders that some people even

posed  as  "God  of Fortune" to do house-to-house  visits

during  Chinese  New Year to demand  ang  pows  from  our

residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to seek clarifications from the Ministry

concerning  the proposed Consumer Protection  Act.   One,

how can the Act protect the elderly, illiterate and young

consumers?   Two, how can the Act be enforced  without  a

Fair Trading Office?  And, three, will the Act cover  all

industries?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Sir, the introduction

of  the  Fair Trading Act is a major step for consumerism

in   Singapore.   Principally,  we  want   to   introduce

legislation  to  protect consumers,  but  without  adding

onerous burden to businesses and costs.  We are confident

that  we  can find a balance between consumer  protection

and business concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the proposed scope of legislation was

published,  CASE  has noticed a new tactic  by  timeshare

companies, for example, trying to beat the proposed  law.

I  hope to see the Act enacted as soon as possible as the

longer we wait the more of such cases we may see.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year, the MAS started industry

consultations on a proposed extension of the scope of the

Act  to  include  all financial services regulated.   The

consumers  welcome this move.  I would like to  know  the

Ministry's   assessment   on  how   soon   the   industry

consultations with the financial sector can be completed,

and  when  we  can  expect to see the  Fair  Trading  Act

becoming a reality in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to raise two related points on the

Fair Trading Act.  First, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>



$20,000 limit.  The proposed Fair Trading Act defines the

$20,000  limit  on the value of the goods  and  services.

CASE  has  studied  this  and feels  that  if  a  cap  is

necessary,  the  limit  should  be  on  the  compensatory

amount,  instead  of  on  the  value  of  the  goods  and

services.   Second, the infrastructure  support  for  the

Fair Trading Act.  We understand that there are those who

feel that there is a need to set up a Fair Trading Office

to  police  the Act.  While CASE agrees that  it  is  not

necessary at this stage to set up a Fair Trading  Office,

the   Ministry  should  give  the  assurance  that  basic

infrastructure  support will be  put  in  place  to  help

consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be, in the first instance, the contact

point of some sort, for example, a call centre that  will

filter  out complaints.  In Australia, the percentage  of

phone calls that are resolved without being turned into a

written  complaint  comes up to  about  95%.   After  the

written  complaint stage, some form of  conciliation  and

negotiation  should also be put in place.   Most  of  the

people  would  turn up for mediation.  In Australia,  the

rate of resolution at this stage is more than 50%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is necessary to have mediation centres and

call  centre as a contact point.  The percentage of cases

that  eventually  end up in the formal legal  process  is

therefore very small.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the basic infrastructure, another key

part  of  the  fair  trading  regime  is  education,  ie,

education for consumers and traders.  A website  is  also

essential for both information dissemination, as well  as

gathering of complaints.  I hope MTI will give support in

such  an educational drive initiated by CASE or any other

business  organisations.  Some form of  publicity  should

also  be  done to inform traders of unacceptable conduct.

Our  media can play an essential and significant role  as

such.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to go on to the next cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Review of the Hire Purchase Act.

Currently,   car  loan  providers  apply  a  mathematical

formula

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>



called  the  'Rule of 78' to most car loans.   While  the

name  seems  harmless, it actually hurts  car  buyers  by

penalising those who pay off their loans early.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hire Purchase Act covers car purchases where the

price  of a car is under $55,000, excluding the price  of

COE.  Under the Act, car financiers apply the Rule of  78

and  stack a disproportionate amount of interest into the

early  period  of the loan.  The situation is  even  more

onerous  for those cars priced above $55,000,  where  the

car  loans  are governed by common contractual  law.   If

they  pay  off their loans early, they get  back  only  a

proportion  of the interest rebate.  Indeed,  the  United

States  concluded that the rule was so  onerous  for  the

consumers that they have already outlawed using this rule

for  loans  which are longer than 61 months.  Britain  is

also reviewing the practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to do likewise here. At the

same  time, the Hire Purchase Act should be updated  with

the  amount  of  the car value which the Act  covers,  to

widen  the requirement for full rebate, or better  still,

make the Act to cover all car loans.  The US practice for

car  loans can also be studied and implemented here.   In

the  US, car loans are transparent because details of the

hire purchase agreements are readily available in all the

banks' websites.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, I like to echo the point that

my  colleague,  Mr  Yeo Guat Kwang,  has  brought  up  on

reviewing the Rule of 78 which is commonly applied to car

loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 22nd January 2003, MAS liberalised its 1995 car

loan guidelines to enable 100% financing for the purchase

of  a  car  and  repayments can be spread over  a  longer

period  of  time.  This created an euphoria  in  the  car

market, much to the delight of car dealers and financiers

alike.  Recent articles in the Straits Times confirmed my

suspicion  that  many car buyers are  not  aware  of  the

implications  of the 'Rule of 78'.  And I  like  to  take

this  opportunity to further expand on  the  workings  of

this rule, which Mr Yeo

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rule 78 applies the moment a borrower signs the

loan  agreement.  Be it a floating rate, or a fixed rate,

he  or she will be legally obliged to pay back all of the

principal and all of the interests that will accrue  over

the term of the loan.  If the borrower redeems his or her

loan before expiry, the lender would "generously" forgive

some of the future accruable interest payments.  This  is

despite  the  fact that, at the time of  redemption,  the

interest payable for the future has yet to be accrued.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Rule 78 has a pernicious effect on

borrowers  by  way  of  hidden prepayment  penalty.   The

borrower's  disadvantage is heightened by the  fact  that

the  banks  and  finance companies often  refer  to  this

practice or the application of Rule 78 as a rebate of the

finance charge.  To a layman, this can be misleading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, without getting too technical, early

redemption  of  a loan at different times  for  different

maturities  and  different interest  rates  will  produce

different penalty sizes.  The rule of thumb is  that  the

higher  the interest rate, the greater the penalty amount

and  the earlier the prepayment in relation to the  term,

the  greater the penalty amounts.  This is highly  unfair

to  the  customer  and encourages indebtedness  which  is

contrary towards what we want to advocate in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain states, as Mr Yeo has said, in the US and

Europe, have already outlawed the application of Rule  78

if  the loan is for more than five years, or for a  given

period  of  time.   Could  the Minister  comment  on  the

current practice and whether a review of this rule can be

expected, and whether the loan deal could be stated  more

clearly and fairly to the consumers?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, there are two pieces of

legislation  that CASE has been advocating.   First,  the

Fair  Trading  Act  to  protect consumers.   Second,  the

competition law to level the playing field for all.   The

Fair Trading Act is making good progress and if we should

see the law enacted this year, it is no surprise.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>



Competition  law is something that I hope to see  enacted

also.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition law will protect small firms from unfair

competition  by  big  firms.  It also  ensures  that  all

players  will have an equal and fair chance.  Competition

law  will also benefit consumers as well.  If the playing

field  is  level, companies will be free to  compete  and

innovate,  and  this  will  be  translated  into   better

products and higher quality of services for consumers.  I

hope  that  the  Minister can share his insights  on  the

competition law, and whether we can expect the law to  be

enacted in the near future.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, the Government is currently

drawing   up   the  legislation  for  a   framework   for

competition  in Singapore.  I have no quarrels  with  the

principle,  ie,  one  of ensuring  fair  play  and  equal

treatment.  However, I believe that we should be clear of

the  desired  outcomes about having such  a  legislation.

What  is  the goal?  Is the sustained competitiveness  of

Singapore the desired outcome?  Or is an ideal  state  of

competition per se the goal?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in pursuit of an ideal state of

competition,   what   are  the   costs   of   introducing

competition?   Sir,  let me cite  a  few  examples.   But

before  that,  allow  me to declare  my  interest  as  an

employee  of  Temasek Holdings which is involved  in  the

businesses  mentioned.  In mobile telephony,  how  do  we

decide that three operators would do just fine?  Why  not

two, or four?  Obviously, the size of our domestic market

and    the    sources   of   competition   are    crucial

considerations.  Too much zeal in introducing competition

or  insisting  on a certain level of domestic  originated

competition,  as opposed to ensuring fair  play,  can  be

value destroying of Singapore as an aggregate whole.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know for a fact that competition does not

originate  only  from  Singapore  sources  and  that  the

typical  definition  of monopoly, or oligopoly,  may  not

always hold.  At some point, we have to ask

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>



ourselves  if we are unwittingly disadvantaging  our  own

operators in the name of competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take another example. Competition in print

and  broadcast media.  Certainly, when one speaks to  the

consumers, the conclusion is that the variety  of  choice

is  welcome.  But I think the jury is still out in  terms

of  the cost of the introduction of competition.  In this

arena,  thousands of publications by non-domestic sources

distributed  through the various channels constitute  the

real  competition.   So  it  is  not  really  a  case  of

MediaCorp Singapore versus Singapore Press Holdings,  but

with  the  advent  of  the Internet  and  cable  TV,  the

competition   is  really  out  there,  not  just   within

Singapore.

<br>3.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lest I leave the impression that I am against

having  a  Competition Law, I must say  that  it  can  be

meaningful for businesses such as those dwelt on earlier,

eg,  bus services.  Competition must, therefore,  be  the

means  to  an  end,  ie,  sustained  competitiveness  for

Singapore, and not an end unto itself.  In this regard, I

would  like to ask the Minister to reiterate the  guiding

principles for drafting the competition law, and  how  he

proposes  to guard against any overkill situation,  which

would be manifested ultimately as cost for doing business

in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Sir, the

severity  of  the  economic crisis  is  mostly  felt  and

indicated  through the disconnection of utility supplies.

The  situation seems more acute lately, as we  have  seen

more  Singaporeans affected by it.  Certainly, there  are

those who are recalcitrant defaulters, but I am referring

to  the  genuine hardship cases who are often victims  of

their economic circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my understanding is that Singapore Power will

disconnect electricity supply first and, if no payment is

received,  water supply is disconnected,  often  about  a

week  later.  Depending on the size of the arrears,  they

will  then  require  a  substantial  amount  before   the

utilities are reconnected.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can anticipate the response from the Minister, ie,

these actions are necessary because, basically, Singapore

Power  is  not a welfare organisation. Sure, I understand

that.   It  is a profit-oriented organisation and  should

make  profits.   Indeed, it was reported that,  excluding

factors  like divestments, Singapore Power's  net  profit

for   2001   rose  15%.   While  it  is  not  a   welfare

organisation, I am sure it can afford to be a caring one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the disconnection of these supplies robs the

individuals and families of their dignity and self-worth,

as they are made to feel that they cannot afford even the

basic human needs, such as water.  I would like Singapore

Power to consider the following suggestions for a win-win

situation between them and the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, following the assessment and

recommendations  by the CDCs or family  service  centres,

allow  genuine hardship cases to defer payments to  their

arrears, akin to what HDB is doing with those who are not

able  to  pay  their monthly mortgage  loans.   They  can

resume  paying  their arrears by instalments  when  their

economic situation improves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, allow people to decide and prioritise what

they  want  to use.  Most people would choose water  over

electricity  in  terms  of  priority.   For  cases  where

electricity supplies have been disconnected, I  encourage

Singapore  Power to accept payments for  usage  of  water

only,   thus  preventing  the  water  supply  from  being

disconnected.  It will be more affordable and  manageable

for  them.   Their electricity supply can be  reconnected

when they feel that they can afford it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some have commented that these households need

to  be more responsible and discerning in their usage  of

utilities.   This is true, and we should encourage  users

to be more responsible.  In this regard, can we think out

of the box and consider different possibilities to ensure

that  people have greater responsibility to manage  their

lives?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to consider the

possibility of supplying utilities through a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>



stored-value system.  Stored-value system is  already  in

use  in  our  transportation system through  the  ez-link

cards  and  the  cashcards in paying  ERP  charges.   The

system I am proposing is for the users to store a certain

pre-paid value for both water and electricity.  The meter

will show how much supply they have used and how much  is

left  for them to use.  The user will then be responsible

in  deciding on cutting down on his usage, or topping  up

on  the stored value.  In this way, his dignity and self-worth  are  maintained, as he is given the responsibility

to  manage  his  own  life.  He  is  in  control  of  the

connection or disconnection actions.  For the low  income

and  hardship  families, it is a  way  of  teaching  them

skills in managing and budgeting their expenses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such a system is already in operation in some

parts  of  the  UK  and  the US.  I would  encourage  the

Ministry  to study these systems and implement them  here

to  overcome future problems of people not being able  to

pay  for  their utilities. Let us ensure that we continue

to  allow  our people to manage their lives with  dignity

and self-worth.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</b> Sir, several Members have

rightly  spoken about our cost competitiveness.  This  is

an important issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our objective, which all Members will agree on, must

be  to  sustain a high income economy.  We want a society

brimming  with  affluence and dynamism, leading  and  not

just following.  This must mean, as Mr Leong Horn Kee has

pointed out, that Singapore ultimately cannot compete  as

a low cost economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we must do, however, is to minimise costs where

they   are   artificially  propped  up  and   wring   out

inefficiencies  wherever we find them, in Government,  in

the  markets.   We  do  this  by  streamlining  services,

keeping   our   markets   open   and   introducing   more

competition,   wherever  feasible,  to   moderate   price

increases.   We must also work relentlessly  to  increase

productivity, keep upgrading the skills of the workforce,

and build deeper pools of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>



innovative expertise.  If we succeed in this, the outcome

will be higher incomes, higher wages, not lower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have referred to the image of

Singapore  as  "high cost" and, therefore, uncompetitive.

Is  this  image, or perception of an image, in sync  with

the  facts?   Each Member would, I am sure, have  at  the

back  of  his  mind, some real examples  of  firms,  even

industries,  that  are  no  longer  able  to  compete  in

Singapore.  There will be real examples.  But  the  facts

overall,  for the economy as a whole, provide a different

picture.   We are a competitive economy.  Our  wages  are

high  but,  on the whole, they are made up for by  higher

productivity.   In  BERI's  workforce  study  last  year,

Singapore  was ranked first internationally, in  Relative

Productivity.    This   refers  to  productivity-adjusted

wages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the board, our cost structures have in fact

adjusted downwards significantly in recent years.  Office

rentals have fallen by about 38% since 1996, and are  now

cheaper  than in most competing cities, including  cities

like  Seoul and Beijing, never mind cities like Hong Kong

and  Tokyo,  which  are  of course much  more  expensive.

Industrial  space is not cheaper than in  many  competing

Asian   locations,  but  the  gap  has   been   narrowed.

Industrial  land prices have dropped by about  45%  since

1996.   JTC  rentals are down to the levels of the  early

1990s.  Competition in the electricity market has brought

tariffs  down significantly, despite rising  oil  prices.

And  the  full  liberalisation of the  telecommunications

market has also brought charges down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh, Dr John Chen, Mr Low Thia Khiang

and  others  have referred to our many Government  taxes,

fees   and  charges,  and  asked  whether  we  are  still

competitive after adding all these up.  Let me first  say

that   the   total   Government  burden  on   businesses,

comprising   taxes,   both  direct  and   indirect,   and

Government  fees  and charges, is low -  certainly  lower

than  in most other countries.  It is two-thirds  of  the

total tax burden in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>



US,  taken as a percentage of GDP, for example.  And  the

US  is  regarded as an environment that is supportive  of

enterprise.  We have achieved this because we  have  kept

Government  spending low and kept Government smaller  and

more  efficient than most.  That is the only  sustainable

way  to  keep  Government-imposed  costs  down,  not   by

lowering  fees  and  charges  to  prevent  the  costs  of

services from being recovered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I agree with the several Members that we have to

keep reviewing Government services, keep looking for more

efficient ways of doing things so as to reduce costs, and

trim  charges  wherever it is possible  to  do  so  while

recovering  costs.   In  this spirit,  MTI  has  recently

completed  a  review  of TradeNet charges.   We  will  be

significantly   reducing  Government  permit   fees   for

applications   made  through  TradeNet,   from   $4   per

application  to $0.90, with effect from 1st  April  2003.

This  measure does not seem like a large one, but it will

alone save businesses more than $20 million annually.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In total, we are competitive. There are pockets of

inefficiency in the economy, areas where we  find  excess

overheads   or  redundant  procedures,  and   there   are

industries  where costs and wages are still  higher  than

what our capabilities can justify against the competition

in  China and elsewhere.  But there are many areas  where

we  retain an edge in productivity and capabilities,  and

offer  an  operating environment superior to  what  other

lower  cost economies can offer.  That is why we continue

to  attract  high  quality  investments,  OHQs,  and  new

financial  market  teams, even as we lose  some  existing

activities.   If we were not competitive, the  EDB  would

not  have  been  able  to attract  $8-9  billion  of  new

investments  each year in manufacturing alone.   So,  our

economy is going through a difficult period, with most of

the external engines of demand weak or sputtering, but we

have  not  become  uncompetitive and  we  are  not  being

hollowed out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang had asked why then did we cut the

CPF in 1998 and why have we deferred the restoration of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>



the   CPF   for  another  two  years.   We  have   stayed

competitive  precisely  by making  quick  adjustments  in

wages  during the downturn, and we will stay  competitive

by  taking the recommendations of the ERC to enhance  the

flexibility of our labour markets, stay flexible in wages

and  work  practices.  That is the way in which  we  stay

competitive.  During recessions and slow growth, as  what

we  have seen in the last few years, profits fall.   Even

productivity falls.  So, if wages do not fall, there is a

simple  result:  unemployment goes up.  By  making  quick

adjustments to the CPF and, therefore, to wages, we  have

avoided a much sharper increase in unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, restructuring our markets to inject more

competition  has been an effective strategy for  bringing

costs  down.   The telecoms and energy markets  are  good

examples of the dividends gained by consumers from market

liberalisation.   Energy,  especially,  is  an  important

component  of  costs.   By restructuring  the  market  to

inject  competition, and by competitive pressures leading

the  generation companies to switch to natural gas, which

is   more  efficient,  we  have  brought  tariffs   down.

Electricity  tariffs today are 8% lower than in  December

2001.  Tariffs would in fact have come down much further,

if  not  for the significant increase in oil prices  last

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits are even greater for the larger

consumers  of  electricity,  who  are  now  part  of  the

contestable  retail market, which the suppliers  can  bid

for.  These larger users have made additional savings  in

their electricity bills ranging from 2-7%, over and above

the  8% drop in tariffs enjoyed by the rest.  The EMA  is

now  working with industry players on the next  phase  of

retail   market   liberalisation.   From  224   customers

currently  in  the contestable retail market,  we  expect

another 5,000 customers to be contestable by around  June

2003, and another 5,000 by the end of this year.  By  the

end  of  the  year,  therefore, 75% of total  electricity

sales  of  annual  value worth about $3 billion  will  be

contestable.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr John Chen suggested that PowerGrid should

benchmark  its  grid charges internationally.   We  agree

with  him.   EMA  has recently completed  a  benchmarking

exercise  for  grid  charges.  While  PowerGrid  must  be

allowed  to earn sufficient returns to be able to finance

new  investments in the grid network, EMA  will  use  the

benchmarks as an indication of how much scope there is to

extract efficiencies out of PowerGrid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EMA's findings are that our grid charges for

households   compare  favourably  with  that   in   other

jurisdictions.  But there is scope to reduce charges  for

both  commercial  and industrial users.   PowerGrid  will

therefore reduce its grid charges by 8% on average,  with

effect  from 1st April 2003.  For industrial users,  grid

charges will be reduced by up to 14%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking forward, however, we must brace ourselves

for  higher electricity prices.  We do not know how  high

oil prices will go as the situation in Iraq plays out, or

how  long  oil  prices will remain high.  Consumers  must

conserve energy, and manage their energy bills prudently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, our utilities costs do not make us

uncompetitive.   Even the cost of water in  Singapore  is

still  comparable to other major cities,  and  less  than

half  the  cost  of  water in Frankfurt  and  Tokyo,  for

instance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have asked questions on industrial

land,  including Dr John Chen, Mr Inderjit Singh  and  Mr

Ang  Mong  Seng.  This is an important area  of  economic

policy.   We will ensure that our industrial land  market

is  competitive  and  responsive to changing  conditions.

First,  as Deputy Prime Minister Lee has explained during

the Budget debate, the Government will release sufficient

industrial land for sale under the Government Land  Sales

framework   to   achieve   sustainable,   internationally

competitive land prices.  There is sufficient  supply  of

industrial land to do this for a long time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to Mr Inderjit Singh, this is indeed

differential  pricing  at  work.   By  zoning  land   for

industrial  use, we allow the market for industrial  land

to settle at a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>



different  level from land for commercial  use.   Second,

JTC  pegs its rentals to the prevailing market rates, and

now  exercises considerable flexibility in the terms  and

conditions  of  its leases so as to be business-friendly.

Third, we intend to grow a stronger private sector in the

industrial  land  market  for  greater  competition   and

stability.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr John Chen and others have asked if industrial

land  prices really reflect the market.  JTC keeps  close

track  of  private  industrial  rental  rates,  and  does

quarterly  reviews  to  peg  its  own  rentals   to   the

prevailing  market  rates.   In  January  this  year,  it

reduced  rentals by a further 2-7%.  So, since the  Asian

financial crisis, JTC has reduced rentals by nearly  40%.

This shows that JTC is responsive to the market, and that

its  rentals are not sticky downwards.  In general, JTC's

rentals   are  comparable  to  the  private  sector   for

equivalent  facilities  and are  even  lower  in  several

cases.  However, JTC cannot simply slash prices to  clear

each  and every piece of vacant space, because this  will

lead  to  an  unstable market and shake  confidence.   No

responsible  developer will do so,  even  in  competitive

markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC's scheme for making annual rental adjustments

also  seeks  to reduce risks for the customer.   It  caps

increases and rental rates at 5.5% per year, when  market

rates  are  moving  up,  but allows  customers  to  fully

capture  the  benefit of any downward price movements  in

the   market.   Some  customers  on  older  schemes  have

different rental adjustment conditions, but all  of  them

have been offered the option of moving to this new market

adjustment scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of keeping posted rentals in line with the

market, JTC has been giving significant rental rebates to

customers, as Members know.  Mr Inderjit Singh has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>



also  asked if JTC and Ascendas have passed the  property

tax rebate onto their customers. The answer is yes.  With

the  recent  announcement to extend rental rebates  until

December 2003, the total value of the rebate package from

1998  to  2003  will amount to $1.1 billion.   More  than

7,000 companies are benefiting from these rebates.  These

rebates  are  helping  businesses to  tide  over  current

difficulties, but they cannot be permanent.  We  have  to

gradually move back towards market pricing over time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng asked whether JTC could be more

flexible  in  its  lease terms.   This  is  an  important

question   for  companies  in  this  uncertain   business

environment.   JTC  has indeed been  responsive.  It  has

broadened  the range of lease tenures that it  offers  to

investors.  In addition to its standard 30-year  and  60-year  leases, it now offers leases of 20 years  or  less.

Leases  of  12  years or more have, in fact,  been  quite

popular, and a lease of as short as 8 years has, in fact,

been granted.  Last year, JTC also enhanced its Temporary

Occupation  Licence scheme, which now allows  for  short-term  use of between one and three years, with an  option

for renewal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC has also changed its requirements, or as someone

just  put  it, "the strings attached" to its new  leases.

It  previously  imposed  a minimum  plant  and  machinery

investment as a condition for the lease to be awarded, so

as  to optimise land use.  Since last year, it has scaled

down  this  requirement so that companies  only  need  to

declare  the amount of investments they intend  to  make.

This  is  to  help JTC to make a decision  if  there  are

competing uses for a specific plot.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For existing leases, JTC has changed its lease

conditions to allow companies to extend their leases  for

up  to  10 years without having to comply with the  usual

terms,  in other words, without having to meet  the  need

for  fresh investments.  This scheme was introduced on  a

case-by-case basis last year.  From April this year,  the

scheme will be extended to all customers whose leases are

due  to  expire within the next three years.  This short-tenure

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>



renewal scheme will help companies to continue operating,

without  having  to  make large  new  expenditures  in  a

difficult business environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC's flexibility in renewing leases has helped many

companies.  Khong Guan Biscuits, a household name, is one

example.    Khong  Guan was keen to keep its  factory  in

Singapore  where it has been for over 20 years.   But  it

found  that  it was not viable to pump in new investments

in  the  Singapore  operations in  the  current  business

environment.     They    have   20    plants    operating

internationally, but they wanted to stay in Singapore for

reasons of history and sentiment.  JTC allowed Khong Guan

to renew its lease for another 10 years without having to

meet the usual renewal conditions.  We kept Khong Guan in

Singapore, and saved jobs for over 200 employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC has put in place other initiatives to help

companies  save  costs during these trying  times.  As  a

further measure, JTC will reduce its rental deposit  from

two months to one month for customers on GIRO with effect

from  1st April 2003.  This small step will free  up  $27

million for JTC's customers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the longer term, we have to add more depth and

breadth in the industrial land market, increase the  role

of  the  private  sector and inject greater  competition.

JTC  has  already reduced its presence in  the  high-rise

factory  market,  where  its  share  is  31%.   It   will

increasingly  let  the  private  sector  take  over   the

development  of  generic industrial facilities,  such  as

ready-built factories and business-park properties.   JTC

will instead focus on its developmental role, engaging in

new and higher risk projects where it is better placed in

the  private sector.  This includes projects with a  long

payback,  such as Jurong Island, or projects  which  push

the envelope, such as Biopolis in One-North.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC will engage and collaborate with the private

sector   to   develop  a  more  vibrant  and  competitive

industrial   land  market  that  responds   quickly   and

creatively to new business needs. One-North is  itself  a

good example.  JTC kick-started

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>



the project. Once the project began to draw interest from

prospective  customers,  other developers  developed  the

confidence to join in.  We expect the private  sector  to

develop up to 80% of One-North over the next 15-20 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, as the manufacturing sector moves up the

value  chain, our industrial facilities will increasingly

be  light and non-pollutive. There will be greater  scope

to  integrate industrial sites within our HDB  townships.

JTC  will  work  with  HDB  to redevelop  and  rejuvenate

industrial sites in HDB towns, starting with a couple  of

pilot sites. This will have two benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it will bring more employment to the doorstep

of  residents.  This will become more  important  as  the

population ages.  In the long-term, it will make it  more

convenient  for  our  older  workers  to  remain  in  the

workforce.  Second, the rejuvenation of these  industrial

estates  will help to support start-ups and viable  SMEs.

Having this broader range of work opportunities, and SMEs

humming away, will contribute to the vibrancy and  rhythm

of life in HDB towns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI agrees fully with Mr Heng Chee How and other

Members about the importance of productivity growth.   It

is  ultimately the only basis for sustaining  high  wages

and remaining attractive to investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve our GDP growth potential of 3-5% per

annum   over   the  next  10-15  years,  we   will   need

productivity  growth  of  2-3%  per  annum.   This  is  a

challenging  goal.  It exceeds what has been achieved  in

other  developed  countries, which are  generally  ranged

between 1-2%, or even the exceptional 2% rate achieved by

the United States during the economic boom of the 1990s.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we sustain productivity growth of 2-3%?

The  most  important factors will still be  our  economic

fundamentals.    This   means   ensuring   macro-economic

stability,  keeping  our economy  open  to  international

trade and investments, and removing artificial restraints

on competition.  It also means investing in our people

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>



to  build  human capital, at all levels of education  and

continuous    learning.    And   it   means   stimulating

entrepreneurship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These fundamentals are the best way of promoting

innovation  and  efficiency.  The  Government  will  also

continue  to support industries with specific  programmes

to  help  firms to move up the value chain.  Productivity

improvement  is about all firms, the new economy  or  the

old  economy, humble or established.  Let me give you two

examples  of  companies  from  the  HDB  heartland,  both

clients  of SPRING.  The first is Sincere Photo  Shop,  a

HDB   retailer  in  Tampines.   Sincere  makes   use   of

Fujifilm's Internet portal to allow its customers to send

over  digital  pictures  and  images  for  printing.  The

customers  can collect the processed pictures at  outlets

of  partner shops or have the photographs mailed to them.

The  portal  also enables customers to make payments  for

Sincere  Photo's  services via the handphone.   One  year

after  adopting these innovations, Sincere  Photo  Studio

had achieved more than 20% improvement in sales.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even something as simple as leveraging on an

established franchise can yield significant  gains.   Hui

Yi  Collection  & Colour Lab in Jurong  West  is  a  good

example.  Joining the Kodak Express franchise in November

2001  enabled Hui Yi to improve on its store  design  and

layout to improve its image.  Also, Hui Yi benefited from

a  transfer of management and retail expertise,  enabling

it  to improve on its customer service, product knowledge

and operational efficiency.  Since joining the franchise,

Hui Yi's sales have improved by 50%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Arthur Fong expressed his support for efforts to

develop the retail sector.  I agree with him and Mrs  Lim

Hwee  Hua  that we need to rejuvenate the retail  sector.

It  is not just a matter of numbers - how many people are

employed in the retail sector and how much it contributes

to  GDP.   A  competitive and lively landscape of  retail

players  is  integral to any vision  of  Singapore  as  a

leading cosmopolitan city.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manpower training is the key to jacking up

productivity  in  the  sector.   The  Retail  Academy  of

Singapore  (TRAS) will be the focus of this effort.  TRAS

is  driven  by the private sector, with the  support  and

encouragement  of  Government.  It is  aiming  high.   It

plans  to  train  and certify 23,000 workers  over  three

years.   It  will also attempt to place at least  50%  of

unemployed  trainees in retail jobs  upon  completion  of

their  training.   To help TRAS get off the  ground,  MTI

will  provide  a  dollar-for-dollar  matching  grant  for

contributions raised by the industry, subject to a cap of

$1  million.   TRAS  will also be  eligible  for  capital

expenditure  funding  under  MOM's  Manpower  Development

Assistance Scheme (MDAS).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Arthur Fong that it is ultimately

the  culture  of  service excellence  that  marks  out  a

competitive  retail sector.  It is what  gives  customers

good  memories. TianPo Jewellery is a good example  of  a

retailer that has taken customer service seriously.   All

its  staff undergo a rigorous training schedule, focusing

on  customer service and product knowledge.   In 1998, it

embarked  on  a Service Excellence Programme (which  uses

scripting  and  casting to achieve  service  excellence).

Since  2000,  TianPo has won an average of  15  Excellent

Service  Awards every year.  More importantly, its  sales

have more than doubled in three years, from $4 million to

$10 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, consumer protection. Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Yeo

Guat  Kwang  have  enquired about the  proposed  Consumer

Protection (Fair Trading) Act.  CASE and other members of

the public have told us that the $20,000 cap on the value

of  goods  and  services is too low.   Mr  Yeo  has  just

reiterated  this.  MTI has reviewed this  issue  and  has

decided to change the way the cap is defined.  It will be

a  $20,000 cap on the value of the claim instead  of  the

value of goods and services purchased.  The consumer  who

purchases  goods and services with a value of  more  than

$20,000 will thus be able to bring a claim under the Fair

Trading  Act if his claim is $20,000 or less.  This  will

take care of most of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>



complaints received by CASE, nearly all of which  have  a

claim value of less than $20,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked if the Fair Trading Office is needed to

enforce  the  Fair  Trading Act.  The  Fair  Trading  Act

adopts  a  different  approach from  a  number  of  other

jurisdictions.  The  difference  is  that  it  does   not

criminalise  unfair trade practices. There  is  hence  no

need  for  a  Fair  Trading Office to  enforce  the  Fair

Trading  Act in Singapore.  What the Act will  do  is  to

empower  consumers  to  obtain civil  remedy  themselves,

without   having  to  rely  on  Government's  protection.

Besides allowing for quick redress, this approach of self-reliance  will  encourage greater consumer responsibility

and proactivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo and Mr Yeo have drawn attention to the need

for  basic  infrastructure to be in place  for  the  Fair

Trading Act to work.  This is indeed crucial.  The  Small

Claims   Tribunal  provides  an  affordable  avenue   for

consumers  to  seek  redress. CASE has  had  a  mediation

service  in  place since June 1999, which  consumers  can

turn   to   before  taking  legal  action.   Some   trade

associations  have also expressed interest in  developing

alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.  MTI  welcomes

such  initiatives. We will work with them to set up  such

mechanisms, to help resolve complaints without  consumers

having to end up taking legal action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another key component is the education of traders

and  consumers. We are glad that CASE will play an active

role  to  support  the  Fair  Trading  Act  by  educating

consumers and helping consumers seek redress in court. As

highlighted by Dr Teo, vulnerable consumers, such as  the

elderly and the illiterate, will be especially in need of

help.   MTI  will give its full support to CASE  and  the

business associations in the educational drive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo has asked if the Fair Trading Act will cover

all  industries.   It is intended to be  generic  in  its

scope.   The original plan was to exclude only two  areas

from the Act, the purchase of residential property, which

is  already  covered by an extensive body of conveyancing

law, and financial

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>



investments.   However, during public  consultations,  we

received  feedback  that  the Act's  coverage  should  be

extended  to  financial investments.  MAS  has  therefore

conducted  a  follow-up  industry  consultation  on   the

possible  extension of this Fair Trading Act  to  include

financial investments.

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS' consultations ended early this month. MTI will

incorporate  possible amendments and table  the  Bill  in

Parliament within the next 4-5 months. Mr Yeo Guat  Kwang

and  Miss  Penny  Low spoke about the  Rule  of  78  that

applies  to  the early repayment of car  loans.   MTI  is

reviewing  the  Hire  Purchase  Act.   We  have  recently

commenced  a  review which will cover  various  elements,

including  the application of the Rule of 78.  In  making

any  revisions  to the Act, we will have  to  maintain  a

careful  balance.   We  will  want  to  make  sure   that

consumers  are not unfairly disadvantaged, but we  should

regulate  with a light touch so as to minimise compliance

cost of businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members, including Mr Leong Horn Kee, Mr Yeo

Guat  Kwang, Mr Inderjit Singh and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, have

spoken about the intended competition law.  Currently, we

have  a sectoral approach to competition law, with sector

specific  competition  frameworks in  telecommunications,

electricity, gas, and media industries.  As MTI announced

last  year, in line with the recommendations of the  ERC,

the Government will enact a generic competition law.   We

target to do so by 2005.  MTI is studying the legislative

frameworks, practices and experiences of other countries.

We  are  mindful that the Singapore economy is small  and

open  and  will  adopt  features  of  laws  that  we  see

elsewhere that best suit our circumstances.  Our  aim  is

to  develop  a  legal framework that will  enable  us  to

further  maintain and promote vigorous competition  among

firms, without adding unduly to business cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on Singapore Power, Dr Maliki had asked how

Singapore  Power manages utilities accounts  in  arrears,

and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>



if  utilities  can  be billed separately  for  water  and

electricity so that households who can only afford to pay

for  their  water bills will not have their water  supply

disconnected.   Singapore Power Services (SP Services) is

flexible   in   working  with  households   on   suitable

instalment   plans   to  help  them   tide   over   their

difficulties.  Utilities are only disconnected  after  SP

Services has made numerous attempts to get the households

to pay their arrears and to commit to an instalment plan.

If  they do not contact SP Services to work out a payment

plan,  they will get their electricity disconnected.   If

they continue to default on payments, PUB will install  a

thimble  in the household's water-pipe to limit, but  not

halt, the flow of water.  This thimbling of water is  not

done  until  at  least  five  months  after  the  initial

default.   If  the  household is still in  default  after

another  six months, in other words, eleven months  after

the   initial   default,  then  the   water   supply   is

disconnected.    So  the  water  supply   will   not   be

disconnected  if  these households pay, at  least,  their

current  utilities bills, which would then only  comprise

water and refuse charges.  In effect, the result is  what

Dr Maliki wanted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separating electricity and water billings and

collections is not a sustainable solution.  At the end of

the day, the arrears and utilities charges must still  be

paid.   The  crux  of  the matter is that  households  in

difficulty  will  have  to control their  consumption  of

electricity  and  water.  Those in hardship  should  also

seek assistance from their relatives or from the CCCs and

CDCs.   As  for  Dr Maliki's suggestion of  using  stored

value   cards  and  other  measures,  the  Energy  Market

Authority will look into any creative solutions that will

help.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Senior Minister of

State  has  not responded to my query on the  IPS  report

which says that business costs are inflated unnecessarily

by Government policies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, I have responded

quite thoroughly on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>



issue,  not  just  on  business costs  as  a  whole,  but

specifically  to  do  with  Government  taxes,  fees  and

charges.   Overall,  we are competitive,  and  Government

taxes,  hidden or not hidden, direct taxes  and  indirect

taxes,  when you total them all up, they are lower  as  a

proportion of GDP, and they are lower as an imposition on

business, than in most other countries.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Leong, please move on to the next

cut.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, this subject on

entrepreneurship had been well debated by many Members in

this House during the Budget Speech debate.  I would like

to make a few points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to congratulate the Minister of

State,  Mr Raymond Lim, for being appointed the  Minister

of  State  in charge of promoting entrepreneurship.   The

process  of  creating an entrepreneurial nation  needs  a

total approach, more so, a total mindset change, as  said

by  many MPs and I in this House.  Our people have become

too  rigid  in  thoughts and methods.  How  then  can  we

encourage  our people to take risk and start  businesses?

These are some of the points made by many Members as well

as the Minister of State himself in his speech during the

Budget  debate.  The Budget Statement actually  mentioned

that  the  MTI  would  set aside  $500  million  to  grow

Singapore companies and help them to venture abroad.   It

was  mentioned at page 23, paragraph 2.22 of  the  Budget

Statement.  However, I have not found any detail  on  how

this $500 million is going to be spent.  I would like  to

hear  from the Minister some details on how this sum will

be  used.   Can  the Minister of State also  give  us  an

insight  into  some  of his initial thoughts  on  how  he

intends  to fulfil his new role as the Minister of  State

in  charge  of  Entrepreneurship?   Has  he  any  initial

programme or course of action that he can enlighten  this

House?   Would  he  get  private  sector  input  on   his

deliberations?   If so, how?  Has the Minister  of  State

thought about the various measurable data, parameters and

targets  to  track  the  progress  and  success  of  this

entrepreneurship drive over the years to come?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, in the last few days, we

have  heard  from a few Members in this House  about  the

role  of  Government in promoting entrepreneurship.   The

common  argument we have heard is that true entrepreneurs

should not wait for the Government and should know how to

find  their  ways  and  they should  stop  expecting  the

Government  to  do things for them.  Sir,  speaking  from

experience and having done it myself, a few times over, I

would  like  to  say  that  all  of  these  are  academic

arguments and they do seem logical.  But I must also  add

that  unless one has done it or gone through  the  trials

and  tribulations  of becoming an entrepreneur,  he  will

never  understand why the likes of Ms Olivia Lum, Dr  Gan

and myself, still feel that the Government can indeed  do

many things to help.  I must also add that the few of  us

in  this  House, who are advocating this suggestion  that

Government's involvement is indeed needed, did it without

the  Government's help in the first place.  And,  if  you

look at the background of every one, we did not wait  for

things  to  change.  We struck out on our  own,  with  or

without  Government's help.  But having  experienced  the

headaches  and heartaches, and having had to resolve  all

of  them  by ourselves, we now want to help others  avoid

similar  problems so that they can better focus on  their

businesses and have an easier chance of succeeding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we indeed want a thousand flowers to bloom, then

we  will  need many more thousands to try and  fail,  and

this  is precisely where the Government can help - making

it  easier  for  those few thousands to try.   Some  will

never  need Government's help, but many could do  with  a

little  support  here and there.  If  nothing  else,  the

Government  could,  at least, clear the  obstacles  which

exist  today  and  which  stifle  entrepreneurship.   The

Government  could, at least, create a more level  playing

field  as  Singapore-based companies face  the  GLCs  and

MNCs.   The  Government  could, at  least,  allocate  its

resources,  such  that every company,  whether  large  or

small, will have equal access to these resources.  As you

can  see,  the  private enterprises and the entrepreneurs

have never asked for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>



handouts.  All they want are equal opportunities and  for

the obstacles to be cleared.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in this respect, I congratulate Mr Raymond Lim

for  being  appointed, and I am glad that the  Government

appointed him because it shows that they do realise  that

there  is  a need for a champion, and there is  something

that  the  Government can do about it.  I would  like  to

give him three suggestions on what he could do as his key

priorities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one is on a conducive environment for the

rules  and  regulations.   I  will  not  go  through  the

details.  We have talked a lot about these.  I would like

to take just one example that stifles entrepreneurship  - the  patent laws which will jail a person who first files

his    patent   outside   Singapore.    This    is    not

entrepreneurship friendly.  In fact, it is negative  when

we try to attract entrepreneurs to be based in Singapore.

I   know   that  the  Government  is  trying  to  develop

Singapore's IP industry.  But why do we think that we can

do  it by forcing people to do it down here?  In fact, it

has a negative impact on us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the suggestions I would like to propose are

these.   We have the pro-enterprise panel - we  all  know

the role - and I think this could be transformed to a pro-active agency that reviews the rules and regulations,  in

addition  to  reacting to them through feedback.   To  do

this, they will need a much bigger secretariat because it

is  a  part-time role for many people involved.   Second,

for  every  rule  and  regulation that  is  presented  in

Parliament, I suggest that we do a study of its impact on

the  cost  of  business.  What is the cost of compliance?

And  if  every Bill that is presented comes along with  a

cost  of compliance, we can basically make it a lot  more

business friendly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of EDB, I would like to clarify the

points  that  some  Members and I  have  made.   And  the

Minister  has raised this just now, on what EDB does  for

multi-nationals.  I do not think that anyone  has  argued

that  EDB did wrong.  In fact, they did an excellent job.

Many, including

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>



myself,  praised EDB for its success.  They  have  really

done well for Singapore.  But, in the same breath, I say,

let  EDB continue to do what it does best, and, that  is,

to  bring in the big accounts, as the Minister said,  and

to focus on multi-nationals.  It is precisely because EDB

was  successful  in what it did that I  am  advocating  a

similar  approach - a one-stop agency for  start-ups  and

local companies based in Singapore.  We already have  the

making  of  such  an  agency.   SPRING  Singapore  is  an

excellent example.  But, in my own experience with  them,

they need a lot more clout, teeth and resources, the  way

EDB has resources to help multi-nationals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area which the Minister of State can focus

on  is  in the area of financing of SMEs, and this  is  a

topic that I will talk in my next cut.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, the

need  to  groom local entrepreneurs cannot be  overstated

and  it is for this reason that today, we have a Minister

of  State in charge of Entrepreneurship.  Sir, I like the

analogy  stated by Minister George Yeo a while  ago.   He

said  that  we are like a garden, and the Government  can

fertilise, water and nurture it, but the ultimate test is

in  the quality of the seed.  I agree and, in fact,  like

to  go  one  step further.  Perhaps, within  this  garden

there  are  a  number  of pots of bonsai  that  are  very

valuable and, if we give them special tender loving care,

one day they may grow to become a treasure and may become

a collector's item.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while it is good to encourage all Singaporeans

to  become more entrepreneurial, it is also important for

us  to focus our efforts to groom a number of what I call

"super-entrepreneurs", who can become business leaders in

their respective fields.  These super-entrepreneurs  will

be  able to put Singapore on the world map.  They will be

able to help us connect to the world and allow us to ride

on  the  waves of the growing economies.  As a  start,  I

would  suggest  that  our GLCs and perhaps  some  of  the

bigger private

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>



companies   can  play  this  role  and  become   business

champions  one  day.  We must work with them,  understand

them  and  find ways to help them to succeed.  And,  when

they  do  succeed,  they must in turn  help  groom  other

Singapore companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we groom super-entrepreneurs, we must not forget

the  problems faced by many local businesses,  especially

the  SMEs.   One  of  the main obstacles  for  the  local

entrepreneurs is the lack of financing.  Many have spoken

on this subject and I shall not repeat the arguments.  To

help  them, Sir, I would like the Government to seriously

consider  setting  up a special bank  for  the  SMEs.   I

believe the DBS Bank was initially set up to provide  the

much  needed financing for developing new industries and,

hence,  the  name  "Development Bank of Singapore".   Now

that  DBS  has  become  a full commercial  bank,  it  has

changed  its  name and shifted its focus,  by  necessity.

This is not a bad thing for DBS, but it has created a gap

that  needs to be filled.  Therefore, we should  consider

setting up a new SME bank to fill this gap.  With  proper

safeguards,  I  believe the SME bank can be  viable.   It

will  certainly signal the Government's determination  to

help  local  businesses and it will be a major  boost  to

groom entrepreneurs.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, many Members have

spoken about Government's red tape and the need to remove

it  so  as  not to stifle entrepreneurship.   However,  I

believe that what is most important and difficult  to  do

is  to effect a mindset change in the civil service, from

one of rigid implementers of rules to a friendly business

advocate.  This will contribute positively to creating an

environment   where   entrepreneurship   can    flourish.

However,  such  a  change  can only  come  about  if  top

Government leaders, the media and the general public keep

up   the   publicity,  exhortation  and,  if   necessary,

pressure.  To be truly successful, our Minister in charge

of  Entrepreneurship certainly needs all the help he  can

get, to not only remove old rules and red tape, but, more

importantly, change all our civil servants'  mindset,  so

that they will become pro-business, customer

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>



service  oriented  and advocates to the businessmen  that

they deal with.

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, creating the right civil service mindset is

only   one   aspect.   Entrepreneurship   requires   many

attributes.   Besides talent, it requires the willingness

to take risks, the grit to keep on going despite failure,

and the passion and belief in a dream.  How do we nurture

such  qualities?  Do we suffer from too  much  order?   I

tend  to  think so.  Maybe we need to loosen up a little,

allow  greater flexibility and diversity.  We should  not

be  too  quick to put someone down just because he  is  a

little   different   or  has  different   strengths   and

aptitudes.   As  we  all  know,  there  is  strength   in

diversity.  A diverse economy is more resilient and  more

survivable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem we seem to have is that of the

copycat  entrepreneur.   Look at the  bubble  tea  craze.

Just because one or two outlets made some money from this

idea,  we had hundreds of bubble tea businesses sprouting

up  overnight.  The end result?  They all lost money.   I

am  sure  Members can cite a few more examples.  What  we

really  need are entrepreneurs with original  ideas  that

contain a good amount of innovation that can be protected

legally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurship will only flourish when our young

idealists  dare  to dream, be willing to sacrifice  their

time and effort to chase these dreams and be brave enough

to  risk  all  for their belief.  A few will succeed  and

reap  the  benefits.  Many will survive and get  by,  and

some  will fail, but the Government must create the right

environment  for  these people to  bounce  back  and  try

again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have made general points on what characterise

and  promote entrepreneurship.  For us to succeed, it  is

necessary   for   the  Government  to   consciously   and

constantly  build into its policies, be  they  social  or

economic,  be  they  in  school  or  the  workplace,   an

environment  conducive to the nurturing of  entrepreneurs

in Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, I am impressed with the

Government's   initiative   to   market   test   non-core

Government    activities,   and   divest    non-strategic

Government-linked   companies.    This   does   open   up

tremendous  opportunities for  both  mature  and  budding

entrepreneurs.   However,  these  well-intentioned  moves

must  consciously  avoid the evil of a  private  monopoly

replacing public monopoly, especially if that monopoly is

a  privatised  "Government-cloned" monopoly.   Could  the

Minister comment on what measures will be put in place to

prevent this development?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have highlighted in my Budget debate speech, we

will need to do more to rebalance some of the risk-reward

ratios  of  our  four  factors of production,  so  as  to

incentivise    our   entrepreneurs.    Ultimately,    the

entrepreneur is the ultimate value creator,  who  employs

the  other factors of production.  However, he will  only

do so if the rewards outweigh the relative risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The costs of land and labour must be kept

reasonable, and the upward pressure on these two  factors

must be kept in check.  On the other hand, capital return

is  at  an  all-time low now and it is, indeed, opportune

for entrepreneurs to access funds and, in return, give  a

better  return  on capital,  albeit with some  degree  of

risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On accessing funds, again, it has been talked about

many  times in this House.  But it is a constant  refrain

of  SMEs that there is a lack of adequate supply of  risk

capital.   There  appears to be an  inherent  risk-averse

culture  of  capital providers, particularly  banks,  for

risky  start-up  efforts.   The  Global  Entrepreneurship

Monitor  (GEM)  Report 2001 noted that failures  are  not

tolerated   and  capital  providers  are  suspicious   of

entrepreneurs.   This culture has created  what  the  GEM

study  termed  as a 'capital gap', which is  a  situation

where  funds needed at start-up stage are not  available,

but pour in when the entity is already successful.   This

will not work.  There must be easier access to a constant

stream  of  risk  capital, or else, it is a  non-starter.

Perhaps  it  is time to set up some sort of a  SME  Bank,

that a few

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>



of  my  colleagues have spoken about, where entrepreneurs

can  have access to seed capital and start-up funds.  And

a  new  set  of  rules  should  apply  to  these  budding

entrepreneurs,  away  from  the typical  collateral-based

lending.   Government grants need not  only  target  high

value add type of entrepreneurs, but be made available to

a whole variety of businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would like to propose the

establishment  of  a  network of a  series  of  colourful

entrepreneur hubs to encourage budding entrepreneurs  and

even  the retrenched to venture.  This could be  done  at

two levels.  First, the 'experimental' level and then the

'serious or committed' level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please allow me to explain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The experimental level type of entrepreneur hub

can take a leaf out of places like London's Covent Garden

and  New York City's Greenwich Village.  Its emphasis  is

on   low cost and simple set-up, although not necessarily

only   in  artifacts  or  souvenir  trades  alone.   This

encourages  budding entrepreneurs and niche entrepreneurs

to  market  test their product and creativity,  and  adds

vibrancy  to  a city.  It could also become the  breeding

ground  and  form a part of the critical mass needed  for

the emergence of serious entrepreneurs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The serious or committed level. This can take

the  shape  of our One-North project, or the  Southampton

Enterprise Hub in South East of England.  The pillars  of

such  a  hub  are  knowledge  and  institution  networks,

trained  persons  and  a  sophisticated  information  and

communication  structure.  In  other  word,  links   with

academic  institutions will enable  research  and  market

information,  so that IP innovations can be  brought  out

of the laboratories.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Miss Low, can you sum up now, please?

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> And links with the real business

world will also give it an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>



unceasing  flow  of  ideas and people  who  are  actively

engaged in entrepreneurial activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of both types of entrepreneur hubs,

when   well   managed  and  networked,  will  create   an

"entrepreneur   breed  entrepreneur"  culture.    Perhaps

'enterprise  hub directors' could also be  introduced  to

network  both  locally and globally, so that  a  constant

flow  of  fresh inputs and outputs can be seen  here.   I

hope the Minister would consider and study this proposal.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, many Members have spoken

about  the need for financing of SMEs.  I think the issue

really  is that, today, we have  two ends of the spectrum

in  terms  of financing.  One end of the spectrum  is  VC

financing  through  equity, which  I  would  say  is  the

aggressive  end.   And the other end  is  debt  financing

through collaterals, which is the conservative end.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can develop a more vibrant financing

environment,  we  will surely attract more  entrepreneurs

from  Singapore and from outside Singapore to locate down

here,  as sugar attracts ants.  And I think we have  many

gaps to plug today.  It will take us some time for us  to

develop  this  vibrant environment, and I  have  given  a

number  of  suggestions  to the Minister.   I  will  just

highlight  a few, in addition to the small business  bank

which some Members have raised, and the OTC board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been very successful with the Local

Enterprise Financing Scheme (LEFS), and I would  like  to

suggest  that  we  build on this  scheme  to  enhance  it

further  and to give it a bit more flexibility,  so  that

this  can be applied in many other areas, including  non-equipment  financing,  participation  by  non-banks   and

venture capitalists, and also to give more flexibility to

financing  institutions  so  that  they  will   be   more

encouraged to use the LEFS to lend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a whole slew of financing modes

depending  on  the  life  cycle  of  the  company.    The

financing  mode that a company needs may  change  as  the

company changes in its structure.  As ours is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>



still   an   immature  market,  compared  to   the   more

entrepreneurial economies like the US, Israel and Taiwan,

we  will therefore need some help, and this is where  the

Government can play an important role in trying  to  help

find  the  match of a financing type for  a  company.   I

therefore  suggest that we set up a Matching Agency  that

can  facilitate this role, just as a facilitation agency.

Once  we  can  get  this  whole  process  going  and  the

environment gets more mature and companies know where  to

find  the money, I think the Government can back  off  as

the momentum picks up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is also room for agencies like SPRING

Singapore  to  play  a developmental  role  of  providing

smaller companies with the right training, mentorship and

access  to the right advice on what is the right type  of

financing  available  for  them.   I  think  whilst  many

companies  can do it on their own, there are  still  some

who still need some help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also given a suggestion of creating a special

fund called a buy-out or restructuring fund.  It will  be

especially  useful in an environment like this  where  we

want  to  encourage mergers, acquisitions and  management

buy-outs  of  GLCs.  If there are more  funds  like  this

established  in  Singapore,  I  think  we  can  spur  the

activities and create a lot more opportunities like this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the issue of credit rating and credit

insurance   schemes.   If  these  can  become   permanent

features  in  Singapore, they will  surely  help  lending

institutions to gain more confidence when they lend money

particularly to smaller companies.  And I think  this  is

something  that  we  have started  but  it  is  not  well

developed,  and this could be another area  which  SPRING

Singapore and the Government could develop further.   And

if  these  schemes are developed, traders who  have  been

complaining about their access to financing will find the

problem being resolved.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, SMEs will provide the future

impetus for economic growth.  The problem is: how to grow

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>



SMEs?   How  to assist them?  How to help them  transform

from  SMEs  to become MSCs  -  Major Singapore Companies?

This  term  is not coined by me.  It appears in  the  ERC

Report,  and  therefore, I am just using the  same  term.

How to transform SMEs into MSCs, versus the MNCs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think one of the starting points is that the

SMEs  need  a  patron.  Perhaps Mr Raymond  Lim,  besides

being  designated as the Minister of State in  charge  of

entrepreneurship, could also  call himself  the  Minister

for SMEs.  He can then be the patron for SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A high level, high profile patronage for the SMEs

will  help  them  to focus their efforts towards  helping

these small companies to grow.  And being the patron,  Mr

Lim  will  definitely have all the sorrows  of  the  SMEs

poured  onto his shoulders, and therefore  he can  better

understand in-depth all the problems of the SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully agree with my colleagues, Mr Inderjit

Singh  and  Miss Penny Low, that unlike MNCs,  which  are

well  taken care of by the one-stop agency of EDB,  there

is  currently no one-stop agency to help SMEs.   I  would

like to suggest that MTI should designate an agency, like

SPRING Singapore, to be the one-stop agency to help  SMEs

locally, and then IE Singapore can be the one-stop agency

to  help SMEs to venture overseas.  Sir, for that matter,

since  both  SPRING Singapore and IE Singapore  claim  to

help  local SMEs, why not revive the idea of merging  the

two  agencies  into  one,  that means,  combining  SPRING

Singapore and IE Singapore.  Then it will have a new name

called  SPRING-IE Singapore.  I believe that  this  is  a

better  approach which will have a single composite  body

to help the SMEs, both locally and venturing overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point I want to raise is with regard

to    MTI's   responses   to   several   of   the    good

recommendations,  stated in the  ERC  Report,  to  assist

SMEs.  Some of these worthwhile recommendations are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to develop entrepreneurship programmes at all

educational levels;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to impose sunset rule on all licences to cut

red tape.;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to enact a competition law; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to establish a private equity exchange.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said earlier, one of the problems of

the  SMEs is that there is no single agency to help  them

to  champion  their cause, to speak up for  them  and  to

solve their problems and to resolve red tape.  Therefore,

my idea of a single agency for SMEs would be able to help

to champion the several recommendations of the Government

in the ERC Report so as to help the SMEs.  In summary,  I

would like to propose that Mr Raymond Lim be a patron  of

SMEs, and a one-stop agency called SPRING-IE Singapore be

the single agency for SMEs.

<br><br><!-- Dr Gan See Khem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Gan See Khem (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I remember

being  involved in 1986 in the Economic Review  Committee

where  a  lot of emphasis was made on the role  of  SMEs,

because we were hit with a recession.  So, workshops  and

committees  were  set up to promote SMEs  and  a  lot  of

emphasis  was  made  on  the role  of  the  SMEs  in  the

Singapore  economy.   But what I also  remember  is  that

after  the  economy recovered, issues about helping  SMEs

became  less prominent.  Basically, amongst the SMEs,  we

felt that when the economy recovered, the emphasis on the

role of SMEs was forgotten, or less important.  Today, in

the  last week of our Budget debate and every day, we are

talking  about issues regarding SMEs, the ERC Report  and

many  of our parliamentary colleagues have made very good

suggestions about how to promote SMEs.

<br>4.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand that SMEs now employ over 50% of our

workforce.   They  contribute  35%  to  our  GDP.    MNCs

contribute 45% to our GDP; and GLCs, 16%.  I believe this

formula  had worked very well for Singapore in the  past.

But what I would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>



like  to  ask is: is there a review of these  ratios  and

targets,  in terms of the long-term strategic development

of SMEs in Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GLCs take a very commendable role in investing in

high tech, knowledge industries and taking us a leap into

the  future.   MNCs' role cannot be underrated.   We  all

congratulate  EDB  on  a job well done.   And  we  should

continue  to attract big MNCs to come to Singapore.   But

what  I would like to ask is:  is there a long-term  plan

to review the role of SMEs in Singapore, in terms of, for

example,  its GDP component?  Are we going  to  allow  or

encourage  our local enterprises to grow larger,  whereby

these   SMEs   or   local  enterprises  will   have   the

capabilities, financial resources and size, in  order  to

compete effectively in the regional and global markets?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMEs are mainly Singaporeans. Until the day we see

Germans and Japanese coming here to set up SMEs,  we  see

most  of  the  SMEs are Singaporeans.  I just  came  this

morning from the inauguration of the 52nd Council of  the

Singapore  Chinese Chamber of Commerce and  Industry  and

there are 4,000 members.  We have 120 association members

with  about  20,000  members of their  own.   So  we  are

talking  about  25,000  membership within  the  Singapore

Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  And these  are

Singaporean companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the going gets tough, these Singaporean

entrepreneurs  would not stay. As the saying  goes,  when

the going gets tough, the tough gets going.  And we still

intend to make Singapore the headquarters of our business

operations.   So  what I would like to  propose  in  this

House is that we need to review and promote the image and

the role of SMEs.  We do not need a revolution.  Suddenly

overnight,  we  say,  "It  is  really  cool  to   be   an

entrepreneur."   We do not need to do it overnight.   But

what  we  need  to  do  is  to  make  the  image  of   an

entrepreneur to be much more acceptable and higher in the

Singapore scheme of things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come from a society ---

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Gan, can you sum up now?



<br><br><!-- Dr Gan See Khem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Gan See Khem:</b> Yes. In Singapore, I think from

the views of SMEs, the mandarins and the scholars are  at

the  highest  peak of the social structure,  whereas  the

merchants  and  the businessmen are at the  bottom  rank.

And  one of the issues that I would like to bring  up  in

this  House  is whether we would, over time, promote  the

social ranking and role of SMEs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, for the

past three years, I have also been involved in efforts to

promote  the  IC design activities and support  companies

and  research  institutes  in  their  efforts  to  design

electronic silicon or integrated circuit.  This  industry

has  huge  potential and has been growing at a phenomenal

rate over the years.  The semiconductor industry is about

US$300   billion.    For  those  who   are   not   aware,

semiconductor chips are pervasive, and they are found  in

computers,  cellular phones, watches,  cars,  pacemakers,

coffee  pots, satellites and greeting cards.   In  short,

they are everywhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our effort to promote entrepreneurship, there is

a  clear need for Singapore to nurture technology  start-ups.   Why?   Just as I speak here in this  House,  other

countries like China, Taiwan, Australia, South Korea  and

Malaysia are very seriously moving into this area.   This

is  because they know that as they embark on  to  the  IC

fabrication  industry, there is a need for them  to  grow

and develop their activities so as to increase the number

of  local design, products and innovation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Shanghai, for example, mainland China's second

foundry,   Grace   Semiconductor  Manufacturing   Company

(GSMC),  is now being built.  GSMC is among the companies

looking out to make money, by being in the first wave  of

advanced     semiconductor    concerns    to    establish

manufacturing  bases  in mainland China.   With  many  of

their  orders coming from foreign design houses and  much

of  what  they make going overseas, they are  also  doing

their  utmost to ensure the growth of their local  design

industry and local

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>



design  houses  because  they know  that,  eventually,  a

rising  type  of  local design houses would  eat  up  fab

capacity and drive expansion.  This is what our local fab

pride, CSM enjoys, and could not benefit from.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In countries, like China, Taiwan, Australia, South

Korea and Malaysia, and even Thailand, incubation centres

with  the  support of Government are sprouting  out  like

mushrooms.  More often than not, in these countries,  new

technology   start-ups   are  given   the   support   and

facilities,  infrastructure, software  and  hardware  for

them  to start their work and focus on what they are best

at, that is, design and create.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for Singapore to move forward, private

enterprises must be encouraged, engineered even  for  the

sake  of growth, if this is indeed the direction that  we

have  charted for Singapore.  Are we willing to seriously

assist  our  start-ups, in every sense of  the  word,  by

sincerely    providing   infrastructure   and   financial

assistance?   Supporting them inevitably is part  of  the

conducive  environment that we need to create.   This  is

why  I  support the call by Members for the formation  of

relevant  financial  institutions  to  assist  start-ups.

Perhaps,   the  changing  of  mindset  is  the   greatest

challenge  at hand.  It is time for us to listen  to  the

industry players and stakeholders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my interaction with the industry professionals

and also budding start-ups, I often hear them complaining

of  so  many  schemes that are supposed to  assist  them.

But,  in the end, the criteria, requirements and controls

are  so  cumbersome and tedious that  most  give  up  and

prefer not to ask for help at all.  It may not be fair to

say  this,  but the impression that I get is  that  civil

servants and Government officers seem to be oblivious  of

happenings  in the industry.  Do we need so many  complex

schemes, so many different names and acronyms?  Would the

Ministry  consider  simplifying  and  streamlining  these

assistance schemes?  Can we make the application  process

more transparent?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, very often, for technology start-ups, the entry

barrier is high and often difficult to start ---

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Nordin, can you start summing up

now?



<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> Can we not do something to

lower  these barriers and encourage more young, able  and

talented  professionals in this field  to  explore  their

ideas  and  take  the leap of faith to be  the  next  big

companies from Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> To allow the Minister ample time to

reply,  may  I  request the remaining speakers  for  this

amendment  to  keep their speeches as short as  possible.

Mr Arthur Fong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong:</b> Sir, in this economic climate, we

hear  of  many businessmen saying that our Government  is

not  sympathetic to helping them tide over the  slowdown.

I  too initially believe this to be so.  But I have  seen

many viable small and medium enterprises being forced out

of  business  because of the chain  of  debts.   Although

these   SMEs  are  viable,  their  obligations  to  their

employees and suppliers are often compromised, because of

their  own  debtors who too are holding them up.   But  a

quick look at the SPRING Singapore's shows - they have  a

whole  coterie  of financial assistance schemes  to  help

SMEs  to  tide  over  the short-term  difficult  cashflow

situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an example is the micro loan scheme that helps

SMEs to overcome their short-term cashflow problems.   It

allows  the  local companies concerned to  borrow  up  to

$50,000  at  a  favourable interest rate of 5%  repayable

over four years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be clear about our intention here. Any

business  organisation that is not able  to  balance  its

cash  in the long term has no business to be in business.

But  I understand SPRING Singapore is not the only agency

that  assists our business.  There are others and,  given

the shortness of time, I will address my concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that a company has its application

for  a  micro loan rejected by an attendant bank  on  the

grounds  that  the company had previously issued  cheques

that bounced.  I am afraid this is not the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>



first or the only case.  It is common knowledge that even

many  of the successful entrepreneurs faced all kinds  of

cashflow problems in their struggling days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to Mr Gan Kim Yong's point on the SME bank,

perhaps,  it  does  merit some look  at  his  suggestion.

Because  I  think the attendant banks, who are  assessing

these  loan applications, are assessing them based  on  a

lot  of  programme  lending and  credit  scoring.   There

should  be people who have experience looking at business

from  the  business  perspective  -  from  the  different

valuation  model, business order books, management  audit

and  the  experience of the people running the  business.

So,  in this respect, maybe, instead of just going to the

SME bank, we should have people with these experiences in

the  attendant  banks.  Sir, I am afraid  that  the  best

intentions of our Government may be thwarted by  what  is

actually happening on the ground.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I call on the Minister of State in charge of

Enterpreneurship  to assure the House that  the  original

spirit  of  whatever assistance schemes that we  have  in

place is carried out to their intent on the ground.

<br><br><!-- Dr Gan See Khem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Gan See Khem:</b> Sir, I follow up with what Mr

Arthur  Fong  has said.  Pro-business schemes  are  many,

from SPRING Singapore, IE Singapore and EDB.  Now we also

have  the  EDB  very actively helping SMEs.   But,  often

times, as what we have heard in the House today, most  of

these schemes are crafted by civil servants with a lot of

inputs  from the different sectors, including the private

sector.   However, the schemes to assist  SMEs  are  much

more  difficult to craft than schemes to attract MNCs  to

Singapore.   Because  SMEs come  in  all  shapes,  sizes,

colours and are in different stages in the organisation's

life  cycle  and from different industry sectors,  it  is

very difficult to just have one solution for all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we would like to propose is a lot more

customisation of these schemes to help SMEs.  One of  the

issues that I would like to raise, which I thought was  a

bit arbitrary, is the $15 million cut-off point.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>



Where  SMEs  whose fixed assets are beyond  that  amount,

they  are  not  allowed  to  be  on  the  different  loan

assistance  schemes.  And where did the $15 million  come

from?  It has been there for a long time.  I think it  is

also time this cut-off point is reviewed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be able to customise schemes for SMEs,

what  I  would  like  to  propose is  that  the  relevant

agencies undertake a much more in-depth research and data

gathering  about  SMEs,  ie, the structures  of  SMEs  in

Singapore  and  the industries they are in.   We  need  a

database in order to do much more analysis and diagnosis,

so  that we would be able to customise the schemes to the

needs  of  SMEs,  as well as to review some  of  the  old

schemes which really do not apply any more.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Ser Miang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Ser Miang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I think

the  most  important  support that we  can  give  to  our

entrepreneurs  is  one of financing them.   For  the  new

start-ups, they need financing.  It is difficult for them

to  do so if they do not have sufficient capital of their

own.  If they try to borrow from commercial banks, as  we

have  heard, and if they lack the track records and  most

of the time they do not have sufficient collateral, it is

difficult for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, local banks have been the ones who

have  been supporting the small accounts, such as  these.

But  with  the  merger of six banks  into  three,  it  is

generally  felt that the three banks are now  more  risk-averse.  We are not blaming the banks as they have  their

own bottomline and their shareholders to look after.

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same also holds true for small entrepreneurs

venturing overseas.  For example, if they go to China, it

is  very  difficult for them to borrow locally.  If  they

want to borrow from Singapore banks, Singapore banks will

insist on collaterals in Singapore.  And if there are  no

Singapore collaterals, there are no loans and no ventures

overseas.   It is also difficult for them now to  attract

funding from private

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>



investors, angel funds and venture capitalists.  With the

economic  downturn and uncertainties, funds  have  become

scarce  and,  at  the  same time, private  investors  and

venture  capitalists  are getting more  conservative  and

wary.  Alas, angels are also getting to be fewer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not talking about handouts. I agree that

the  Government cannot become an ATM where anyone with  a

calling card "entrepreneur" can come and freely draw from

the support.  Entrepreneurs must also compete for limited

funds  available.  The rule of survival  of  the  fittest

should  also apply.  But the problem of financing genuine

entrepreneurs  with  potential is real.   Many  of  these

entrepreneurs with good and workable ideas would probably

be  stopped in their tracks before they even get started,

because of a lack of funds, and that would be a real loss

to the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that there is really no easy solution to

this problem, but we really need to find a way forward to

bridge  this  gap  and  to  help  our  entrepreneurs   to

flourish.  The idea of a SME Bank or a special fund could

be a workable solution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a Chinese saying, wan shi ju bei, zhi qian

dong  feng, ie, everything is ready, what we need is  the

East wind.  I think there are hundreds, if not thousands,

of entrepreneurs who are prepared to set sail, and I hope

that the Ministry and, now, Mr Raymond Lim, can find  the

East wind for them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</b> Sir, I thank Members for their

useful   comments   on  promoting  entrepreneurship   and

developing the SMEs.  I agree with Mr Inderjit Singh that

the Government has an important role to play in promoting

entrepreneurship, but I think he and many Members of  the

House would agree with me that, ultimately, whether  they

succeed or not really depends on themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the example of Dr Diana Young, CEO of

Mil-Com  Aerospace Group.  She had to mortgage  her  home

and persisted even when the going was tough,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>



until  she  clinched her first deal in  India.   Starting

with  six  employees  in  1994,  the  Mil-Com  group   of

companies  now  serves  as  a  one-stop  centre  for  the

aerospace industry, offering value-added services ranging

from  engineering  and airport security technologies,  to

training for engineers and technicians.  As a female in a

male-dominated  industry, her achievements  are  all  the

more  remarkable.   This  is  the  kind  of  feisty   and

resilient spirit that marks a true entrepreneur.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should not be hand-holding our

entrepreneurs, but neither should it stand  in  the  way.

Nor  should  it  simply be folding up  its  arms  and  do

nothing.   It  should  and  will  help  by  creating  the

conditions that will make it possible for those with  the

drive, determination and gumption to succeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has said in his Budget speech that

we must ensure that the business environment is friendly,

not just to big firms or foreign SMEs, but also the small

local  firms.  Dr Gan just now highlighted the importance

of  the SMEs for the economy.  I fully agree with both of

them.   We will help our SMEs upgrade their capabilities,

so that they can better compete in the marketplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Penny Low's vision of a vibrant enterprise hub is

one  that we share and have been actively nurturing.   It

is one where large and small companies, local or foreign,

co-exist, compete, interact and leverage on one another's

strengths  to  scale  greater  heights.   There  will  be

feedback  between  industry  and  academia,  and  a  wide

spectrum   of  capital  ready  to  commercialise   ideas.

However, we must be agnostic on nationality and  size  of

firms, because they all contribute to economic growth and

create  jobs for Singaporeans.  So, in answer to Dr  Gan,

as  to  whether we have a quota in which we  fix  in  our

minds  a certain percentage should be for SMEs, a certain

percentage  for GLCs or MNCs, we do not  have.   We  will

promote the growth of all enterprises.  We would like all

of them to succeed, because they add to economic activity

and growth, and jobs for Singaporeans.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example of the synergistic benefit of such an

environment  is  Encore Technologies, which  brought  its

Simputer,  or  Simple Computer, to Singapore  to  further

develop  and  launch it in global markets as a  "made-in-Singapore" hand-held computer.  Today, from its Singapore

base,  Encore  works  with more than  60  big  and  small

companies   in  Singapore  and  the  world   to   develop

applications for its Simputer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides grooming local companies, we are also

attracting foreign SMEs to Singapore to build  a  vibrant

enterprise  sector.   We want them to  use  Singapore  as

their  base  to  innovate, develop products  and  explore

opportunities in the region and beyond.  We have  already

made  some  headway in this area, and Singapore  is  fast

becoming a cosmopolitan enterprise hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of foreign incubators increased from 38

in  2001 to 51 in 2002, including incubators from  India,

Japan,  Korea and New Zealand.  In particular, the Korean

IT  promotion  agency  set up its first  Southeast  Asian

centre in Singapore, while Japan's Mie prefecture set  up

its  first  overseas Mie Business and  Innovation  Centre

here.   The  13 new incubators that came to Singapore  in

2002  are  expected to create about 500 jobs and generate

$55 million in value-added per year.  These foreign start-ups  that come to Singapore include companies such as  SL

Interactive,  a Korean multi-player online game  company.

This company is planning to launch a 3-D online game this

year.  It is also developing games for mobile phones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the high-tech incubators and start-ups, we

are  also  attracting SME centres from around the  world.

In addition to the South Sumatra Information House opened

earlier  this  month, we also expect to welcome  new  SME

centres   from  India,  China,  Chile  and   Korea.    In

particular,  the Zhejiang Centre will be  the  first-ever

centre  of  its kind by China in Southeast Asia  to  help

Chinese  companies venture overseas.  In  September  this

year,   Singapore  will  host  the  International   Small

Business Congress, which is internationally known as  the

SME event of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>



the   year.    CEOs,   entrepreneurs,  bankers,   venture

capitalists and policymakers from all over the world will

come  here for the Congress.  Japan alone will be sending

<br><br>100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SME  CEOs to attend.  Such events help to underscore

our status as an international enterprise hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, then, is the business environment that we are

creating.   All companies, big or small, must be  assumed

to  have the potential to grow and globalise, and we will

ensure  that there is a level playing field  for  all  to

succeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have brought up three important conditions

that   we   have   to  get  right  to  create   such   an

entrepreneurial economy:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) culture;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) regulatory environment; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will address them in turn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Inderjit Singh, Dr John Chen and Mr Leong Horn

Kee  have  emphasised, the critical factor is  a  culture

where Singaporeans are quick to seize opportunities, take

risks  and  make a difference.  Education is vital  here.

Mr  Leong  asked for an update.  NUS and  NTU  have  both

introduced   entrepreneurship   courses   and    exchange

programmes  to  their  curricula  in  collaboration  with

Stanford  University  and the University  of  Washington,

respectively.   About half of the 49 graduates  from  the

inaugural  batch of NTU's programme are now embarking  on

new start-ups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurship programmes are also taking off in

the  schools.  Since March last year, some 4,000 students

from over 70 schools have been trained under the BizWorld

programme by more than 500 volunteers, including business

people,  public  servants  and  teachers.   We  hope   to

increase the number of students trained under BizWorld to

10,000 by the end of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently heard about Mr Lin Xiang Qian, a former

VJC  student,  who is now serving National  Service.   As

Vice President of Esco Micro Pte Ltd, a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>



company owned by his parents, Xiang Qian spearheaded  the

product   development  and  exports  of  its   bio-safety

cabinets  division.   Last June, he  became  the  world's

youngest  person  to be granted full accreditation  under

the  NSF International Biohazard Cabinets Field Certifier

Accreditation Programme.  I know it is a mouthful, but it

is  an important thing.  He also brought in sales of $3.5

million for the company last year - all this in the  same

year that he sat for his A-Level examinations.  I do  not

want  to embarrass him by divulging his results,  but  he

did  very well in his A-Levels.  It is stories like these

that give us reasons to be optimistic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this culture has to spread beyond our students

to  our adult population.  The Phoenix Award was launched

in 2000 to recognise entrepreneurs who had persevered and

succeeded  in  spite  of past failures,  and  to  inspire

others  to emulate their fine example.  It is encouraging

that  many  past Phoenix Award nominees and  winners,  as

well  as  other  entrepreneurs, are now  volunteering  as

mentors  under  the Phoenix Mentorship Programme.   Along

with  activities run by other organisations, such as  the

Young  Entrepreneurs  Organisation, the  Association  for

Small  and  Medium  Enterprises, and  the  Entrepreneur's

Resource  Centre,  such  programmes  provide  a   support

network for entrepreneurs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To change a nation's culture will take time, as

these  are societal behaviours that are embedded  in  the

psyche of the people.  But a certain momentum has set in.

There  is  clearly  today a heightened awareness  in  the

country on the need for entrepreneurship.  The debate  in

this House bears testimony to this.  What is important is

that we actually walk the talk.  By "we", I mean not just

the   Government  and  civil  servants  but  every   one,

including parents, teachers, community leaders, business,

workers and the media.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On regulatory environment, I share the concerns of

Members about excessive red tape.  They have added to  my

store of horror stories that was already quite full after

a year chairing the EISC.  What

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>



is  encouraging is that the Minister for Finance has made

clear  that the Government is very much seized with  this

issue.   Besides the Pro-enterprise Panel, there  is  the

Rules Review Panel.  The latter is doing what Mr Inderjit

Singh   suggested,   that   is,   reviewing   rules   and

regulations.   This is a comprehensive internal  exercise

where  all  public agencies are required to review  their

rules  by  the end of FY 2004.  They have been  asked  to

consult  private  stakeholders as part  of  their  review

process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Leong have suggested that

there  be  sunset clauses in rules and regulations.   The

Government  has  accepted in spirit this  recommendation,

with  a mandatory review of all rules and regulations  by

all  Ministries every five years.  However, we will  look

into  how  stronger discipline can be  instilled  in  the

process  in  a  way  that  does  not  lead  to  excessive

administrative burden.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has also proposed that every rule

and  regulation change be accompanied by a study  of  the

cost   impact  on  businesses.   This  is  a   worthwhile

suggestion,  as  it  will raise the  awareness  of  civil

servants  on regulatory costs.  We will see how  best  it

can be implemented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for what Dr John Chen said, I believe that he has

hit the nail on its head.  It is not just about excessive

rules,  but how they are administered by public servants.

After all, there will always be rules.  Even in a society

of  angels, there will be, say, a rule to decide on which

side  of the road to drive on.  The issue is whether  the

angel  will be hauled up if he makes a U-turn  on  a  new

road  where  the traffic signs are not yet  up.   I  have

suggested  that  to  shift  the mindset,  the  Government

should  set the default key at "Yes" rather than "No"  in

dealing with business.  We will see how best this can  be

done in practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to move away from our top-down attitude

towards  the  public to one that emphasises teamwork  and

participation.  We are moving in that direction, with the

ERC as the clearest example

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>



of  partnership  in  setting  the  economic  agenda.   As

always,  more can be done, as bureaucracies  tend  to  be

hierarchical and more focused on process rather than  the

customer.  The good news is, as Deputy Prime Minister Lee

said, our civil service is moving in this direction,  and

more would be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On finance, several Members, such as Mr Ng Ser

Miang,   Mr  Inderjit  Singh  and  Ms  Penny  Low,   have

highlighted that financing gaps in the market may  hinder

entrepreneurship.   I  agree.  The  Government  has  thus

sought  to  improve  access to  funding  for  enterprises

through   facilitating  or  capitalising  new   financing

avenues,  and  by sharing in the financing  risks.   Last

September,  for  instance, the Government introduced  the

Loan  Insurance Scheme, where it defrays part of the cost

of the insurance premium.  This is to help companies that

would otherwise have difficulty in securing funding  from

VCs and commercial banks.  Since its launch, more than $9

million worth of loans have been approved.  But more will

be   done.    MTI   has  accepted,  in   principle,   the

recommendations of the panel headed by Mr Inderjit  Singh

to  improve the access to finance for entrepreneurs.   We

thank him for his work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has highlighted some of the

recommendations   from   that  panel.    Our   underlying

philosophy must be to work with private players  to  plug

these  gaps.  What are some of these key recommendations?

As  I said, he has highlighted some, but let me take  you

through them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) SME Bank. Banks in Singapore are paying more

attention to SME financing.  This has been helped by  MAS

granting Hong Leong Finance an exemption from section  23

of  the  Finance Companies Act, enabling  it  to  provide

unsecured  loans  of  up  to  0.5%  of  its  capital   to

customers.  This exemption is important as it facilitates

their  lending  to start-ups that are unable  to  provide

collateral.   More  recently, OCBC has also  adopted  the

lending   methodology  of  Hong  Kong's  SME  Loan   that

specialises in cash-flow financing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Private equity exchange. The Second Minister

for Finance, Mr Lim Hng Kiang,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>



said  during  the MOF's Committee of Supply that  parties

who  find  it viable will be allowed to operate  one,  if

they  meet  MAS' regulatory requirements.   I  understand

that  some interested Singapore parties are looking  into

this.  EDB and MAS will facilitate, where necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Credit rating bureau. The Association of Banks

in  Singapore is currently looking into how  best  to  do

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Angel matching network. SPRING is actively

exploring  this with a few private entities  to  see  how

best to match the SMEs with angel investors.

<br>5.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Modification to existing schemes. Mr Inderjit

Singh  has  mentioned some of these, eg, Local Enterprise

Financing  Scheme  (LEFS)  and  the  Start-up  Enterprise

Development  Scheme  (SEEDS).   SPRING  is  working  with

several venture capital companies to see how LEFS can  be

used  for hybrid financing like convertible loans. SEEDS,

which  was  started  to  help innovative  start-ups  with

equity   funding,   will  now   be   extended   to   non-technopreneurial companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to the other issues raised by Members.

Mr  Leong  Horn  Kee has asked for details  on  the  $500

million  that  the  Government is  putting  into  growing

Singapore  companies and helping them to venture  abroad.

The bulk or $399 million will go towards LEFS, the Micro-loan  scheme and the Loan Insurance Scheme.   2,400  SMEs

are  expected to benefit from these schemes in  FY  2003.

$42  million  will  be allocated to the Local  Enterprise

Technical Assistance Scheme (LETAS) which will help  some

3,000  SMEs  upgrade  their  business  capabilities   and

restructure their operations. The rest is for  SEEDS  and

IE   Singapore's   activities  to  help   Singapore-based

companies internationalise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to assure Mr Arthur Fong and Dr Gan See Khem

that our SME assistance schemes are periodically reviewed

to  ensure  that  they stay relevant.  For  example,  the

performance of LEFS and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>



the  loan terms and conditions are regularly reviewed  by

the  LEFS  Credit Committee, which comprises  public  and

private  sector  members.  Adjustments are  made  to  the

scheme, in the light of changing conditions, to meet  the

needs  of SMEs. For example, the conditions were  relaxed

and the interest rates lowered during the Asian financial

crisis at the last recession.  The Micro-loan scheme  was

also  started  as  a result of a review to  better  serve

small enterprises.  This explains why LEFS has been  very

popular   with  the  number  of  successful  applications

doubling from 1,586 in 2001 to 3,632 last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also developed new schemes to groom our

growing    enterprises.    For   example,   the   Growing

Enterprises with Technology Upgrading Initiative (GET-Up)

was  launched  last  month.  This scheme  pools  together

resources  and expertise from A*STAR, EDB, IE and  SPRING

to  provide  comprehensive assistance to enterpreneurs  - covering  innovations, technology development, capability

upgrading  and  venturing  overseas.   GET-Up   takes   a

proactive  approach. Senior officers  from  the  agencies

visit  the growing enterprises to understand their  needs

and offer customised assistance.  They have visited about

100 companies in the first two months of the scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another new programme that will be implemented in

April   is   a   $10  million  Locally-based   Enterprise

Advancement  Programme  (LEAP). We  have,  in  the  past,

provided  assistance  to MNCs and GLCs  who  have  helped

upgrade   SMEs.    LEAP  will  be   used   to   encourage

multipliers, such as industry associations and incubators

to   undertake  worthwhile  projects  with  clusters   of

companies.  Our intent is to reach out to a larger  group

of companies by working with such multipliers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is important is that through these various

financial  and upgrading programmes, many companies  have

been able to develop new business models to enhance their

competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such example is 77th Street, a trend-setter for

hip  streetwear  in  Singapore  and  Malaysia  which  was

featured in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>



yesterday's  Straits  Times.   It  has  built   a   loyal

following  among the young and trendy, particularly  aged

between 14-28.  Founded by Ms Elim Chew, who pounced upon

a  fashionwear  niche  which she saw  emerging   -   77th

Street grew from a small retail outlet in Far East  Plaza

to  16  outlets  and another 5 joint venture  outlets  in

Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong has suggested that we identify a few

winners and groom them to be super-entrepreneurs, like Mr

Sim Wong Hoo.  The problem is that the Government has  no

superior knowledge to identify winners. Sim Wong Hoo  was

not identified by the Government.  The market did. So the

market  is the best judge of potential winners.  However,

he  is right that, given our limited resources, we should

maximise them for the greatest impact on economic growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our starting point should be that companies at

different stages of growth have different needs.   Start-ups  are different from companies that are ready and able

to internationalise.  Help will be available to companies

at  different stages of their growth, but the  extent  of

help   will  be  different.   This  approach  is  to   be

preferred.   It  makes no assumption of who  the  winners

will  be and, hence, excludes no one.  It lets the market

decide,  while extending in a calibrated fashion to  help

the companies throughout their growth cycle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have suggested the creation of a one-stop SME agency, including reviving the old idea of

merging  IE  Singapore and SPRING Singapore. The  Finance

Minister  has  pointed out that SPRING Singapore  is  the

designated SME agency. However, based on their  feedback,

MTI will see how best to enhance what SPRING is doing  so

as  to increase the convenience and comprehensiveness  of

its  service to SMEs and better coordinate with the other

agencies  like  IE Singapore.  But let us have  realistic

expectations here. There are crucial differences  between

EDB  that targets the MNCs that it wants to bring in, and

an  SME  agency that caters to about 100,000  firms  with

very diverse needs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong has asked what are our next steps. There

are three.  First, we will look into implementing the ERC

recommendations  on  entrepreneurship   as   quickly   as

possible.  Second, we will take stock  of  the  different

schemes and the work done by the various agencies to  see

how  best  to  position them to promote entrepreneurship.

Third, to Mr Leong's question as to whether there will be

private  sector  inputs, the answer is "Yes".   Promoting

entrepreneurship   must  be  done  in  partnership   with

entrepreneurs as it is an iterative process  where  ideas

must  be  validated, some discarded as they may not  work

out as intended, and new ones adopted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some MPs have suggested setting up a statutory board

to  promote entrepreneurship.  I feel that the last thing

we  want  to promote entrepreneurship is to bureaucratise

the  process and that is why I think it is apt  that  the

Minister  in charge of Entrepreneurship is one without  a

Ministry.   It gives a lot more flexibility to do  things

and  not  be  weighed down by entrenched wisdom.    There

would,  of  course, be a core resource group  which  will

come  from  MTI, but it would include other agencies  and

private sector participation.  Mr Leong Horn Kee asked if

there are any outcome indicators to track the success  of

our  entrepreneurship methods.  We are watching a  number

of indicators, some of which include the number of start-ups,  the  number of companies that grow  and  eventually

internationalise,   and  their   contributions   to   the

Singapore economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the longer term impact of achieving the

cultural shifts that I mentioned earlier will have to  be

measured in a more qualitative way.  Ultimately,  I  hope

to  see  entrepreneurship become a part of our  society's

DNA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong has asked whether or not I should also be

the  SME Minister.  Since taking up my appointment as the

Minister  in charge of Entrepreneurship, there have  been

numerous suggestions that I be patron of many things.  If

you  read the Forum page, you will see that.  But I  have

tremendous confidence in my Ministerial

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>



colleagues and the Ministry of Trade and Industry who are

already looking after our SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also been asked when the position of Minister

in  charge of Entrepreneurship will no longer be  needed.

As I said in the Budget debate, we will know that we have

succeeded  when  Singaporeans look to the market,  rather

than  the Government, to make their decisions.   That  is

the final acid test.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I wish to thank the

Minister  for  his very vibrant, animated  and  enriching

discourse   on  the  future  strategies  for   Singapore.

Notably,  I hope that his idea that Singapore can  become

the  London  of  Asia will arouse high  public  interest.

Perhaps,  the  media will want to launch a  great  public

debate  on  this idea.  Can Singapore be  the  London  of

Asia?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wish to thank the Senior Minister of

State  and the Minister of State for their very  thorough

and clear replies.  On this note, I beg leave to withdraw

my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2). Mr Chew Heng

Ching cannot speak again.  Mr Arthur Fong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code VA 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall share your views with the House as

well.  The formation of the Singapore Business Federation

has  led to some disquiet in the business community. Many

felt  that  the aim for the business community  to  speak

with  one  voice  has  not been achieved.   Some  in  the

business  community felt that there was little  that  the

Singapore Business Federation could do for them and  were

confused  by  what seems to be overlapping roles  of  the

Singapore  Business  Federation  and  other  chambers  of

commerce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others felt that they could not afford to feast in

this economic downturn but,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>



in  the  main, many are questioning, especially  in  this

poor   economic  environment,  what  has  the   Singapore

Business Federation done to spur business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we had a meeting with the GPC Resource Panel

for  MTI and they have also expressed similar views.  For

instance, many businessmen are wondering, in the light of

the  world  expo  to be held in Shanghai,  what  has  the

Singapore   Business  Federation  done  to  ensure   that

Singapore  businesses are well-represented  there.   What

leg  work has the Singapore Business Federation  done  to

give  Singapore business a leg-up on the competition from

other countries? Sir, the Singapore Business Federation's

annual budget for membership fees alone is expected to be

about $6 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a moral obligation to take extra measures to

ensure  that  the activities undertaken by the  Singapore

Business  Federation  are  in the  interest  of  all  its

members.   We should put in place an apparatus to  ensure

that the Singapore Business Federation has fully met  the

expectations  of  its  members.  I propose  the  Minister

consider  setting  up  an  independent  body,   call   it

ombudsman if you like, to assess the performance  of  the

Singapore  Business Federation in promoting business  for

Singapore  business over a specific timeframe.   Perhaps,

the Minister of State in charge of Entrepreneurship could

take this review under his wing.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, I answer Mr Arthur

Fong's  question with a certain reluctance.   SBF  is  an

autonomous   federation.   It  is   under   parliamentary

oversight  only  to  the extent that we  have  under  law

provided  for compulsory membership.  In order to  buffer

the  Federation from us, when we legislated, we  provided

for a board of trustees. I am reluctant to be telling SBF

what they should do.  I do not think it is right that  we

should  set  up  an  ombudsman or some such  facility  to

oversee  what  the SBF does.  It should be an  autonomous

independent federation, looking after the interest of its

members  and operating independently from the  Government

and, if necessary, criticising us.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, I would certainly convey to

the  SBF  the views raised by Mr Arthur Fong,  but  as  a

postbox.  I think that is the type of relationship for us

to establish with the SBF. We took the decision to put it

under  legislation  with  great reluctance  because,  for

years,  we tried to create an apex body but we could  not

break  through  the  existing chambers  which  have  been

established over time.  So, finally, at their request, we

moved  legislation and since it has only been a year,  we

should give the SBF some time to find its footing and  to

establish a pattern of activities.  I can tell you  this,

because  I  am  involved in it: SBF has  expressed  great

interest to explain to its members the FTAs which we have

concluded and to collect views from its members  on  what

we should demand of the FTAs that we are negotiating.  In

the  coming  months,  SBF will be carrying  out  a  whole

series  of  measures to explain and do work on the  FTAs.

MTI  has told the SBF that we will support them fully  in

these activities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the

amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (3), Mr Tan Soo Khoon.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code VN 3100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, Singapore attracted some 7.57

million  visitors, marginally more than the  7.5  million

figure  for  the previous year.  However, there  are  two

disturbing  trends.   First, tourism receipts  have  been

estimated to be only $9 billion, a decline of 5% over the

peak some years ago, and that is a $1 billion loss to our

economy.   Second, the average length of stay of visitors

was  3.2  days per visitor, and this is a steady  decline

from  the  peak figure of 3.9 days chalked  up  in  1991.

Although in the past few years we have heard a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>



lot  about  different ways to boost tourism, eg,  Tourism

Master Plan, Tourism Blueprint, Tourism Task Force,  etc,

it  appears to me that we have reached a kind of dead-end

as  to  what we can actually do to give a boost  to  this

sector of the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, the difficulty is similar to what we face in

other  aspects  of the economy - that we are  faced  with

immense competition from other destinations that are  not

just only cheaper, but are probably more attractive.   In

the  three  areas of interest for your average  tourists,

ie,  sightseeing, shopping and dining, other places  have

caught  up  with us, and are probably outdoing  us.   The

challenge  for  us now is to find niches to differentiate

ourselves  from  others.   We  must  focus  on  a  unique

identity   and  offer  something  not  easily   available

elsewhere,  say, a product or a service, or an experience

that  the  tourists  can  only  get  here  in  Singapore,

otherwise why would they come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, we have made some dubious efforts, like

the  redoing  of Chinatown, resulting in what  I  call  a

"sanitised  version"  of  Chinatown.   Many  visitors   I

brought  there  are simply not impressed with  what  they

have  seen  because they said there are better Chinatowns

elsewhere.   But  let  us take a look  at  Little  India.

Luckily,  we  have not tried to remake Little  India  too

much.   It  is so naturally attractive, and that  is  why

many   visitors,  including  Singaporeans,  flock  there.

Sometimes you need a little of messiness to make a  place

attractive.   Maybe sometimes it is best to leave  things

alone.   So,  I would like to hear from the Minister  how

the Singapore Tourism Board is tackling this problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area I would like to highlight is the increasing

number  of visitors from China and India.  China  is  now

our third largest visitor generating market, with 670,000

visitors last year, up 35% from the previous year.   They

spent, on the average, $201 per visitor per day, that  is

the  third highest number amongst the spenders.  I  would

like  to  urge  the  Board to continue  to  step  up  its

promotion  to the Chinese market with activities  similar

to  the one that was recently done - the Tourism Carnival

in Guangzhou.  Sir, I was not able

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>



to  get  figures  of how many days the  Chinese  tourists

spend  in  Singapore, but I understand that it  could  be

less  than the average of 3.2 days.  This is because they

find  that Singapore is a bit too expensive for them  and

many  tour agents are using Singapore as a quick stopover

before whisking them off to nearby destinations.  This is

a  pity.   Hong Kong last year attracted over  4  million

visitors  from China.  That is about 34% of  their  total

number  of  visitors.  Many of these  are  high  spending

tourists,  buying  high  value items.   So  it  has  been

forecasted that in the year 2020 some 100 million Chinese

would be packing their bags and travelling abroad.   This

is a vast market that we have to tap.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem facing Chinese tourists is their

difficulty of navigating around in Singapore because  the

signs  we  put  up  are not in Chinese.   I  recall  that

sometime  ago  STB  was looking into the  possibility  of

multi-lingual signboards and preparing more brochures and

maps in different languages.  Can I know what progress we

have made?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, India is another promising market. Last year

we  had  340,000  visitors from India, each  spending  an

average  of $278 per day, making them the No. 1  spending

nationality.  I would like to know what plans we have  to

increase the number of visitors from this market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not have much to say on the Singapore

Zoological  Gardens  because events  have  overtaken  us,

except  to  say that many Singaporeans are relieved  that

they have backed down on the proposal to change the name.

They  wanted to spend something like $100,000  to  change

their  name and $400,000 for the signs.  That is  exactly

the  point  I was making last year.  It is not  just  the

money on changing a name.  You spend many more times that

amount just to effect the change.  Last year, I mentioned

about  the changes of organisations to names like A*Star,

SPRING  Singapore,  IE Singapore.   Today  I  still  have

difficulty  explaining to people  what  happened  to  our

Trade  Development Board.  When I tell them it is  called

IE, they look at me with some amazement.  I notice

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>



that  all  these organisations which have  changed  their

names, and also the zoo, are all under the same Ministry.

I  hope  that we do not change the name for the  sake  of

changing  the  name, because there is an  attraction  and

value to old names.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the private sector, for example, names like

Robinsons, Cold Storage, and as mentioned just now, Khong

Guan  Biscuits, these are all venerable names with value.

So I hope somebody does not wake up one day and take on a

flight  of  fancy  and  say that since  we  are  remaking

Singapore,  maybe  we  should  change  our  name  because

Singapore  sounds so 19th century.  I hope  the  Minister

will make sure that this does not happen.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, Mr Tan Soo Khoon

raised  two  important points about the  tourism  sector.

One  is  that the total tourism receipts have been  on  a

declining  trend  for  a number of  years  now,  and  the

average  number of days that they stay in  Singapore  has

also come down.  The situation has been made worse by the

Asian  financial  crisis, the global  economic  downturn,

September  11, then Bali, and so it is a whole series  of

knocks which the industry has suffered from.  But, we are

not doing badly, and the number of visitors has continued

to trend upwards to over 7 million tourists, which is not

bad  for a city-state of 4 million people.  The fact that

they  are  staying  fewer  days in  Singapore  is  partly

because we have become a very efficient switch.   So,  if

you are doing business here, you are exhibiting here, you

carve  up  your  time  finely.  You land,  SIA  flies  in

punctually, in so many minutes you are in town,  do  your

business, whatever, stay one night if necessary, if  not,

you are off.  So, in that sense, that cannot be helped.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, there are new opportunities arising principally

from  all  the developments around us, and the growth  of

the  middle-classes.  The Chinese are travelling in  huge

numbers  and this is just the beginning.  When I  was  in

Xian  two  years  ago, I asked them,  "How  many  foreign

tourists?"   They  said, "800,000".  I asked,  "How  many

Chinese  tourists?"  They said, "30 million."   All  over

China now, internal tourism is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>



rising spectacularly.  What we are seeing is just an over-spill from what is happening within China itself.  It  is

the same thing in India.  So we are working very hard  to

develop  the Chinese market.  It has been growing  double

digits.   We  expect it to reach 1 million  by  the  year

2005.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially they are mostly here on cheap tours. Some

are  on zero cost tours, which means they sign up for the

tour,  they pay nothing, but when they come in here  they

are  brought shopping.  They are milked at each  shopping

centre.  They do not see our museums and, before you know

it,  they are off to Malaysia, Thailand and then back  to

China.   They spend.  Many buy gold, not because gold  is

expensive  in China, but because they want to bring  back

souvenirs.  But that market is fast changing and  we  are

finding now more Chinese tourists coming in as individual

travellers and they are going for more diverse  products.

So  we have got to keep up with the changes and make sure

that  we  move with the higher value tourists.  So,  this

year, STB will be conducting major publicity campaigns in

both India and China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indian tourists are here mostly as individual

travellers.  They come with family members and relatives,

you  can  see them all over Singapore and they stay  here

much  longer.   And, per head, they spend more  than  any

other  category.  That is partly because they  stay  here

longer.   I  am  amazed, whenever  I  go  to  India,  how

favourably  they look at us.  And not only as a  shopping

emporium - yes, all of them have heard of Mustafa  -  but

it  is  no  longer  just Mustafa now.  So,  we  are  also

stepping  up  our  tourism efforts  in  India,  including

involving  some  of  their Bollywood stars,  and  we  are

trying  to  get Singapore more featured in  some  of  the

films produced in Bombay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there are many things that we should do, there

are  many  opportunities,  and I hope that in the  coming

years  we  will see many more Chinese and Indian tourists

coming  here  and they will give a strong  boost  to  our

tourism industry.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan mentioned that we should consider new and

more  interesting  products  because  shopping  is  down.

Shopping may be down generally, but we continue to be the

New  York  of  Southeast  Asia, as  far  as  shopping  is

concerned.   People  come here for  diversity.   When  we

speak  to  the  golfers, they say they can get  different

range   of   golf  clubs  in  Singapore.   One  Malaysian

Minister's  wife told me that she shopped  for  her  toys

along  Orchard Road.  I said, "Surely, you  can  get  the

same toys in Kuala Lumpur."  She said, "No, you have  got

more  range here."  So we are finding more such  flagship

stores relative to the rest of Southeast Asia and this is

how we are seeing the development of Orchard Road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we try to boost Chinatown. I do not think we

should  do  nothing.   We have  cleaned  it  up.   It  is

somewhat  sanitised now.  Recently, we opened a  Heritage

Museum.  It is not bad  -  old shophouses showing the old

`coolie keng', and it has received a good response.   The

other  things  that we are doing may take a while  longer

before we see everything come together.  But, we are  not

letting up on our efforts on Chinatown.  Little India can

be a little cleaner, but we should not over-sanitise it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other products we should consider and we

are  working on them.  For example, we take Jurong Island

for  granted.   But Jurong Island is a remarkable  place.

If  you  are  a student who studies chemistry or  organic

chemistry  in school, it is a fascinating site to  visit.

Right  now, of course, because of September 11  there  is

tight  security.  But we are working on tour buses  going

to  the Exhibition Centre on Jurong Island, and that  may

bring  in tourists from various countries, and really  it

is  one  of a few such sites, anywhere in the  world.   I

have  been to the site in Pernis, near Rotterdam, and  it

is  not  half as attractive as Jurong Island.  At  night,

when  we  see the lights, it is magical.  But, I  am  not

promoting  Jurong Island.  I would let STB do  it.   And,

even our NEWater plant, I told Lim Swee Say, "Look, I see

a  tourism opportunity there.  Let them try it and  maybe

sell some souvenir products - NEWater from Singapore.  We

may make some money along the way."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we found that visitors from Mainland China

were interested to experience staying in HDB estates.  We

will  convert a few blocks of HDB flats for them and make

some  money  in  the  process and gain some  reputational

benefit  for Singapore along the way.  So there are  many

things that we can do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months ago, I visited Orchidville up in

Mandai.   It  is  an orchid farm.  Our orchids  are  high

quality  orchids.   When they reach the Japanese  market,

they  fetch twice the price of orchids from Indonesia  or

Bangkok.   I  asked them why.  They said, "Well,  because

they are all the same length, all have the same number of

petals,  same number of buds, opened and unopened."   And

it  is  a high quality operation.  The owner, because  he

was  facing the pinch from the economic downturn, decided

to  open  his orchid farm to Japanese tourists.  So  they

come, they are happy to cut the orchids.  They do not cut

them  well, so he throws in a few of his own sprays, then

when they bring them back to Japan, those that are cut by

the tourists they do not perform so well.  Those that  he

put into the boxes they look better.  So everything looks

much  better, and in the process he makes more money  for

himself.   He  has  got  a little coffee-house  there,  a

restaurant and, in so doing, he bundles services into his

product and ups the value of his products.  So, to answer

Mr Tan Soo Khoon, there are many things that we can do to

make  tourism more lively in Singapore and to  gain  more

economic benefit out from it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the zoo, MTI was asked to take over

responsibility for the funding of the zoo only from  this

year.   I would not like to answer for some of the  ideas

that have been floated.  Maybe, next year I would.

<br>5.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Maybe I should remind the Minister

that there is a saying that says if you pay peanuts,  you

get  monkeys.   In  this case, if they  decide  to  spend

$100,000  or $400,000, it is no small peanuts,  and  they

will find that in the end,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>



if  they spend the money, they still end up with the same

old monkeys running around.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head S of the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, undoubtedly, structural unemployment is the

greatest manpower challenge today.  Workers at all levels

are  hit,  both blue-collar workers and executives.   The

way  to address the problem is clearly workers' training.

In this regard, I am glad that the DPM announced that the

Government  will  establish a statutory board  under  the

Ministry  of  Manpower  to enhance  the  development  and

promotion  of  continuing  education  and  training   for

adults.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although our economy is down and unemployment

is  high,  there  is  never a better  time  to  encourage

workers and Singaporeans to go for skills upgrading.   In

fact,  there  is  a window of opportunity  that  we  must

explore.   We  must use this slack period to enhance  our

capability and employability of our workers.   This  way,

we will be better prepared when the economy recovers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since last year, the Ministry has stepped up its

employment   assistance  programmes  in   various   ways.

Programmes   such  as  the  People-for-Jobs   Traineeship

Programme, Work Skills Training Programme and  the  Self-Employment Training Programme were implemented.  I  would

like to ask the Minister what has the feedback been on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>



these  programmes.  How many workers  were  helped?   And

what more the Ministry plans to do to help retrenched and

unemployed  workers, particularly for  this  round  where

both blue-collar workers and executives are affected?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, the Home page of

today's Straits Times really sums it all, as far as  jobs

are  concerned.  This will be another bad  year  for  the

jobless,  and firm recovery is expected only  next  year.

Fundamentally, the issue is really one of  poor  economic

growth.   The  economy is not growing  fast  enough,  and

therefore fewer jobs are created.  In fact, for every  28

job openings, there are 100 job seekers.  In other words,

for  every  one job, there are four workers chasing  that

one job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is easy for us to identify the reasons for

the  poor job growth.  But we have to think of the plight

of   those  who  remain  unemployed.   As  the  situation

worsens,  many  will get desperate and  this  will  cause

instability.  The signs that the situation will get worse

are  there.   Out  of a total of 89,900  people  who  are

unemployed,   23,900  or  27%  of  them   are   long-term

unemployment, meaning that they have been out of work for

at least six months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is cause for concern is that,

traditionally,  those  who  lost  their   jobs   in   the

manufacturing  sector  could find jobs  in  the  services

sector.  Over the last few years, for instance, for every

four workers who were retrenched, only one came from  the

services sector.  But last year, almost one out of  every

two  persons  who were retrenched were from the  services

sector. Even the services sector is not spared.   As  the

services  sector retrenches more people, the  profile  of

those   who  are  retrenched  has  also  changed.    More

professionals,  managers and executives have  lost  their

jobs  last year.  In fact, it comprises about 42% of  the

total of those who were retrenched.  And what is worrying

also is that those who were retrenched take a longer time

to find jobs, particularly the older workers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are larger numbers who are being

retrenched, but the indications are that there  are  less

jobs  being  created.  In fact, the EDB said that  20,900

jobs  will  be created over the next five years.  Out  of

these,  18,000 jobs will be created by sectors like  bio-medical  sciences,  chemicals, infocomms  and  the  media

sectors.  But if we look at the bio-medical cluster,  for

instance,  they employ only about 7,000 jobs.   So,  jobs

are  created  but the numbers are smaller and  these  are

also higher value added jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the questions that I would like to ask the

Minister  are  these.   What is  the  general  employment

outlook, where are the jobs being created, and what  kind

of  jobs are these?  Will there be enough jobs to  absorb

all the unemployed workers?  What about prospects for the

older and semi-skilled workers?  Are there jobs for them?

What is the manpower planning and projection for the next

three years?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the situation is not getting better - in

fact,  it sounds pretty grim  -  I would like to ask  the

Government  to revisit this issue of quotas  for  foreign

workers.   I know, sometimes, if we raise this issue,  it

is  almost heretical, and I think there will be a lot  of

unhappy employers.  But I would like to argue a case  for

us  to  revisit  the  quotas  for  foreign  workers.   My

argument, basically, is this.  The quotas were set  at  a

time  when  we had high economic growth, low unemployment

and,  therefore,  the situation was much more  different.

Structural unemployment was not a major issue.  But  now,

as  the situation worsens, we are expected to have slower

growth.  The long-term unemployment will increase between

3-5%,  and structural unemployment will be a major  issue

for  those  who  lost  their jobs.  There  will  be  jobs

created in Singapore.  Investments will come in but these

will  be high-value added and high-skilled jobs.   So,  I

think  it  is necessary that we revisit this issue,  even

though  we may not immediately change the quotas,  but  I

think  there is really a need to revisit and see what  we

need to do.  Because it does not really make sense for us

to continue to have large numbers of foreign workers when

Singaporeans themselves are unemployed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, at my MPS, a 75-year old lady came to

see  me  and  she  asked for a job as a cleaner.   I  was

rather  surprised because I thought she earned the  right

to retire at the age of 75.  But she told me that her son

had  lost  his job, and as he could not get another  job,

she  had  no source of income.  So, I think the situation

is  getting pretty desperate for some people,  and  I  do

urge  that  when  we look at statistics and  figures,  we

remember  there are faces, there are families, there  are

problems behind those statistics and figures, and that we

will really put in a lot more effort to ensure people get

work  and  remain employed.  As it is, my firm belief  is

that the greatest dignity that we can give to a person is

a job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I do hope for a response from the

Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How:</b> Sir, even as Singapore has to

grapple  with  the  challenges of an  uncertain  economic

landscape  and rising unemployment, it is also  important

for us to focus on the ingredients that will be important

for us in the future.  One of the key ingredients is that

of  training  and skills upgrading.  In this  context,  I

welcome   the  formation  of  an  agency  for  continuing

education and training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make four suggestions towards the

planning of the scope of work of this agency and also  to

make one request.  The suggestions are that in drawing up

its  scope  of work, that priority be placed,  first,  on

ways   to  further  promote  the  funding  of  individual

initiated training and skills upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, to find better ways to understand how adults

learn and, therefore, find better ways to help them learn

and develop different methodologies for that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, to find better ways to stimulate the demand

for  training,  both from companies and  individuals.   I

know  that,  over  the  years, the  number  of  companies

sending their workers for training, as well as the number

of  individuals who have taken up training on their  own,

have both increased.  However, there is a need to further

promote the demand.  It is always

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>



easier  to put in the money to create the infrastructure,

to  create  the  training places, but it is  always  more

challenging to overcome the different hurdles to get  the

demand up.  I think this is an area for closer study  and

stimulation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, in the area of job placement, job

counselling  as  a  capability is relatively  lacking  in

Singapore,  and this is the result of our many  years  of

more than full employment.  And it is different from  the

kind  of  social counselling that family service  centres

can  provide.  So, this is a capability that we  have  to

grow, and I urge the agency to put this as a priority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My request is in terms of the timeframe for setting

up  of this agency.  I understand that, currently, we are

looking  at 6-9 months from today.  I hope that it  could

be speeded up.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Sir, as many Members in this

House have noted, taking care of careers these days means

managing   perpetual  motion.   Promotion  of  continuing

education  and  training  of  Singapore  workers  as  the

economy restructures is a critical move by the Government

to  ensure  that  our workers keep up with  the  changing

needs of their jobs as organisations re-shape, shift  and

flex  themselves to fit our rapidly changing world.   Our

workers must understand that this is the only way for the

organisations  they work in to survive in  this  fiercely

competitive  environment.   They  must  therefore  expect

flexible  ways of working as duties are constantly  being

realigned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Deputy Chairman of the ITE, I make it a point to

keep track of the goings-on, and I am convinced that many

programmes  are in place to nurture CET.  At  ITE,  there

are  20,000 training places created for skills upgrading,

leading  to  Nitec  and higher Nitec courses.    Half  of

these   are   taken  up  by  Singaporeans  and  Singapore

permanent  residents.  There  are  an  additional  10,000

places for general education, leading to secondary,  'N',

'O'  and 'A' level qualifications, and 28,000 places  set

aside for the BEST and WISE programmes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between continuing training, ie, short skills

updating courses and train-the-trainer programmes,  there

are yet an additional 4,000 training places.  What I have

just  mentioned  does not include ITE accredited  courses

conducted by industry training partners, which contribute

a  whopping 113,000 additional training places.   I  know

that the ITE works closely with Government agencies, such

as  the EDB, IDA, SPRING Singapore and, more importantly,

with  the  advisory council on continuing  education  and

training  -  a tripartite body comprising representatives

from MOM, NTUC, SNEF, SCI and also private organisations,

to  identify  areas  of  manpower shortages  in  specific

industries and also assess the needs and demands for  new

certifiable  skills.  Sir, it is therefore  evident  that

ample   opportunities   exist  for   mature   and   young

Singaporeans to benefit from CET.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of all these tremendous efforts, I still

hear  frequent  rumblings in this House about  unemployed

Singaporeans grumbling about their inability to find jobs

after going for skills upgrading or learning a new skill.

There appears to be a disconnect here, Sir.  I would like

to  ask  the Minister for Manpower to consider  reviewing

the  current CET framework and, particularly,  to  ensure

that Singaporeans are learning and re-skilling themselves

in the areas demanded by employers and by the industries.

For  unemployed  Singaporeans, a centralised  CET  agency

should guide them and match them with skills which better

suit  their personality and learning abilities. All these

could  perhaps  be undertaken by the new statutory  board

under   MOM  which,  I  believe,  is  meant  to   address

employment issues and training of workers.  Many millions

of  dollars  are  being poured into  CET,  which  is  the

appropriate   thing   to   do  to   overcome   structural

unemployment,  but I see the effort as being  ineffective

if unemployed Singaporeans still cannot get jobs.

<br>6.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, I would like to congratulate

MOM for the setup of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>



CET  Board  that  will  ensure  continuous  training  and

education for employees to enhance their employability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I refer to Chapter 13 of the recommendations in

the ERC Report.  I have six issues which I would like  to

raise  and  which I hope MOM will take into consideration

when  planning the agency.  Issue 1, is on the  scope  of

coverage, as defined in the write-up.  The whole write-up

refers to workers, leaving out the entire segment of  our

workforce  that  constitutes PMEs.  This segment  of  the

workforce  is  growing and is anticipated  to  constitute

about 60% of the workforce in the near future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the critically important role played

by   this   workforce   segment   in   our   increasingly

sophisticated knowledge-based economy, would it not  make

better sense to reflect their importance in the write-up?

I  would  like to propose that the write-up take  a  more

global tone to reflect the PMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue 2 will be on the programmes drawn up for PMEs.

What  types  of programmes will be in place  in  the  new

agency  that  will be suitable and be made  available  to

PMEs?   How  will the training needs analysis be  carried

out  for  in-service employees and economically  inactive

PMEs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the third issue, can MOM clarify the specific

differences between the statutory board on CET  and  CAL?

To the public, there appears to be no distinction.  Also,

how  would  these two entities relate to SPRING Singapore

and PSB Corp?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth issue, the Government has often been

told  that  it must give space to the small timers  among

the  SMEs  a chance to grow and flourish and not  compete

with  them  unnecessarily.  How would the activities  and

functions  which  the  CET and CAL seek  to  provide,  as

outlined  in  Chapter  13, impact  the  various  economic

entities,   presently  providing  similar  services   and

functions?   How can the small consultancy  and  training

providers survive with increased competition?   If  there

are benefits arising from the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>

intervention from MOM, we must take care that  we  manage

the  small timers well.  Otherwise, we would be repeating

the  experience of the small provision shop and the super

stores.   Lessons  of  the past can be  applied  in  this

instance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On issue 5, the Government has been told far too

often  that it must shed its nanny image.  Will  not  the

setup  of  the CET and CAL, even with the best intentions

to   facilitate  the  market  and  industry,  signal  the

paternalistic attitude of the Government which many  fear

may be misplaced in this particular area at this time?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, with unemployment hovering between 4%

and  5%,  many Singaporeans have been urged  to  consider

entrepreneurship and self-employment as an option.   Will

not  the  setup of these two entities steal away some  of

their chances?

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, continuing

education and training is a new name in this new economy.

In  the  old  economy,  we call this  lifelong  learning.

Thus,  continuing education and learning  is  not  a  new

concept, but the Government's determination is new and it

is news.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The labour movement has been talking about this

concept  of  continuing education and training  for  many

years,  and  lately,  lifelong  learning  has  become   a

festival - Lifelong Learning Festival.  In fact, in  many

of  the  stories we read during our childhood  days,  our

ancestors  were  talking  about  how  to  keep  ourselves

relevant to the time and to the organisation, and have an

advantage over our competitors or rivals through lifelong

learning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point of time, most Singaporeans, except the

bo  chap  group,  know the importance  of  CET  and  many

retrenched workers, including the PMEs, regret very  much

that they do not have the relevant skills to take on  the

new  jobs  available.   Other workers,  who  fear  to  be

retrenched, hope that they can reskill themselves as soon

as  possible.  Thus, the annoucement of the CET statutory

board

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>



is hope to many.  However, I would caution that we should

be  pragmatic  and  realistic and set  our  priority  and

target  right.  The main objectives of the CET should  be

to re-skill Singaporeans for both the new jobs in the New

Economy  or  traditional jobs which Singaporeans  in  the

past  were  doing, but not doing now, and more  and  more

foreign workers are doing them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, priority should be given to the industries

which  are vulnerable to the New Economy so that  workers

in these industries, as a group, can learn the new skills

together.   Next  in line should be the companies  facing

relocation  possibilities.  We should aim at  individuals

who  will be in and out of employment in the New Economy.

The  CET  statutory board shall learn  from  our  Nanyang

Polytechnic  which  caters  to  the  needs  of  the   new

investments  coming to Singapore by working closely  with

the  industries.   In  the case of CET,  it  should  work

closely with not only the industries which are coming but

also  industries going out from Singapore so that we  can

prepare our workers well in advance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the challenge to CET board is in fact to come

out with creative marking strategies to excite workers to

enrol   themselves  for  this  continuing  learning   and

training.  MOM may want to learn from McDonalds again  on

how  it can create the herd mentality that even those who

claim  that  they had no time, no money, or the  bo  chap

group, also queued up for the 'Hello Kitty'.  I hope that

we have a long queue for 'Hello Teacher'.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to applaud the Government for deciding

to  establish a Continuing Education and Training agency.

This  agency  will  help to further focus  and  intensify

efforts  to ensure that our workers are well-skilled  and

remain employable.  I like to share some thoughts on this

agency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the agency can play a very important role in

identifying industries and companies with ready vacancies

for  those  who go for training. It must have  a  network

with the employers to identify

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>



which  are  the job openings in the future so  that  when

they  go  for  training, they will come  out  and  become

employable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should put in enough resources into

training   teachers   of  adult  learners   and   develop

appropriate teaching methodologies.  So the CET  trainers

should   also   be  well-trained  in  psychological   and

pedagogical principles for the teaching of adults.   They

should be equipped with such skills to enthuse workers to

learn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the CET agency should also encourage

training  providers  to  draw  up  curriculum   that   is

appropriate for adult learners, rather than use the  same

curriculum  for  fresh  school leavers.   Otherwise,  the

training would not be meaningful.  I think this programme

should be more flexible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we should also encourage those existing

training  providers  to  provide  a  greater  choice  and

flexibility  for adult learners.  For example,  we  could

have  e-learning and a similar kind of training  to  suit

the convenience  of the would-be learners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, I think the CET agency can also play a role

in  modifying the attitude and behaviour of the  workers.

Workers must be trained to have a "can do" mindset.  They

must be determined, innovative and enterprising.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, the agency will have to look into the

motivators  and demotivators for continuing education  to

thrive  amongst  our  people.  One method  would  be  the

promotion  of a pro-learning environment and  culture  at

workplaces.   The  agency  must  also  work  on  how   to

influence  the mindset of  not only the workers  but  the

employers as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, there are so many continuing education

courses,  ranging  from  short  courses  to  certficates,

diplomas   and  degrees.   But  the  quality   of   these

programmes varies - some are good and some are  obviously

a waste of time and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>



money.   At the same time, the diplomas obtained  by  the

students  upon  completion of their  course  may  not  be

recognised  by  the market.  So, with this  proposed  CET

agency, we would be able to provide some guidance to  the

would-be  learners  so  that they  can  make  enlightened

decisions  when  they take up degree or  diploma  courses

offered  by  the non-Government institutions.   They  can

decide whether this degree or diploma would be of use  to

them  or not. Otherwise, they will be wasting a few  tens

of  thousands of dollars and, in the end, the diploma  or

degree  is  not recognised by anybody and they could  not

find a job with it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the new agency should also provide

courses   which   can  serve  as  alternatives   to   the

correspondence  courses  and  distance-learning   courses

which many of our students are pursuing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this proposed CET agency can be forward-looking

and  act according to the needs of the market, I am  sure

it  will go a long way in helping to enhance the standard

of  training of our learners and to lead our  workers  to

achieving a better standard of living.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, the announcement that a new

statutory  board is being formed for continuing education

and  training  has  rasied a lot of  expectations.   Many

people expect the statutory board to fill up all the gaps

that  are currently found in our training programmes  and

job  assistance plans.  I hope the statutory  board  will

live   up  to  this  expectation.   It  is  an  important

development and we should give it a chance to take  root.

To  me,  it  is an important milestone in our efforts  to

develop human capital.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a key challenge for this statutory board will

be  to help people to remain employable.  If jobs are  no

longer  guaranteed,  then it is important  that  we  help

people  to acquire the means to remain employed.   If  we

want  labour  market  flexibility and workers'  mobility,

then  we  must  have a system in place  to  help  workers

acquire  skills, competence and the frame  of  mind  that

will prepare them

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>



for change and help them remain continuously employed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, Sir, adjustment process will be chaotic,

painful  and will cause social disruption.  The CET  must

help  workers to develop wings so that they can  navigate

through  the  rough wind of adjustments that  is  blowing

through  our  economy.  It must also act as a  contractor

between workers and jobs as displacement will become more

common.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the CET is a move in the right

direction and will strengthen our social safety net.   As

I  had  argued  on  the first day of the  debate,  as  we

examine  how to make our labour market more flexible,  we

must  also  continue to ensure that our  existing  social

protection system is adequate and move in tandem with the

other changes in the labour market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this new statutory board will provide greater

focus  and  coordination  for  worker  training  and  job

assistance.  Job assistance, for instance, had  developed

more  as  an  ad hoc programme as a result of  the  Asian

financial crisis.  It is obvious now that we need a  more

permanent  structure  in view of the changed  environment

and the problem of structural unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important that the courses the people go

through remain relevant and useful.  There is also a need

to  make sure that those who have undergone training have

jobs.   So there must be a link between training and  job

placement, otherwise people will get quite disillusioned.

For  this,  employers  must also  play  their  part,  not

participate in programmes, just because they feel obliged

to, but actually are not too committed to the programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received some complaints from retrenched

workers who are placed on the People for Jobs Traineeship

Programme, for instance, that employers are reluctant  to

employ  them  after the training period  is  over.   Such

examples  will discourage people from taking up  training

courses and act as a disincentive.  I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>



hope  that  the  Ministry will continue  to  monitor  the

situation closely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will not repeat the points which have been

raised  or  mentioned by my colleagues, the other  labour

MPs.  But I have a few points to make with regard to  the

work  of the CET.  First, is the point about drivers.   I

think all training programmes need drivers.  So having  a

statutory board and parking the training programmes under

the  board  itself,  I do not think that  alone  will  be

effective.   So  I think it is necessary that  the  board

continues  to  have drivers to drive individual  training

programmes  similar to the schemes which we already  have

right now.

<br>6.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would also like to find out what will

happen  to  the  various  training  programmes  that  are

currently  run  by  the various non-Government  agencies,

such  as  NTUC and the self-help groups.  Will all  these

now  come  under the new statutory board?  Perhaps,  this

may be a premature question, because the board has yet to

be  formed,  but these are some of the issues  the  board

ought to look into when it is formed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I want to stress on the need for continued

strong  partnership of labour, Government and  employers,

and  the community on the various areas to be covered  by

the CET.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, I also feel that there is a need for the

board  to  remain focused and to help those who are  most

vulnerable  and  at risk, such as older and  less-skilled

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also feel, Sir, that there is a need for better

outreach  programmes, as anecdotal evidence, particularly

in  the  Malay  community, seems to  suggest  that  those

coming  for  training are generally those who are  better

educated, and also those who have better skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite all our efforts, there will always be a

group that will be untrainable, for whatever reasons.   I

would like also to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>



find out what will be the CET's approach to this group of

people, how it proposes to help them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another group of people that I hope the CET

will  address will be self-employed Singaporeans  who  do

not  have  access to training funds.  I urge the  CET  to

look also at how to allow them to gain access to training

funds, as I feel that this number will grow as our ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Halimah Yacob, can you sum up

now?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Yes, Sir. I am ending my

speech.   ---  employment structure changes  and  as  the

economy restructures.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong):</b> Sir, in the course

of the proceedings over the last few days, two words kept

appearing in the debates.  The two words are "change" and

"fast".   In this modern society, everything is  changing

much  faster  -  in school, at work, in business  and  in

life.   How fast does the Government change in  terms  of

policies  and strategies?  How fast do businesses  change

or  improve  their products and services?   How  fast  do

workers  change  in terms of skills and attitudes  to  be

able  to meet the challenges in the face of fierce global

competition?  How do we respond to such changes in  terms

of manpower policy?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this fast-paced society, today's jobs may be gone

tomorrow.  We have to be fast to plan, respond  and  take

action.   Sir,  I think it is important that  our  people

should  be fast enough to be aware of and understand  the

changes in the job market.  I would therefore like to ask

the  Minister how does the MOM plan, in terms  of  demand

and  supply  in the labour market?  How far ahead  do  we

plan  for, and how often do we review our policies?   The

reason  I  ask  this is that a few years  ago,  when  the

Jurong   Island  was  set  up,  we  had  a  shortage   of

technicians and engineers for the petrochemical industry.

And, now, the bio-sciences industry is the in-thing.  Do

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>



we have enough qualified workforce to meet the demand?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The percentage of our labour force in the

manufacturing sector dropped from 27.5% in 1992 to  18.2%

in  2002.  In the same period, the community and personal

services  sector percentage rose from 21.5%  in  1992  to

25.7%  in  2002.  For the financial and business services

sector, the percentage rose from 10.9% to 17.1%.  It will

be  useful  for the public to know what are the  manpower

needs in each industry, where are the existing jobs,  and

which  are  the  growing sectors.  Such information  will

help  them  in  making appropriate lifelong learning  and

career decisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does the newly proposed Continuing Education and

Training  (CET) statutory board plan to train our  people

for  employment?  Among our retrenched workers, the  most

affected  groups are production and transport  operators,

cleaners  and labourers, and professionals, managers  and

executives,    which   represent   34.4%    and    42.5%,

respectively.  I would also like to suggest that the  CET

should place more emphasis on training these two groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CET statutory board should also adopt a holistic

approach  in carrying out its training.  It is  not  easy

for  a  retrenched person who has worked in a job for  30

years  to change to another job immediately.  It takes  a

lot of courage, mindset change, determination and support

from family, friends and society.  Therefore, one of  the

important areas is career counselling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area is generic employability skills

training.  I would like to suggest that the CET statutory

board   develop   comprehensive  and  flexible   training

programmes  for  our workers, especially  those  who  are

changing jobs from manufacturing to the service industry.

This includes basic IT skills, customer service attitudes

and grooming.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area is in bringing training closer to the

people.   There  are  many ways of  conducting  training.

Besides the normal

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>



classroom  training  and training through  Internet,  the

classes  can also be conducted at the community  centres,

libraries, etc, or training facilities can be set  up  in

shopping  malls,  such  as Ngee Ann  City,  IMM  and  big

shopping  centres.  For trainees in the service industry,

they  can observe what is good customer service and  what

is not.  It will be even better if the training providers

can  link up with the shops to provide hands-on training.

This will make training more interesting and fun.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore is encouraging entrepreneurship, there

is  a  Self-Employment Training (SET) Programme  to  help

those  who  wish  to set up business.  MOM,  Chambers  of

Commerce, business and professional associations and  the

Singapore  National Employers Federation can  set  up  an

"Enterprise Circle" ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mrs Yu-Foo, can you sum up, please?

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon:</b> Yes, I am trying to finish,

Sir.   --- to try to match those who are retrenched  with

those who have capital, to create joint ventures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to urge the Minister to raise

the cap for tax relief from $2,500 to $5,000.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, one in three of the

unemployed could not find a job for at least six  months.

The  danger  is that the longer they are left  without  a

job,  the  harder  it is for them to get  back  into  the

workforce.   And we know that the problem is particularly

acute  for workers above 50.  I note in the latest labour

market report by the Ministry of Manpower that more  than

half  of the retrenched aged 50 and above could not  find

re-employment within six months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sending them for more training will not solve the

problem.  Some have gone for retraining and still  cannot

find jobs and, as Mdm Halimah Yacob has noted, even those

who  have  signed up for the People for Jobs  Traineeship

Programme,  some of them also find that  they  could  not

find jobs.  If this sentiment is allowed to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>



spread,  a  sense of hopelessness will set  in,  and  the

jobless  will see training as a waste of their  time  and

effort,  and  they will become increasingly  disenchanted

with this Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if there can be a promise or a guarantee of

a  job  at  the end of a training programme, it would  be

more  useful.   The  Ministry of  Manpower  has  all  the

information of where the job vacancies are, it knows what

sort  of  training is needed for these jobs, it  has  the

information on the unemployed looking for jobs, it  knows

who  among the jobless have not found jobs for  at  least

six  months.  The Ministry of Manpower should give urgent

priority  to this group.  They are more desperate  for  a

job and, hence, should have more realistic expectations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge MOM to tailor a package deal for such

jobless workers, ie, training, with a guarantee of a  job

at the end of it.  It is not such a radical idea, because

I  was  surfing the Internet and I found that  there  are

some  private companies abroad who offer such a  training

programme.   You sign up for this training programme,  if

you do not get a job or if I do not help you to get a job

within  120 days, your money back.  So, I think we  could

get  the  jobless  to  pay a certain  amount,  go  for  a

training  programme, we help him to find a  job  and,  if

not, money back.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for this, MOM needs to tie up with employers who

have  job  vacancies.   Start with that,  and  then  work

downwards,  ie, what sort of training is needed  and  who

can  be  slotted into these programmes.  I think MOM  can

also  start  looking around at companies with  a  lot  of

foreign  workers, and persuade these companies  to  leave

these  jobs for Singaporeans instead, and that they  will

train a pool of Singaporeans for these jobs.  Right  now,

the standard approach is that you train first and then we

try  to place them into jobs later.  To be effective,  it

should  be  turned the other way around, ie, place  first

and train later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For employers, it will mean cost savings, because

they  do not have to put up job advertisements, and  they

will have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>



a pool of workers all trained for the jobs.  For workers,

it  will  mean  some certainty that, after the  training,

they  will  have  jobs  to  look  forward  to.   For  the

Government, it will mean reducing the unemployment  rate,

especially  structural unemployment,  and  keeping  faith

with our jobless people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, lifelong

learning and adult education is not new to Singapore.  In

fact,  many years ago, we had the Adult Education  Board,

ie,  Lembaga  Pelajaran Dewasa, and we  are  coming  full

circle  mainly because in the good days I remember trying

to  encourage the older workers to take up retraining and

there was this reluctance because the job was secure  and

they  found  that  they  preferred  leisure  instead   of

spending time learning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the point is that the Government can only do

that  much  if  the  workers  do  not  exercise  personal

responsibility.  The success of training is really in the

attitude  and  values  of the individuals,  and  this  is

something  that  the individuals must  really  think  for

themselves,   that  the  Government   can   provide   the

facilities,  but  they must want to  learn  and  to  take

advantage of all the facilities provided.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On coverage of the target groups, I support Mdm Ho

Geok  Choo's point that in the knowledge economy,  it  is

really  beyond  the skilled workers, ie, the  technicians

and  even  the middle management personnel who  need  the

training.   My  concern  with  regard  to  such  learning

institutions  provided  by the Continuing  Education  and

Training statutory board is how do we de-stigmatise these

learners wanting to go for training, because we certainly

do  not want it to be perceived as an institute for drop-outs, but really to encourage these people that there  is

something valuable that they can benefit from.  Unless we

make sure that this is an incentive and is of benefit  to

them, people may actually veer away from taking advantage

of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is obviously the operations of

learning.  The suggestion is that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>



the  Government  would want to outsource and  get  third-party involvement, such as professional bodies, employers

and  whatever  organisations that  have  an  interest  in

providing this facility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point, Sir, is that the Government is in a

good  position, because it has all the data,  information

and the network, and I hope that through the services  of

the  CET  statutory board, more employment  opportunities

would  be  created and there would be a better  match  of

individuals and jobs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ahmad Magad, you have two minutes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Yes, Sir. We all know that

much  has  been done to send the message to our workforce

on the importance of lifelong learning.  Not only has the

Ministry of Manpower reinforced this message from time to

time,  the NTUC and many employer organisations, such  as

SNEF and the Singapore Human Resource Institute, and also

responsible  employers, have done their part  to  further

propagate  the  message.  However, I strongly  feel  that

there  is  still  a  segment of our  workers  who  remain

oblivious  to  this message.  We need to work  harder  to

reach out to this group, if we are intent on reducing the

impact of structural unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's world takes no pity on the individual who

gets lazy about learning.  The choice is to take personal

responsibility  for continuing one's  education  or  risk

ending  up  without the knowledge and  skills  needed  to

protect  one's career.  Our workers must know that  "LLL"

is  the only way to remain competitive in the job market.

They  must  understand the need to invest  in  their  own

growth, development and self-renewal, just like the way a

company invests in research and development and comes  up

with  new and better products or services they can offer.

Their  future  employability,  their  appeal  as  a   job

candidate  will depend on them having a relentless  drive

to  update their credentials and keep abreast of what  is

happening in their field.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to consider

stepping  up  the  initiatives  to  further  spread   the

lifelong learning message, and particularly reach out  to

the segment which seems to ignore or may somehow have not

received  this  message.  Just like the crime  prevention

message  is  effectively driven home through posters  and

exhibits  displayed at grassroots functions, the Ministry

of  Manpower could perhaps consider a similar approach to

drive  home  this message, which is important  to  ensure

that  our  workforce  keeps up with changing  trends  and

business  needs,  and  remains  relevant  in  this   fast

changing world.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is 6.30 pm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon, Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the House.

financial year 2003/2004, and ask leave to sit  again  on
