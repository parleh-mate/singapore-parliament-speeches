provide sewerage facilities to the densely populated

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

there  is no immediate scheme to construct public  sewers

in  the  Upper  Serangoon Constituency, as other  schemes

have  been  given higher priority. In the next  Five-Year

Development  Plan 1966-70, there is a scheme  to  provide

for  the  sewer  mains, which now come  up  only  to  the

junction  of  Bartley and Braddell Roads, to be  extended

towards the Braddell Road and Upper Serangoon area.  When

extended,  it will be possible for the densely  populated

suburb  of  Upper  Serangoon to be served  with  sewerage

facilities.

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL REGISTRATION ACT</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Labour)</b></div>



<br><br>2.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, over the last few

days  after the introduction of the National Registration

Bill  in  Parliament on the 13th of December, 1965,  much

public concern has been expressed by the Backbenchers and

through  the  Press  over  a provision  in  the  National

Registration  Act  -  that an unnamed  birth  certificate

supported   by   a   statutory  declaration   shall   not

necessarily  be  sufficient evidence for the  purpose  of

establishing Singapore citizenship by birth. The Registry

of  Persons  has been besieged with inquiries as  regards

the  citizenship status of persons holding unnamed  birth

certificates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government wishes to make it clear that this

provision in the Act is designed to debar people who were

actually  not born in Singapore but who claim birth  here

by  using  unnamed  birth certificates not  belonging  to

them. The Government appreciates the fact that there  are

many  people  who were born in Singapore but whose  names

had  not been entered on their birth certificates  either

through  the  ignorance of their parents or  through  the

tardiness  of  the colonial registration authorities.  As

far  as  those  who were, in fact, born in Singapore  and

holding  unnamed birth certificates are concerned,  there

need be no worry over this provision in the Act.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to announce the Government's policy which

is  that  a person who holds an unnamed birth certificate

and  has  a  Singapore identity card issued  in  1949  or

earlier, stating that his place of birth is Singapore, is

presumed  to be a Singapore citizen by birth.  There  is,

therefore, no cause for anxiety by persons whose identity

cards  issued  in 1949 or earlier stated that  they  were

born  in Singapore. They need not rush to the Citizenship

Registry to have their citizenship status verified.  They

can  apply  for the new plastic laminated identity  cards

when their turn comes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those of 12 years of age in 1949 must have taken

identity  cards  as required by the law  then.  In  other

words, all those now over 28 years, i.e. 12 years at 1949

plus  16 years, that is 16 years since 1949 to 1965, have

their  proof  in their identity cards. There are  persons

born  in Singapore who attained the age of 12 after 1949.

In  such cases their birth certificates, whether named or

unnamed,  have an endorsement on them by the Registry  of

Persons  when  they obtained their identity  cards.  This

endorsement  shows  their present identity  card  number.

When   such  persons  produce  their  birth  certificates

together  with  their  present  identity  cards  for

re-registration, they will be accepted as Singapore citizens

by  birth  and will be given a Singapore citizen  plastic

laminated identity card. Further, any person who holds an

unnamed  birth  certificate  together  with  a  statutory

declaration  made by one of his parents can always  prove

his  Singapore  citizenship by birth by other  supporting

documents such as:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) birth certificates of his brothers and sisters, or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) birth certificates of his children, or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) school leaving certificate, or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) vaccination notice or certificate, or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) baptismal certificate,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which my Ministry will accept as sufficient evidence to

establish status as a Singapore citizen by birth.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A citizen plastic laminated identity card in future will,

be  a very important document for a person to possess. In

fact,  the Government has taken measures to see that  the

new  plastic  laminated identity card  is  forgery-proof,

tamper-proof  and  water-proof. With a  citizen  identity

card,  a  holder will have all the rights and  privileges

conferred  on  a  citizen of Singapore. It  will  be  his

passport  to  social  amenities like education,  housing,

health, employment, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement should clarify the position and allay

the doubts of those who were born in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If Members are in any doubt, they may ask

the Minister any question arising from that statement.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the Minister in one part of his statement mentioned

people  without  names in their birth  certificates.  The

parents   may   have  taken  out  statutory  declarations

regarding  such  persons and those will  be  accepted  as

proof.  But there are instances where parents of  certain

children  give away their children in adoption. Sometimes

the adoption certificates are in order and sometimes they

are  not.  Sometimes the natural parents of the  children

may  unfortunately be dead. Now, these  children  may  be

about 17 or 18 years old. Therefore, their guardian ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have indicated to the House that

Members may ask questions on the statement, but not  make

a  speech.  If  the  Member will come  to  his  question?

Perhaps he is coming to his question!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): My question is this, Mr Speaker,

Sir. Those children who have not been given away properly

in  adoption, if their natural parents are deceased,  can

their  guardians, who are looking after them now,  submit

statutory declarations in order to get these accepted  as

valid proof of birth?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have explained

earlier  that  the birth certificates of those  who  were

born after 1949 - whether named or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>



unnamed  -  will be endorsed by the Registry  of  Persons

when   they   apply  for  identity  cards.  These   birth

certificates will be accepted as proof of citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> The

Member's question is if the child was born before 1949.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Well, if he was born before 1949. I

think  the  legal  parent should be  allowed  to  give  a

statutory declaration on that.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE TELEPHONE BOARD</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker,  I  beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Singapore Telephone Board

Ordinance.   In   consequence  of  the  independence   of

Singapore  and its ceasing to be a part of Malaysia,  the

powers  of  the Federal Minister are transferred  to  the

Singapore Minister under this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for an increase in the number of

members  of the Telephone Board, other than the  Chairman

and  the Deputy Chairman, from three persons to five.  It

is  considered that the business of the Board warrants an

enlarged membership and this will enable more persons  to

participate in the activities of statutory bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limit of six per cent interest on stocks and shares

issued  by the Board has been removed, and the  Board  is

now  given discretion to pay such rate of interest as the

state of the undertakings



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



and  the  financial  position of the Board  warrants.  Of

course, it is the hope of the Government that this clause

will  enable  the Board to pay a rate of interest  higher

than six per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to put back in the

Ordinance the general power to the Board to acquire land.

This  provision  was deleted from the  Ordinance  by  the

Modification  of Laws Telecommunications  (Extension  and

Modification)  Order,  1964, dated  9th  December,  1964,

because  a  substantially similar  provision  existed  in

Chapter  4  of  Part  VI of the Federal  Constitution  to

enable the Board to acquire land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of other consequential amendments in

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, this Bill provides that powers be

taken from the Federal Minister concerning the activities

of  the  Telephone  Board. Before  Malaysia,  a  workers'

representative  was  a member of the Singapore  Telephone

Board.  When  Singapore became part of Malaysia  and  the

powers  transferred  to the Malaysian  Telecommunications

Minister, the workers' representative did not sit on  the

Board.  I  would  like  to know  from  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister  whether workers' representatives  or  Telephone

Board employees will now be allowed to be members of  the

Telephone Board in order to look after the welfare of the

workers and to ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order; whether as an employee of the

Board,  or  a member of the Board. If the latter  is  the

question,  he  is  in  order; but if  he  is  talking  of

something else, then he is not in order on this  Bill  on

the Second Reading.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): What I mean, Mr Speaker,

its  workers' representatives sit on the Telephone Board.

In the past, Mr Speaker, a workers' representative was a

member  of the Board. When this Bill becomes law and  the

powers are reverted to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>



Deputy   Prime   Minister,  will  he   appoint   workers'

representatives to sit on the Singapore Telephone  Board,

as  this is necessary to look after the interests of  the

workers   and  continue  the  good  relationship  between

employer and employee?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I will bear in mind

what  the  Member for Kampong Kembangan  has  said  about

appointing  a  workers' representative on  the  Singapore

Telephone Board. In fact, in the past it was my  practice

to see that there was a member from one of the unions, or

at  least somebody who was a worker who was also a member

of  the  Board.  In fact, this Bill by providing  for  an

increase in the membership of the Board will enable me to

so appoint.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Dr Toh Chin Chye].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir, I beg

to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23rd December this year I introduced the Army Bill

which provides for the establishment of a full-time armed

force  for  the State of Singapore. I then mentioned  the

additional need to have a part-time fighting force  which

would be an essential part of our Armed Forces. This Bill

provides  for  the  establishment and  maintenance  of  a

volunteer  force  to  be known as the  "People's  Defence

Force".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are a small nation and our financial resources

are  limited.  We therefore cannot afford  to  raise  and

maintain large defence forces on a permanent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>



basis. The regular army will have to be complemented by a

volunteer force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Defence Force will call upon our young men

and  women  to  serve their country and undergo  military

training without seriously interfering with their  normal

lives.  The  training they receive will not only  prepare

them  for the part that they will take beside our regular

Army but also provide them with the necessary disciplines

and skills required in the task of nation-building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to come now to the specific provisions of the

Bill. Part II provides for the raising and maintenance of

the  People's  Defence Force. The Force will  be  divided

into   corps,   regiments,  services   and   departments.

Provision   is   also   made  for  the   disbandment   or

amalgamation  of one or more such units.  The  enlistment

into  the Force is open to Singapore citizens of 18 years

of  age and above who are medically fit. Boys between the

ages  of 14 and 17 years may be enlisted as drummer  boys

and  band  boys in the Force. With regard to  discipline,

the  provisions of Parts IV, VII and VIII of the Army Act

will  apply  to  members of the People's  Defence  Force.

Provision  is also made in Part II of this Bill  for  the

President to commission officers of the Force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III deals with Colour Training Service of members

of the Force. No member of the Force shall be required to

attend  at  weekly parades for a total of  more  than  20

hours  in  one month or at continuous training  for  more

than  16 days in any one year. Every member of the  Force

shall be required to perform Colour Training for a period

of  three  years.  The Bill also includes  provision  for

members of the Force performing Colour Training and their

dependants  to  be  entitled  to  receive  pensions   and

gratuities  in respect of injury or death resulting  from

such  Colour  Training Service. A  member  of  the  Force

performing  Colour Training Service may be released  from

the  Force  on  his giving three months'  notice  of  his

desire  to  do so. Certain offences are provided  for  in

clause 25 to which a member of the Force is subject  when

he  is  not  attached to any unit of the Singapore  Armed

Forces.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the Bill provides for a Reserve composed of

Volunteers  and  National Servicemen.  The  President  is

empowered  to recall by Proclamation all or any  part  of

the  Reserve  to  Colour Training Service  at  any  time.

Members  of  the  Reserve  may  also  be  called  up  for

mobilised  service.  Service  in  the  Reserve  shall  be

limited to a minimum period of seven years after which  a

person can resign on giving three months' notice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Part V, the President is empowered to call out

all  or  any  part  of  the Force for mobilised  service.

Members  of  the  Force who are called up  for  mobilised

service  and  their dependants are eligible for  pensions

and  gratuities for injury or death resulting  from  such

service.  Members of the Force, when mobilised,  will  be

subject to the provisions of the Army Act with regard  to

discipline.  During  a state of war,  the  President  may

direct  that members of the Force may be attached to  the

Singapore  Armed  Forces  or  the  armed  forces  of  any

Commonwealth country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI of the Bill provides for a University Training

Corps and a Cadet Corps, and any such Corps may, with the

concurrence  of  the  President,  be  attached   to   the

Singapore  Armed  Forces. The President is  empowered  to

commission members of the University Training  Corps  and

of   the   Cadet  Corps.  Clause  60  provides  for   the

establishment  of the "People's Defence Force  Benevolent

Fund"  which,  as the name implies, will be  administered

for  the  benefit  of members of the Force  by  a  person

appointed by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has been under consideration for a long time

and  its provisions have been considered in detail by the

Muslim  Advisory Board and copies of the Bill  have  been

sent  to  a  number  of Muslim bodies in  Singapore.  The

comments which have been received on its provisions  have

been  considered  by the Muslim Advisory  Board  and  the

present  draft  incorporates the suggestions  which  have

been considered reasonable and in keeping with the scheme

and purpose of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill in the main follows the legislation in the

States  of Malaya, which have tended to follow the  model

set  by  the  Administration of Muslim Law  Enactment  of

Selangor  in  1952. The Bill, however,  incorporates  the

provisions which were designed to control the exercise of

the right of divorce and the permission of polygamy which

were first introduced in Singapore, and which have, I  am

happy to say, been followed in recent legislation in  the

States of Malaya, notably in Selangor, Negri Sembilan and

Perlis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II of the Bill constitutes a Majlis Ugama Islam or

a  Council of Muslim Religion to advise the President  in

matters  relating  to  the Muslim religion.  The  Majlis,

unlike  the  present  Muslim Advisory  Board,  will  have

certain executive powers in issuing rulings on Muslim law

and the administration of Muslim Charities and will be  a

corporation, with power to hold property and to  sue  and

be sued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III of the Bill in the main reenacts the

provisions of the Muslims Ordinance, 1957. It  is  sought

to  give  power to the Shariah Court to deal  with  cases

where  the parties were married under the Muslim law  but

where  one  or  both  of the parties have  ceased  to  be

Muslims (clause 35). At present there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>



is  no  provision whereby a party to such a marriage  can

obtain  a divorce, for example, as the Shariah Court  has

only  jurisdiction  in cases where all  the  parties  are

Muslims  and  the High Court has no jurisdiction  in  the

case  of  Muslim marriages. It is expressly provided,  to

remove all doubts, that the Shariah Court will apply  the

Muslim law, as varied by Malay custom, that is, clause 35

(2) .  Provision is made for representation by  authorised

agents  (clause  38) and for reciprocal arrangements  for

the  service  of  summonses in  the  States  of  Malaysia

(clause 41). Clauses 47 to 49 of the Bill clarify the law

relating to applications for divorce by a married  woman,

and  clause  49 sets out the grounds on which  a  married

woman  can  apply  to the Court for judicial  divorce  on

fasakh.  The  provisions relating to the appointments  of

arbitrators in marriage disputes has been strengthened by

giving  power to the Shariah Court, where the arbitrators

originally  appointed are unable to reach  agreement,  to

appoint   other  arbitrators  or  hakam  with  power   in

appropriate cases to effect a divorce (clause 50).  Power

is  given  to  the  Shariah Court  to  order  payment  of

maintenance beyond the period of eddah, if the  Court  is

satisfied that it is fit and proper to do so. That is  in

clause 52.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the Bill deals with the financial powers of

the  Council  of  Muslim Religion and  in  particular  it

establishes a General Endowment Fund. Hitherto there  was

no  such  fund  in Singapore and there was  therefore  no

central   organisation  which  could  deal  with   Muslim

charitable trusts. Some Muslim endowments are at  present

administered by the Muslim and Hindu Endowments Board but

the   majority  are  administered  by  private  trustees.

Provision  is made in the Bill for the vesting of  Muslim

religious  trusts in the Majlis and the manner  in  which

the  incomes  of Muslim religious endowments  are  to  be

applied.  The Majlis is also empowered, with the approval

of the President, to collect zakat and fitrah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the Bill deals with mosques of which the

Majlis  is to be the sole trustee with powers to  control

the erection of new mosques and with duties to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>



keep existing mosques in good order and repair. Power  is

given  to  the Majlis to appoint committees of management

for mosques and also to appoint officials. It is the hope

of  the  Government that in this way the Imams and  other

officials  of the mosques will have a better  status  and

position in society and that the mosques will be able  to

be   the  focus  of  Muslim  activities  in  the  various

districts and parts of Singapore. Provision is also  made

for  the registration and supervision of Muslim religious

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI deals with matters relating to marriages and

divorces and re-enacts with amendments the provisions  of

the  Muslims  Ordinance, 1957. It is  proposed  that  the

powers  at present exercisable by the Chief Kathi  should

be exercised by the Kathis attached to the Shariah Court.

Provision is made for the appointment of Naib Kathis  who

will  be  mainly  concerned with  the  solemnisation  and

registration  of  marriages, to which  the  guardians  or

walis  have  consented. Where the woman has  no  wali  or

guardian,  or  where  the wali or  guardian  refuses  his

consent  to  the marriage, the marriage may be solemnised

and  registered  by the Kathis attached  to  the  Shariah

Court.  All divorces will similarly be dealt with by  the

Kathis  in  the Shariah Court. There are at  present  two

Kathis  attached to the Shariah Court, and  if  the  need

arises,  additional  Kathis  will  be  appointed.  It  is

proposed that the imams of mosques in Singapore should be

appointed Naib Kathis. The Bill seeks to lay down the age

of  15  years as the minimum age of marriage for Muslims,

but power is given to the Kathi to approve a marriage  in

special  cases, where the girl has attained  puberty.  In

view  of  the hardship that can be caused in cases  where

the man divorces the woman by three talak, it is proposed

that  such cases should be referred to the Shariah Court,

so  that  the  Shariah Court can be  satisfied  that  the

interests of all parties are adequately safeguarded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VII deals with property and in the main re-enacts

the  provisions of the Muslims Ordinance. 1957. One major

change  is the provision that the Muslim law shall  apply

to  dispositions by will by Muslims. The effect  will  be

that a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>



Muslim  can  only  freely dispose  of  one-third  of  his

property by will; the balance must be distributed to  the

persons entitled to take an intestacy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VIII of the Bill deals with conversion. Power is

given  to  make  rules to provide for the  procedure  for

conversion  and  the  Majlis is required  to  maintain  a

register of converts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IX deals with offences relating to marriage and

divorce.  It  does  not  go to the  extent  of  punishing

offences against the Muslim religion, as in the States of

Malaya,  but  clause 130 provides for the  punishment  of

persons  who cohabit and live with another person outside

marriage.  The  Bill  also provides for  the  control  of

Muslim  religious  lectures so as  to  ensure  that  such

lectures   are  not  used  for  political   or   communal

propaganda  or  to advocate teachings or doctrines  which

are repugnant to the teachings of Islam.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part X deals with miscellaneous matters and gives power

to make rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Comparative Table attached to the Bill shows that

many  of  the  provisions  of  the  Bill  follow  similar

provisions  in the corresponding enactments in  Selangor,

Pahang  and  Penang which are, however, merely  cited  as

examples.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before Parliament envisages two major

changes  of  substance  to  the  existing  Property   Tax

Ordinance.  Section  2 of the Ordinance  defines  "annual

value"  and  gives  the  Chief  Assessor  the  option  of

adopting as an annual value a sum equal to five per  cent

of   the   capital  value  of  the  property  in  certain

circumstances. But in the operation of the Ordinance,  it

has  been  found  that the provision is not  adequate  to

cover  all  cases.  Under the existing  law,  the  option

applies  where  buildings are erected on  land  and  also

where  the  land is vacant. There has been  doubt  as  to

whether  the option applies while buildings  are  in  the

course  of  construction and some litigation has  already

resulted  from  this doubt. The amendment  will  make  it

clear  beyond doubt that the Chief Assessor may adopt  an

annual value of five per cent of the capital value of any

property whether vacant land, land with buildings erected

thereon, or land with buildings being erected thereon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also clarifies the power of the Chief Assessor

in  respect  of  land appurtenant to any house  or  other

building  in  excess  of  the  quantity  fixed   by   the

Controller so that five per cent of the capital value may

be adopted as the annual value of such excess land. There

is  no  definition of "building" in the Ordinance at  the

present time, and one of the amendments made by clause  2

is  the  inclusion of a definition. This, apart from  its

usefulness   in   regard  to  buildings  and   structures

generally,  specifically provides for  the  inclusion  of

items  like  underground  and overground  tanks  and  oil

refineries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 16 of the existing Ordinance does not require

property-owners to give notice to the Chief Assessor when

rentals are increased. The amendment Bill will place  the

onus  on  the  owner  to  inform the  Chief  Assessor  of

instances where rentals are increased. Such notice will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



also be required when renting vacant land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment to section 17 is to empower the

Chief Assessor to increase the annual value of properties

taking  account  of the increases in land  value  in  the

recent  years, especially in those cases where the annual

value bears little relationship to the price at which the

property changes hands. As the Ordinance now stands,  the

Chief Assessor may amend the annual valuation list during

the  year  in  which it is operative where  there  is  an

inaccuracy   in  a  material  particular.  However,   the

Ordinance  does not define what constitutes an inaccuracy

in  a material particular. An amendment will clarify  the

circumstances  under which the Chief Assessor  may  amend

the  existing valuation list and spell out in detail  the

circumstances in which the annual valuation list  may  be

amended. As any vendor or transferer of property  remains

liable  to tax until notice is given, provision is  being

made  under  section  16 that he should  give  notice  of

transfer  instead  of the purchaser as  provided  for  at

present. Under the existing Ordinance, the maximum  limit

for  fines imposed for failure to give notice of transfer

of  property  is raised from $500 to $5,000. The  present

limit  is  considered inadequate to cover certain  cases;

for  example where the transfer of property  with  a  low

annual  value  is not notified over a long period  and  a

permanent  savings from additional tax  may  well  exceed

$500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other amendments are either consequential, necessitated

by  separation  from Malaysia, and they take  account  of

Singapore's position as a sovereign independent Republic,

or are matters of terminology or procedure to improve the

administration of the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>3.19 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Bill is to make certain amendments

to the Industrial Relations Ordinance, 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, the Industrial Relations

Ordinance was enacted five years ago as one of the  chief

measures  in the promotion of the Government's policy  of

industrial  peace  with justice.  Ever  since  then,  the

Government  has kept a careful watch on its operation  to

see  whether it could be improved. Accordingly, a  number

of amendments were made to it in 1962, the most important

of  which  was  the  setting up of the Second  Industrial

Arbitration  Court. However, in the light  of  experience

gained  since  then,  it  has become  apparent  that  the

Ordinance could be improved further in order to make it a

more   efficient   instrument  in  the   prevention   and

settlement of industrial disputes, that is to say, in the

preservation of industrial peace.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments which are embodied in this Bill have,

therefore,  been  made  with  this  end  in  view.  These

amendments are the results of several months'  hard  work

of the President of the Industrial Arbitration Court, the

representatives of the N.T.U.C., the representatives from

the Singapore Employers' Federation, and officials in  my

Ministry,  and  I would like to take this opportunity  to

thank them for their contributions to this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to draw the attention of the House to

the principal changes. Clause 5 reduces the period of the

appointment  of a panel member from three  years  to  one

year.  Although there are ten members on each of the  two

panels, in practice the burden of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>



constituting the Court has fallen on only a few of  them,

as  employers  and  trade unions  of  employees  who  are

parties  to  trade  disputes have  invariably  restricted

their  choice to these few. The proposed amendments  will

help to remove this tendency by enabling the Minister  to

replace  any  panel  members who are seldom  selected  to

constitute the Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 8 and 23 introduce new provisions on union

recognition, because it has been found that  one  of  the

major  causes  of  a  trade dispute has  been  over  this

matter. Experience has shown that the existing provisions

of  the  Ordinance are inadequate for dealing  with  this

area  of  dispute between employers and trade  unions  of

employees. The purpose of the amendment is to remedy this

situation.  It is provided inter alia, as  a  basic

pre-condition   for   opening  negotiations  for   collective

agreements, that a trade union of employees must first be

recognised by the employer in the prescribed manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 deals with the certification of collective

agreements by the Court. At present, if the parties to  a

collective agreement do not agree to alter or  amend  the

agreement  in  accordance with  the  suggestions  of  the

Court,  the  Court  has no power to alter  or  amend  the

agreement  and  certifies it. This state  of  affairs  is

unsatisfactory in that until the parties agree  to  amend

the  agreement  as  directed by the Court,  there  is  no

binding  agreement. Therefore, this clause  empowers  the

Court  to amend and certify a collective agreement  where

the  parties  refuse  to do so on the  direction  of  the

Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 12 and 16 expressly stipulate inter alia that a

collective  agreement  or  an award  is  binding  on  the

successor  to  a  trade  union. Under  the  Ordinance  at

present, a collective agreement or an award is binding on

the  successor to the business of an employer but not  on

the  successor  to a trade union. The proposed  amendment

remedies this anomaly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 seeks to remove the conflict between section

16 and section 35 (4)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Ordinance. At present, when  a  union  serves  a

notice  under  section  16  for  negotiations  on  a  new

collective  agreement on the expiry of the old  one,  the

employer  is  at  liberty to apply  to  the  Court  under

section  35 (4) for an order extending the old collective

agreement. The Court in dealing with such application  of

an employer has no power to take cognisance of the notice

served  under section 16. The proposed amendment empowers

the Court to take cognisance of and to deal with both the

proposers  for a collective agreement and the application

for  extension of an award under section 35  (4)  if  the

parties  do  not reach agreement on their  own  within  a

specific period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To remove any ambiguity that may exist with regard to

the  power of the Court to order the reinstatement  of  a

dismissed  employee, it is expressly provided in  clauses

17 and 21 that in making an award, the Court is empowered

to  take  into  consideration  matters  relating  to  the

dismissal  or reinstatement of an employee  or  class  of

employees  and to order the reinstatement of a  dismissed

employee  or grant any suitable relief as it may consider

desirable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 provides that the Commissioner for Labour may

authorise a public officer to carry out investigations of

complaints in respect of offences under the Ordinance and

it  sets  out the powers of such officer. This  has  been

done to ensure that speedy action is taken to investigate

every  complaint  and to prosecute any  offender  if  the

investigation shows that the complaint is well founded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D 01 be reduced by

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Before the Member goes any further, for

the guidance of Members, I must inform the House that the

debate on these Development Estimates will proceed not on

the basis which was proceeded on the Estimates which have

been  previously discussed, but purely on  the  basis  of

development and principles concerning development and  on

no  other basis. I hope the House understands that  -  no

questions  of Government policy with regard to  the  Main

Estimates  can be brought up again. I hope  I  have  made

myself quite clear.



<br><br><!-- Mr Gonzales -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gonzales:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform

Members  of  this House that the hangar,  for  which  the

House is asked to approve a sum of $100,000 to convert it

into a cargo complex, is not just an ordinary hangar made

of  steel girders and corrugated asbestos. It is a hangar

which  has got a history, and if it were by any chance  a

human  being  and member of the civil service,  it  could

credit  itself with reasonably long service, for  it  was

dismantled and transferred from the old



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>



Kallang  Airport in 1957 to its present site. Ever  since

then, officials in the Department of Civil Aviation  have

not made up their minds as to what is to be housed in it.

They  have  been very fortunate in having a  building  up

their  sleeve  to  produce whenever  someone  wants  some

hangar  space  at  the  Airport.  I  think  we  have  had

badminton  played in the hangar and parties held  in  it.

There  used  to  be cars parked in it;  and  the  Airport

Manager  stole  a  march  on  the  Ministry  of  National

Development by charging each car owner $10 per month  for

the use of the parking space. Today the hangar is used as

a  garage by one airline and for varying reasons by other

airlines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear that the Department of Civil Aviation

is now waking up to the fact that this hangar can be used

for  something  worth while. What I cannot understand  is

why  it has taken so long for them to realise this.  What

was  done  during the two years when we were in Malaysia?

Did  the  D.C.A. at  that time attempt  to  improve  the

facilities at the Airport for storage of cargo? Or did he

think that, as there was a $50 million Airport at Subang,

there  was  sufficient cargo space and that,  as  far  as

Singapore Airport was concerned, it could develop into  a

second-class Airport?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity

of bringing to the attention of the Deputy Prime Minister

the   short-sightedness   in  respect   of   the   future

development  of  the Airport. The Deputy  Prime  Minister

himself  has  said  that more people  come  to  and  pass

through  Singapore  by air than by  any  other  means  of

transportation. Statistics also show that the  volume  of

air cargo has increased year by year. I would ask him  to

look  carefully  into  the question  of  converting  this

hangar into a cargo complex which, in my opinion, will be

totally inadequate in a very short space of time.  If  we

are planning for the future, then we should look into the

question of building a cargo terminal instead of spending

money  on  a  project which would only  serve  our  needs

temporarily.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as a matter of interest, I would like to ask

the  Deputy  Prime  Minister how many  airlines  will  be

taking up space in this new cargo complex.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like  to  add a few words to this  item.  I  think

consideration  should be given as  to  whether  there  is

justification in spending $100,000 now, and possibly at a

later  stage the House would be asked to approve  another

$100,000 for the plan cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that at the present moment the hangar is

being  occupied  by certain airlines as a cargo  complex.

Even  if a conversion is made, it is not going to satisfy

present  and  future needs as a cargo complex.  With  the

present  trend in air cargo, as I understand  it,  larger

planes  with  palletised loading  are  due  in  Singapore

Airport  early next year. And definitely with this  trend

in  cargo movement, there is no justification in spending

this money because it will be totally inadequate for  the

needs  of  the airline operators. Therefore, I think,  in

the  interest of long-term planning, a new cargo terminal

would best be considered.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I am surprised to learn

that Hangar No. 4 has a very varied history - that it has

been  used in the past as a badminton stadium,  an  arena

for parties and get-togethers, and last but not least, as

a  car park! Nevertheless, I think we would like to leave

the history of Hangar No. 4 in history.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform the House, however, that the

reason  why it is intended to convert this hangar into  a

cargo  complex is simply that it has been found that  the

present  facilities for storing air cargo  elsewhere  are

not  adequate. However, the demand for cargo space at the

Airport  is  not  as  great as the Member  for  Serangoon

Gardens or the Member for River Valley would suggest.  In

fact,  I  am told that in the first year of operation  of

the Airport at Paya Lebar, which was opened



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>



in  1955,  a total of 5 million kilograms of air  freight

was  handled.  Barely  nine years later,  in  1964,  this

figure  had increased to only 6 million kilograms.  Well,

an increase of one million kilograms in the space of nine

years is pretty slow. So we would not anticipate that  in

the next five years the volume of cargo would increase so

rapidly  that  a  completely new cargo  handling  complex

would  be needed. Nevertheless, it would be necessary  at

this stage to put Hangar No. 4 to better use than it  was

in the past; hence this request that a sum of $100,000 be

allocated  to  convert this hangar into a cargo  complex.

This  will be quite adequate for the cargo that would  be

envisaged for probably the next five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no knowledge how many airlines have applied for

cargo  space  in  the  proposed new  cargo  complex,  but

presumably  airline  operators  will  put  forward  their

request  to  the Department of Civil Aviation  when  they

feel that there is a necessity to increase the space  for

air cargo.

wish to proceed, in view of the explanation of the Deputy

Prime Minister?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D 01 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 004.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know how many people share

my  views  that  an  International  Airport  could  be  a

showpiece  of  the country, but I feel  that  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister will agree with me that Singapore Airport

could  be  the showpiece of Singapore. However, in  order

that  it could acquire this reputation, there has  to  be

efficiency at the Airport. And the one place where  there

has  to  be efficiency is in the ticketing area. It  does

not  do us any good to have people say that they have had

to  wait  for hours before getting their baggage  cleared

and   tickets   checked.  The  airlines  themselves   are

responsible for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>



getting  their passengers cleared, but they can  only  do

this if they are offered the facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extension of Ticketing Offices is one of these

facilities,  but  I would like to ask  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister if he could let us know whether these extensions

are to be made to all offices, or are they for offices of

airlines   which  have  recently  started  operating   in

Singapore?  Sir,  it looks as if the question  of  future

expansion   of   the  Airport  Terminal  was   completely

forgotten  when  the  Airport was  planned,  as  was  the

requirement for other facilities at the Airport.  Why  is

it that we have to knock down V.I.P. car parks to provide

room  for  extra office space, not that V.I.P. car  parks

are  absolutely necessary? The next thing  that  we  will

have  to  do  without would probably be the  V.I.P. room

itself. This House recently approved a sum of $42,500  to

provide for additional office space. What we will have to

spend  next  is  a  question no one  can  answer,  except

probably  the  architect who made  such  a  mess  at  the

Airport.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as more and more people use the Airport every

year,  there  will come a time when the present  terminal

building  will be considered inadequate. It is  therefore

very  important  that the Department  of  Civil  Aviation

should  look  carefully into the  question  and  plan  an

expansion programme that will see us through for the next

15 years instead of the next 15 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Deputy Prime Minister could also investigate

to  assure himself that the Department of Civil  Aviation

is  capable of drawing up a programme that will serve our

needs for the future.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head D 01 be reduced

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind Members that the deadline on

this is 3.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on this item of

the  Extension of Ticketing Offices on which  a  vote  of

$82,500  is  being sought for, I would like to  draw  the

attention of the House



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>



and  also  of  the Deputy Prime Minister to  the  Federal

Development Estimates of 1965 in which a sum  of  $82,500

has  been  approved in respect of the conversion  of  the

V.I.P. car-park into office space. And then earlier on in

this  Session, in Cmd. Paper 24 of 1965 a vote of $42,500

has  been approved for the conversion of the V.I.P.

car-park into office space. And here again in the Development

Estimates,  a  further sum of $82,500 has been  requested

for  the  extension of Ticketing Offices. I just want  to

seek clarification as to whether all these are in respect

of one and the same item.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I will answer the Member for River

Valley   first.  I  must  inform  the  House   that   the

Development Estimates for Civil Aviation were worked  out

when  the department was under the charge of the  Central

Government  of  Malaysia, Kuala  Lumpur,  and  they  were

submitted to the Treasury at the beginning of this  year.

So  when  we  became  independent in August,  these  were

automatically  included in the Development Estimates  for

next year. I have not had the opportunity to study all of

them  in detail. However, it would appear to me that  the

intention  is the same, that is, to extend the  Ticketing

Offices  into the area now occupied by the V.I.P. garage.

As  to why there are two separate sums asked for, I would

not  know,  unless  the sum of money  asked  for  in  the

Supplementary Estimates is to be spent on  work  that  is

already  in progress or has been completed and  that  the

sum  of money in the Development Estimates is to be spent

next  year.  Nevertheless, I promise the  Member  that  I

shall  look into this matter. I will only say  that  when

the  new  Airport  Terminal Building  was  designed,  all

commercial  airline  operators were  consulted  on  their

requirements and, in fact, a long series of meetings were

held  with  them in order to draw up a plan  which  would

satisfy  their  needs. In fact, if  there  has  been  any

shortsightedness at all on the planning of the  ticketing

area,  then it must also be partly the responsibility  of

the  airline operators themselves. In fact, I  would  say

the  worst  offender is Malaysian Airways. When  I  urged

them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>



to apply for space in the present airline ticketing area,

their  reply  to  me was that it was not necessary,  they

were  not going to do so, they were going to use the town

office  which  was  quite adequate, and furthermore  they

were not going to use the new passenger terminal building

and  they  were  going to disembark their passengers  and

operate from the old terminal building in Paya Lebar.  It

was only after all available space had been allocated  to

other airline operators and the new terminal building was

proving  to be a hive of activity that Malaysian  Airways

finally   regretted  its  shortsightedness  and   hastily

applied  for  space  in  the  ticketing  area  and   also

elsewhere in the new terminal building. Frankly, if there

are  any complaints which any airline operator wishes  to

raise  on  this  matter, then I must say that  they  have

hardly any cause to do so, because they cannot deny  that

they were consulted on this matter. In fact, sometimes  I

regret  indeed  that Malaysian Airways  is  our  national

carrier.  If it were a foreign carrier and it  does  this

sort  of thing to the Civil Aviation Department, I  would

have just put it out. But preferential treatment has been

given  to  Malaysian Airways. We have bent  backwards  in

order to meet their needs. And I think they are sometimes

unappreciative  of  these  efforts.  And  if  there   are

passengers who complain that they have to wait for a long

time  to  get  their  tickets checked and  collect  their

baggage,  then I will again point my finger  squarely  at

those   members  of  the  staff  of  commercial   airline

companies which have been slow in doing their job.  I  do

not  see how the Civil Aviation Department officials come

into  the  picture at all. And if there is a fuss  to  be

kicked up by the public, I would say that it be aimed  at

the airline company on whose tickets they are travelling.

Certainly,   I   would  advise  all  airline   operators,

including  Malaysian Airways, that they  should  pull  up

their socks and see that their staff get down to work  in

a prim



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>



and proper way so that they will maintain a good image

and their passengers will be satisfied.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Development Estimates, there

is  provision for the building of a holiday camp for  the

national workers who took part in the struggle to  defeat

the  anti-national elements led by the  Barisan  Sosialis

whose allegiance is to a country outside the Republic  of

Singapore. What has happened, and what is going to happen

to  the  workers' holiday camp which was proposed  to  be

sited at Changi Beach and which is now being used by  the

Fisheries  Department?  If  there  is  provision  for   a

workers' holiday camp, it should be administered  by  the

N.T.U.C. which can look into the question of applications

for  the use of the holiday camp by national workers  who

have  dedicated  themselves in the  past,  and  who  will

continue  to  do so, in order to strengthen the  workers'

organisation,   to  the  task  of  nation-building   with

disciplined  workers.  The use  of  existing  and  future

holiday  camps should be properly supervised  to  prevent

undesirable  elements from poisoning  the  minds  of  our

people  who  desire to build a multi-racial  society  and

live in peace and prosperity.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State of Defence (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, these holiday camps  are  established

mainly  for  the  purpose  of the  have-nots,  i.e.,  the

working class. We know that the haves, i.e., the

well-to-do,  have their own facilities for weekends and holidays.

So  due  to lack of amenities in the past for the working

class,  the Government has established holiday  camps  in

the  island  for the use of the majority of  the  working

class. There is no necessity to establish a special  camp

for  the  use of the N.T.U.C. In fact, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

from  the  records, it is observed that many unions  have

made use of these camps in the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D 03 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D 03 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge that the plan to build an

Adult  Education  Centre  be speeded  up,  and  that  the

Government should not be unprepared to increase  the  sum

allocated for the Centre should the proposed $1.5 million

be   found   to   be  inadequate  to  meet   the   actual

requirements.  Since its inception  in  April  1960,  the

Adult  Education Board has developed itself  to  such  an

extent  that  it  has been regarded as  an  indispensable

quasi-government body that provides an invaluable service

to the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last five years, the Adult Education Board has

developed  a system of adult education that is impressive

by  Asian standards. This programme includes literacy and

language  classes,  a  primary and secondary  educational

system   up  to  and  including  pre-university  classes,

commercial education, classes to assist adults  preparing

for  overseas  Professional Examinations, public  forums,

and  a  wide range of recreational and vocational courses

arranged on an ad hoc basis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



according to public demand. This year, the total  student

enrolment is above 50,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Adult Education Board has managed to cope with this

expansion  with  the assistance and co-operation  of  the

Ministry of Education. The Board has no facilities of its

own  except the Cultural Centre and a bungalow, known  as

the  Annexe, situated at No. 9, Fort Canning Road. It has

relied  mainly on Government and Government-aided  school

buildings  for  implementing its programme.  However,  on

many  occasions it has to make use of other premises like

the  community  centres, Government  Social  Welfare  and

Institutional  Homes, and whatever accommodation  it  can

lay its hands on. The use of these facilities means great

savings  in  expenditure, for it involves an  intensified

use  of  overhead social capital. For example, the school

buildings  are  used  three  times  a  day,  for  morning

schools,  for afternoon schools, and, finally  for  night

classes.  However, the use of these buildings unavoidably

imposes  certain  limitations  on  the  scope  of   adult

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with the use of school buildings, the fact

that  these  are  used for teaching in  day-time,  as  it

should  be, means that the adult classes are only run  at

night. In fact, most of these classes are run after  6.30

p.m. But there is a demand for classes in the day-time as

well.  In fact, the Board has been conducting with  great

success language classes for office workers between  7.30

and  9.00 a.m, and between 5 o'clock and 6 o'clock in the

evening. Classes for housewives, and other categories  of

workers  whose working hours are confined either only  to

the  morning, afternoon, or at night, cannot be organised

because of the lack of facilities. The size of this adult

population with leisure in the day-time can be gauged  by

the  fact  that  the cinemas in Singapore have  found  it

worth while to run shows at 11.00 a.m., 1.30 p.m., and  4

p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of day-schools has also imposed a limitation on

the kind of classes the Board can run. The standard type



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



classroom facilities consist of blackboards and  rows  of

desks and chairs.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. There are other Members who wish

to  speak  on  this  amendment. I must  impose  a  strict

compliance  with  my  first request to  Members  to  talk

strictly to the item under discussion. This speech  could

have  been more usefully made on the Main Estimates. Will

the  Member  please  get on with this particular

item - "Adult  Education Centre", the building of it and whether

there is a necessity for building it, wholly next year or

partially next year? That is the point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I will need

about another five minutes to finish what I want to  say.

Would I have my five minutes, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> They have been designed to cater for

the  needs of an academic and literary type of education.

But  they  cannot be used for other types of classes  for

which there is a popular demand, e.g, taxidermy, pottery,

silkscreen  painting, basket weaving  and  so  on.  These

classes are of a vocational and craft character. Some  of

these   require  special  equipment,  e.g. workbenches,

easels, potter's wheels, baking kilns, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of school buildings has also resulted in the

difficult  problem of divided responsibility.  The  Board

has hardly any teaching equipment at all. For example, in

the  case of science classes, for which there is a  great

demand, especially at the pre-university level, the Board

has  to  make use of the school facilities and equipment.

In the day-schools, the Principal or a member of the

full-time staff is given the responsibility of taking care  of

them.  In  the  night classes, it is harder  to  delegate

responsibility. However, the problem has  been  partially

solved by employing the Principals or the members of  the

full  time staff as the supervisors of the adult  classes

functioning in their schools. But it has not always  been

found possible to employ the Principals or the members of

staff responsible for the equipment in the day-schools to

be the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>



supervisors  in the night classes. In any case,  all  the

staff  engaged by the Board in its classes are  part-time

and time-rated, and, for this reason, it is difficult  to

delegate  responsibility for the care of  the  equipment.

The Board has experienced great difficulty in getting the

equipment  available for use for its night  classes.  The

inadequacy of it inevitably has affected the teaching  in

the night classes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board has also employed the community centres for

its classes. All community centres have provision for  at

least  one or two classrooms with furniture suitable  for

teaching purposes. These facilities have at various times

been  used for adult education, but the use of  them  has

been  limited by a number of factors. First of  all,  the

People's   Association  has  a  prior  claim   on   these

facilities  and this has posed a great deal of difficulty

for the Board because of the wide range of activities  of

the  People's  Association.  Furthermore,  the  classroom

facilities are not always suited for the conduct of

night-classes.   The  community  centres  have  many out-door

activities   which  are  unavoidably  noise-making,   and

therefore,  are  distracting and  not  conducive  to  the

learning processes. In recent years, the installation  of

television  sets has increased the volume of distraction.

Finally, the use of the community centres also raises the

problems of divided authority and responsibility for  the

facilities and equipment as encountered in certain  cases

in the use of the school premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only premises over which the Board has direct

control are the Cultural Centre and the Annexe, which was

previously  a  government bungalow, now on lease  to  the

Board, on a year-to-year basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cultural Centre was built in 1955. Its construction

was  completed in 1957. It was never designed to  be  the

Headquarters of Adult Education, as it has since  become.

It  was  designed for what its name has clearly

stated - namely,  a  centre  for  cultural  activities.  For  this

reason,  the greater part of the building is  a  330-seat

theatre  and a foyer which can be used for art and  other

exhibitions. As originally planned, adult



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>



education facilities were limited to two classrooms  with

a  collapsible dividing partition for converting the  two

classrooms  into  a  lecture hall, if  necessary.  Office

accommodation was planned for a small staff of about  ten

persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the present Adult Education Board was formed,

adult  education was the responsibility of the  Singapore

Council for Adult Education. The latter was essentially a

co-ordinating  body,  and  its scope  of  activities  was

limited. It was accommodated in the Cultural Centre. Even

then, the Singapore Council for Adult Education had found

the Cultural Centre inadequate, especially from the point

of  view  of  office accommodation. It had to  convert  a

garage into needed office accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Adult Education Board, unlike the Council, is a

planning,  organising,  and employing  body.  The  latest

figures  I  secure from the Board show that, during  this

year, an average of about 57,000 students attend all  the

Board's classes and courses in any one month. This  large

student  population requires a far larger  administration

than  before.  In the Cultural Centre, the  office  space

available has exceeded the saturation point. Any one  who

takes  the  trouble to visit the Cultural  Centre  during

office hours will notice this immediately. One of the two

lecture rooms has already been converted for use  as  the

General  Office,  resulting in a  reduction  of  urgently

required   centrally   located   classrooms   for   adult

education.  In fact, the General Office faces  the  foyer

where  the  canteen is also located. It is  a  matter  of

daily experience that the staff is constantly assailed by

the  aroma of coffee and the smell of cooking in addition

to  being  disturbed  by the chatter  of  people  in  the

canteen. Senior staff are crammed in the same room.  They

have  no  privacy  and do not enjoy the other  conditions

necessary  for sustained work and planning. There  is  no

special  room available for Board and Committee meetings.

In  brief, there is no further room for the expansion  of

office space.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the problem of accommodation has been

temporarily  overcome by the acquisition of  the  Annexe.

But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



this  building has been designed for residential purposes

and not for an educational institution. Nevertheless, the

Board  has been forced to make use of it for some of  the

classes that cannot be held in the school buildings, e.g.

Chinese typewriting, and dress-making classes. The  Board

has   been  forced  even  to  make  use  of  garages  for

conducting its classes. Thus, the photography classes are

being run in a converted garage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons, Mr Speaker, Sir, I strongly

urge that the Government should give greater priority  to

the  construction of the Adult Education Centre  and  all

haste  should be exercised to complete it in the shortest

possible time. Furthermore, our Government should be more

generous  in its allocation for the construction  of  the

Centre.  The Adult Education Board has done a great  deal

of  good work in the past, and everything should be  done

to  encourage  it to serve the society in a  constructive

and useful way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must thank the Member for

Punggol   for  presenting  a  very  good  case  for   the

establishment  of a permanent Adult Education  Centre  in

Singapore. But I would preface my remarks by saying  that

the  case he put forward would make it appear to be  that

he  wanted an Adult Education Centre where all the varied

activities  of  the  Adult Education  Board  were  to  be

concentrated in that one centre.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, that is not the intention. The intention is

to retain the decentralised feature of adult education in

Singapore for various reasons, one of which is transport.

Incidentally  the  people who  take  part  in  our  adult

education  classes are adults who want to  improve  their

knowledge  in  various fields. Many of  them  are  people

belonging  to  the lower income group whose salaries  are

small and, as such, they need to spend less on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



transport  by  attending  these classes.  Therefore,  the

Adult  Education Centre which Government intends to build

in  the  near future is more of a nerve-centre for  adult

education  in Singapore, and soon I will explain  briefly

the  various  divisions of that Centre. As  I  have  said

earlier,  it  is  not  meant to be  a  centre  where  all

activities,  classes, lectures, and so on, of  the  Adult

Education Board are held.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Adult Education Board - the Lembaga Gerakan

Pelajaran  Dewasa  - will  have its  new  headquarters  at

Armenian  Street.  It will be a l3-storey  building,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, with a floor area of 81,800 sq, ft.  This

building  will  provide  an  administration  office,   30

lecture rooms, 5 science laboratories, 2 domestic science

rooms,  a  language laboratory - this is a new innovation

in  Singapore  -  a  lecture hall, a film  and  reference

library,  and  special  rooms for extra-mural  activities

like  photography, art, and so on. Workshops of woodwork,

radio   and  television,  electrical  and  motor   repair

facilities,  will  also be erected  but  at  a  different

place.  That  will be at the old sewerage site  in  Tiong

Bahru - minus the smell, of course!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vote provides $50,000 to enable work on the

proposed  headquarters and workshop  of  the  Lembaga  to

commence in 1966. The plan cost for the whole project  is

$1.5  million, which is estimated to cover  the  cost  of

buildings  as  well  as  furniture  and  equipment.   The

original  proposal  for the Lembaga was  for  a  building

having a floor area of 91,000 square feet, costing  $3.15

million.  But  the  Economic Planning Unit,  taking  into

consideration the real needs of the Lembaga's activities,

the  relative priorities in educational development,  and

also  the  availability  of financial  resources  of  the

State,  pruned  it down to a floor area of 81,000  square

feet,  costing $1.5 million. In other words,  the  frills

and  finery  have  been made subordinate  to  utilitarian

needs in the interests of the economy of the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lembaga has appealed for an upward revision of the

plan  cost, but the considered view, I am told,  is  that

this sum is adequate for the proposed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



building  consisting of 81,800 square  feet.  But  if  it

should  prove inadequate, then a request for revision  of

the  plan  cost  can always be considered.  And  being  a

Government which is very education-conscious, we are sure

that this request will be met when the time comes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D 03 be reduced by

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, does this provision in the Development

Estimates  include  provision for  a  primary  school  in

Hindoo  Road, which could not be built by December  1965,

as  contained  in  a letter of the Urban  Rural  Services

Committee dated 10th August, 1964? I will read that  part

of the letter in English:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In English) `The Director of Education has reported

that   detailed   plans  are  being  prepared   for   the

construction of a 20-classroom primary school  in  Hindoo

Road.  The school is expected to be completed in December

1965.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Malay) Today is the 30th December, 1965; tomorrow

is  the 31st, and the day after will be the New Year -  a

public holiday. It is important for me to point out  that

this  primary school should be filled with pupils of  all

races,  wherein they could learn through various language

media in one school building, so that they could learn to

live together in order to build a multi-racial society.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that the standard be improved

considerably.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head D 03 be reduced

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that Amendment (3)* standing in the names of

Inche  Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi and Mr Teong Eng Siong  is

also  in  respect of subhead 012. Could these two Members

take their amendment (3) together with the amendment just

it not?

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In addition to Primary Schools, can

Secondary Schools be taken together?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I would like

to know from the Minister of State for Education, in this

allocation of not less than $30.8 million for Primary and

Secondary Schools, whether there are other plans to build

such  schools in Kampong Kembangan. In Kampong  Kembangan

the number of children attending school has increased and

new  buildings  for  primary and  secondary  schools  are

limited. Children staying around Kaki Bukit are  sent  to

Opera Estate and those staying in Jalan Eunos are sent to

Kaki  Bukit because of lack of classrooms. Likewise,  the

building  of  secondary schools where there is  only  one

secondary school in Kampong Kembangan Constituency; that,

too,  is  an  integrated school. Thus, a good  number  of

children  whose  ages are above 13  years  and  who  have

passed  primary  school  and  who  should  be  going   to

secondary  school, are sent to as far as Punggol,  Changi

and  other places. This is a matter for concern for their

parents  because  their  children  are  sent  to  faraway

places.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that a girl

staying in Changi who has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



passed  an  examination to go to a secondary  school,  is

sent  to  Jurong. Is this not a matter for  concern?  The

girl  herself is staying in the east of Singapore and  is

attending school in the west of Singapore. In view of the

distribution  of primary and secondary schools,  I  would

urge  the  Minister of State for Education to  tell  this

House  how  many  primary and secondary schools  will  be

built in Kampong Kembangan Constituency for next year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like to seek clarification. My original motion  is

to  reduce  the  sum by $100. I would like  the  Minister

concerned to allow me to talk on general problems.  If  I

am not allowed, then I will speak on the next amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member can only touch on primary and

secondary  schools  now. But if  he  wants  to  speak  on

something  more than that, he must wait till Mr  Ho  See

Beng gets going.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Inche Rahim Ishak, in reply? I think the

Members  want  some  information as  to  whether  certain

schools are to be built in the east or west.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> Mr Speaker, the Member for Kampong

Kapor was interested in the building of a school promised

for  1965 in Hindoo Road. The answer, of course, is  that

the  Hindoo Road School is actually in the 1965 programme

but it is to be built in 1966 under subhead 012.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a special school as the area is limited and,

therefore,   the  standard  type  of  primary   education

building cannot be sited on it. Fresh plans for a

multi-storeyed  building have now been prepared - if  that  can

compensate  for the complaint by the Member  for  Kampong

Kapor. And an application for a revision of plan cost has

already been submitted. So what the Member will miss in a

small  primary school will be compensated for by a

multi-storeyed one.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan also queried about

schools  in Kampong Kembangan. There are several  reasons

why  schools  cannot be concentrated  in  any  particular

constituency.  It  is almost unavoidable  for  pupils  in

certain  localities  not to be given  places  in  schools

nearest  their  homes. This is actually a  minor  problem

probably  not  affecting  even  five  per  cent  of   the

population. Very rarely do we get a pupil, say, like  the

one  mentioned  by the Member for Kampong Kembangan,  who

lives  in Kampong Kembangan and has been sent to a school

in  Jurong.  As  I have said, during the  debate  on  the

Ordinary Estimates, every case will be considered, and  I

personally shall be very happy to take up this case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Kampong Kembangan, three schools have been built

since  1959.  The  one  at Kaki Bukit  is  an  integrated

primary  school  built in 1961. The  second  school,  the

Kampong Kembangan Integrated Primary School, was built in

1963. Then the third, the Kaki Bukit Secondary School, is

one of the few secondary schools built in the rural areas

in  1964. As a matter of fact, the Minister for Education

comes  from Telok Ayer Constituency and in the  whole  of

his  constituency, there is not a single school. In other

words,    all    the   children   in   his   constituency

[Interruption] no secondary school, Mr Speaker, Sir, In

other  words,  all  the primary school  children  in  his

constituency have to go to schools far away.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need not go further, Mr Speaker, Sir, than to say

that  plans  are  coming not only  for  the  building  of

secondary  schools but, if I may mention for the  record,

the  schools which are to be built in 1966 actually  come

under  the same subhead, and I think it would be relevant

for me to mention something about them. In 1961, we built

a primary school in Wallich Street, a multi-storeyed one;

in  1963,  a  primary school in Bedok  Road;  in  1965  a

primary school in Broadrick Road. Primary schools in  Toa

Payoh,   Tiong  Bahru,  Hindoo  Road  (the  one  I   just

mentioned) are for 1965 which will actually spill-over in

1966.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary schools - MacPherson South Secondary School

now  under construction; there are Parry Avenue Secondary

School,  Bukit  Timah Village Secondary  School,  Rangoon

Road  Secondary  School on the same site as  the  present

one,   Changi   10  m.s.  Secondary  School   all   under

construction.  Then there are Crescent Road  and  Dunearn

Secondary  Schools,  Holland  Village  Secondary  School,

Chestnut  Drive  Secondary School, Sennet Road  Secondary

School  in  Siglap Constituency. Then there  are  Lowland

Secondary School, Toa Payoh Secondary School, Bukit Merah

Secondary  School, Whitley Road Secondary School,  Linden

Drive,  a  junior  college coming under the  category  of

secondary schools, all being planned for the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure an even distribution of work and expenditure,

the  projects under the second Five-Year Plan  have  been

phased so that there is no undue overloading for any  one

year.  The large number of schools to be built next  year

under  the  spill-over project has therefore necessitated

the  deferment of the building of new schools  under  the

second Five-Year Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may summarise, there are 8 primary schools

shown  in  the  Estimates to be built  and  39  secondary

schools shown under the same Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to ask the Minister is this. How many

vehicles are going to be purchased with this sum which is

being  budgeted  for  and how many of  them  are

refuse-collecting  vans? Because I have had complaints  from  my

constituents  that  their refuse has not  been  collected

sometimes  for  a week, or sometimes for  three  or  four

days.  In  fact, Sir, if you look outside this Parliament

House,  you  will notice that there is a pile of  rubbish

opposite  the road which has not been collected  for  the

last three days. Sir, I hope the Minister can let us have

an answer to that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, in reply to the hon. Member for  Serangoon

Gardens,  the provision of $320,000 for 1966 is  for  the

intended  purchase  of five refuse  collectors,  6  crane

wagons and one street watering wagon. As explained in the

previous debate on public cleansing, we have had to  face

a  situation  in  which  even if we  had  purchased  more

vehicles for disposal of refuse, owing to the practice of

absenteeism  among  the  workers  and  sometimes  of  the

drivers,  there would have been more vehicles than  there

were  drivers. And that was how it was going on for quite

a number of years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



But  now  that there is this new Disciplinary Code  which

has  been put into operation for the last two months,  we

believe   that   there  will  be  better  observance   of

discipline from our workers and drivers. It is  possible,

now  that  we have put the matter on a proper  basis,  to

consider the purchase of more refuse collectors and crane

wagons. So I envisage that for the New Year we should  be

in  a  position  to  see  an improvement  in  the  public

cleansing situation in Singapore. What has taken place in

the past and what we see today is something which I think

we will not likely see in future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for

Health  how  many markets he proposes to build  with  the

$900,000, where are they to be sited; and in view of  the

implementation of the new Hawkers' Code, can  he  let  us

know whether most of the hawkers will be accommodated  in

these  new markets and what about those hawkers  who  are

now in unauthorised places and on the roadside?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to the

hon.  Member for River Valley, I would like to  say  that

the  provision  of $900,000 for the building  of  markets

next  year,  1966, would be in respect  of  five  markets

only. Jurong Neighbourhood 1, a medium-sized market  with

120  stalls  costing around $167,000; and  a  large-sized

market with 150 stalls in the Bukit Ho Swee Neighbourhood

4  area  estimated at $240,000; a very small-sized market

with  60 stalls in Tuas off Jurong which may come  up  to

$123,000;  and  MacPherson  South  Estate  off   Pesiaran

Keliling;  and the fifth one is likely to be at  the  Toa

Payoh  New  Town Neighbourhood 3 or the Redhill extension

area



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



which  has not yet been decided. The first three  markets

have  already  been approved by the Development  Planning

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Member's second question about the proposed

implementation  of the new Hawkers' Code  which  will  be

announced  sometime  in February  and  the  licensing  of

hawkers  from  1st  of March, I have indicated  that  the

licensing  of  hawkers will take a number  of  months  to

conclude,  and  that  it is the first  step  towards  the

control  of hawkers in Singapore. As indicated, the  five

new  markets  that will be built next year will  probably

only provide something like 500 stalls for hawkers. So it

is  impossible  to give an answer that the  licensing  of

40,000  to  50,000  hawkers can therefore  be  solved  by

building five markets next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is intended in the long-term plan for hawkers is

to  get  them  into permanent premises to  conduct  their

business,  that  is  to say, either  in  Government-built

markets or private markets or inside shop-houses. It will

take  some years before it can become effective, but  the

new  Hawkers' Code will provide a temporary  solution  to

get  hawkers off the main streets. In fact, hawkers  will

be  prohibited from plying their trade along bus  routes.

At  the  present moment, we see too many hawkers crowding

themselves  around bus stops, and even at  pasar  malams,

with  their  wares  displayed inside  bus-stop  shelters,

which is ridiculous.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So by providing some accommodation for hawkers as a

temporary solution, we will try to get them away from the

main roads and bus routes and allocate places for them in

side  streets. Gradually we will be able to persuade them

that  they can do better business if they find places  in

permanent premises like markets, shop-houses and  so  on.

We  think that during the course of a few years we may be

able to reach that ideal stage where hawkers, except  for

the  itinerant ones, will no longer be seen  doing  their

business in the open streets, as what is existing today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, next year the Ministry of Finance

will lend to the Economic Development Board a sum of  $48

million for the purpose of financing factories. Would the

Minister for Finance consider the building of sawmills in

specific  areas?  Lorries  carrying  logs  pass   through

crowded  areas. This is a source of danger to the people.

There are also sawmills in the vicinity of wooden houses.

That  also  is  a source of danger to the people  because

lorries  carrying  heavy logs pass through  these  areas.

They  are thus damaging the roads and causing the  drains

to be choked. I hope the Ministry of Finance will be able

to  allot specific areas for sawmills so that there  will

be no more sawmills located in the centre of the city and

in  the  heavily populated areas. I wish to know  whether

such a plan is envisaged by this Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it would be ideal if

we  could  segregate certain trades, that is, divide  the

island  of Singapore into sections where offensive trades

can  be  carried on on one side, and certain other trades

can be carried on on the other side. But we all know that

town  planning  is something new. It is only  during  the

last few years that great emphasis has been placed on it.

Even  up  till  today  quite a lot  of  the  sociological

problems involved in town planning have not been  solved.

We  are all aware of the problems created by the movement

of  large  log-carrying lorries in the city  areas.  But,

unfortunately,  this is a legacy which we have  inherited

since early times. An estimate has been made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



that   there   are  altogether  about  100  sawmills   in

Singapore.  If we are to resettle them in  one  area,  so

that the transportation of the logs and planks would  not

interfere with the traffic or break up the roads, then we

will require an area of 400 acres or so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, to answer the question put by the Member for

Kampong  Kembangan.  I am glad to inform  him  that  this

problem  has  been considered by the Economic Development

Board,  and  we have marked out an area in  Kranji  where

land  reclamation is taking place, so that, if  possible,

all  the sawmills in Singapore could be resettled  there.

But  I  must  warn the Member for Kampong Kembangan  that

this  is a problem which cannot be solved in one day,  or

even  one  year  or  two  years, because,  as  he  knows,

resettlement   is   quite   a  difficult   problem.   The

resettlement  of people ordinarily is quite  a  difficult

problem,  and the resettlement of trade and  industry  is

more difficult than that of resettling people. Anyway, we

have  already marked out an area and it is our  objective

to  see  that as far as possible all offensive trades  or

trades  which  add to our traffic problem  would  be  set

aside in a different area.

something to be commended. Since we are to have this  new

equipment,  I  hope  the  T.V.  Section  will  have  more

programmes produced locally. The

T.V.  Section should shoot more local scenes and  reduce,

as  far  as  possible, the number of programmes  imported

from  abroad - the so-called "canned" foreign programmes.

They  are not suitable for the taste of our local people.

According  to  what  I understand, a foreign  film  costs

about  $120  to $170 to hire. This is expensive.  We  are

thus losing no small amount of foreign exchange.

most  complicated aspects of television. But it  has  its

advantages. For example, this Videotape Recorder is  able

to  record events on sight, and, secondly, it can do away

with  the  process  of developing,  as  in  the  case  of

conventional  films  by  tele-recorder  and  sound  tape.

Thirdly,  in  view  of  the  advantage  that  it  is  not

necessary  to process the film, the playback or  telecast

could almost be immediately done after recording. Another

advantage is the fact that the films of the Videotape are

clearer  than the conventional films. Finally,  from  the

economic  aspect, the Videotape can be  erased  and  used

over  and over again, as we see in the conventional  tape

recorder.  So  from the economical aspect, the  Videotape

Recorder  does, to a considerable extent,  cut  down  the

expenses of the Ministry of Culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has touched slightly on the

programmes. He has suggested that we should produce  more

local  films  rather than depend on the hiring  of  films

from  other countries. I am in full agreement  with  him.

But  there are difficulties about which I would  like  to

take  this  opportunity to inform the House. The  average

cost for the hiring of a film, say, of half an hour's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



duration will cost the Ministry of Culture about $120  to

$170.  The  average  cost is about $150.  If  we  are  to

produce  our  own  films locally, with local  talent  and

local  material, it will cost us anything  from  $850  to

$3,500. This gives us an average cost of $2,000. This  is

the  minimum  amount of expenses that any  film  producer

must  incur  in  producing  a  film  of  half  an  hour's

duration. The reason for the high cost is that we have no

markets for us to sell or to rent out these films.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, there is no avenue for us to rent out our

films to other parts of the world so as to defray part of

the  expenses incurred in the production of these  films.

However,  we cannot forever depend on films from  foreign

countries;  and  particularly on the  Chinese  programmes

side  we  are,  in fact, running short of  supplies.  The

source  of  supply  is  Hong Kong  and  the  quality  and

contents of some of these films from Hong Kong are not up

to  expectations and standard for television. In view  of

the  concern  expressed  by Members  yesterday  afternoon

about  the  censorship of films, we find ourselves  in  a

very difficult position because television programming is

a  daily affair, unlike a normal cinema where a film like

James  Bond 007, for example, can perhaps be shown for  a

period of two months. But on a television programme,  the

film  has to be changed every day. Therefore, in time  to

come,  we  will run out of supplies, and we must  on  our

part  take  the  initiative to remedy our  dependence  on

foreign T.V. film distributors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this cannot be done until our new studio is

completed  in  mid-1966, and as  I  said  in  this  House

yesterday  afternoon,  the facilities  are  limited.  But

these  are  technical aspects. The other difficulty  that

confronts  us  is  the availability of talent.  Now,  the

standard  of  talent  does  not necessarily  satisfy  the

requirements  of  television. So the difficulty  in  this

matter  is  manifold, and with the purchase of  this  new

machine,  and together with the new facilities  available

in  the  new studio, we hope in the future to be able  to

produce more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>



locally  orientated films, notwithstanding the fact  that

this  may  cost the Government a considerable  amount  of

money.

would like to ask the Minister concerned whether he  will

consider  providing  at least one of  the  50  children's

playgrounds  in  my  constituency and  also  improve  the

beaches at or around Ponggol Point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Discussion may also range over Amendment

(3) .



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Perhaps you are aware,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, as well as most hon. Members  in  this

House, that Long Beach in California, where international

beauty  contests  are held, as well as beaches  in  other

countries  like  Hawaii, is today the most  famous  beach

resort in the world. That being so, it has attracted many

tourists  to  that country besides providing  its  people

with good social amenities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tourism in our country, though in its infancy, is

progressing  steadily  into a  dollar  earning  industry.

Therefore,  it is my hope that our Government could  turn

our  beaches both in the east and west of Singapore  into

proper  seaside resorts not only for our people to  spend

their leisure hours but also to provide good amenities to

tourists, so that tourism can further progress.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, I agree

whole-heartedly with the Member for Mountbatten on his point to

attract  tourists. Definitely this is one of our purposes

-  to  beautify  our beaches as well as to  provide  more

amenities on our beaches and make them attractive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, however, may I answer the Member for

Punggol  on  the  two separate subheads?  First,  he  has

raised the question of children's playgrounds. As far  as

the  programme  for children's playgrounds is  concerned,

the  Ministry is to provide 50 new children's playgrounds

over  a  period of five years, at the rate  of,  say,  10

playgrounds each year. Each playground will have a  lawn,

compound, swings and see-saws. It will be about  an  acre

in  area. As far as possible, these playgrounds  will  be

sited  in  areas  where  the need is  greatest,  but,  of

course,  the  main consideration will be the availability

of  suitable  sites. Consideration can be  given  to  the

provision of a children's playground in the Punggol  area

provided that the Government is satisfied that there is a

need for such a playground and also if a suitable site is

available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other matter brought up by the Member for

Punggol  concerning  the improvements  of  beaches,  this

project  is  for the improvement of beaches along  Nicoll

Drive,  which  has proved to be one of the  most  popular

seaside  resorts in Singapore. Selected sites  along  the

beach  will  be  developed and  planted  with  trees  and

flowery shrubs and beauty added to the scenery. The beach

will also be kept clear of rubbish and debris and special

receptacles will be provided



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>



for the dumping of rubbish by members of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As available funds are limited, it is proposed in the

first  phase  to  develop the beach along  Nicoll  Drive.

There are no plans at the moment to develop the beach  at

Punggol which is, in fact, not as popular as the beach at

the north-eastern end, i.e. Changi and Pasir Ris.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad to hear

the  Parliamentary Secretary say that our Government will

consider building children's playgrounds on merit.  I  am

sure that in all or most of the rural constituencies such

playgrounds will be an added means of recreation  to  the

many under-privileged children in such constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to raise one more question, and that

is, if I were to help in locating a suitable site for the

consideration   of   building   a   playground   in    my

constituency, would the Minister concerned consider  this

matter seriously?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Yes, I will.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> In that case, Sir, I beg leave to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D 07 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Inche Mohd

Ariff Bin Suradi ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D 07 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 007.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi? He is not

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D 07 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 009.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, subhead 009 is in respect of the

installation  of  Parking  Places  including  Kiosks  and

Signs. I would like to ask the Minister whether there  is

a  Committee  in  existence which meet  and  approve  new

parking  places  to  be installed;  if  so,  whether  due

consideration  can be given to the business  premises  in

the  area,  because  where the space  in  front  of  such

premises  is  taken  up  for  parking,  this  in  a   way

jeopardises  the  business.  In  many  constituencies,  I

believe  that the owners or occupiers of houses  find  it

very difficult either to carry on with their business  or

their private affairs, because the area in front of their

houses is being used for parking places.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to consider whether

some  consideration could be given to occupiers  of  such

premises  or  business  concerns  by  providing   certain

parking lots free for common use; that is to say, without

all  the  parking lots being taken up. Another suggestion

is  that if the parking lot in front of a house is  taken

up,  the resident can get priority to use another parking

lot  by  paying  a  monthly fee,  so  that  there  is  no

restriction on the resident's use of the place.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am a bit confused

by  the  Member  for  River Valley. I am  just  wondering

whether  he wants the parking lots in front of businesses

or  shops to be reserved free for the shops concerned, or

whether  he wants them to pay a certain sum of money  for

the  sole  right of using the parking place in  front  of

their shops, or whether he wants parking lots abolished.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he can clarify this, Sir, perhaps I may be able to

answer him.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Member was advocating the

second course, if I remember him correctly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> What I am trying to ask the

Minister  is  that if a place has to be earmarked  for  a

parking place, then due consideration should be given  to

the occupiers of houses or shops in that area first.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I think the Member for River Valley in

his  earlier  statement  did  say  that  the  marking  of

frontages  for  parking does affect the business  of  the

shops.  I  do  not know whether he has thought  carefully

over  this  matter,  because if we were  to  reserve  the

frontages  solely  for the use of  the  shops,  then  the

customers would have no place to park their cars and  the

shops would be more affected that way; whereas if it were

left  to  the members of the public to make use of  these

parking places, then it would be easier for the customers

or intending customers to park their cars, so that on the

whole  the shops would not suffer. In fact, I would  like

to  inform  the  House that when the parking  scheme  was

first introduced there was an outcry from the shopkeepers

that  this would result in loss of business. But after  a

trial  for several months in certain areas, it was  found

that  far from affecting the business, it did help  them,

because it meant a greater flow of cars which are  parked

along that area. If the area is left free for parking and

no  charge  is made, there are quite a lot of people  who

will  just  leave their cars there, with the result  that

shoppers  will have no chance at all to park  their  cars

there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his question whether special consideration

would  be  given to shops whose frontages are marked  for

parking  lots,  I  think there is in operation  a  scheme

whereby  consideration  is given  for  special  types  of

businesses.  For  instance,  the  doctors.   Where   some

doctors' premises have their frontages marked for parking

lots, then a parking lot is reserved for them, so that in

cases of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>



emergency, their patients can come to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Amendment (3) also stood in the names of Mr Teong Eng Siong and Mr Lim Cheng Lock.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, my intention is not to criticise the

administration of the Housing and Development Board or to

criticise any errors or malpractices in relation  to  the

Housing  and  Development Board. I merely  want  to  make

certain constructive criticisms to enable the Housing and

Development Board to build better houses and to transform

Singapore  into a better city under the second  Five-Year

plan.   I  quite  appreciate  the  efficiency  and  great

achievements of the Board under the last Five-Year  Plan,

and  everybody appreciates them. The Board is  under  the

direction  of our Government and I want to speak  on  it,

not  just to praise it. All the people in South-East Asia

have praised the achievements of the Board. Even visitors

from  Eastern  and Western European countries  have  also

praised the achievements of the Board. This is a concrete

fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to say in connection with this item is that

simple  houses  were  built in the past,  and  they  were

mostly   six-storey   or   five-storey   flats,   usually

rectangular in shape. They look like this in this picture

[indicating]. Mr Speaker, you can see that this  is  the

type of houses that were built in the past under the last

Five-Year   Development  Plan.  Under  that   Plan,   the

Government of Singapore built low-cost houses in order to

accommodate people of the lower income-group, and also to

enable people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



of  the  middle  class  to live  in  them.  The  previous

Government  was  not able to solve the  housing  shortage

problem. So when we came to power, we laid stress on  the

housing  development  plan and we  put  forward  a  crash

programme  to build a flat every 45 minutes in  order  to

meet the needs of the people. At that time we were trying

to  build flats quickly to accommodate as many people  as

possible,  and at the same time we were trying to  fulfil

our objectives to the people. So the plans for the houses

during that period were very simple, because they were of

cheaper quality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now feel that such a period has passed. The number of

houses  built  by the Housing and Development  Board  has

actually  exceeded what was stipulated  in  the  previous

Five-Year  Plan.  The target has been  exceeded.  In  the

Second  Five-Year  Development Plan, I  feel  that  there

should be certain changes in the designs of the flats  to

be built. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

National Development has also touched upon this.  He  has

also  said  that Singapore today is quite different  from

what it was 15 years ago. I agree with him that we should

progress  with the times, and we should have new  designs

for  our  future  houses to be built by the  Housing  and

Development  Board. The old type of flats  built  by  the

Board  during  the  past five years should  give  way  to

modern flats designed to keep pace with our progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the people who lived in Housing and

Development Board flats might not have cars. So the roads

around   such  flats  may  not  be  suitable   today   to

accommodate  the present volume of traffic.  The  streets

and  roads inside the estates are crowded with  cars.  We

know that the people staying in flats in areas like Tiong

Bahru  and  Queenstown  own cars. There  is  insufficient

space  for the parking of cars. The old plans should  now

be  corrected  to  meet  the new requirements  of  today,

because the situation today is quite different from  that

of  before. Therefore, we should change the plans of  the

houses to make them more beautiful so that our city  will

be more modernised, befitting the title of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



the  "New  York  of Malaysia", as it was once  called  by

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The type of flats at the moment is of a one-room unit,

a  two-room  unit, or a three-room unit. As I have  said,

some  flats are meant for sale and others are for renting

out. Why cannot the Government proceed now to build units

with  three bedrooms and one hall, because there are many

large families with more than 10 members? Therefore,  the

building of houses should be based on the actual needs of

the  people  and  should not follow the old  trend  as  a

matter  of  course. The present living  standard  is  not

quite  suitable for the future needs of our  people,  and

the  common corridors perhaps could be somewhat corrected

to  enable  people  with a slightly  higher  standard  of

living  to  rent  or  buy Housing and  Development  Board

flats, so that they can have more ideal accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point concerns roads which should be

broadened.  Consideration should also  be  given  to  the

question of parking spaces in order to accommodate  cars.

At the moment, because of the shortage of car parks, some

residents  have to park their cars on the roads alongside

the  white  traffic lines. Traffic Police are  unable  to

fine  such car-owners, because, in actual fact, there  is

no space to park the cars. The present situation is quite

a   headache   to  the  residents  of  the  Housing   and

Development Board flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what I say is mainly on these two points. I hope the

Minister concerned will consider my suggestions  so  that

under our next Five-Year Development Plan, Singapore will

be more beautiful with more modernised flats built by the

Housing and Development Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, under

this subhead, the allocation is $45 million for 1966  for

14,000  flats. This sum of money is quite a large one.  I

know   that  there  are  many  people  who  need  housing

accommodation. Although the Government has  built  60,000

flats  of  the two-room or three-room type for people  of

the lower income group, according to the actual situation

now, we need to build more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



houses and flats in order to meet the requirements of the

people. I understand that flats are mainly built  in  the

city  area  - in Queenstown and Toa Payoh. In  the  rural

areas, it seems that no flats are being built; the  rural

areas have been overlooked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Minister concerned should look into

this  matter  because ours is a developing  country.  The

construction  plans  of  our  country  should  take  into

consideration all parts of the island - not only the city

area but all the rural areas - so that there is a balance

in respect of housing development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope that the Minister concerned will allot part

of this sum to build houses in the rural areas, including

the surrounding islands. I refer to such areas as Changi,

Tampines, Punggol, Nee Soon and Sembawang. The people  in

these  areas,  I  understand, need housing accommodation.

The  houses  at the moment are very small,  dirty,  quite

untidy and mostly in a dilapidated state. Thus the people

who  live  in  them  risk their lives  if  there  is  any

outbreak  of  fire.  The  Fire  Brigade  has  very   poor

equipment to deal with this situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if the Government will build more houses in the

rural  areas, this will be welcomed by the rural  people,

and  this  will also show that the Government is carrying

out  the policy of building houses both for the urban and

rural  people.  The housing plans should be  carried  out

equally both in the rural and city areas. Moreover,  land

prices in the rural areas are cheaper. So I hope that the

Government will build more houses in the rural areas, and

rent them out to the rural people at low rentals, because

their  income  is somewhat less than that  of  the  urban

people.  Low  rentals will be more in  keeping  with  the

living standard of the rural people.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like the Minister to pay attention to the

building standards of the flats built. For instance,  the

flats  in Queenstown have cracks in the walls. Some flats

have  been built to last for 99 years, but after a period

of only two or three years, some cracks appear in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



walls of certain flats in the Queenstown and Tanjong  Rhu

areas  and  elsewhere.  What is the  cause?  I  hope  the

Minister concerned will look into the matter and see that

the  building materials used for the flats are up to  the

standards stipulated, so that in future there will be  no

such flats of poor quality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also other shortcomings in regard to the

lifts  in these flats. They usually go out of order,  and

the  lights  suddenly  go  out. This  inconveniences  the

residents, especially the children. When they are trapped

inside  the lifts, they cry aloud but they are not heard.

Therefore,  there  should be more  proper  management  of

these lifts in the flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is that the lifts are very unhygenic

because  of  poor maintenance. Some children pass  motion

inside  the  lifts  which usually  stink.  Of  course,  I

understand that it is not the sole responsibility of  the

Housing  and  Development  Board,  but  if  the  Ministry

concerned will look into it and try to seek some  way  to

improve the situation, of course, things will improve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Housing and Development Board plans to have a

Residents' Committee to run and manage the flats they are

living in, I suggest that the authorities concerned  will

encourage  the residents to join this Committee  so  that

special  paid  staff can be engaged  to  look  after  the

lifts, thus helping to solve the employment problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will look into it.

sufficient  units of houses to meet the  demands  of  the

people  of  Singapore. I believe when the First Five-Year

Plan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



was  completed, it did satisfy the needs of  our  people.

Now we are embarking on the Second Five-Year Plan, and in

this  item there is a sum of $45 million for loan to  the

Housing  and  Development Board to carry out this  Second

Five-Year Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to the Minister that our policy for this Plan

should  be for more of our people to own their own homes.

I  believe with the improved standard of living  and  the

economic  position  of  our  country  today,  this  is  a

possibility. In the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  Address  on

the   policy  debate,  I  mentioned  that  one   of   the

difficulties the people who wish to own their  own  homes

would face is the down-payment which a person would  have

to  pay  before he could own a home. I asked the Minister

in  charge  if  he  could look into  the  possibility  of

whether  contributors to the Central Provident Fund,  who

have sufficient funds standing to their credit, could use

their  funds as surety to buy one of these Housing  Board

homes. This means that if that person's money can be used

as   a  surety,  he  would  have  to  pay  slightly  more

instalments over a period of, say, 10 to 15 years. And if

this is possible, I am sure there will be more people who

would be able to own their own homes and thus assist  the

Government financially, in that they do not have to  seek

more  money  to  build homes and then rent  them  out  to

people who can afford to buy these homes on instalments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the latest report of the Central Provident

Fund  Board  which has just been released, No.  S  13  of

1965,  there are over 14,000 contributors who  have  over

$900  in  their savings. If this plan is possible,  there

would  be over 14,000 contributors who would be  able  to

buy   homes  without  a  down-payment,  by  using   their

contributions in the Central Provident Fund as a  surety.

I  hope  the  Minister  for Law and National  Development

could look into this possibility.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Any other Member wishing to speak before

I call upon the Minister? Mr Barker.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the speeches of our

Backbenchers  reflect  the  feelings  of  the  people  of

Singapore, then I would say that these people  are  never

satisfied.  I  think  everyone  knows  that  our  housing

projects have won recognition not only in South-East Asia

but  in  the  whole world. It was only recently  that  my

predecessor,  who,  in  fact, is  the  one  Minister  who

succeeded  in  solving the housing problem in  Singapore,

was awarded the Magsaysay Award for his community work in

building houses in this city of ours and thereby  helping

to  house  about  one-quarter of the population  of  this

town.   Instead  of  being  grateful,  I  see  that   our

Backbenchers are even asking for more and more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can deal first with the hon. Member for Delta. She

says  our  houses  are simple, they  are  rectangular  in

shape, we have passed the phase when housing was really a

shortage,  and therefore we should change the designs.  I

do  not know what she wants. Probably something circular!

But  we have looked into this matter and given it careful

consideration, and the view is that the present structure

and  the  pattern  of these rectangular blocks  with  the

minimum  space wasted is the most efficient and  economic

in  the  circumstances. And since the lowering of housing

cost  is  of  primary importance in public  housing,  the

Government cannot at the moment change the shape of these

flats just for the sake of appearance. That was her first

point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point she referred to was about the roads

within  the  housing flats and also the  parking  spaces.

Here  again,  Mr  Speaker, Sir,  having  regard  to  the

fundamental  fact  that the Board is  providing  low-cost

housing  at  subsidised rentals for people in  the  lower

income  group,  it is firmly against any  change  in  the

present  policy  of providing one car-parking  space  for

every  six  units of two- and three-room  flats,  and  15

units of one-room flats. Extensive road improvements have

been  carried out, and will be carried out  in  our  next

Five-Year Plan to facilitate the flow of traffic  to  and

into and out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>



of  housing  estates,  but  within  the  housing  estates

themselves, the standard 36-foot wide road will  continue

to  be  provided.  The Public Works Department  has  many

plans  to  improve  the  many road  systems  linking  the

housing estates to different parts of the city. There are

many such schemes, Mr Speaker, but I will not bother you

with further details on these schemes.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point raised by the Member for Delta was that

we  should build flats of three rooms with a hall. I  can

assure  the Member that the Board has introduced  several

new  types  of  flats for our Second  Five-Year  Plan  in

addition to our standard one-, two- and three-room flats.

For  example,  a one-room improved type of  flat  with  a

floor  area  of  340 square feet is being  introduced  as

another  standard plan. This improved one-room  flat,  in

fact,  attracted considerable interest when a  full-scale

furnished model was displayed at the exhibition  in  July

1965   in  Outram  Road.  This  type  of  flat  is  being

constructed  in Toa Payoh, Kallang Basin  and  the  Tiong

Bahru fire site. The rental of these flats will be $30 as

against  the  emergency type one-room  flat  at  $20  per

month. Further an improved three-room flat has also  been

introduced into our standard plan. This type of flat will

have  a  separate bathroom and water closet and  also  an

enlarged balcony. The floor area will be about 80  square

feet  bigger than the standard three-room flats of  about

550  to  630 square feet. The Board has also proposed  to

construct  a small number of four-room flats for

bigger-sized  families.  In fact, 472 units of  these  four-room

flats  will be built at the corner of Alexandra Road  and

Henderson Road. The proposed rental will be in the region

of  about  $100  a  month. I think that disposes  of  the

points raised by the Member for Delta.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the Member for Sembawang. He wants us to

build flats in the rural areas. I say first things first.

Let  us  not run before we can walk. The urgent need  for

houses is in the urban and semi-urban districts. If we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



build flats in the rural areas, I doubt whether they will

all  be  occupied. In the rural areas the folk are mostly

farmers  or  fishermen.  They  need  land  on  which   to

cultivate their crops or rear chickens and, at the moment

anyway, we do not think we should start building flats in

these  areas. Besides, the population is not very  dense,

and  if any rural farmer or fisherman desires a flat,  he

can  always  shift from the rural areas and apply  for  a

flat  in  town. As far as the rural areas are  concerned,

Mr  Speaker,  we feel that we should provide  the  rural

folks,   firstly,   with  water   and,   secondly,   with

electricity and, lastly, with housing accommodation. Most

of   our  efforts  at  the  moment  are  concentrated  on

extending the water and electricity supply throughout the

island, and in particular to the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang complained about some of the

flats in Queenstown having cracks in the walls. I am glad

he  said  "some"!  Mr Speaker, Sir,  it  is  practically

impossible  to  build so many flats in Singapore  without

some  of  them  having  cracks.  But  these  cracks,  are

remedied  when  complaints are sent in. As  long  as  the

houses do not topple down and kill the occupants, I think

if  I were in their place, I would be quite happy to have

a flat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member complains about the lifts breaking

down.  May I remind the Member that lifts not only  break

down  in Housing Board flats, but also in other buildings

in  Singapore? And as far as the flats in Queenstown  are

concerned, the lifts probably break down because  of  the

residents or their children. And if the children, as  the

hon.  Member complains, do things in the lift which  they

should not do, surely one cannot blame the Housing Board.

The  occupants  of  these flats should look  after  their

children.  But on this point I am glad to note  that  the

hon.  Member  said that the Housing Board is  not  solely

responsible.  He  has also asked us to provide  staff  to

look  after the lifts. This, I think, explains  my  point

that  they are never satisfied. You provide them  with  a

house;  you provide them with a lift; they want staff  to

up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>



and  down the lift and to look after it. I say that there

is a limit to what we can do for the people.



I  come  now  to the point raised by the hon. Member  for

River  Valley  who  says  that we should  encourage  more

people  to own their own homes or flats. I say that  this

is  a  good  policy.  We would be happy  if  everyone  in

Singapore owns his own house. That is a Utopia  to  which

we can look forward, but I do not think we can accomplish

it in the near future. But his main point is the funds or

monies  in the Central Provident Fund. He would  like  to

know  whether the contributors to this fund can  withdraw

their  contributions and use the money to pay  the  first

instalment  or "surety" that is needed when  one  buys  a

flat. Mr Speaker. Sir, I am not in charge of the Central

Provident Fund. I believe it is the Minister for  Labour.

But  as  far as I am aware, there is no provision in  the

Central Provident Fund Ordinance to allow contributors to

withdraw their contribution, to use the money ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I make a

point of clarification?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not say

withdraw the contributors' provident fund. I said to come

to an arrangement whereby their contributions can be used

as a surety. That does not mean a withdrawal.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In other words, the monies will remain in

the fund?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> If, as the hon. Member says, the money

remains in the fund, then that is money that will not  be

available until the contributor reaches the age of 55 and

retires  from  work or retires earlier; which  means  the

money is there, but the Housing Board has to wait for the

money. However, there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>



no   provision  in  the  Ordinance  for  contributors  to

withdraw  the money or for the contributors to charge  or

mortgage the money which belongs to them in the Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, the Government is of the view

that  in  order  to  make anything  worth  while,  it  is

necessary  that  the person who benefits must  make  some

effort  by  himself to obtain this something. Free  gifts

are  seldom appreciated, and it will be wrong to make  it

too  easy for anyone to own his house without some effort

on his part. It is for this reason that there are schemes

to  encourage savings so that down-payments  for  Housing

Board flats can be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with a little effort, I believe the

intending purchaser can surely save $900 or $1,200  as  a

down-payment  required  for a two-room  or  a  three-room

flat.  Besides,  he  will also learn  to  appreciate  his

purchase much better if it is obtained by some effort  on

his own part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I believe the building of flood

alleviation  works  in  the Geylang  area  is  to  reduce

flooding,  and I believe this includes Geylang Serai  and

Kampong Kembangan. Before, Kampong Kembangan Constituency

was an area which seldom experienced floods, but now with

this  flood  alleviation  measure  in  Geylang.  It   has

experienced many floods.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flood alleviation works in Geylang have been built, but

the  drains  around the Kampong Kembangan area  have  not

been repaired, and when the rain falls for a short while,

the  Kampong  Kembangan area is flooded and  animals  and

plants  are  destroyed.  Now is the  best  time  for  the

Minister  for  Law  and National  Development  to  visit

Kampong  Kembangan Constituency, because it  is  now  the

rainy season, and he will he able to see for himself  the

condition  of  the drains in this area. I would  like  to

know from him whether the drains will be repaired.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, the whole area of

Geylang Serai is low-lying and drainage in this area is

totally inadequate. The drains are too small and there is

hardly any gradient for water to drain off. Therefore, it

obviously inevitable that flooding will occur whenever

there are heavy showers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proper and adequate drainage for this low-lying

area  is entirely dependent upon the construction of  the

main  outward drains provided in Phase 4 of  the  Geylang

Flood  Alleviation  Scheme.  This  scheme  has  not  been

implemented  all these years because of the  presence  of

thousands  of  squatters. However, as a  temporary  flood

relief  measure, the Government is all the time  prepared

to clear the drain to relieve the present position.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the

Parliamentary Secretary has just now said the  Government

is  all  the  time  prepared to clear  the  drains  as  a

temporary  measure. I would like to  ask  him,  has  this

measure been taken or will it be taken?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, I can assure the hon.

Member  for  Kampong Kembangan that my  Ministry  is  now

looking into this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scheme to convert Orchard Road into a one-way

system (including New Road and Intersections) will affect

my constituency and that of the Minister for Finance, and

I  would like to know if the Minister could give us  some

details  of  this  scheme as to how  they  are  going  to

convert Orchard Road into a one-wav system and where they

propose to site the new road and intersections.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the existing Orchard Road

with traffic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>



flowing in either direction is getting very congested and

is,  in  fact,  hardly  capable  of  taking  any  further

increase in traffic. Traffic jams are particularly severe

during the rush hours, and for this reason it is proposed

to convert this road into a one-way system by routing the

other one-way traffic along one or more of the many roads

running in line or somewhat parallel to Orchard Road, for

example, Somerset Road, Devonshire or Grange Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, in fact, two or more alternative routes

which   are  being  investigated  by  the  Public   Works

Department  in conjunction with the Planning  Department.

It is only after these investigations have been completed

that  I  will have more details for the hon.  Member  for

River  Valley.  But  it is only after the  investigations

have  been completed to the satisfaction not only of  the

P.W.D. and  the  Planning Department  but  also  of  the

implemented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, just now I spoke about the bad drainage

system  of  Kampong Kembangan. Now I would like  to  talk

about the roads in Kampong Kembangan which are very  bad.

You can say that 90 per cent of the roads there are earth

roads. When it rains, the roads become muddy, and when it

is  hot, the roads are full of dust. Petitions have  been

made several times and also during the time when the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>



Prime  Minister visited Kampong Kembangan,  and  requests

were  also  made through the U.R.S.C. but up to  now  the

kampong roads in the Kampong Kembangan area have not been

repaired  yet.  I  would like to know from  the  Minister

concerned when they could be repaired so as to  give  the

kampong people the use of better roads.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, last year's

vote for this item was $490,000, and this year we have  a

vote  of  $700,000.  The increase  of  $210,000  for  the

development of agricultural and kampong roads  next  year

shows  that  the  present Government is stepping  up  its

efforts  to  give  kampong people better road  facilities

next year. It has always been the Government's policy  to

provide  the same facilities not only to the urban  areas

but  also  to the rural areas. Sir, I wonder whether  the

Minister  will  give priority to the  making  up  of  the

following  roads  in  my constituency.  They  are:  Jalan

Saksama, Jalan Greja, Siak Kuan Road, Main Road at  Pulau

Tekong Besar and Jalan Darat Nanas. Jalan Darat Nanas,  I

think,  should be given immediate attention, because  the

compound  of Changi Prison is now fenced and  declared  a

protected  area.  There is a kampong  behind  the  prison

called  Kampong  Darat Nanas, and  more  than  a  hundred

houses  are situated there. The people make use of  Jalan

Awan  which  is  in  the compound of  Changi  Prison  for

getting  into the kampong. They have been making  use  of

this  road  for more than 25 years. Now that  the  prison

compound  is fenced, there is no other through road,  and

this   is  very  inconvenient  for  the  kampong   folks,

especially the school children. Sir, I wrote a letter  to

the  Chairman of the U.R.S.C. dated 15th of  July,  1965,

and something was done to level up the reserve road, i.e.

Jalan Darat Nanas, for which I must be thankful. Sir, two

months have elapsed and this road has become inaccessible

due to pot-holes caused by heavy rain. Therefore, I shall

be  extremely  grateful if the Minister could  look  into

this matter with great urgency.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, about 3,000 to 4,000 people in Pulau Tekong Besar

are  making use of the only road in the pulau. This  road

is  now in a very bad condition and cannot be made use of

especially  during the rainy season. I hope the  Minister

concerned  will give special consideration to the  making

up of this road as soon as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I too have similar

complaints about the poor condition of some of the  roads

in  my  constituency.  I  notice  some  roads  have  been

metalled in my constituency but no drains have been made,

i.e. roads  are metalled without drains on  both  sides.

Very  often  these  roads do not last  long.  Also,  such

kampong  and  agricultural roads are made up of  laterite

and,  when  repaired,  will last for  only  a  couple  of

months. Heavy thunderstorms will wash away what has  been

put on top of these roads. Sir, I would suggest that,  as

far  as  possible, every effort should be made  to  metal

such  roads  and  also to provide drains so  that  public

funds  will  be  spent usefully. It is better  than  just

repairing the road by dumping and levelling a few hundred

lorry  loads of earth because after some time, if a heavy

storm comes along, it washes away all this earth. So  the

funds  are  not worthily spent. Sir, I would request  the

Minister concerned to look into this matter and  give  it

due thought.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Carry on.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I wish to refer to

the work of the Urban and Rural Services Committee in

Singapore. The work done by it is well known. But is the

Minister aware that in the rural areas the roads and

bridges are not constructed in a practical manner? Their

construction is a waste. In the rural areas the roads

built are laterite roads. If a car were to pass over a

road after a rainstorm, the whole road would be damaged.

On the average a rural road will have to be repaired

after only six months. If the Urban and Rural Services

Committee could allocate more money for the building of

better roads, these roads do not need to be repaired

after only a few months. When we look at these roads

during the day-time, we can see dust flying about. This

is rather unhygienic to the rural people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to bridges, if a heavy lorry were to pass

over  one of these wooden structures, it may collapse.  I

hope  the  Minister  will  prohibit  heavy  lorries  from

passing  over these bridges and roads. This is  the  only

way to keep them in good condition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which I would like to bring up is the

request  made by rural people for the building  of  roads

and   bridges.  These  are  urgently  required  by  them.

Although  these requests have been approved by the  Urban

and  Rural Services Committee - and there are cases where

six  months have elapsed since the approval was

given - nothing  was  done. I hope once approval has been  given,

work  can commence after three months. But there are some

roads and bridges in my constituency which have not  been

built even though their construction has been approved by

the  Urban  and Rural Services Committee. If Mr  Speaker

will  approve  of  it,  I  will  quote  two  examples  to

substantiate  my point. This is a notice from  the  Urban

and  Rural Services Committee. The excerpt says  that  if

within  three  months no work is carried  out,  then  the

Urban  and Rural Services Committee can be asked to  give

an explanation. There is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



one  agricultural road in Kampong Kimpong and  two  roads

which  pass  over  wooden bridges and which  need  to  be

repaired. The plan for their construction was approved on

22nd  March  this year. Although I have investigated  the

matter,  the Urban and Rural Services Committee  has  not

given me any satisfactory answer. The minute given to  me

was  dated the 22nd of March, saying that plans have been

approved to repair the bridges and the roads. Nine months

have already elapsed and I have yet to see the roads  and

bridges  being  repaired.  I hope  the  Minister  or  the

Parliamentary  Secretary  concerned  will   give   me   a

satisfactory  explanation as  to  why  such  work  should

always be delayed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Kampong  Kembangan  has  raised the  question  about  the

kampong roads in his constituency. According to him, most

of   the  requests  which  were  made  during  our  Prime

Minister's visit to his constituency were submitted to my

Ministry,  but  they were not carried out.  This  is  not

true.  For example, in 1965, the Urban and Rural Services

Committee has already approved an amount of $106,845  for

the improvement of kampong roads, drainage, the provision

of stand-pipes and other social amenities. Sir, the Urban

and  Rural  Services  Committee  has  to  look  after  51

constituencies,  and  not  only  one  or  two  particular

constituencies.  As  such, the vote allocated  should  be

spread out to 51 constituencies. So you will see that for

that one constituency we are spending over $100,000. This

is a very special case. I also want to draw the attention

of  the  Member  for Kampong Kembangan to the  fact  that

before   the  P.A.P.  Government  came  to  power,  Kampong

Kembangan was totally neglected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi has requested for repairs to

Jalan  Nanas.  This  road  leads  to  the  Changi  Prison

compound, and there are about one hundred houses there. I

can  assure the Member that the engineer in charge of the

area  concerned has been asked to investigate the  matter

and when the estimate of cost is ready, it will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



submitted  for the consideration of the Urban  and  Rural

Services Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the road at Pulau Tekong Besar, this is a

very long road, probably more than three miles long,  and

its  repair will cost a huge sum of money. But we are now

looking into the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> How long?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> More than three miles long. We can

do it by stages, you know!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol complained that there is very

little  improvement to the road repairs  in  the  kampong

area. Sir, he is a member of the Urban and Rural Services

Committee  and  this type of problem can  be  raised  and

discussed at Committee level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the Member for Ulu Pandan's complaint about

the  project approved by the U.R.S.C. in March, and  that

no  work  has since been carried out, I have  to  explain

here  that  he is referring to Kampong Kim Ho. This  area

has  been  acquired by the Housing Board and is earmarked

for  future  development, probably in one or  two  years'

time.  There is no point at this moment in spending  much

money  on the place when the Government is going to clear

the  area.  The  Urban and Rural Services  Committee  has

issued  a circular to all Assemblymen concerned to inform

the Committee whenever any project is not carried out  by

the Committee after it has been approved. Any Assemblyman

wishing  to do so must then write in officially  and  not

raise a verbal complaint, so that the Secretary can  take

up the matter with the Department concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan also complained that most of

the roads in the rural areas are of agricultural standard

and  not  metalled. This is entirely wrong. Mr  Speaker,

Sir, from the beginning of this year, the Urban and Rural

Services Committee has adopted a policy to metal as  many

as  possible of the kampong roads so that the  number  of

agricultural  roads will decrease. Most of these  kampong

roads  that  we  are going to repair are of  agricultural

standard. After a shower of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



rain,  the  whole road is damaged. So the  policy  is  to

metal  these kampong roads to avoid wasting public  money

on temporary repairs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, I think the Parliamentary

Secretary  has  missed my point. I was  not  in  any  way

complaining that, though I am a member of the  Urban  and

Rural  Services Committee, the question of making  drains

and  the metalling of kampong roads should be brought  up

at such sittings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must point out that, in fact, I have brought up this

point that when we metal the small kampong roads, we make

sure  that  there are drains on both sides of  the  road.

That is the point I wish to stress.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, in reply to the Member

for Punggol, I want to say that in repairing roads in the

rural  areas, the most important thing is to  repair  the

not so good roads first and the next stage is to consider

the  drainage system. To give an example, I remember that

at one place

-  I  forgot  the  name of the road - we  provided  earth

drains  along a road but after two or three  months  they

disappeared.  The  reason is that  everybody  who  has  a

frontage  fills up the drain so that he can easily  cross

it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I am glad to say that there is

another  $100,000  to  be allocated  for  electrification

schemes  in  rural constituencies in 1966. There  is  one

little complaint I wish to make here, and that is,  there

is  a  big scheme in my area which is split up into three

phases.  One of the phases extends from the 7th milestone

Punggol  Road right up to 9� milestone Punggol  Road  and

into Serangoon Kechil. This is where I am concerned. In a

certain part of Serangoon Kechil, there are some numbered

and unnumbered attap houses whose owners have applied for

electricity   supply.   But,  unfortunately,   the   last

electrical post that carries the overhead cable stops  at

a  certain place and, therefore, a few houses have to pay

for  the  extra poles. So petitions were made to  me  and

applications were sent to the Electricity Department. The

petitions sent to me were forwarded, but up to now, after

a lapse of well over six months, nothing has been done. I

would like the Minister concerned to enlighten me on this

point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the question of jetties, I would like to know

the  number of jetties that are to be constructed in  the

Islands  next year. As regards water supply in  Track  13

off Punggol Road, requests for water supply were made  in

1963  and again this year. The residents have waited  for

more  than two full years for their request to be acceded

to,  but  unfortunately up to date, no  water  facilities

have been made available to the residents in that area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding minor works in kampong areas, as I have

suggested just now, when roads are repaired, it is better

that  we  spend a little more money to metal as  many  of

them as possible and to construct some drains within  the

sum  allocated  for this purpose. When I say  "construct"

drains, I do not mean just earth drains which are covered

up  after a shower. What I mean is lining the drains with

concrete slabs so that public funds are well spent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister concerned will enlighten me on the

points that I have raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, "That the sum to be

allocated  for Head D 08 be reduced by $10 in respect  of

item  004 of subhead 016." In speaking on this amendment,

Members  may also speak on amendments (8), (9) and  (11).

Amendment  (11) also stands in the name of Mr  Sim  Boon

Woo - he may speak on this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> I am not moving.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Punggol  has asked about the applications for electricity

to the kampong houses. He complains that the applications

were sent in a few months ago and that no action has been

taken. If he can give me more details of those people who

have  already submitted their applications, I can  assure

him that I will take up the matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also asked how many jetties will be

constructed in the Southern Islands. There is a provision

for   jetties,  $100,000  provided  for  next  year.  The

Government  is considering constructing 6 jetties  -5  in

the  Southern  Islands and one in Changi. The  5  in  the

Southern  Islands are: (1) Pulau Seraya, (2) Pulau  Bukom

Kechil, (3) Pulau Seking, (4) Pulau Semakau and (5) Pulau

Ayer  Merbau.  These 5 are in the Southern  Islands,  and

Kampong  Panghang, Pulau Tekong, that is in  Changi.  The

estimated cost of all these jetties is about $80,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also raised the question of water supply

to  rural  areas  in Track 13. Sir, the Urban  and  Rural

Services Committee this year has already approved $88,400

for  the Punggol constituency. The sum of money is  spent

on  the  repair  of  roads as well as  on  providing  for

standpipes and water supply. He should be satisfied, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever it is repair to a major road to provide for

drainage, the Committee will consider it, but not  for  a

small track or a small lane to provide the drainage.  The

cost of the drainage in this case will cost more than the

road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think a lot of praise has been sung

for  the Housing and Development Board. In fact,  it  has

been  over-emphasized, but there is  one  sector  in  the

P.W.D.,   I  think,  which  has  been  going  on  quietly

developing,  widening and generally improving  the  roads

for  the  people  of Singapore. So far it  has  not  been

acknowledged except by the Member for Changi yesterday. I

think  it is only proper that the good work done  by  the

engineers  and  staff of the P.W.D. for  the  people  of

Singapore should go down on record. I think we should  be

grateful  to  them for the fine stretches of  roads  that

they have laid and are laying, otherwise the movement  of

traffic will be impeded and we will not be able to get to

our  destination on time. I think this is another achieve

ment we should be proud of, besides housing.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The debate on the Second Reading of the

Bill may now proceed. The Question is, "That the Bill  be

now read a Second time."



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, though I am grateful

to  the  Minister for Labour for presenting  before  this

House



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



a Bill to amend the Industrial Relations Ordinance, 1962,

I  have some comments to make, especially in relation  to

the proposed amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first comment is in respect of clause 8 of the Bill

in which it is proposed to include new section 15A in the

Ordinance.  I  gladly  welcome  the  move  to  bring  the

question  of union recognition by an employer within  the

scope  of  the  Ordinance by treating recognition  as  an

industrial matter. But my concern is that the question of

union  recognition does not seem to be  adequately  dealt

with  in the proposed amendment. I refer to the fact that

a  union may not be granted recognition by an employer if

the  result of a secret ballot shows that the trade union

does not represent the majority of the employees or class

of employees in respect of whom the right to represent is

claimed  by the trade union, as stated in subsection  (3)

of the proposed section 15A.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am bringing up this point because, once this

Bill  is  passed  by  this House  and  becomes  law,  the

question  of  union recognition becomes  very  vital  and

crucial to any union, and until a union has been accorded

recognition  by  an  employer  in  accordance  with   the

provisions  of  the proposed section, the  union  has  no

right to represent the employees vis-a-vis the employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem of union recognition does not arise in the

case  of  an  established industry or  undertaking  where

unionisation has taken place or has been taking place for

some  time.  In  such  a case, the  provision  for  union

recognition  as  set  out  in  the  proposed  section  is

adequate, because unionisation of workers will have taken

place.  The  problem then would likely be one of  whether

Union A or Union B should be given the right to represent

the  workers. In such a situation, where two rival unions

compete for the right to represent the workers - I repeat

once  more  here  -  I agree that the  provision  of  the

proposed  amendment deals adequately with the problem  of

resolving  which  union is to be accorded  the  right  to

represent the employees. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>



do not think there will be any disagreement among Members

in this House that they would not consider it unfair that

the union which obtains the majority of votes in a secret

ballot  should  be given the sole right to represent  the

workers  vis-a-vis the employer. What I have in  mind  is

this,  that  in the case of a new industry or undertaking

where unionisation is in the process of taking place  and

in  such a case where a union has only started to move in

and  organise the workers, it is plain common sense  that

it  will  take some time before the union can  enrol  the

majority  of  workers in such industry or undertaking  to

become members of the union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been given to understand by the Pioneer

Industries  Employees' Union that  the  workers  in  such

industry  or  undertaking are often reluctant  to  become

members  of the union until they are convinced  that  the

union  can  do  something for them in relation  to  their

benefits,  terms  and  conditions of  service.  But  this

means,  in effect, that the workers expect the  union  to

obtain  a favourable collective agreement on their behalf

before they consent to become members of the union.  This

I  can  assure you, Sir, can make things rather difficult

for the union, because when negotiations for a collective

agreement break down - and this is highly probable in the

case of a first collective agreement - the matter will be

referred  to  the  Industrial  Arbitration  Court   whose

practice  in the case of a first collective agreement  is

to  make an award that follows the minimum provisions  of

the  prevailing employment Ordinance in Singapore. It  is

not  difficult  to  understand  here  why  these  workers

question  the  purpose of a union when it  is  unable  to

obtain  for them benefits over and above those laid  down

in the relevant employment Ordinances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the point, it would be hardly conducive to

industrial peace to allow a situation to develop where an

employer can refuse recognition to a union solely on  the

ground  that  it does not represent the majority  of  the

employees. So to prevent such a situation I suggest  that

some provision be made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



for  the Minister to direct, at his discretion, that  any

union   be   accorded   recognition   by   an   employer,

notwithstanding the fact that such a provision will  have

the  effectiveness of the proposed section  15A.  Such  a

provision,  of course, is subject to the fact  that  only

one   union  is  involved  in  this  question  of   union

recognition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have stated earlier, Sir, where two or more unions

are  competing for recognition it is only fair  that  the

union  which  obtains the majority of votes in  a  secret

ballot is entitled to represent the workers comprised  in

the  secret ballot. To extend this principle of  majority

to   a   situation  where  only  one  union  is   seeking

recognition  from  an employer is to  create  unnecessary

industrial unrest and injustice because, as I  have  said

earlier, in the case of a new industry or undertaking, it

may be difficult for a union to organise the majority  of

the workers until some time has elapsed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I would like to make in respect of this

question of union recognition is that some provision must

be  made  to safeguard the interests of workers  who  are

members  of a union which has lost out in secret  ballots

where  there  are two unions competing for the  right  to

represent  the workers. Now, according to the  provisions

of the proposed section l5A, only a successful union will

be recognised as a negotiating body for the workers. But,

as  it  often  happens, the members of  the  unsuccessful

union are liable to be victimised by the employers. I  am

fully  aware that sections 75, 76 and 77 of the Ordinance

provide  legal protection for such workers who have  been

victimised  by  the  employers. The  difficulty  lies  in

enforcing or seeking the legal protection provided  under

the  Ordinance. The difficulty lies in the fact  that  no

employer  will be so foolish as to state in  writing  the

true  reasons why he had victimised a worker. It  may  be

that the latter is engaged in trade union activities  and

also the fact that the worker, being a human being, is so

perfect  that  an employer cannot find any fault  in  his

conduct or competence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



or  efficiency  as to warrant his justification  for  the

dismissal  of the employee. I will deal with  this  point

more  fully  later. For the present, I only wish  to  add

that the successful prosecution of an employer under  the

provisions  of  sections 75, 76 and 77 of  the  Ordinance

must  be  dependent  on circumstantial  evidence  in  the

absence of better evidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employer may tell a worker in the privacy of his

office  that  it is detrimental to the interests  of  the

worker if he persists in continuing his union activities.

If the employer is brought to court and if he denies that

he  ever  made such a statement, then it is the  worker's

word  against the employer as to whether such a statement

was ever made by the employer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the difficulty facing a worker when he

seeks  to obtain redress through the ordinary law  court,

it  is  no surprise that the worker would prefer to  have

his  legitimate grievance or complaint dealt with by  the

Industrial Arbitration Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point I want to make here is that the proposed

section l5A should provide that where two or more  unions

compete  for  the right to represent the  workers,  those

workers  who have been members of the unsuccessful  union

up to the time of the secret ballot and still continue to

be members of the unsuccessful union in spite of the fact

that  this union has no locus standi in the eyes  of  the

employer, should be brought before the Arbitration  Court

by  the unsuccessful union. As I see it, this question of

union  recognition  should  be  properly  treated  as   a

question of the definition of the relationship between an

employer and a union in respect of a collective agreement

and  other incidental matters thereof. While an  employer

is  entitled to refuse to deal with any union other  than

the   one  to  whom  he  has  accorded  recognition,   in

accordance  with  the provision of the  proposed  section

15A., he should not be allowed to seek refuge behind  the

provisions of this section when he has committed  an  act

of  injustice  which  is within the jurisdiction  of  the

Industrial Arbitration Court to direct.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, I think I should remind Members that

the  Industrial Arbitration Court grants hearing only  to

an  employer or to a union - an individual worker has  no

right  to appear before the Industrial Arbitration Court.

The  Industrial Arbitration Court grants hearing only  to

an employer. So there is no opportunity for an individual

worker, if he has grievances, to appear before the Court.

Even no union can appear on his behalf, because, you see,

it   is  not  recognised  by  the  employer.  Under   the

provisions  of this proposed section 15A, the  plight  of

those workers who are members of the union which lost out

in  the secret ballot is most unenviable. Any dispute the

workers  may have with their employer cannot  be  brought

before  the  Industrial Arbitration Court, because  under

the  provisions  of section 20 (a) of  the  Ordinance,  a

joint  application by both the employer and the union  is

necessary  for  the  reference  of  the  dispute  to  the

Industrial Arbitration Court. In the situation  as  I  am

describing now, the employer will not consent to  make  a

joint  application with the union which the  employer  is

entitled  not  to  recognise as a representative  of  the

workers,  and the union which is accorded recognition  by

the  employer will be entitled to refuse to take  up  the

case of these workers who are not their members. This, in

effect,  leaves such workers without the right of redress

to the Industrial Arbitration Court. Under the provisions

of the present Ordinance, the Minister may direct such  a

dispute  as  I  have  described to  be  referred  to  the

Industrial  Arbitration  Court  in  accordance  with  the

provisions  of  section 28 (b) . But my  only  concern  is

whether  the enactment of the proposed section  15A  will

have  any effect on the Minister's right to intervene  in

the  situation I have described before. If  the  Minister

for  Labour  can give me an assurance that  it  is  still

possible,  after  the enactment of the  proposed  section

15A,  for  workers who are members of a union which  lost

out  in  a  secret ballot to obtain redress  through  the

Industrial Arbitration Court



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



in  the event of any dispute arising between them and the

employer, I shall be most satisfied.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  would like to comment on another section of  the

Bill  which is section 18 where it is proposed to  delete

the existing subsections (2) and (3) of section 39 of the

Ordinance  and  insert  in  place  thereof  another  five

subsections.   My   interest  lies  with   the   proposed

subsection  (6) wherein it is stated that an appeal  from

the  decision of a referee to the Court shall be made  in

the prescribed manner within 14 days from the date of the

referee's decision. I am of the opinion that the 14 days'

limit  for  the  making of an appeal  is  inadequate.  My

reasons  for saying so are, (a) it is nowhere  stated  in

any  of  the proposed subsections of section 39 that  the

referee  must  make  his award in  writing  or  that  the

referee  must  give the grounds of his decision  together

with his decision. I do not see how a person can make  an

appeal  unless  he knows what he is appealing  from.  The

present  system of making available transcripts of  court

proceedings  to  the  parties is  highly  unsatisfactory,

because  of  apparent  understaffing  in  the  Industrial

Arbitration Court. It may take a party as long  as  three

months  to obtain such transcripts. I have been given  to

understand  that some unions had made representations  to

the Industrial Arbitration Court in respect of this delay

in  obtaining Court transcripts and had been told by  the

Court  officer  that the Court is under no obligation  to

supply Court transcripts to any party. While I agree that

the  Court officer is correct in making such a statement,

the fact remains that the party to any proceedings before

the  Industrial Arbitration Court has to wait for  months

before  he  can  lay his hands on Court  transcripts  for

which he has to pay quite a sum of money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that no union can afford to employ a

staff  of  stenographers at its own expense to take  down

Court  proceedings for its own use. I am not making  this

criticism  of  the Industrial Arbitration Court  for  the

purpose of running it down. What I want to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>



emphasize  is  that the provisions of  making  an  appeal

within  14  days  is impracticable in the  light  of  the

present  staff  situation in the  Industrial  Arbitration

Court. I would suggest that the phrase "notice of appeal"

be inserted in place of appeal in the proposed subsection

(6) and that a longer time period be given for filing  an

appeal under the provisions of this Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in section 22 of the Bill wherein it is proposed

to  delete  subsection (2) of section 79 of the Ordinance

and  insert in place thereof seven new subsections, I  am

of  the opinion that the proposed amendment does not  add

to   the  efficiency  of  section  79  and  the  proposed

prosecution  of an employer in respect of offences  under

section  75 or 77 is cumbersome as the existing  mode  of

prosecution   under  the  present  provisions   of   this

Ordinance. The crux of the matter, as far as the National

Trades  Union  Congress  is  concerned,  is  whether  the

written  consent  of the Public Prosecutor  is  necessary

before  any  prosecution  can  be  instituted  under  the

provisions of section 79. As I have said earlier,  it  is

difficult  enough  to  institute prosecution  proceedings

against an employer in respect of any offences under  the

provisions of the Industrial Relations Ordinance  without

making  it  more difficult by requiring that  the  Public

Prosecutor must be satisfied that such a prosecution must

have a chance of success before he would give his consent

to  the  prosecution being instituted.  In  effect,  this

means that any complaint by a worker against his employer

must   have   a  double  trial  before  he   can   obtain

satisfaction for his complaint. First before  the  Public

Prosecutor,  and then before the trial judge.  I  am  not

speculating  on  the  probable  effect  of  the  proposed

amendment, but I am speaking from bitter experience.  The

National  Trades  Union  Congress has  submitted  several

cases  to  the  then  State  Advocate-General,  now   the

Attorney-General,  for  his  necessary   consent   before

instituting prosecution proceedings. In such cases as the

British  Eastern  (Malaya) Ltd, and  the  Singer  Sewing

Machine Co., where some employees were dismissed  by  the

employers in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>



highly  suspicious  circumstances,  no  consent  to   the

institution   of   prosecution  proceedings   under   the

Industrial  Relations Ordinance was obtained because  the

Attorney-General  was of the opinion that  there  was  no

sufficient case. Only in one case that involved Lim  Teck

Lee  &  Co. was consent given to institute a prosecution.

Even then I am given to understand that the police is not

pressing  forward  with  this  prosecution.  It  is   the

contention of the National Trades Union Congress that, in

view   of   the   unsatisfactory  mode   of   instituting

prosecution  proceedings under the  Industrial  Relations

Ordinance,   the  most  suitable  manner  of  instituting

prosecution proceedings should be as provided  for  under

the  provisions of section 132 of the Criminal  Procedure

Code  (Chapter  132). In advocating such a  procedure,  I

have  in  mind  that  the  Public Prosecutor  is  already

overburdened  with work and that it will take  some  time

for  him to examine the facts of the case before  he  can

decide   whether  to  give  his  whole  consent  to   the

institution  of  any  prosecution proceedings  under  the

provisions of the Industrial Relations Ordinance.  I  can

see  no strong objection to the adoption of the procedure

laid  down in Chapter 132 of the Criminal Procedure Code,

except  that possibly the Government of Singapore has  no

confidence  in  the  incumbents  on  the  Bench  in   the

Magistrate's Court, for surely a magistrate will be  able

to  put a stop to any frivolous prosecution when he comes

across it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, there are sufficient safeguards under the

Criminal  Procedure Code to prevent a person  from  being

unduly  inconvenienced by any complaint laid  before  the

magistrate.  I  presume from the term  "public  officers"

referred to in the proposed subsection, the Minister  has

in  mind  any  Government employee other  than  a  police

officer.  He  is not very concerned as to  who  makes  an

investigation.  I  would  have thought  that  the  police

officer,  by  the nature of his training, should  be  the

proper person to make any investigation in respect of  an

offence  under the provisions of the Industrial Relations

Ordinance!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the procedure laid down in the proposed

amendment,  it  may  take a long time before  consent  to

institute  prosecution proceedings can be given.  In  the

meantime,  the worker who has been injured by an  offence

in  respect  of  which  consent to institute  prosecution

proceedings is sought, justifiably feels that his time is

being  wasted. Where an ordinary worker is  concerned,  I

feel  happier if he is to appear before a magistrate  and

told by him that he has no case against his employer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally think that it is not only sufficient to

ensure that justice is done, but it is also important  to

ensure  that  justice is seen to be done. As  far  as  an

ordinary  worker  is concerned, it appears  to  him  that

justice  is  not  done  where the decision  to  institute

prosecution   proceedings  for  an  offence   under   the

provisions of the Industrial Relations Ordinance is  left

solely  in the hands of the Public Prosecutor. After  all

is  over, he will still be left with the feeling that  no

action has ever been taken on his case.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am rather

surprised  that the Member for Bras Basah and the  Member

for  Telok Blangah have still got so much to say on  this

Bill. In fact, the amendments contained in this Bill were

based  on a memorandum submitted by the N.T.U.C. at  the

end  of  1964 and throughout the whole of 1965,  we  have

spent  much time with the representative of the  N.T.U.C.

to  work  out the amendments in this Bill. In  fact,  the

amendments  contained in this Bill were mainly  proposals

made  by  the N.T.U.C. and in many committee meetings  we

have already explained ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Minister give way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I can only agree with the Minister for

Labour that some amendments were effected in consultation

with the N.T.U.C. representative,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>



but  not  all the amendments in the Industrial  Relations

Ordinance. In our deliberations with the officials of the

Ministry  of  Labour, we told them that we would  reserve

our  right to comment. So we did not fully agree with all

the amendments, but we did agree with some amendments. We

did not make any comment on those amendments we agreed. I

am  only  commenting on all those amendments on which  we

still have some area of disagreement with the Ministry of

Labour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Nevertheless, the whole of this

amendment is based on the proposals made by the  N.T.U.C.

Of  course, we cannot say that every proposal made by the

N.T.U.C. must be accepted by the Government. Some of  the

proposals  can be accepted, but some of them,  we  think,

are demanding too much and will not be in the interest of

industry  as a whole. So we have rejected some  of  these

proposals,  and  we have given full explanations  to  the

representative of the N.T.U.C. I think the  N.T.U.C. has

developed into such a big organisation that sometimes its

left  hand may not know what its right hand is  doing.  I

cannot  blame  it for that, because the N.T.U.C. is  now

representing about 75 per cent of our working population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let me come to the points raised by the

Members. One of the points raised by the Member for  Bras

Basah  is that he has some misgivings about clause  8  of

this  amendment  Bill. He said that it  is  not  adequate

enough   to   deal   with  unions  seeking   recognition,

especially   the  unions  which  are  in  the  pioneering

industries. I think he has not read the Bill as a  whole.

He  came across this clause 8 and he found that under new

section 15A there will be a provision: `No trade union of

employees  which  has not been given  recognition  by  an

employer  in  the  prescribed manner may  serve  on  that

employer a notice under section 16 of this Ordinance.' So

he  came  to the conclusion that unions in the pioneering

industries may not be able to seek recognition because of

this clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out to him that there is still

another clause in the Bill



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>



- clause  23  -  which seeks to amend section  81  of  the

Ordinance  and  this provision empowers the  Minister  to

make  regulations  governing  the  recognition  of  trade

unions,   and   I   must  inform  the  House   that   the

representatives of the N.T.U.C. have, in fact, worked out

the regulations to be published governing the recognition

of trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in these regulations which will be published if

this  Bill is passed, one of the things which is provided

is  that  a  trade  union of employees may  serve  on  an

employer  a claim for recognition in the prescribed  form

and  that once this claim is served on him, he must  give

recognition  to  that  union within seven  working  days,

unless he has some reason for not recognising it. In this

case  then,  the union will have the right to notify  the

Commissioner  for Labour who will direct  that  a  secret

ballot  be taken in accordance with the directions  given

by  him  within a reasonable period, and once the  secret

ballot  has  decided that the union is  representing  the

majority of the workers, the employer must recognise it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there is no law to provide that an employer

must  recognise a trade union, but if this Bill is passed

and  the  regulations  which we are  going  to  make  are

published,  then there will be something legally  binding

on  the  employer to recognise the union.  So  the  point

raised by the Member for Bras Basah will not arise here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member also complained that there are not

enough  safeguards for the workers if they are victimised

by  employers.  In  other words, he is  complaining  that

section 77 is not adequate enough to let our trade unions

prosecute  employers  who  are found  to  be  victimising

workers.  Now,  I  would like to remind Members  that  in

October  this  year the N.T.U.C. held its  Second  Annual

Delegates Conference, and the then Secretary-General, Mr

Devan  Nair,  made a report to the N.T.U.C. for  and  on

behalf of the Central Committee of the N.T.U.C. In one of

the passages in this report, he said ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Would the Minister give the citation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Yes. This is the

Secretary-General's  report  for  and  on  behalf  of  the

Central Committee  of  the  N.T.U.C. which was presented to the

N.T.U.C. Conference in October 1965. In page 18  of  this

report, Mr Devan Nair, among other things, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`On the proposed amendments to the Industrial Relations

Ordinance,  several discussions took place in  the  State

Economic  Consultative  Committee  as  well  as  directly

between  the N.T.U.C. and the Government. The  Government

is   happy  to  announce  that  as  a  result  of   these

discussions, several major changes will be  made  to  the

Industrial  Relations Ordinance. These  changes  will  be

contained in a Bill intituled "An Ordinance to amend  the

Industrial   Relations  Ordinance,   1966",   which   the

Government has agreed to introduce at the next sitting of

the Legislative Assembly of Singapore.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, among the amendments envisaged by the Bill would be

provisions  covering  the following  matters.  There  are

several matters here - (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f)  and

(g), I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(g) A more efficient and simplified procedure to deal

with contraventions by employers under section 77 of  the

Ordinance.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So here it is very clear that the then

Secretary-General  of  the  N.T.U.C. was quite satisfied

that  the Bill,  which is now being debated here, provides

a  more efficient   and  simplified  procedure   to   deal   with

contraventions of the Ordinance. I do not  know  why  the

Member  still  wants to raise this question  since  their

Secretary-General  had agreed that what  is  provided  in

this  Bill is adequate enough to deal with contraventions

of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the N.T.U.C., of course, would like to be given

the  power to prosecute employers as soon as they dismiss

their  workers.  This  would be an  ideal  case  for  the

N.T.U.C. and for the trade unions, but I am  afraid  the

Government cannot allow this, because once we make  it  a

law  that  employers  would be prosecuted  whenever  they

dismiss  their workers, then I am sure nobody would  like

to bring in their capital to this country.
