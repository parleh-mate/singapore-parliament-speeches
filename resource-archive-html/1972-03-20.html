<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Yeo Choo Kok, Ho See Beng and Seah Mui Kok.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last Budget session, I spoke on staff

shortage  in  the Telecommunications Department  of

the Ministry of Communications. Let me quote what I

said on the 19th March last year [Hansard, Vol. 30,

No. 13, col. 889]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... we have a very serious shortage of staff in the

Telecommunications Department. The employees in the

operational side of the department work day in  and

day  out  without obtaining any time off  for  rest

days and public holidays.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, the International Telegraph

Section of the Telecommunications Department  alone

owed  the staff for the period June 1969 to January

1971  a  total of 30,000 hours for working on  rest

days  and public holidays. The Department owed  the

messengers 11,500 hours, clerical assistants  5,600

hours,  and  counter  clerks 1,500  hours.  I  also

mentioned then, Sir, the fact that messengers  were

put  on  duty  without a single  day  of  rest  for

several weeks at a stretch. They worked for half  a

year  without any rest days or public  holidays.  I

also  mentioned the fact that there should  not  be

any   problem   at   all  in  recruiting   clerical

assistants,  counter clerks and messengers  because

they are not highly skilled persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now quote to you, Sir, what the Minister

told  this  House then, and I quote from  the  same

Hansard, col. 892:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I am very pleased to say that for the first time

the  department  is well ahead on recruitment.  The

Public  Service  Commission has just  completed  an

exercise to recruit over



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>250&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telecommunications  clerical  assistants  and

technicians. This will wipe out the present vacancy

position  as  well as fill the 159  new  posts  now

coming  up  for  approval  before  the  House.  The

department should be able to have a full complement

of staff by May this year.'



<br><br>That was the reply last year. And he continued:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A crash training programme is being arranged

which  will enable the new staff to be trained  and

put into operating position some time in August. It

is  anticipated that the long overdue time off  can

be granted thereafter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is likely that 24 vacancies in the vote for

telegraph  messengers will be filled  by  June,  by

which period time off for messengers can be granted

thereafter.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will relate also what actually is the

position  today.  It  is strange,  but  true,  that

although the Minister for Communications assured me

on   19th  March  last  year  that  the  loyal  and

dedicated    staff    of   the   Telecommunications

Department  would  not  again  be  faced  with   an

enormous  accumulation of time off, for this  year,

i.e.,  from March 1971 to February 1972, the figure

stands  at 45,000 hours owing to the staff  in  the

department.  Sir,  the workers  in  the  department

cannot  be  treated as cogs in the  wheels  of  the

department. They should be given justice. It  would

seem odd indeed that such a situation exists in the

Telecommunications   Department   since,   as   the

Minister  intimated last year, the  Public  Service

Commission  had  just  completed  an  exercise   to

recruit  over 250 Telecoms clerical assistants  and

technicians and that the 24 vacancies for telegraph

messengers would be filled by June. Sir,  what  has

actually gone wrong? Was the recruitment done? Were

the  people recruited at all? My firm suspicion  is

it has broken down. Let us hope not. The department

is   expanding  with  greater  demands  for  higher

technological Telecommunications. Rapid advancement

has  been  achieved  with the installation  of  the

satellite  earth station and the expansion  of  the

telex  service.  But to keep pace with  this  rapid

development in the department, staffing should also

be  increased  commensurate with  the  development.

Sir, progress, cannot be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>



achieved  without  adequate, contented,  and  well-rested  staff.  May  I suggest  that  the  Minister

radically revises the present situation existing in

the  Telecommunications Department to  ensure  that

the  defects are remedied without prejudice to  any

better   provision  which  may  exist  or  may   be

negotiated by the N.T.U.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now that the Telecommunications Department is

to  be  made  the  Telecommunication  Authority  of

Singapore  from  1st  April this  year,  will  this

improve  the  situation at all? I have  my  doubts.

Another   statutory  board,  the  Public  Utilities

Board,   has  similar  problems  of  overtime   and

staffing.  Do I have to come back again  next  year

and make the same plea on behalf of the workers  of

the Telecommunication Authority of Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Will you be here next year?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> I will be here next year!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it does appear to be a

repeat  performance on the part of the  Member  for

Telok  Blangah in respect of the Telecommunications

Department. He has asked whether anything has  gone

wrong  with the Telecommunications Department.  The

answer is: nothing has gone wrong. It is only  that

the  growth  of traffic has been more than  normal.

Because  of  the very rapid expansion  and  demands

from  the commercial public, the Telecommunications

Department could only meet this abnormal demand  by

involving the staff in overtime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has quoted passages from Hansard in respect of

the  previous  year's Budget. Vacancies  then  were

being  filled.  The Public Service  Commission  did

interview  the  candidates  concerned,  and  it  is

normal  for  applicants  to be  interviewed  around

February-March when the results of the Secondary IV

examinations  are  known. I think  that  is  normal

procedure. So once again in February-March



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>



this year there would be another recruitment

of  staff  to  fill any vacancies. But  may  I,  in

reply, provide some figures too, for the benefit of

the  hon.  Member?  At the beginning  of  the  last

financial  year,  there  were  166  vacancies   for

operational staff and 57 vacancies for technicians,

which  represent a vacancy percentage of  about  20

per  cent and 16 per cent respectively. It is  very

high,  and  I think it is unfair to the workers  on

the  establishment having to work overtime to  fill

this  gap. 174 operational staff and 51 technicians

were  recruited  during the year. That  would  have

virtually    filled   all   the   vacancies,    but

unfortunately  with  recruitment  there  were  also

resignations  or  retirements. There  was  a  staff

reduction  of  this  nature  by  as  many   as   67

operational  staff  and  25 technicians  (the  word

"wastage"  was  being used),  leaving  us  with  59

vacancies  - 4 operational staff and 31 technicians

-  waiting to be filled. This represents a  reduced

rate  of vacancy percentage at only seven per  cent

and  nine  per  cent respectively. I  think  if  we

compare  with the previous `year's rate of  vacancy

percentage of 20 per cent and 16 per cent,  we  can

say  that  there  has  been an improvement  in  the

situation. However, selection of candidates to fill

these  remaining vacancies has just been completed,

and  it is envisaged that most, if not all, of  the

vacancies  for  operational staff and  technicians,

will be filled shortly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has partly answered his own query when

he    touched   on   the   establishment   of   the

Telecommunication Authority of Singapore in 10 days

time.  The Telecommunications Department  which  is

now part of a Government Ministry will be converted

into  a  statutory organisation,  and  one  of  the

reasons why we are converting it is to give it more

flexibility  in the recruitment and  employment  of

staff.  It  may not be necessary, for  example,  to

recruit  staff annually. The new Authority will  be

in  a position to recruit staff as and when it, is

necessary  and  to  decide on  the  salary  scales,

bearing in mind the Government salary structure and

terms and conditions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



of service. As a statutory organisation, it will

certainly be able to move much more quickly in

dealing with overtime problems like we have now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to overtime, may I say that the

position  is  not as bad as that  stated  by  the

Member,  who  quoted the figure of  thousands  of

hours of overtime due. Time-off, which was earned

and  accumulated up to 31st December,  1970,  has

been  converted  to  leave, and  such  leave  was

commuted  to  overtime pay  at  normal  rates  of

salary. So money has been paid for overtime which

has been accumulated prior to that date. But from

1971 onwards, the accumulation began to build  up

once  again and this will have to be adjusted  at

some  future  date. However,  I  can  assure  the

Member  for  Telok Blangah that it  will  not  be

necessary  for him to repeat a third  performance

at the next Budget.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0703 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0703 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this subhead, I would like to touch

on two matters relating to the Paya Lebar

Airport. I hope the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



will  pay  special attention to them  because  of

certain complaints I have received.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first complaint is that the officers of the

Immigration Department at the Paya Lebar  Airport

are not very efficient. The number of porters  at

the  Airport is also too small. There is  a  need

for more porters. Being an international airport,

the  traffic has been increasing every  year.  At

present  the number of passengers is  nearly  two

million  a  year. This shows that more  and  more

travellers are coming from abroad. Therefore,  we

must  extend the highest standard of  service  to

them  in order to impress them, so that they will

spread our good reputation abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the Government has made

provision  for  a  few million  dollars  for  the

development of Paya Lebar Airport, which includes

the extension of the runway and the building of a

new  hangar to accommodate the Boeing  747.  This

type   of   passenger  air  liner  requires   the

redevelopment of the Passenger Terminal Building.

In  view  of  all  this, we hope that  our  civil

aviation   services   will  reach   international

standards,  which, I think, is  the  aim  of  the

Government.  We  should  maintain  a   reasonable

standard of service. Therefore, all the staff  at

the   Airport,   including  the  staff   of   the

Immigration   Department,   should   provide   an

efficient  service. They should be  courteous  to

the  tourists, so that those coming  from  abroad

will have a better impression of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I regret to say that recently I

have received some complaints from members of the

public  to the effect that the staff at the  Paya

Lebar Airport were rather slow in rendering their

services.  For instance, air travellers  have  to

take two or three minutes, and sometimes even  up

to five minutes, to be cleared at the Immigration

counter.  If  there are 100 passengers  arriving,

how  long will that take to clear? It may be that

they are too busy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also received complaints that some of the

staff   on   duty  used  to  crack   jokes   among

themselves. They are thus wasting their  time  and

prolonging  the  waiting time of  the  passengers.

This  is  uncalled  for,  and  I  would  like  the

Minister  to  look  into  this  matter  and   take

measures to remedy the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also complaints about the shortage of

porters.  According to my information,  there  are

only  three  porters to cope with  more  than  100

passengers.  Obviously this number is not  enough.

If at times the porters are weak, the luggage will

be  thrown  about because they cannot carry  them.

They are not able to cope with so many passengers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to bring all these complaints to the

attention  of the Minister because the  number  of

tourists  is  increasing  and  our  Government  is

spending   a  lot  of  money  on  civil  aviation,

particularly in the development of the airport. We

should  see  to  it that our civil servants  there

render a high international standard of service.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

there  is  only  a limited staff at  the  tax-free

store for passengers at the Transit section of the

Paya  Lebar  Airport  to  cope  with  the  present

increased   passenger  load.   Can   the   Airport

authorities look into this matter to increase  the

staff of the store?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What measures have been introduced at the

Airport to prevent the hijacking of aircraft,  now

that  hijacking  has become a  popular  sport  for

neurotics and political desperadoes? If  there  is

any special device, is it used to check on all the

passengers?  Are  there  any  measures   for   all

passengers to go through a screening device?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What plans have been made for the use of Changi

Airfield   now  that  the  British   troops   have

withdrawn? Can the facilities available at  Changi

be  considered  for use in conjunction  with  Paya

Lebar  Airport, so that it forms an  extension  of

the  Airport services, particularly for  chartered

flights?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  just  like  to comment on  the  Member  for

Sembawang's allegation with regard to the slowness

of the Immigration counter officers at the Airport

in  clearing passengers. Perhaps, if he would care

to  go  to the Arrival Lounge in the new Passenger

Terminal- I believe it is upstairs - he  would  be

able   to   see  a  few  counters  where   several

Immigration officials are at work. I once  had  an

occasion to visit this Terminal Building, and  saw

quite  a  good number of passengers coming through

the  Lounge.  Judging from the  speed  with  which

Immigration clearance was made, and this is  based

on  personal  experience, I think  the  Member  is

exaggerating  when he says that it  takes  two  to

three minutes, or even five minutes, to clear each

passenger. However, he is more or less correct  in

his  remarks about the Customs and Excise counter,

because  over  there the passengers  upon  arrival

will  have  to  declare themselves, and  for  this

reason  there  may be a little delay.  I  hope  my

clarification   will   help   the   Minister   for

Communications.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am always

grateful to Members sitting on the Opposite bench,

answering on my behalf. It does help now and again

to have your ball at the other man's foot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now refer to the point raised by the

Member  for Sembawang regarding complaints against

the  Immigration  Department.  Strictly  speaking,

this   is   something  not  within  my  portfolio.

Immigration Department comes under the Ministry of

Home  Affairs,  and  my  colleague,  who  is   the

Minister, is having a good laugh behind me. It  is

quite  likely that the complaints received by  the

Member  were  in  respect  of  persons  whom   the

Immigration  Department were quite  interested  in

and, therefore, probably a little longer time  was

taken  before they could be cleared at the Arrival

Hall.  However, the Airport does provide  adequate

facilities for the Immigration Department.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our view, ever since the completion of the

short-term development of our Airport costing  $10

million,  the floor area in the Passenger Terminal

Building  has  been doubled from  over  a  hundred

thousand  square feet to 270,000 square feet.  The

clearance facilities for passengers in respect  of

Health,  Customs and Immigration have,  therefore,

improved. For the information of the Member, there

are  six triangular counters corresponding to  six

channels  at  the  Arrival  Hall  for  Immigration

authorities   to   process   arriving   passengers

simultaneously. In addition, there are  two  other

counters behind the main Immigration counter to be

used for checking arriving passengers who have  no

documents   or   whose  documents  are   improper.

Probably  these  are  the  people  who  have  been

complaining to the Member. If they had the  proper

documents, it would have been very simple for them

to  gain entry into Singapore. In our view,  these

eight  Immigration counters are adequate  to  cope

with  passenger arrivals even during  the  evening

peak period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the complaint about baggage handling,

which  is  under my portfolio and for which  I  am

responsible,  the  problem  has  probably   arisen

because   there  is  more  than  one  organisation

handling the baggage. It is our intention to  have

one  Baggage Authority in the near future. Anyway,

may I say that even at this moment, there are four

different  organisations  handling  the   baggage.

Firstly,  the Malaysia-Singapore Airlines  handles

baggage of more than half of all the airlines that

come  into  Singapore.  There  are,  in  all,   24

international  airlines. M.S.A, handles  at  least

one-half  the  number of airlines' bag-gages.  The

others  are Pan-American, Garuda and, lastly,  the

Civil Aviation Department.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Aviation Department handles seven

airlines.  Sir, if there is one authority,  we  do

agree  that  it would be more efficient.  We  know

exactly  who is responsible. But when an  aircraft

comes in and four authorities have got to find out

which one of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>



them  is  responsible, inevitably  some  delay  is

involved.  Whatever it is, after the  $10  million

short-term development of the Airport, we now have

at  the  Arrival Hall five conveyor belts for  the

conveyance of baggage from the ramp to the baggage

claim area. In our view, these five conveyors  are

adequate  to cope with the demand at peak periods.

The  time  taken for the baggage to be transported

to  the Arrival Hall at the Airport depends on the

handling  capacity of the airline or agent,  which

is  responsible  for it, and also  the  number  of

aircraft  that  lands at any one  given  time.  If

there were four landings within the space of  half

an  hour, then of course there would be a big jam.

It  also  depends on the location of  the  parking

bays  where  the  aircraft are ultimately  parked.

Anyway, may I say that normally baggage should  be

available  for claiming in the baggage claim  area

within  five  minutes after  the  arrival  of  the

aircraft which, I think, is a very good time.  And

this is the normal handling time undertaken by the

Department  of  Civil  Aviation  for   the   seven

airlines which it is in charge of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question raised by the Member for

Anson,  he  understands that there is  not  enough

staff  for  the  tax-free  store  in  the  Transit

lounge.  This  matter  will  be  conveyed  to  the

Department of Civil Aviation to see that the store

does  provide adequate staff. May I add, Sir, that

the  stores  at  our Airport are doing  such  good

business and, believe it or not, the rental for  a

store is not less than $40,000 a month, or half  a

million  dollars a year, because we have at  least

two  million people -as many as the population  of

Singapore-using  our Paya Lebar  Airport.  If  the

concessionaire  is  able to  pay  half  a  million

dollars  in  rent for a store in the  Airport,  he

will  see  to it that there are more than adequate

staff  to  handle the business because more  staff

means more business, and ultimately more profits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also raised the problem of hijacking

of aircraft. As you know, Mr Speaker, Sir, we have

passed   a   Bill  sometime  ago  to  enable   the

Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>



to  comply  with  the so-called Tokyo  Convention,

which  takes strong measures against hijacking.  I

believe  our  staff  in the  Department  of  Civil

Aviation  is  quite wide awake to this possibility

and,   together   with   the  representatives   of

international airlines, they are taking all  steps

to  ensure  that  maximum security is  maintained.

Sometimes  it  may  bring  about  some  delay   to

passengers  leaving or arriving at our Airport.  I

hope  that  if Members get complaints  in  future,

they will understand that it is not because we are

a  little  sticky about security, but  because  we

have  to  be a little longer on the ground  rather

than something to happen up in the air.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the question whether or not Changi

Airport can be used as an extension of Paya  Lebar

Airport  for  charter flights.  Sir,  there  is  a

possibility that Changi Airport may be reverted to

civilian  use.  It is now being  reserved  by  the

Ministry  of Defence. They want it as  a  military

airport. But there is no reason why Changi Airport

may  not be partly used for civil aircraft if  air

traffic continues to increase. May I say that,  at

the  present  moment, Paya Lebar  Airport  is  not

fully stretched. The present traffic is equivalent

to  about 40 per cent of what it can take. As  and

when it does come close to 80 or 90 per cent, then

perhaps  we  can divert some of the chartered  air

flights  from  Paya Lebar to Changi  Airport.  But

should  it be necessary for Paya Lebar Airport  to

be   closed,  we  do  have  arrangements   whereby

aircraft  are  advised to land at  Changi  Airport

instead.  So  there is really no  problem  to  use

Changi  Airport  as  an extension  of  Paya  Lebar

Airport, as and when the necessity arises.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, is

it  the opinion of the Minister for Communications

that what I have said does not exist? In any case,

if the Minister has the time, or his Parliamentary

Secretary if he has no time, he should investigate

into this complaint. If there is no truth, then it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>



is  all  the  better. But if there is some  truth,

then  there  must  be  some  improvement  to   our

services.  It  is my hope that our high  standards

will be maintained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in view of the explanation given, I beg

leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Hwang Soo Jin-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0703 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1009.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (2), Mr Hwang?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0703 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1371*.(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Cheong Yuen Chee.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if my understanding is correct, Simbang

Aerodrome  was  taken over by the Government  from

the  British  Forces. My queries to  the  Minister

are:  (1) where is this aerodrome sited, and  what

does  the Government propose to do for its  future

use?  (2)  if it is to be used for civil aviation,

for which a sum is provided, what type of aircraft

will be allowed to operate in this aerodrome?  and

(3)  why are only fire-fighting services stationed

in  this  aerodrome, instead of an  administrative

set-up? Will the Minister clarify, please?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I would like to inform the

Member for Mountbatten that Simbang Aerodrome is a

military aerodrome situated in Sembawang, and  was

vacated  by  the British Armed Forces. That  being

so, it came under the control of the Ministry  of

Defence.  However, at the request of  the  M.I.D.,

the  Department  of Civil Aviation is  responsible

for providing the fire-fighting services, both  at

Simbang Aerodrome and the missile base.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the type of aircraft that will make

use of Simbang Aerodrome, I assume that it will be

military aircraft, and not civil aircraft. If more

interest is shown, perhaps the Member can  inquire

from the Ministry of Defence officials.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, in view of the

explanation given by the Minister, I beg leave to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Ng Yeow Chong-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0703

be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1391.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (4), Mr Ng Yeow Chong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> I am not moving, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of 59,704.180 for Head 0703 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0704 -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0704 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now that Singapore has built a satellite

earth  station  in  Sentosa, may  I  know  if  the

Meteorological Services Department is  keeping  up

with  the latest in weather forecasting,  if  such

facilities  are available? If the Department  says

there  will  be no rain today, but it  does  rain,

then  they  are incorrect. They should  have  more

forecasting  stations  in  order  to  give  better

information to the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

comment  made  by the Member for  Anson  is  that

there   is   rain  today  but  our  Meteorological

Department  says  there is no rain.  This  is  not

something unusual in Singapore. It happens in  the

best  of  cities. If you take a newspaper and  the

weather  forecast says "No rain", it means,  bring

your umbrella!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has, however, mentioned the fact that since

the Telecommunications Department is reasonably up

to-date  with the satellite earth station,  should

not  our Meteorological Department also keep  pace

with technological advances? Sir, I wish to assure

him that our Meteorological Services Department is

reasonably   up   to  scratch  with  international

requirements,  because it falls on the  Department

to   provide  meteorological  services  for  civil

aviation as well as for shipping. And they have to

conform  to international standards stipulated  by

the  World Meteorological Organisation as well  as

the International Civil Aviation Organisation,  so

that constant efforts are always being made by the

Department  to ensure strict observance  of  these

international standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cope with the new development in meteorology

and  to  provide improved quality of service,  the

Department   has,  over  the  past  three   years,

acquired  a number of sophisticated meteorological

instrumentation. This includes a ground  satellite

station   to  receive  meteorological  data   from

orbiting   satellites,  as   distinct   from   the

telecommunication satellite. There is also  a  10-centimetre   radar  at  Paya  Lebar   capable   of

detecting   storms  within  400  kilometres   from

Singapore. There are also two other weather radars

of  lesser  range at Changi and Tengah Aerodromes,

and a new wind-finding radar and telecommunication

equipment  for the prompt reception  of  computer-produced     weather    charts    from    overseas

meteorological   stations.  The  Department   also

supplied   a   large  volume  of  climatologically

information    to   commercial   and    scientific

organisations and Government departments for their

varied  purposes such as factory siting, off-shore

drilling operations, engineering construction  and

also air pollution studies.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the North-east monsoons, warnings of

prolonged  and  heavy  rainfall  likely  to  cause

flooding are broadcast over Radio and Television.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>



Furthermore, a daily weather outlook forecast  has

been  issued  to  the press for publication  since

1970.  The compact size of Singapore, the  absence

of distinct seasons - we have perpetual summer, we

do  not have the four seasons in Singapore  -  and

the character of local tropical weather, all these

factors  necessarily impose a  limitation  on  the

accuracy  of this daily forecast. So it  could  be

"Fair  weather  this  afternoon",  but  it  rained

before 12 o'clock. What could we do?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> In view of the explanation

given by the Minister, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,535,660 for Head 0704 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0705 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0705 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total vote for Postal Services this year

amounts  to  more  than $22  million,  showing  an

increase  of  over  $400,000 as compared  to  last

year.  This  means that an increase of  population

and   the  development  of  commercial  and  trade

services  have  caused  an  increase  of  mail  in

Singapore, thereby increasing the workload of  the

Postal Department. Undeniably, the Postal Services

Department  in Singapore has all along  enjoyed  a

reputation  of  high standards, it  provides  very

good  service to the people of Singapore and is  a

source of our pride.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, following the increase in population and

of  requirements  and a shift in  population,  the

degree  of  efficiency has  been  affected.  As  a

result of this, I have received several complaints

recently   against  delays  in  the  delivery   of

domestic  mail.  It normally takes  about  two  to

three days to deliver a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>



letter locally. This is quite true, because I have

some  personal experience. For example, a  certain

friend of mine rang me up one day and asked, "Have

you  received  my invitation card?"  I  told  him,

"No". In reply, he said, "Strange! This invitation

card was posted some three days ago." Sir, this is

quite  a  frequent occurrence, and 1 believe  that

other  Members  of this House may have  a  similar

experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there are signs of a lowering of standards

of  efficiency, we must try to find a remedy. This

cannot  be dismissed as a small matter and allowed

to  deteriorate.  It will be a wrong  attitude  to

adopt.  What  has caused the low standard  of  our

Postal   Services  recently?  Is  it  because   of

shortage of staff or poor allocation of duties? Or

is  it  because of traffic congestion which causes

delay  to postal delivery? If it is a question  of

traffic congestion, it is within the portfolio  of

the  same  Minister. I would, therefore,  ask  the

Minister to explain and to find ways and means  to

remedy this situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to raise is the matter of

wrong   delivery  of  mail.  I  have  on   several

occasions   received  letters,  or   even   Public

Utilities Board bills, addressed to other  people.

So  I  have  to perform the duty of a  postman  to

return these mails and letters. I think this wrong

delivery happened because the postmen are careless

in  their duty. 1 have come across postmen who are

mostly young people. The Department concerned must

urge these young postmen to be more careful in the

delivery  of  letters, instead of  sending  Paul's

letter to Peter. If it is an important letter that

is  wrongly delivered or a love letter sent to the

wrong  person,  then  it  will  create  a  lot  of

misunderstanding and difficulty on the part of the

recipient. It may even cause the separation  of  a

couple.  I,  therefore, hope that the Minister  in

charge  will  take immediate steps to  remedy  the

situation  and  to  reduce  instances   of   wrong

delivery  of  letters  If this can  be  wiped  out

entirely, this will be all the better.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I

raise  the point of my amendment, I would like  to

touch   on  the  criticisms  of  the  Member   for

Sembawang  regarding the delivery  of  letters  by

postmen.  There is no doubt that I  also  have  to

draw   the   attention   of   the   Minister   for

Communications to this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister had taken very serious measures for

the reorganisation of the Postal Department. It is

most  probable  that  during  the  reorganisation,

deliveries   were  delayed,  or  letters   wrongly

delivered.  So  because of reorganisation,  I  can

accept the complaints. But today I do not think  I

can  accept complaints of delayed delivery because

some  postmen are using motor cycles, which  makes

for  fast  delivery. Formerly you would  get  your

letter  at about 10 o'clock. But now when you  get

to  your office at 8.30, you will get your  letter

at  9 o'clock. `this delivery service is going  on

very smoothly and efficiently. I must congratulate

the  Minister for Communications for  taking  such

serious   action   to   reorganise   the    Postal

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have to ask the Minister now about the use

of  the  warehouse  in Nelson Road  as  a  sorting

section. What action has he taken to alleviate the

very   poor   conditions  that  the  workers   are

experiencing? On a hot day the heat  is  so  great

that  it  is  like an oven. Could the  ventilation

system  be  improved with, say, the  provision  of

some  fans  and  make openings  in  parts  of  the

warehouse  as windows? The workers' health  is  in

danger all this time, and the conditions are  made

worse  by  a  film  of  dust settling  around  the

warehouse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the Maxwell Road postmen's quarters, the

common bathroom and lavatories are very filthy.  I

wonder   whether   the   Postmaster-General   will

consider recruiting an attendant, as has been done

previously,  to  maintain  the  toilets  of  these

quarters.  Sir,  we  are having campaigns  against

pollution  and  we are also talking about  keeping

Singapore clean. But yesterday when I went to  the

postmen's quarters, I saw that everything was very

bad.  The  lavatory  is  very  ugly,  and  in  the

bathroom some of the window panes are broken,  and

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>



chicks  are worn out. At the backyard, nobody  has

been  sweeping it, not like before when there  was

one  attendant  appointed to sweep  the  quarters.

Even in the estates of the Housing and Development

Board,  there are people to sweep the  flats.  Why

does the Postmaster-General not employ one man  to

sweep and clean the common lavatory and the common

staircase?  This is very bad for the  postmen  who

are  living  there.  If you  go  to  the  personal

quarters,  it  is  very  clean  and  decent,   but

outside,  just because it is common  property  and

used  by  everybody,  nobody  wants  to  take  the

trouble to clean it. You must have one man to look

after  it. Therefore, I ask the Minister,  without

any  previous notice, to please visit the  Maxwell

Road postmen's quarters, and to take the necessary

remedial action on this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, having

complained     about     the    Telecommunications

Department, I think I must stand up this  time  to

compliment the Ministry on the vast improvement in

the  postal  services. I am sorry  that  I  cannot

agree with the views of the Member for Sembawang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you will remember correctly, during the

last  Budget  debate, I spoke on  two  aspects  of

postmen. One was the uniforms which were not  only

unattractive but also unsuitable for  the  climate

of Singapore. You will notice that the postmen are

now  on  a  smart turnout. Let me  take  a  little

credit for that for having criticised the uniforms

of postmen last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you remember, Sir, I also mentioned the

problem of providing postmen with faster vehicular

transport.  That also has been done.  Now,  I  see

postmen  in rural areas, as the Member  for  Anson

said, using scooters resulting in faster delivery.

There has been vast improvement in the Ministry of

Communications,  if  not in the Telecommunications

Department, then in the Postal Department. Let  us

congratulate the Ministry on that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it looks as if

it  would  not be necessary for me to  answer  the

criticisms by Members. I would like to say that if

there  has  been  any improvement  in  the  Postal

Department,  credit is due to the Backbenchers  of

Parliament  because, arising out of  their  strong

criticisms,  action was followed up. Therefore,  I

would  appreciate it if Members have  constructive

criticisms, could they please direct them  not  to

the  Member for Sembawang, but to pass them on  to

me, because there is a lot of work to be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complaint of the Member for Sembawang that

there are two or three days' delay in the delivery

of  local  mail  does not appear to be  justified,

because there are two other Members who feel  that

they are getting their letters earlier than usual.

This may well be, because the Member for Sembawang

is  living  in  a  rural area and  the  other  two

Members are living in an urban area where services

are more efficient.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Point of

clarification, Sir. Even if a man lives in a rural

area, he is entitled to an equally speedy service.

Does  it  mean  that those who live in  the  rural

areas must accept a slower service?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> It will be an ideal situation

if  the Postal Department is able to give the same

high standard of service in the rural areas as  in

the  city area but, knowing the background and the

history  of so many complaints, surely  the  first

priority  is to satisfy the large city  population

and  then work towards the rural areas. So I  hope

the  explanation  should satisfy  the  Member  for

Sembawang.   After  the  reorganisation   of   the

Department,  with the assistance of  the  National

Productivity  Centre, it is possible  for  letters

which are posted before 1.00 p.m, in the city area

to be delivered the same afternoon. That, I think,

is  reasonably good service. On the whole, in  the

urban areas there are two deliveries of mail - one

in  the morning and one in the afternoon. For  the

outlying rural areas, we are at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



moment gearing for just one delivery each weekday.

Perhaps the time will come when, with more  motor-cycles and motor-scooters, our postmen with  their

new  smart uniform will be seen in the rural areas

more often.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for wrong delivery of mail, this is possible in

the  best of circumstances. But it would be better

if  such complaints can be made known to us rather

than  to  the Member for Sembawang. We  cannot  do

very much unless the complainants give us specific

information. It is no use saying, "I have received

a  letter which is not meant for me." But if  they

can give us more details - such as the address  of

the  mis-delivered item, the date and  approximate

time  it  happened  to enable  us  to  know  which

particular postman was on the beat and to ask  for

an explanation  then we can do something about it.

But  the  postman may have a good explanation.  It

may  be  that the dogs in the rural areas  are  so

fierce that he is unable to deliver the item,  and

therefore hands it over to the neighbour  who  has

agreed  to  accept it. I mean, there may  be  good

explanations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the specific complaints from the

Member for Anson. First, the Nelson Road Centre. I

think  he will agree with me that the movement  of

the  Parcels and Mail Centre from the General Post

Office  basement at Fullerton Building  to  Nelson

Road  is  an  improvement, because  it  was  quite

unhealthy down at the basement. But it  is  to  be

admitted  that, having moved over to Nelson  Road,

which  was,  in fact, a P.S.A, warehouse  and  not

built for the purposes of a postal department  and

therefore  not  really  a  proper  place  for  the

Parcels and Mail Centre, conditions existing there

are  not as good as we would want them to be.  The

move was made in December last year, and so it  is

already three months since we have moved there. It

is  also  admitted that unfortunately  there  were

some  inconveniences. However, renovation work  is

almost  completed, and we hope that  most  of  the

initial problems would have been sorted out.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of a report in January 1971 by the

Occupational Health and Safety Committee  of  the

N.T.U.C.,  the Ministry looked into  the  working

conditions  at  the Nelson Road Centre  and  made

certain  recommendations which  were  immediately

investigated  into,  and action  has  since  been

taken.  For  example, vacuum cleaners  have  been

purchased  and 14 large wall extractor fans  have

been  installed to improve the ventilation.  They

are  currently looking into the various types  of

floor  varnishes  to reduce the problem  of  dust

accumulation  on  the  floor.  And  we  hope   to

continue  keeping a watch on any further defects,

so that improvements can be made as we go along.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Maxwell Road postal quarters, I

am  sorry to hear from the Member for Anson  that

he  thinks  that  the place is quite  filthy.  As

suggested  by  him.  I shall make  an  unheralded

visit  to  see conditions and to insist that  the

matter he put right as soon as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker.

Sir,  with regard to the delay and wrong delivery

of   mail,  perhaps  certain  Members  have   not

encountered such difficulties. I would  like  the

Minister  to look into this aspect of the  postal

services.  I  have  said that on  the  whole  our

Postal  Services are very good. However,  because

of  the increase in population recently, there is

bound  to be a certain amount of delay and  wrong

delivery  of  mail. But I would  still  like  the

Minister   to   take  steps   to   remedy   these

shortcomings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0705 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2017.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding the postman's

uniform,  I  am quite happy that all postmen  are

very satisfied with it. However. I would like  to

say a few



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>



words  about  it.  Recently,  new  uniforms  were

supplied  to  the  Postal  Department.  With  the

exception  of  the  name  tag  on  the  postman's

uniform,  there  is  no indication  to  show  the

various grades of postal workers. Could some sort

of  distinguishing feature be introduced so  that

members of the public can straightaway identify a

mail  officer,  inspector, postman,  or  ordinary

postman? Further, the tailoring of these uniforms

is  of very poor standard, and it gets torn  very

easily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also understand that the postal driver,

who  at times performs the duties of the ordinary

postman,  is  given only three suits of  uniforms

per  year, whereas an ordinary postman gets five.

I would, therefore, suggest that these drivers be

also  given five sets of uniforms, like any other

ordinary postmen.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think I can answer the

Member   for  Anson  rather  quickly.   His   two

suggestions  which he has put  before  the  House

this  afternoon, i.e., (1) more gradations, other

than  name  tags on uniforms, so that the  public

will  be able to recognise the various grades  of

officials in the Postal Department, and (2)  that

drivers  be  issued with five issues of  uniforms

instead of three, will be given consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> In view of the answer given

by the Minister, I withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0705 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3004.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that there is a huge increase in

the allocation for new issues of stamps, that is.

from  $140,000 for last year to $360,000 for this

year.   I believe there is an increasing interest

in stamp collecting among our school children and

adults.  So  these  new issues would  be  welcome

additions for all these budding philatelists  and

professional stamp collectors. What I wish to ask

is the number of new issues of stamps



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



to  be made for this year. I would be grateful  if

the  Minister  for Communications  would  be  kind

enough  to  indicate the type and  number  of  new

issues  of  stamps with the various denominations,

which  the  Postal Department will be  introducing

this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to point out to the

Minister one aspect of these new stamp issues.  In

past  years,  when  a  new  :issue  of  stamps  is

introduced,  pamphlets about the  new  issues  are

distributed  to  those who ask  for  them  at  the

Philatelic  Bureau of the General Post Office.  On

some  occasions  the  supplies  are  insufficient.

e.g.,  sometime  last year, there  was  a  special

commemorative issue of the Festivals  series,  and

there  were  insufficient brochures to  go  round.

These Festival stamps were quite big and colourful

and  there was a great demand for them.  But  when

applications for brochures were made, the  Bureau

could  not  supply them, probably because  of  the

large  demand for them. Nevertheless. I  hope  the

Minister will look into his matter as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I pointed out just now, there seems to

be  a  growing interest in stamp collecting. I  am

happy  to say that in one of the community centres

in  Punggol, a  small stamp collecting  group  of

about  20  students and adults was set up sometime

last  year.  This group held regular meetings  and

with the interest generated among them, it has now

swelled to about 70. I think this is a good start,

and  I  hope  that  with the  advance  information

provided  for by the Postal Services  on  the  new

issues,   other   groups   interested   in   stamp

collecting,  from  schools  and  other   community

centres, will he able to get the information  they

want on such new issues.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I should like

to  inform  the Member for Punggol that  provision

under  subhead 3004 "Stamps - New Issues $360,000"

for  the  coming  financial  year  is  really  for

expenditure  on the production and  issue  of  new

definitive  stamps, that is to say, new definitive

stamps for normal sale to the public.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present series was introduced in 1968-69. It

consists of the Dance series, Mask series, and the

Musical instruments series, ranging from one  cent

to   $10.   It  is  normal  practice   in   postal

administrations  to change the  definitive  stamps

every three to four years. So we intend to produce

a  new definitive series for 1972-73 with about 14

denominations, also ranging from one cent to  $10.

This  new  series  is  in  the  process  of  being

designed and, when ready, will be issued. What the

Member  has  in  mind really was the commemorative

issues  which. I think, had generated considerable

interest  ever since the Stamp Advisory  Committee

was appointed in 1968.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past there were only one or two sets of

commemorative issues per 3ear. But since  1968  we

have  tried  to make it a normal policy  to  issue

about  four  or five sets of commemorative  issues

per year. We have also given our local artists  an

opportunity  to  design  our  stamps,  which  have

created  so great an impact that even the  Punggol

Constituency  has a stamp club, as stated  by  the

Member.  For this year, we will have five sets  of

commemorative  issues depicting designs  based  on

coins,   art,   festival  (we  hope  without   any

controversy), youth and shipping.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the complaint that there were

insufficient   brochures  for  new   commemorative

issues,  I am sure the new Chairman of the  Stamps

Advisory  Committee who is my Political Secretary,

the  Member for Bukit Merah, will take note of the

complaint. I am also sure that he will see  to  it

that  there wilt be more than adequate  copies  of

these  pamphlets and brochures in future, so  that

sales  of  commemorative issues can  improve  and.

therefore,   it   means  more  revenue   for   our

Consolidated Fund.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, before I withdraw my

amendment  I  would like to make  just  one  small

observation:  I was talking in terms  of  the  two

types  of issues, i.e., the commemorative and  the

definitive issues.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very grateful to the Minister for his

detailed reply, and I beg leave to withdraw my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $22,630,370 for Head 0705 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0706 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0706 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Ng Yeow Chong, J. F Conceicao, Ch'ng Jit Koon, Low Yong Nguan and P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this head of expenditure relates to the

provision  for the Registry of Vehicles  amounting

to $2.3 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, Singapore has a large number of

vehicles. According to statistics there are  about

140,000  motor cars alone. In addition, there  are

buses,   motor-cycles,   scooters,   trucks    and

bicycles.  The total number of vehicles  is  about

half a million. We can imagine the workload of the

Registry of Vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to ask two

questions.  I  have received some complaints  from

the  public, and it is my duty to convey  them  to

the  Minister  concerned.  I  would  urge  him  to

investigate  these complaints and  to  remedy  any

shortcomings, so that the department can carry out

its  work efficiently. Firstly, some taxi  drivers

have  complained against certain R.O.V, officials

who  carry out routine inspection of taxis.  These

inspectors are trying to make things difficult for

the taxi drivers. For example, on inspection of  a

taxi, the inspector will tell the taxi driver that

a  certain part of his taxi is defective, and that

it  should  be corrected before it can be  passed.

The  taxi  driver will then have it repaired.  The

next day he will drive his taxi to the R.O.V, for

a  further  inspection, of course,  thinking  that

this  time  his taxi will pass the test.  But  the

same  inspector will take a hammer and  knock  the

taxi here and there, saying, "No, no. This part is

also  faulty."  And  he might also  say  that  the

engine is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



noisy and that it should be repaired. All this has

caused much dissatisfaction among taxi drivers. If

the  inspector could only tell the driver once for

all  what  parts of the taxi are faulty  and  need

repair, which perhaps can be done in one day, then

it will be convenient to the taxi drivers and also

avoid  another day's loss of earnings. Mr Speaker,

Sir, if the allegation is true, then it shows that

the  inspector's approach is not correct.  I  hope

the   Minister   will   carry   out   a   detailed

investigation to see whether there is any truth in

such an allegation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxi drivers have also complained that there is

always  a  long queue at the R.O.V, whenever  they

send  their  taxis  there for inspection.  Certain

officers  are very discourteous in their  attitude

towards taxi drivers, although our Ministers  have

always told our civil servants to be courteous.  I

hope the civil servants will take note of what the

Ministers have said and maintain their services at

a high standard. I would urge the Minister to look

into these complaints.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  take  this  opportunity  to  congratulate  the

Minister for Communications on his success in  the

reorganisation of the motor transport service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a lot of improvement in bus

services  since  its  reorganisation  last   year.

However,   one  can  still  see  some  old   buses

operating  on the roads.. These old and  out-dated

buses should have been condemned long ago as scrap

for  the  national steel mill. Instead,  they  are

still  permitted to continue to operate, and  most

of  them  are  polluting the air with their  smoky

exhausts.  Besides,  these  old  buses  frequently

break  down,  thereby upsetting the time  schedule

and  causing great inconvenience to bus commuters.

There was an occasion when I had to travel by bus,

and I had to  wait more than half an hour for it.



I was later told by the bus conductor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



that  the delay was due to the breakdown of a  bus

of  the same service route somewhere on its return

trip  to  the  terminal. Sir, every morning  as  I

travel  from  Changi to the city, I often  see  at

least  one  or  two buses parked on the  roadside,

apparently  stalled with engine  trouble.  In  one

morning  alone I counted no less than five  buses,

belonging   to  two  bus  companies,  which   were

rendered  inoperative  with engine  trouble.  They

were  parked  along  Changi Road  within  a  short

stretch  of half a mile. This state of affairs  is

highly undesirable. Something must be done quickly

to   rectify  this  situation.  Why  did  the  bus

companies not replace the old buses with new ones,

according  to  the  plan?  The  Government  should

initiate action to press the bus companies for  an

early   Replacement  with  new  buses.  Meanwhile,

action  must be taken against bus companies  which

do  not  keep  their buses properly  serviced  and

maintained before putting them on the road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask the Minister

concerned  whether the law enforcement section  of

the  Registry  of  Vehicles  has  been  adequately

staffed,  and  whether these enforcement  officers

have been sent out to carry out their duties.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

the  last Budget debate in 1971, the Minister  for

Communications informed the House that steps would

be  taken  to improve the standard o, driving  in

respect  of buses in the public transport  sector.

The Minister informed us that courses on courtesy,

first aid, etc., would be run. Since that time  we

have  heard  a suggestion that one of the  reasons

why our bus drivers seem to be in such a hurry  to

get  from  one  place  to another  is  that  their

schedules  impose a pressure on them. If  this  is

so, can the Ministry not take such steps that will

result  in  more reasonable requirements  for  bus

drivers to keep to time schedules for bus routes?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten has raised a matter

which  I would like to endorse. It relates to  the

standard of maintenance and operation of buses.  I

agree  with  him  that one notices too  frequently

buses  breaking down and holding up traffic.  They

also  caused inconvenience to bus users. I am sure

that bus drivers will feel more disposed to listen

to  advice given in courses on proper bus driving,

if  pressure of route schedules was not  so  great

and if buses were better maintained. In respect of

these  two points, can we be informed of  (a)  the

progress  of educational courses for bus  drivers,

and  (b)  the  extent  to which  the  Registry  of

Vehicles  has  a say in the proper maintenance  of

buses, and to what extent is this right exercised?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we were also told during the last Budget

debate  that  the  Ministry of Communications  was

observing   the   extent   to   which   pedestrian

facilities, for instance, overhead bridges,  zebra

crossings, and so on, were used. I recollect  that

it  was  stated that consideration would be given,

if necessary, to legislation against jay walking -

legislation,  of course, that would  concomitantly

protect pedestrians. Mr Speaker, Sir, it has  been

frequently  declared  that a large  proportion  of

those   killed  and  injured  in  road   accidents

consists of pedestrians.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, special measures have to be

taken  to  protect pedestrians. The Minister  will

recollect  the extent to which our legislation  on

safety  helmets for scooterists and motor-cyclists

and  pillion riders has helped to reduce  injuries

and   even  the  number  of  deaths  arising  from

accidents.  Of course, Mr Speaker, Sir,  the  real

answer  to the problem is education - to  persuade

people to be more careful and to be more conscious

of  pedestrian hazards, and so on.  We  hear  that

solution quoted again and again. But the time  may

be  ripe for measures dependent on education  .and

social   persuasion   to   be, strengthened   by

legislation.  Perhaps the Minister would  like  to

enlighten us on that point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the

reorganisation of the motor transport  system  was

implemented  last year, drivers and conductors  of

buses    behaved,    to    everyone's    surprise,

marvellously. Unfortunately, time has proved  what

they really are. Daily, our travelling public have

to  put  up  with  rude conductors,  inconsiderate

drivers who fail to stop at designated stops,  and

thereby   causing  great  inconvenience   to   the

travelling   public.  The  buses   too   are   not

maintained properly. Quite often these buses break

down  at  odd places and cause great inconvenience

to  other road users. The bus companies should  be

pulled up for allowing faulty buses to run on  the

roads. Many of these buses run around without  any

petrol  filler caps. As such, when they  negotiate

turns, they leave a trail of oil on the roads. Any

motor-cyclist  will know what this  trail  of  oil

will  lead  to  eventually. It is high  time  that

companies   were   fined  for   taking   such   an

irresponsible attitude towards the safety  of  the

ordinary road user.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, there is an acute shortage of buses

running certain routes. It is high time that  more

buses  were put into operation. On the other hand,

bus  drivers should be given better conditions  of

service,  such  as  vacation  leave  and   medical

benefits. May I also know whether the increase  in

fines  for  traffic offences has proved  to  be  a

deterrent, and has it in any way produced  better

standards of driving and ease on the roads? It  is

my  view that this is not so. Has the Registrar of

Vehicles   exploited  the  possibility  of   using

television   as  a  medium  for  instructing   and

educating  Singaporeans  in  better  standards  of

driving?  There  seems  to  he  a  great  lack  of

courtesy and goodwill on our roads at present.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the views

expressed  by various Members of this House  about

our   buses.  Since  the  implementation  of   the

reorganisation  of  motor  transport   system   in

Singapore,    there   has   been   some    general

improvement    of    our    transport     system.

Unfortunately, after the closing down of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  Traction Company, bus commuters  still

have  to wait very long for buses. Also, the buses

are very overcrowded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a good number of the old buses are very

dirty.  We  can  see black smoke coming  from  the

exhaust  pipes,  seats  with  the  cushion   badly

damaged, windows cannot be shut  when  it  rains.

These  old  buses are littered with used  tickets,

paper, and other rubbish. Perhaps they have  never

been  swept  for months. The noise  from  the  old

engines  is so terrible that if you sit  near  the

front portion of the bus, you will at times get  a

terrific   headache  as  well.  There  have   been

frequent  breakdowns of these  old  buses  causing

traffic jams here and there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly urge that these old buses should

not be allowed to carry commuters any more, as  it

is  very  dangerous  to do so.  I  would  strongly

suggest that the Registry of Vehicles should  give

another  check  on all these buses to  ensure  the

safety of bus commuters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take this opportunity to ask the

Minister  for  Communications how many  new  buses

have  been  bought and put to use by all  the  bus

companies   since   the  implementation   of   the

reorganisation  of  the motor transport  service?

And  would  he be kind enough to request  the  bus

companies  to `put more new buses on  the  various

routes  to ease the present overcrowding  and  the

unnecessarily long waiting for the buses?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I propose to

deal  first with the complaints mentioned by  the

Member  for Sembawang. I appreciate the fact  that

in  his  criticism  he did say that  some  of  the

members  of the staff in the Registry of  Vehicles

would appear to be difficult when it comes to  the

question of inspection of taxis. I appreciate his

use  of  the word "some" because it is not just  a

wide sweep that the whole department is proving to

be  difficult,  but some may  be  difficult.  The

Member's  complaint  is to  the  effect  that  the

vehicle  inspectors do not give the taxi owner  or

driver a full list of all





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



the  complaints as to where the taxis have failed

to  come  up to the required mark and would  need

attention and repair in order to get a clearance.

And  that instead, the vehicle inspectors  would,

after   pointing  out  one  complaint  which   is

subsequently attended to, then look  for  another

complaint  and  send them away. It  would  appear

that  this  state  of affairs  did  unfortunately

exist  during the months of June, July and August

of  last  year. But I am pleased to say that  the

department   has,   since  August,   considerably

improved  the  situation, and  the  inconvenience

caused  to taxi drivers should not now arise.  It

is  quite  possible that the complaint  that  the

Member  has  received is not a  recent  one,  but

perhaps  a fairly long outstanding one  which  is

therefore  something of the past. But  if  `there

are  more  complaints of this nature, I  hope  he

will be good enough to forward the particulars to

us  so that, while they are fresh in the minds of

everyone, we will be able to deal with them  much

more quickly and have the matter rectified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for rudeness on the part of an official, as

stated  by  the Member, it is the policy  of  the

Government not to encourage rudeness on the  part

of  any  public  official to the members  of  the

public. If there are cases of such a nature, will

he  be good enough to advise the complainant  `to

submit  his  complaint, and the  matter  will  be

looked into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to move on to the comments of

the  Member for Katong, first, before  coming  to

the  Member for Mountbatten. There seems to be  a

general complaint that some bus drivers are rude.

That  is  also  the complaint of the  Member  for

Anson  - that bus commuters appear to be harassed

by  very crude bus drivers. Courtesy is something

that  takes some time to inculcate. It is  either

in  you or not in you, in which case you have got

to  be  educated. And education is  a  very  long

process.  Sometimes I feel that  the  Member  for

Katong,  who is associated with adult  education,

seems to have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



little  confidence in the efficacy  of  education

with respect to improvement of human nature.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I clarify? My

view  is  that one of the best forms of education

is legislation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I hope Members will agree that

it  is  not  necessary to legislate in  order  to

educate.  One  would think that  the  Member  for

Katong is a very impatient man. I think we should

not  resort  to  legislation  unless  as  a  last

resort.  I  think  we should  talk,  educate  and

persuade until we are blue in the face and, if it

does   not   work,   then   perhaps   resort   to

legislation.  So with regard to his  request,  in

view  of  the  fact  that  legislation  for   the

compulsory use of crash helmets has been a  great

success,  whether or not it is time to  introduce

legislation against jay walking, I would say that

I am a patient man and a very patient Minister. I

would  still say that it is not time yet, as  far

as  I  can  help  it,  to  introduce  legislation

against jay walking. Perhaps this time next  year

I  may  change my mind if he raises  the  subject

again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is true that there is a very' tight

schedule  for  bus drivers to bring  their  buses

back  to the terminals. Otherwise, if there  were

no  proper  bus schedules, complaints would  come

from the bus commuters that `they had to wait not

half an hour but probably one hour for the buses,

in  which  case  the  complaints  would  be  even

louder.  Of course,, we do not believe  that  bus

schedules, should be so tight that drivers should

be   reckless  or  that  we  encourage  negligent

driving. Far from it. We will take action  if  it

is  proved  that the driver or the conductor  has

been negligent in the execution of his duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for maintenance of buses, I think bus

operators themselves realise that, if they keep a

proper  maintenance of their vehicles, they  will

be  able to get more out of their buses. Firstly,

there will be savings in fuel and the buses  will

be'  able  to  run  for longer periods  of  time,

because  when a bus is on the road it is  earning

money.  I  think  it is in the  interest  of  bus

companies themselves to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>



ensure  that  there is proper maintenance.  It  is

possible  that sometimes the buses are  unable  to

keep  to  the schedule and may be in a  very  poor

condition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the Member for Anson who, speaking

on  behalf of bus workers, said that there  should

be  an  improvement  in their working  conditions,

vacation  leave,  etc.  Here  again,  a  good  bus

operator  as an employer will see to it  that  his

workers  are  reasonably paid, with adequate  time

for rest and recreation, and therefore they should

be  able to give maximum service. I think I  would

be  exceeding my authority if I tried to say  more

than  this,  in  other  words,  to  tell  the  bus

operator  how  to  be  a  good  employer.  It   is

understood  that it would be in the bus operator's

interest  to  be  a  good model  employer  to  his

workers,  and  leave it to the union  leaders  who

speak  on  behalf of the bus workers to  negotiate

with  the  employer concerned; and  we  wish  both

sides the best of luck.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the Member for Mountbatten. Before

coming to his question of scrapping old buses  and

so  on  and so forth, he has asked when would  the

Enforcement Section of the Registry of Vehicles be

operative.  I am pleased to say that this  section

is   almost  ready  to  begin  its  work.  We  had

recommended   under  the  White   Paper   on   the

Reorganisation of the Motor Transport  Service  of

Singapore, which was tabled in this House in July,

1970,  Command  Paper 21, the  recruitment  of  80

policemen  with 40 motor-cycles to be attached  to

the  Registry  of  Vehicles. We  expect  this  new

Enforcement  Section to be operational  in  April,

1972,  which means 10 days from now. As  early  as

July  1971, an Assistant Superintendent of  Police

was  seconded to the Registry of Vehicles  to  get

acquainted with the work involved and to  lay  the

necessary  groundwork. Thirty  policemen  and  two

sergeants were posted to the Registry of  Vehicles

in  January this year. The motor-cycles have  also

arrived and are registered with distinct numbers -

ROV.l  to  ROV.40. We do not have  to  ballot  for

these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



numbers.  They are for free! The present  recruits

are  now  undergoing motor-cycle  training,  which

would be completed in a week's time. A further  30

policemen and an Inspector of Police are  expected

to  join  this  Section by  June  this  year.  The

officers  in this Section are basically  policemen

and  are  vested with all the powers of  a  police

officer.  However, they will generally concentrate

on  the conduct of drivers, especially drivers  of

public   service  vehicles,  and  on  the  general

condition  of motor vehicles to ensure  that  they

are  mechanically safe and sound.  These  officers

will  complement  the traffic police  strength  in

antipollution campaigns against motor vehicles. In

order  that this special force is to be  respected

rather  than  feared, they will be  instructed  to

achieve  their  objective  through  education  and

persuasion  and, when necessary,  only  by  strict

enforcement of the rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the main crux of the complaints

from   Members  of  the  House.  The  Member   for

Mountbatten has suggested that old buses should be

scrapped and the Member for Anson complained  that

there  is  a  shortage of buses, followed  by  the

Member  for Bukit Ho Swee who complained that  the

noise  of  the  engines  of  some  old  buses  are

terrible.  He  has also asked how many  new  buses

have  been operating since reorganisation.  It  is

not denied that many buses which are still running

are  in  such poor condition that they  should  be

scrapped  and  replaced by newer  buses.  I  would

suggest  to  Members of this House and the  public

that we should ponder a little over this matter to

see  whether we are pushing matters too  hard  too

soon against our bus operators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we refer to the White Paper (Command 21 of

1970) tabled in this House on the 21st July, 1970,

on  the  Reorganisation  of  the  Motor  Transport

Service  of Singapore, according to paragraph  4.3

the 10 Chinese bus companies had a total bus fleet

of  only  768 buses. That was two years  ago  when

this  Report was published. But at the end of last

month,  February,  1972, the total  bus  fleet  of

these three Chinese bus



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>



companies - the previous 10 companies were  merged

into  three  companies  -was  1,988  buses,  which

represents an increase of 1.220 buses, or close to

150 per cent of the fleet which existed `two years

ago.  Even if allowance has been made for the fact

that  the  ex-Singapore Traction Company fleet  of

407 buses were acquired by the three companies  in

December,  1971, i.e., three months  ago,  at  the

price  of $2,750,000, Members should bear in  mind

what  the cost is to the operators for the balance

of  the increased fleet of over 800 new buses -800

over  the  last two years. Assuming that each  new

bus costs $40,000 - it could be $40,000 or $50,000

depending on the size of the bus, but let us  work

on  the  average  of  $40,000 -  these  three  bus

companies had to find the resources over the  past

two  years  to invest a sum of not less than  over

$30  million. This is not an insignificant  amount

by  any  standards; it is not $3 million,  or  $10

million, but over $30 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is just one year ago since the massive

reorganisation of our public bus services was  put

into  effect in April, 1971. Had the S.T.C, taken

our  advice as contained in the White Paper  para.

4.15 - STC to be reorganised - that reorganisation

was  coming  and that it would lose its privileged

position as the bus company of Singapore since the

other three amalgamated companies are coming in as

equal  competitors, then today, after one year  of

reorganisation,  everything  would  have   settled

down.  But  they  did  not  take  the  advice  and

Government  had to intervene three months  ago  in

early  December  to  prevent  a  collapse  of  STC

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the present three bus companies,

Amalgamated  Bus  Company (blue),  Associated  Bus

Services   (red),  and  the  United  Bus   Company

(yellow), had risen to the occasion by taking over

the  running of the former STC services. The  full

operation of ex-STC services resumed with  only  a

break of 24 hours. What is most appreciative on my

part was their willingness to take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



over  all the 1,700 drivers and conductors of STC,

as   otherwise  these  people  would   have   been

unemployed. Therefore, the smooth progress of  the

bus  service  reorganisation has suffered  only  a

temporary setback because of the collapse  of  STC

and  it is only fair that we should give the three

bus companies reasonable time to adjust themselves

to  this  new  situation. Only three  months  have

passed,  and therefore we cannot pass judgment  on

the adequacy of our bus services at this juncture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the state of the bus services in

Singapore  a year ago? Take April 1972 as  against

April  1971, and again, against April  1970,  what

was  it  then?  Let us give thought to  the  first

before  we  begin  to  be  critical.  Furthermore,

although the White Paper lays down an age limit of

17 years for public buses, it is felt that our bus

operators will, of their own accord, replace buses

even before they have reached the age limit of  17

years.  Singapore's bus commuters  are  so  choosy

that  when  an old bus comes along they  will  not

board  it. They prefer to wait for another 10,  15

or  even  20 minutes for a new bus to come  along,

and bus operators are aware of this. They know how

selective bus commuters can be, and they will,  of

their own accord, quickly replace them long before

the age limit is reached.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> They want to make their money's

worth!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I do not blame them. I think

they  are  right.  So there is  no  need  for  any

directive  from  the Registry of Vehicles  or  the

Ministry  of  Communications  to  tell   the   bus

operators to change their old buses for new ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, may I remind this House of a

recent  critical  article  published  in  the  New

Nation on this subject, "The Bus System - Good  or

Bad?"  The article ran for three days and came  to

this conclusion; page 9 of the issue of 9th March,

and I quote (I did not say it, they said it):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It would also be nice to bear in mind that

Singapore   has  the  best  public  transportation

system in the region, if not the whole of Asia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the tax-paying public can rejoice in the fact

that  it  is  also  one of the few non-Government-owned  non-subsidized services in  the  world.  It

makes a profit!'



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the

Minister  mentioned the investment of $30 million,

can  he tell us the income of the company? He  has

not mentioned any income of the companies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, I wish to make myself

clear  to  the  Minister. I am not  for  a  moment

advocating  the taking off of all  the  old  buses

from the road at one time. All I want is that  the

Government  should suggest to these bus  companies

to  maintain  their old buses and to service  them

properly before putting them on the roads.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, we are all very impressed with

the eloquence with which the Minister has defended

the public transport system, and we must certainly

agree  with  him  on the conclusion  that  he  has

reached, without the aid of the article in the New

Nation.  At the same time, I feel that  there  are

little  points which show that the system  is  not

all that perfect. There can be no system which  is

perfect,  and  it  is the job of the  Backbenchers

here  to  point to the need for one or  two  small

things, not  in the spirit of carping  criticism,

but in the spirit of constructive contribution.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For myself, may I say that I would like to

correct any impression that I may have made in the

debate just now that I feel that one should resort

to  legislation at the drop of a pin. I would like

to  clarify  that  there is educational  value  in

legislation,  provided the time is  opportune  for

its  implementation. But in respect of jaywalking,

apparently  the Minister wishes to  wait  for  yet

another year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am glad to know of the

reactions of Members because it gives me a  chance

to say more.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>



If  it  will satisfy them, let me say that  we  do

take  action on bus company operators, but  we  do

not talk about it. For the information of Members,

over  the  past  year  we have  imposed  financial

penalties  on  the  bus  companies  -against   the

Amalgamated  Bus Company, $1,600,  Associated  Bus

Services,   $13,200,  and  United   Bus   Company,

$17,400.  If we find that they are not putting  on

the  routes as many buses as they are supposed to,

and  they have been checked and found wanting,  we

penalise  them $2,000 a bus that is found lacking.

This  is the screw that we are tightening on them.

But, I think, we should be fair. They have made  a

great  effort  to bring in more than  $30  million

investment  in the buses - 800 new  buses  on  the

road  over the last two years, which is fantastic.

That  is as big a fleet as we ever had in donkey's

years. Therefore, I think we should be careful  as

to how far we can press them do not kill the goose

that  lays the golden eggs because, believe it  or

not, the 1968 revenue for the Registry of Vehicles

was  only $50 million, but for last year. 1971-72,

the revenue was $81 million.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank

the  Minister  for  having answered  not  only  my

question, but also those of all the other Members.

So,  with  their agreement, I would like to  thank

answer. I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Tay Boon Too, Ng Kah Ting, Ho Kah Leong, Ho See Beng and P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice the Members for Paya Lebar, Jurong

and  Moulmein have also moved amendments  to  this

Head of Expenditure. As we know that all three  of

them  are Presidents of Teachers' Unions,  I  will

leave  it to them to take up the professional  and

industrial problems of teachers and the  Education

Service in general. I will confine myself to those

aspects  which  affect teachers and  pupils  as  a

whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems I wish to raise is the high

cost  of education in Singapore. Let me hasten  to

add,  Sir,  the high cost of education to  certain

categories of people, that is (1) the lower income

group, and (2) the over-worked pupils in secondary

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are aware of the emphasis on technical

education  and participation in uniformed  groups.

In  the  case  of  the lower income  groups,  this

emphasis  is  costing  more  than  what  they  can

afford. I have spoken on this subject once before.

This   policy   does  not  appear  to   give   any

consideration to the minimisation of the  economic

effect of the readjustment of its policies on  the

parents of the students concerned. While it is not

possible for the Government to implement a  scheme

of  free  secondary education,  it  is  reasonably

expected  of  the  Government to  bring  secondary

education within the means of as many citizens  as

possible.  Many citizens, particularly those  from

the  lower  income group, have found the  cost  of

educating  their children to secondary level  very

expensive.  A student in the secondary school  has

to pay a school fee of $4 per month, plus a fee of

$2  for miscellaneous purposes thus making a total

of  $6  per  month.  The  only  students  who  are

exempted  from  the  payment  of  such  fees   are

students of Malay origin. Others, even those whose

parents  are in receipt of public assistance  from

the Social Welfare Department, are expected to pay

at  least  a fee of $1 for miscellaneous purposes.

Conditions prescribed by the Ministry of Education

for the remission of school fees from $6 per month

to $1 per month are extremely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>



rigid and restrictive to such an extent that it is

impossible for the student from a family  of  very

difficult  financial circumstances to  be  granted

such  a  remission  of school  fees.  One  of  the

conditions  is  that the family  income  does  not

exceed  $200 per month, and the other is that  the

remission, if granted, is subject to a maximum  of

10 per cent of the total enrolment in each school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other expenses involved in respect of

pupils, especially from the lower income group. If

the  schools are far from their homes,  invariably

they are, the children will have to remain be-hind

in  school  at  least  twice  a  week  for  extra-curricular activities and technical classes.  This

involves additional expenses for meals as well  as

additional  transport  where  workshops  are   not

located close to the school where the children are

admitted.  I  have  known of lower  in-come  group

parents,  especially those earning $200  or  less,

complaining  that it costs them at least  $30  per

month to keep each child in a secondary school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to this monthly recurrent

expenditure,  there  are  some  expenses  at   the

beginning of the school term, such as the purchase

of   books,   drawing  boards,  workshop   aprons,

geometrical instruments, etc., which are  required

for  technical  classes. A system of  loan  scheme

should be devised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Government's policy of

requiring every pupil to be enrolled in  at  least

one uniformed group in a school. I have known that

in  some schools uniforms have to be purchased  by

the  students  themselves. In certain  cases  they

have  to  buy  two  sets  of  uniforms,  one   for

ceremonial  purposes.  We are  encouraging  school

bands to be formed. In many schools, uniforms  for

the  bands are not provided and therefore children

from  poor  homes, even if they are  talented  and

interested  in  joining the  bands,  feel  shy  of

joining them just because they cannot afford it. I

hope  the  Minister will look into the possibility

of  providing these uniforms free-of-charge  which

will  be  returned to the school  when  the  pupil

leaves  the  school,  or  is  no  longer  in   the

uniformed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>



group. This is being done in some schools, but not

all. Surely we do not want participation in school

bands to be the exclusive right of only those  who

can afford it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another common complaint of parents with

children in secondary schools is the heavy load on

the school curricula. I have heard complaints from

parents  that  secondary school pupils  have  very

little time for homework and for home environment.

Sir,  I  speak  this  with  some  experience   and

authority.  I have the same complaint. The  pupils

spend  very little time in the house as  they  are

required  for extra-curricular activities,  games,

sports, etc., at least three to four times a week,

either in the evenings or mornings, outside  their

regular  school  hours.  Education  should  be  an

enjoyable process and not a burdensome one.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I remind hon. Members of

<br><br>This  is to prevent possible heartaches among  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, to talk about education  within  10

minutes is too short a time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our general education policy today should move

in   the  direction  of  consolidating  our  basic

education.  That  is what I would  call  back-bone

education.  In  other words, the children  of  the

various   communities  should  receive  a  certain

amount  of education in their mother tongue.  Sir,

all  along we have emphasised that children should

first  receive  education in their mother  tongue,

and at the same time learning a second language in

order to fit them into the multi-lingual and multi-cultural  context of our country. Indeed,  parents

in  general appreciate the value of mother  tongue

education. But may I know why many parents do  not

want  their  children  to  receive  mother  tongue

education in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>



the  first instance? If this can be satisfactorily

answered, then our back-bone education will  be  a

success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Education has made

considerable  praiseworthy efforts.  There  is  no

doubt  about it. But on the other hand,  there  is

still  plenty of room for drastic improvements  in

our  education  system.  We  all  appreciate  that

Singapore  thrives on international trade.  It  is

also  a  multi-racial Republic. We also appreciate

that  English is used as a medium of communication

for  promoting inter-communal understanding in our

own  country. It is also a language of science and

technology.  But while our economy and  technology

are  making  a  headway, we must  also  pay  equal

attention, if not more, to other values which have

been  acquired as a result of over 4,000 years  of

experience  and cultural traditions.  Parents,  in

general,  understand the value of  this.  However,

because  they are unable to have the cake and  eat

it,  they send their children to a language stream

other than their own. This is indeed a matter  for

regret.  As  a  Government, we must think  of  the

interests and future of our next generation.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must find ways and means to ensure that every

child  receives an education in the mother  tongue

first  and, at the same time, improves his  second

language, so that secondary school leavers will be

effectively  bi-lingual. If we  can  achieve  this

aim,  then I believe many parents will send  their

children  to schools to receive education  in  the

mother tongue first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, education systems in the world vary from

country  to country. In my opinion, in the context

of  our multilingual and multi-racial society, the

present  system of a six-year period  for  primary

education  should be extended to seven years.  The

seven-year  period will be allocated  as  follows.

For  the first six years, every child will receive

education in his mother tongue which, at the  same

time,   prepares  a  foundation  for  the   second

language.  The  seventh  year  will  be   reserved

entirely for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



the  teaching  of  a second language,  except  for

certain periods to be reserved for the teaching of

the mother tongue. At the end of the seventh year,

the  parents will then decide to which  stream  of

education  they  wish to send  their  children.  I

believe  that  in  this way  we  can  ensure  that

children   from  any  language  stream   will   be

effectively   bilingual  at  the  end   of   their

secondary education. In this way, we would be able

to  bring our policy of bi-lingual education to  a

satisfactory  conclusion.  I  think  there  is  an

urgent  task  ahead for a reform in our  education

system. If we still maintain the present system of

six  years  for primary education and continue  to

increase the teaching time for second language  at

the expense of the mother tongue, then it will not

help  us  in  our policy of bi-lingual  education.

This  is  my  opinion. It is no  solution  to  our

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next I would like to talk about schools in

the rural areas, in particular, the aided schools.

The  school  premises in the rural areas  are  far

from  ideal. In the past when aided schools  first

accepted   the  full  grant-in-aid   system,   the

Government  undertook to grant a dollar-for-dollar

aid  for  the  building of schools.  But  recently

there  has been some modification to this  dollar-for-dollar system. The capital grant is  now  made

on  the basis of the performance of the school. Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  this is not in  keeping  with  the

actual  circumstances of the schools in the  rural

areas,  in  which  the members  of  the  Board  of

Directors are not very rich people. They  have  to

work  very  hard  to  be able to  raise  money  to

rebuild   their   old   and   dilapidated   school

buildings.  Very often they have  to  spend  large

sums  of money to build school lavatories, leaving

only  a  meagre sum for the main building  itself.

Most of the school premises are made of planks and

attap  leaves for the roof. Are we to allow  these

old  and  dilapidated huts to continue as schools?

Sir,    we   must   understand   that   in    such

circumstances, the progress of the schools in  the

rural areas will be impeded.

abolished,  as shown in page 177 of the Estimates.

In other words, these posts of Teacher-in-Training

do  not exist any more. I would like to know  from

the  Minister for Education the reason  why  these

posts  have been abolished, and why will there  be

no  more  intake in the Teachers' Training College

in 1972-73.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question concerns the problem of

relief teachers. We had occasion last year to hear

the  Minister of State for Education mention  that

there  was  then  a  very high  number  of  relief

teachers  required  for various  reasons  to  fill

vacancies  or  to  relieve  those  who   were   on

maternity  leave, sick leave, or on retirement.  I

believe  that  some of these relief  teachers  are

graduates, and some are not. However, some of them

are  suitably  qualified, and I am just  wondering

whether  they have any opportunity to be  absorbed

into the Education Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point concerns T.T.C, graduates required

to  step in as relief teachers. I understand  that

the next batch of T.T.C, graduates will be passing

out   sometime  this  year.  Therefore,  with  the

problem of relief teachers being resolved, another

attendant problem will arise - how to absorb  this

year's  batch  of  graduates  into  the  Education

Service,, and what of future batches?  I  do  not

know  whether  there are plans to see  that  there

will  be no occasion for the supply to exceed  the

demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if I can come to the types of courses which

were  organised  sometime ago by the  Ministry  of

Education.  These are in-service training  courses

for  teachers to acquire additional skills  or  to

polish  up  their  skills, and the  Bonus  courses

which,  on  successful completion, will entitle  a

teacher  to  some sort of a bonus  for  a  certain

period. I would like to know from the Minister the

number of courses which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



were  conducted  last year, and  whether  such  new

courses will be conducted this year as well as next

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Bonus courses, I believe my

colleague,  the  Member  for  Telok  Blangah,   had

occasion to seek clarification from the Minister of

State  for  Education  as to whether  such  courses

would  be organised more frequently to enable  more

teachers  to participate. I hope the Minister  will

care to make some observations on these points.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Would the Minister like to reply to

some of the points first?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Yes.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I am quite taken  up  with  the

suggestion from the Member for Telok Blangah  about

a loan scheme to help needy pupils. We can consider

that.  However, I cannot agree with  him  that  the

cost of education in Singapore is high. I would say

that  in  this respect we are in a better  position

than  most countries because we have the facilities

to allow everyone to have an education. Whenever  a

case of real hardship can be made, aid is given.  I

think  the  management committees are now seriously

considering the possibility of giving free  lunches

to  very  poor  pupils who have to attend  workshop

sessions in the evenings.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member's other observation

that  an  added burden is imposed on poor students,

by  their  having to supply their own uniforms  for

school bands and other extra-curricular activities,

either he or I have been misinformed. As far as the

policy  of  the Ministry of Education is concerned,

all  uniforms  for uniformed groups and  bands  are

supplied  free. Only in certain cases are  students

asked  to buy their own shoes. But here again,  the

poor  students are aided, as shoes are  bought  for

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the heavy load on the students, I

heartily  agree with the Member for Telok  Blangah

that education should not be a chore. I hate to see

our  school children going to school with tears  in

their eyes. A directive has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



already been given and steps have been taken to see

that,  as far as possible, learning should be  made

enjoyable  for  our children. In fact,  if  Members

were to take time off just to drop in at one of the

large  number of our primary schools and watch  the

new  integrated  syllabus being  implemented,  they

will  know  what  I  mean when  they  see  children

learning   their   lessons  happily   without   any

inhibitions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, in this respect, the Ministry of

Education  is re-examining its priorities  to  find

out  what its objectives should be. In fact, during

the  last  few  years, we have been so  engaged  in

nation-building  that many other  Ministries  have,

shall  I  say,  imposed their requirements  on  the

Ministry  of Education. We want them to  be  strong

and  healthy. We want them to keep Singapore  clean

and  green.  While  these and many  other  national

campaigns,  in which we are all engaged,  are  very

good  for us, we must at the same time realise that

the schoolboys and girls have limited time at their

disposal. Their capacity to do the many things they

are  now  asked  to  do  is  limited  by  the  time

available.  We are examining and re-examining  this

aspect  to establish the order of priority so  that

first  things come first instead of wanting  to  do

too  many things at one time. I can assure  Members

that this is foremost in my mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar has made a suggestion

that in order to really succeed in our objective to

make  our citizens bi-lingual or multi-lingual,  we

should  extend the primary school period  from  six

years  to seven years. It can be done, but it  will

cost  a  lot of money. I think it is reasonable  to

assume  that, with an additional year and with  the

proper method of teaching, we will be able to  make

bi-linguists  of  our students. At  the  moment  my

Ministry is examining the possibility, with the two

semester  system,  of  giving special  coaching  to

students  who  are weak in the second language  for

six  months or a year. This should enable a student

from  any  stream  on  completion  of  his  primary

education to be in a position to choose any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



language  stream for his secondary  education.  For

instance,  students in Chinese primary schools  who

take  English  as  a second language  may,  in  the

secondary  institution,  elect  to  continue  their

secondary  school education in English or  Chinese,

and  it  is  the same with the Malay and the  Tamil

streams.  If  we  are  able to use  modern  methods

appropriate to our environment, we may reach such a

stage when transference from one language stream to

another  will  present no problem for the  student.

Once that is achieved, I think we can consider that

our  schools  are  truly  integrated,  because  the

barrier  to  integration among some of  the  school

children is largely one of language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to aid for rural schools, I think the

Member  for  Paya Lebar is misinformed.  There  has

been no change in the policy of a dollar-for-dollar

grant  to  rural  aided schools.  Where  they  find

difficulty  in getting aid, or where  there  is  no

encouragement  given to continue  the  aid,  it  is

because the school may be in a resettlement or in a

redeveloped  area. It would then be  advisable  for

the management committee and for Government not  to

throw  away  good money, because the  school  would

have to be shifted very soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of relief teachers raised by the

Member for Punggol, I think the Member for Moulmein

has  replied  very clearly in his  press  interview

this  morning with regard to the position of relief

teachers.  This interview was published in  one  of

the  local  dailies.  I agree  with  him  that  the

position will improve when the 800 or so final year

students of the Teachers' Training College have sat

for  and  passed  their examinations.  One  of  the

reasons  why  the  post of Teacher-in-Training  has

been  abolished  is  to keep up with  international

practice. It has been found by experts - not by  me

- that part-time training is not suitable. Teachers

should be trained full-time. Of course, there is no

question of doubt that, wherever possible,  T.T.C.-trained  graduates  will  be  recruited  as  relief

teachers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Member's question whether we should give

jobs  to  T.T.C, graduates  in  the  Ministry   of

Education, in reply I will instead ask him  whether

we   can  guarantee  jobs  for  graduates  of   the

University of Singapore, the Singapore Polytechnic,

Ngee  Ann  College, or any other  institutions  for

that matter. This is something which nobody can do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol also wants to know how many

in-service  courses were conducted  last  year  and

whether  we  will continue to run these  in-service

courses.  To  the second part of the  question,  of

course,  we  will continue to run them  because  it

means  upgrading the skills of teachers. As regards

the   number  of  in-service  courses  which   were

conducted last year, may I suggest that since  this

is  a  matter  of  detail, the  Member  puts  in  a

question for Question Time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am really very surprised to learn from him - and

I  hope it is not true -that in-service courses  to

upgrade skills would only be popular because  there

is  bonus as an incentive. At least he has  implied

that.  However,  I would like to believe  that  the

20,000  teachers that we have in the service would,

of their own accord, improve themselves rather than

depend on bonus as an incentive.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to make

some  clarification. First of all, with  regard  to

the  Minister's  reply on the  question  of  relief

teachers,  I  am well aware of the  fact  that  the

Member  for  Moulmein  has said  something  to  the

press.  But  the  Minister  for  Education  totally

missed  my  point. I said that some of  the  relief

teachers,   graduates   and   non-graduates,    are

adequately qualified, and I wanted to know  whether

they can be absorbed into the Education Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of in-service training courses,

the  scheme with bonus payment was started  by  the

Ministry  of  Education. I think  the  Minister  of

State  for  Education can bear me  out  that  if  a

teacher  successfully completes  a  bonus  training

course, he is entitled to a bonus.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>



I  believe this was one of the incentives  given  to

teachers  because  of  the many  grouses  they  had,

before the restructuring of their salary scales.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Of course, Mr Speaker, Sir, relief

teachers  who are capable and efficient always  have

the opportunity of being absorbed into the Education

Service. There is no doubt about that at all.  There

is no fear that they would not be absorbed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards bonus for in-service training courses,

we  started  it as an incentive. But, as  I  say,  I

would hate to think that it is only incentives which

motivate  our teachers to attend in-service training

courses.  We  will  continue  conducting  in-service

courses  for  upgrading the skills of our  teachers.

While  it  is  an incentive, I hope  that  it  is  a

secondary  motivation for teachers to  attend  these

courses, and not the primary consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, whether or not this is a

primary  or  secondary motivation,  I  am  not  less

concerned  with the question of monetary inducements

that are forthcoming under such a scheme. What I  am

more concerned is whether the Ministry is continuing

to run these in-service training courses and, if so,

how  many? Or is the Ministry of Education going  to

continue  running these so-called bonus  courses?  I

for  one  would like to see that when  our  teachers

attend in-service training courses or bonus courses,

they  do not go in with the idea of getting  one  or

two  extra  increments, but  because  they  want  to

polish up or upgrade their skills.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wish to make my contribution on a point arising  out

of the Minister's reply. With regard to the Member's

remarks that teachers should be motivated other than

monetary  reasons when taking up in-service courses,

I  would like to tell him that normally teachers, on

their  own accord and in the interest of the service

and  career,  take  up  extra  courses  without  any

expectation of bonuses, and so on. But this  is  the

case  only with courses which are related  to  their

own interest and their own liking.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very often because of the major shifts in the

educational  system in the last few years,  teachers

sometimes are asked to do jobs contrary to their own

aptitudes and interests. Sometimes it helps  to  pay

bonuses for attending these courses, as the Ministry

itself  has  recognised. Therefore,  while  agreeing

with  the Minister that the main motivation must  be

for  the  love  of  it, there is  no  harm  for  the

Ministry  to  increase the number of  courses  where

bonus payments are made. Therefore, this question of

motivation  for  the wrong purposes  should  not  be

given too much prominence. Otherwise, the impression

would  be  given  that it is only for  the  sake  of

bonuses that teachers take up these courses.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim, I think it would be a good

idea to take the suspension at this stage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to clear up any

misunderstanding  that may have  arisen  during  the

debate  just  now,  I would like  to  say  that  the

Ministry  of Education will, of course, continue  to

conduct   these  in-service  courses   which   carry

bonuses,  because  the  exigencies  of  service  may

require   it  with  the  introduction  of  technical

education   and   greater  emphasis   on   technical

education.  It  is possible that some  teachers  who

have  been  in  the academic streams  will  have  to

undergo  special  courses for  retraining,  and  for

which  they may have to spend quite a long  time  to

acquire the skills to be proficient enough to  teach

certain  subjects  in  the  technical  stream.   So,

therefore, these Bonus courses will continue  to  be

conducted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I am indeed very grateful to

the  Minister for Education for having  pointed  out

that   more  courses  along  such  lines   will   be

conducted. I am also grateful that he has  clarified

the points I have raised just now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I am glad to see that the Minister for

Education  is  now able to answer all  queries  with

ease  and in a calm manner. I hope he will have  the

same confidence when we come to the next amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years our education system has

been  undergoing  tremendous  changes.  Besides  the

major   change   from  academic-bias  education   to

technical-bias  education,  there  are  many   other

changes.  However, I am sorry to say  that  some  of

these  changes are indecisive in nature, while  some

others  are  dependent on the change  of  Ministers.

Whether  the changes are all for the good,  we  will

have  to  wait for history to tell. Because  of  the

speed  of the changes, sometimes even people in  the

educational circles feel at a loss. Thus,  I  wonder

whether adequate and prudent consideration had  been

given  before the changes were made. For example,  a

few



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>



years ago, it is required to use English in teaching

Mathematics and Science in Chinese schools, and  the

teaching of History, Geography and Civics in Chinese

in  the  English schools, and so on. However, before

long  the  directive  is not  rigidly  enforced  and

principals  are given the discretion to  decide.  At

the  moment,  it  is not certain  in  what  language

textbooks are to be used for Mathematics and Science

in  Chinese secondary schools. The reason given  for

the   abolition   of  geography   and   history   as

examination subjects for the combined primary school

leaving examination is "to raise the interest of the

students in these subjects so that the students  may

not  have to learn by rote for the examination. Thus

the  teachers  will  be better  able  to  use  their

teaching methods freely to obtain greater effect  in

order to achieve the aims of education as expected."

This  was  the  reply  given to the  Chinese  Middle

School  Teachers' Union by the Ministry of Education

and  it was published on 1st March this year in  the

Chinese  newspapers. If that is the  case,  why  not

abolish   the   combined  primary   school   leaving

examination? Why not let us do away with  all  this,

so  that  teachers  may  be able  to  effect  better

teaching  methods  to achieve the expected  aims  of

education?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is the use of so-called "wordless

new  syllabus".  It may be all right to  experienced

teachers  and  bright students. But if the  teachers

are  without  any  experience  and  the  pupils  are

backward,  then  it will amount to nothing,  whether

the  students are attending school or  not.  I  have

come  across  certain  pupils who,  after  attending

primary school for two years, are still not able  to

write  their  own names. Sir, I am  not  being  very

archaic  and  I am not against educational  reforms,

but  the question is whether these reforms are  good

for our education. Here, I would like to suggest  to

the  Minister that before the implementation of  any

change  in the education system or policy, we should

consider  the views and opinions of all  the  people

concerned. We should not merely go by the reports of

experts  or  the  liking of some.  In  case  of  any

failure of the reformation, the losers will always



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



be  our  innocent students. It will also  adversely

affect  the quality and interest of our  nation  in

the long run.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me touch on the question of the teaching

of  second  language in Chinese schools. All  along

Chinese schools have been using English as a second

language.  They have been striving hard to  promote

the  learning of English by increasing the sessions

or  by  other means. Some schools even  go  to  the

extent of providing additional English teachers out

of  their  own funds to teach the English language.

However,  all  these efforts seem to have  achieved

not  much success. Basically, I think it is because

both  the  textbooks and the teachers are far  from

ideal.  Generally,  not every  English  teacher  in

Chinese schools is properly trained in the teaching

of  the second language. There is great mobility of

such   teachers  too.  Some  pre-university   level

classes  are  taught  by  teachers  with   only   a

Cambridge  School Certificate. It is  necessary  to

have  trained  teachers and to have  new  textbooks

compiled  to meet the needs and background  of  our

local   situation  in  order  to  meet  the  actual

requirement  for a better standard  of  English  in

Chinese schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise a final question for

the Minister's consideration. That is the abolition

of the post allowance to school Vice-Principals. In

October  last, the Teachers' Unions had reached  an

agreement  with  the Ministry of Education  on  the

readjustment of salary structure. To be  fair,  the

Ministry should not change the substance and spirit

of  the  agreement by acting unilaterally. How  can

the  post  allowance of Vice-Principals be entirely

abolished  in the course of the readjustment  after

it  has been implemented for so many years? I would

like the Minister to explain this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

praiseworthy to note that the Ministry of Education

is   continually  making  efforts  to  improve  the

quality  of  education.  The  recent  decision   to

abolish  examinations in History and  Geography  in

the  primary schools is an example of such  effort.

However, this decision has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



been  questioned in some quarters and the  validity

of some of the criticisms merits close attention by

the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason for abolishing these examinations

seems to be the heavy learning load on children and

the  lack  of  time  or the teacher  to  cover  the

syllabus for these subjects. The pressure  of  time

in  the  learning  of  these  subjects  has  caused

students to commit to memory a mass of facts  which

have no meaning to them, who only present them  out

of context. With History and Geography becoming non-examination  subjects, it is  hoped  that  children

will  be  able to learn at their own leisure,  thus

ensuring  a comprehensive grasp of the subjects  in

their  totality so that learning becomes meaningful

and directional.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the mere abolition of examinations on

these  subjects  may  not  help  to  achieve   this

objective.  Children in the Primary School  Leaving

Examination  classes  tend to  be  over-examination

conscious,  and  may  not  pay  due  attention  and

interest to non-examination subjects. This frame of

mind  applies  with  equal truth  to  the  teachers

teaching  in  these classes. So it may  perhaps  be

more  feasible  to  revise  the  syllabi  of  these

subjects by reducing their content so that they  do

not  impose  a burden upon the children's  capacity

for  learning. However, if it is intended to  carry

through  with the decision to suspend examinations,

then  this should be confined only to the  P.S.L.E.

classes.  Examinations  in  these  subjects  should

continue  in  the lower standards  in  which  these

subjects are taught. An overall suspension of these

examinations may lead to its total neglect  in  the

other extreme and defeat the very purpose for which

it is intended to achieve. I think the Minister for

Education  will agree with me that  history  is  an

important subject in our school curriculum  for  it

records  the events of a nation's past. If students

do  not know the events of our nation's past,  then

there  is  hardly  any chance to build  a  nation's

future. And more so, our future generation will not

be  able to know, for instance, who is the Minister

for  Education  in the year 1972!  Whether  or  not

there is merit in abolishing examinations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>



on  history,  I  strongly urge  the  Minister  for

Education  to seriously consider it before  taking

steps to implement this policy.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the

last  Budget session, I touched on the  integrated

school  system. I regret that even now  there  are

very  few  schools that can be truly  said  to  be

integrated    schools.   Many   schools    display

signboards to say that they are integrated schools

but,  in  fact,  they  are  completely  segregated

schools.   Some  of  these  Government  integrated

schools  are  separated by language,  the  English

stream  occupying one half of the  building  while

the  Chinese stream occupies the other half.  Even

in  the  field  of  sports, the  two  streams  are

separated.  It  is further disappointing  to  note

that  segregation  exists in  the  English  stream

where  the students are separated by race. Chinese

students are put in different classes while  Tamil

and  Malay students are put together in one class.

The  excuse for this is second language. I  wonder

how  the second language can be used as an  excuse

for  these  students  to be segregated  throughout

their  secondary school career,  when  it  is  the

Government's intention and policy to integrate the

people of different races. This is a very pressing

problem.  May I ask the Minister for Education  to

look  into this matter as soon as possible  before

further damage is done in our schools?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is commendable on, the part of the Government

to  lay  emphasis on bilingualism, which has  been

long overdue. It is true that bi-lingualism or bi-lingualism can make our citizens more tolerant and

to  achieve a better understanding of each other's

cultures and traditions. But I wonder if  we  have

sufficient teachers who are themselves bi-lingual.

May  I suggest that emphasis be laid on persuading

teachers  to  be  bi-lingual  themselves.  It   is

through their understanding of the complexities or

problems  faced by the other races that they  will

be  able to impart their views of tolerance on the

younger generation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>



At  present,  we  find teachers  educated  in  one

medium only and, therefore, conversant only in one

language,  like living in cocoons. These  teachers

are  quite often insulted from ignorance of  their

own  problems, customs, traditions. The  aesthetic

qualities found in a knowledge of a language other

than  their  own  are  not much  of  an  asset  to

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, an option was

given  to the various schools to teach Mathematics

and  Science in the language they prefer,  largely

because  there  was insufficient  staff  to  teach

these  subjects  in  English in  a  Chinese-medium

school, and as a result we found that the standard

of Mathematics and Science began to fall. About  a

year  ago, I announced that when sufficient  staff

has  been  trained in the T.T.C, and are available

to  teach Mathematics and Science, we will make it

compulsory to teach these two subjects in  English

in Chinese schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am afraid the Member for Jurong really

made  a  wild and sweeping statement when he  said

that many children who have been in school for two

years  cannot write their names. I know there  are

always  black  sheep to be found  in  a  group  of

people  and  probably we also have  our  share  of

retarded  children among the young ones.  However,

if  it  is really true that these students  cannot

write their names after two years of schooling,  I

think  what they need is not so much a teacher  or

help  from  the Education Ministry, but help  from

the  psychologists. However, I am sure  that  such

cases are, few and far between, and if they should

come  to  the notice of the Member for  Jurong,  I

would  ask him to appeal to the Ministry of Health

for assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of incorporating the

allowance  of  the  Vice-Principal  into  the  new

salary scale, it may also interest and please  him

to  know  that we have written to the Ministry  of

Finance  on  this subject. This was a point  which

was  probably overlooked by both the Union and the

Ministry during the negotiations. Anyway,  we  are

trying  to  rectify this. The final decision  will

have to depend



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



upon  the Ministry of Finance, though I can assure

him  that  the Ministry of Education will advocate

the  incorporation of this allowance,  because  we

think that there is a case to be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad that the Member for Bras Basah has

realised, or agreed, that it will be a good  thing

to  do  away  with  examinations  in  History  and

Geography  in the P.S.L.E. If this is so,  and  if

his  own reasoning has led him to this conclusion,

I  think  it  will lead him to the  fact  that  we

should  abolish  this examination in  the  primary

schools.  Therefore, I cannot understand  why,  on

the  one  hand, he considers that it is advisable.

in  order  to  make the students less examination-orientated,  to abolish the P.S.L.E, examination,

but  on  the  other  hand  to  continue  with  the

examination  of  these  subjects  in  the  primary

schools at the lower levels. Anyway, I am  of  the

opinion,  though I am not a professional educator,

that  it  is no use talking about the significance

of  History  or  the importance of  Geography,  if

children do not understand what they read. I think

our  first  priority should be to teach and  allow

children  to  get a firm grasp of the language  or

languages. That is the reason why I thought, after

consulting professional educators, that we  should

take  History and Geography as part of a  language

lesson.  Although there is no examination for  the

two  subjects, part of the information  and  facts

which  they  read and gather from the  History  or

Geography  textbooks would be required  when  they

sit  for  their language examinations. This  would

also   allow   the   teachers  more   freedom   in

approaching  the  subject  and  to  make  it  more

interesting. So it is not a question of  free-for-all  for  the  teachers to do what they  like  and

ignore  the subjects. But we hope that, by  making

both   History   and   Geography   non-examination

subjects, they would be made more interesting  and

more pleasant for the child to learn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all of us, including the Member for Anson,

would  like to see actual integration taking place

in  the  schools. But I think it is  too  much  to

expect  a  miracle to be performed in five  years.

and to see all our people mingling



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



freely.  The  barrier to integration lies  in  the

ability  to  communicate in a common language.  We

want  to  integrate  them by  making  them  multi-lingual.  Therefore, it is not true  to  say  that

instead  of encouraging integration, the  Ministry

is  discouraging it by putting pupils of different

races into different classes, i.e., the Tamil  and

Malay  students are in one class and  the  Chinese

students in the other classes - students are  only

put  in  the  same class when they take  a  second

language.  For  instance, if the Tamil  and  Malay

students are studying either Tamil or Malay, then,

wherever possible, we put them in the same  class.

I  think all the teachers and principals are aware

of  this integration policy. So I do not think the

Member  for  Anson has got the right  information.

There  is no segregation in the way that he  seems

to think.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, I think I have covered most of

the  points. But if there are any points  which  I

may have left out, probably Members can remind me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am glad to

know that the Minister for Education has seriously

discussed matters with us here. However, there  is

one point which he has overlooked, and that is the

question  of  raising the standard of  English  in

Chinese schools. I would like to hear his views on

this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I would like to express the hope that the Minister

for  Education  will enlighten us on  the  present

policy  of the dollar-for-dollar grant-in-aid  for

aided   schools  in  the  rural  areas.   I   have

discovered that several schools in the rural areas

have  to rebuild their schools, but they have  not

been  able to obtain this dollar-for-dollar  grant

in  aid or any capital grant. Now, if the Board of

Directors  of the school or the school authorities

do  not  understand the procedure in applying  for

this  dollar  for  dollar grant-in-aid,  I  wonder

whether  the  Minister will consider  giving  more

information to such people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  comment  on a particular point  on  the  post-allowance for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



Vice-Principals which the Minister, in his reply,

had  left  out. He mentioned that this  allowance

was possibly a point his officials and the unions

had missed in their negotiations. I would like to

tell  him  that  that  is  not  so, because  the

principles enunciated in the agreement  are  very

clearly  spelt  out and they cover  them.  May  I

suggest that someone in the Finance Ministry  has

messed it up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I will not quarrel with the

Member  for Moulmein about that. Coming first  to

the Member for Paya Lebar, let me assure him that

there  is  no  change in the policy of  giving  a

dollar-for-dollar grant to aided  schools.  Where

he has difficulty. I would say that it is largely

because  the  management committee  has  probably

experienced  difficulty in raising the  requisite

amount, which they will have to raise in order to

continue the projects which they have in hand. Or

it  could  be  that, as I have said earlier,  the

school  is  likely to he resettled, or  that  the

area is marked for further development so that it

would   be  wise  not  to  spend  further   money

rebuilding  and repairing the school  because  it

would have to be demolished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the Member for Jurong on how

to  improve the teaching of a second language, we

are trying to supplement or give further sessions

in  English as second language by opening classes

in  the afternoons, so that those who really need

it  will have the opportunity to spend more  time

on  the study of the language. But here again,  I

think  it  depends on whether  we  can  evolve  a

suitable  system  to teach English  as  a  second

language,  or  Chinese as a second  language  for

that matter because of the special content of our

society.  This  is where professionals  like  the

Members  for  Jurong and Paya Lebar can  help  if

they  will just get their unions to consider what

is   the   best   approach  under   the   special

circumstances. Anyway, the Research  Officers  in

the  Ministry  of Education are exercising  their

minds on this matter and possibly we may come  up

with a new syllabus and new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



methods. It could be something of the type  which

was  considered  a great success in  America  and

which is now telecast over our T.V. But I do  not

consider  this  method to be exactly  appropriate

here,  because it deals with people  who  already

know  how to speak English, and moreover it deals

with adults. Anyway, this is food for thought for

the professionals in the Ministry of Education. I

hope   they  will  be  able  to  come   to   some

conclusions,  so  that we  can  have  a  syllabus

appropriate to our surroundings arid so  make  it

easier for our students to acquire a knowledge of

English,  Malay.  Chinese or Tamil  as  a  second

language without too much sweat;  though  in  the

end  it  comes  to sweating on the  part  of  the

students before they can grasp a command  of  the

language.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, perhaps when I moved the

amendment  and spoke on the expenses of  uniforms

for  students in the uniformed groups. I did  not

make  myself  clear. If I remember  correct, the

Minister  mentioned that all  such  uniforms  are

provided  free And he has also said  that  I  was

perhaps  misinformed. I want a clarification,  to

make  clear  on  what I have said,  and  also  to

listen  to the Minister's further views  on  free

uniforms,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am correctly informed, uniforms are

provided  free in the case of members  in  N.C.C.

that is, the National Cadet Corps of the Army and

the  Police.  However, the  uniformed  groups  in

schools  are not confined to these two categories

alone.  There  are  other uniformed  groups, for

instance,  the Boy Scouts, the Girl  Guides,  the

Red  Cross,  the  Boys' Brigade, the  St.  John's

Ambulance Brigade and, most important of all, the

school   bands   which  we  are  very   keen   on

advocating.  As I have said earlier on,  I  speak

with  some  experience  as  I  have  children  in

schools. I have said that there are many  schools

which provide these uniforms free of charge, on a

loan  basis. However, there are also some schools

where  the  children  have to  buy  the  uniforms

themselves.  It  is  all  right  for  me  to  buy

uniforms for my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



children,  but  there are some  people  who  cannot

afford  to  buy  them. This is where  I  think  the

Minister said that the school management committees

are  even looking into the possibility of providing

free  lunches if students have to stay  behind  for

technical  education.  This  is  a  welcome   move.

Perhaps  we can extend this privilege by  providing

free  uniforms  so that we do not confine  children

from  the lower income group to the N.C.C, of  the

Police or the Army. If they have talent and if they

are  interested, they can join the school hand.  It

is exorbitant to buy uniforms, especially those for

the school band. I know this from experience. Can I

have the Minister's clarification on this issue?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if school bands

are  encouraged by the schools and form part of the

school   curriculum,  then  uniforms  are  provided

completely  free.  I would not know  whether  Scout

uniforms  are  given free, but I know  for  certain

that  needy students who join the Boys' Brigade  or

Boy Scouts are given free uniforms. Anyway, all the

N.C.C, uniforms are given completely free. In  the

case  of  Scouts group, where the Troop belongs  to

the school, free uniforms are probably provided. If

it  is  not free, then it is a remnant of  the  old

custom.   Whether  or  not  the  school  management

committees  will provide free uniforms,  I  do  not

know.  As  far  as  the Ministry  of  Education  is

concerned, we have provided free uniforms  for  the

different  categories of uniformed groups  which  I

have  stated.  Much as we like,  I  will  not  make

promises  just now, because finance is not  in  the

hands of the Ministry of Education. It has to  come

from  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  There  are  many

aspects  of  the problem which must be looked  into

before  we  can  provide  free  uniforms  for   the

uniformed  groups,  like  the  Boys'  Brigade,  Boy

Scouts or the Red Cross. And I say it again that in

the  case of the N.C.C., which is encouraged by the

Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



Education, uniforms are completely free, For sports

too, jerseys, shorts, boots and spikes are supplied

completely free if the students are members of  the

school  team.  In cases where these items  are  not

supplied free, the poor students can apply for  and

be given aid,



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> I thank the Minister for his

elaboration. I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said just now that even if I were allowed

to  speak  for  one whole day on  the  question  of

education, I might not be able to finish expressing

all my views. However, let me briefly touch on some

problems   of   education  which   require   urgent

attention.  My  colleagues and I, who  are  in  the

teaching  profession, are of the opinion  that  the

numerous  educational  seminars  organised  by  the

specialist  inspectors were not very well  managed.

There were too many. In the first term of this year

alone  there  were seminars for Primary  I  and  II

revised  syllabus for Mathematics, the Primary  III

and IV revised syllabus for Physical Education, the

Primary III and IV revised syllabus for Music, etc.

All  these so-called seminars were of two or  three

hours' duration only. In these seminars, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



specialist inspectors merely took out their  notes

and  rattled them off, and that was the end of it.

However,  the  teachers who had  to  attend  these

seminars, especially those who come from the rural

areas are experiencing some difficulties. As  soon

as  their  schools were dismissed at  about  12.50

p.m., they had to take a quick lunch, rush off  to

catch a bus and should within one and a half hours

reach  their destination. The seminars would begin

at  2.30  p.m. They were in such great haste  that

when  they  reached  their destination  they  were

panting  like dogs. The seminars were  of  two  or

three  hours'  duration.  I  doubt  whether  these

seminars  will  help the teachers in familiarising

themselves  with  the  new  teaching  methods  and

whether  any  real  objectives  can  be  achieved.

Moreover, most of the primary school teachers  are

not  specialist teachers. They should be  able  to

teach  all subjects. The subjects taught  by  them

are not the same every year. Sometimes before they

are  conversant  with a certain subject  they  are

asked  to  attend  a seminar. We can  imagine  the

outcome  of such a seminar. As for those  teachers

who  come  from the small schools,  they  have  to

teach   many   subjects  in   different   classes.

Therefore,  it is very likely that  they  will  be

asked  to  attend  seminars on  various  subjects.

Under  such  circumstances, it is not possible  to

expect these teachers to perform their duties well

and to benefit from such seminars. Hence, the main

objective of the seminars was lost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no limit to learning.

It  is  the  duty  of a teacher  to  keep  himself

abreast  of  the  latest trend in  his  particular

field. He must keep himself informed of the latest

knowledge.  The  theory  of  education  cannot  be

studied  in two or three hours, A teacher  has  to

spend  a  lot  of  time studying  the  methods  of

teaching.  Whether or not the methods of  teaching

are suitable will depend on the specific school in

which  he  teaches. I am of the opinion  that  the

seminars  should be well planned. They  should  be

conducted during the long vacation period.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



They  should  last  at  least  a  few  days.   The

discussions should be held in a systematic manner.

The  results  of  the discussions,  including  the

teachers' reactions, should be considered, and any

proposals made should be implemented. It  is  only

logical  to do so. It is impossible to  discuss  a

subject  within  three hours at a seminar.  To  my

mind this is only a waste of time and effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me touch on a different problem which

has  become quite common in Singapore,  but  which

has  not  been  solved.  I  am  referring  to  the

allegations  of  members  of  the  public  against

public  officers. We live in a democratic  country

and  the  people have every right to  censure  any

corrupt  officials  or  to make  any  constructive

criticism   against   certain   aspects   of   the

Government's policy. They are allowed to  exercise

such rights. However, some of the allegations  are

groundless  and  are not based on facts.  Some  of

them  are  mere  frame-ups. Such  allegations  are

usually made in the form of anonymous letters.  On

receipt  of such letters, the department concerned

will  carry out an investigation and if  there  is

any  truth in the allegation, the officer will  be

punished.  If  not, then that is the  end  of  the

matter.  We  can  imagine the mental  torture  the

alleged   officer   has   to   undergo   when   an

investigation is being conducted, and  the  effect

it  might  have  on his reputation.  However,  the

person  who  makes  an untruthful  allegation  has

achieved   his   purpose,   that   is,   malicious

defamation  of a certain official, and is  allowed

to  go unpunished. Such procedures in dealing with

the complaints will result in the victimisation of

these officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, those in the teaching profession

are  very  particular about their good name.  When

dealing  with  such complaints,  the  Ministry  of

Education should follow a rational procedure.  Any

letter  of complaint which does not bear any  real

names and addresses should not be dealt with.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Your time is up, Mr Tay.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

do not want to talk on the problem of policies.  I

merely   want   to  touch  on  the  technique   of

implementing  our policies. Our policy  of  multi-lingualism  is a wise and farsighted one  and  has

won international acclaim. However, from the views

expressed  by  other Backbenchers, it  seems  that

they   are   not  entirely  satisfied   with   its

implementation, and that something has gone  wrong

somewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our students are not fluent not only in their

mother  tongue but also in their second  language.

This  might be due to the fact that our Government

is  more  concerned  about fostering  science  and

technology,  thereby resulting in the  neglect  of

the  languages.  Subjects such as  the  humanities

have  been  neglected.  A  certain  Chinese  press

recently  advertised for translators.  There  were

about   20  applicants  and  the  result  of   the

interview  was  that  the  applicants   were   not

proficient  in their second language  or  even  in

their  first  language. And these were  graduates.

This shows that there is no proper training in the

second  language. In the Universities,  there  are

courses  in  translation. There are also  language

laboratories. However, such courses appear  to  be

mere  frills,  not being put to  good  effect.  By

themselves,  they are not adequate  to  train  our

pupils'  ability  in  languages  and  translation,

There will be more and more scope for translators,

as  translation has become a profession. There may

be language specialists in the higher institutions

who  are  not  fully utilised and as our  language

teachers have not been given any special training,

may  I  suggest  to  the  Minister  to  set  up  a

specialist  language  training  course   for   our

language teachers. We can get the T.T.C, to  make

use   of   the   language  laboratories   in   the

universities  to  train  them.  The   T.T.C, can

organise  training in these labs for our  language

teachers at all levels and from all streams. There

are  many language teaching scholars who had  been

trained abroad and they have been posted to  teach

simple  language  classes, Thus, their  talent  is

little  used. The authorities concerned  have  not

fully made use of their ability and talent,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



which  can  be  fully used to train  our  language

teachers.   Such  scholars  should   be   properly

utilised  by  the Ministry. There should  also  be

theoretical courses in language teaching so as  to

enhance the standard of teaching of languages.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like to touch on the behaviour and thinking

of  our students in the schools. I think the  kind

of  behaviour and thinking they have will  have  a

great bearing on our future. Sir, not long ago the

students  in our schools were guilty of  extremism

in  their  thinking and behaviour which caused  us

some  concern,  They were a bit radical  and  this

lasted  for  some length of time,  and  they  were

criticised  by the society at large. However,  now

there  has  been a complete change  to  the  other

extreme.  They have become indulgent  in  pleasure

seeking and licentiousness, and some of them  even

try  to imitate hippies of the West. This has also

infected our schools. You can notice it. If we  do

not  arrest such trends now, allow it to continue,

it  will  result  in  our  young  people  becoming

decadent and degenerate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then are we going to bring up a rugged

generation? The purpose of having extra-curricular

activities  in  the  schools  is  to  channel  the

learning  and energy of our students to the  right

direction.  Hence we have civic  subjects  in  our

schools. How then could our youths have changed? I

think  we can deal with this matter under  several

subheadings.   Firstly,   the   evil   vogue   and

environment   in   our   society   exert   harmful

influences  over  our  youngsters.  Youngsters  of

lesser will power will not be able to resist  such

enticements and trends, Mass media like Radio  and

T.V, broadcasts,   gramophones,   the    press,

advertisements and posters, bookstores and  coffee

houses, all exert a kind of degenerating influence

on  our  young  people. On this,  the  Member  for

Thomason  has given his view in the  House  a  few

days  ago.  Secondly, the disciplinary control  by

the schools has recently been lax on our students.

Many teachers have sighed with a heavy heart about

this. What are the causes? The answer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



may  be  that the schools do not bother to control

the  students, The less you do, the  less  trouble

you get, otherwise your good intention may get you

evil  recompense from the students,  What  is  the

reason  for  this  situation? It  is  because  the

schools  are  not given proper authority  to  deal

with  the  students. Teachers are  not  given  the

right  to  mete out corporal punishment. With  the

system  of  automatic  promotion,  persuasion  and

character  records  will  have  no  avail  on  the

situation.  If any corporal punishment  is  to  be

meted  out, the school must be prepared  to  brave

the  possible  anger of parents because  they  may

write to the Ministry or to the press to complain.

Under  such  circumstances, is it any wonder  that

most  schools  do not want to get any  credit  hut

hope   to  avoid  getting  into  trouble  by   not

exercising  control  over the  students?  Thirdly,

parents do not exercise their guidance adequately.

This  might  be  due  to lack of  time  or  proper

understanding  on their part. Most  of  them  send

their  children  to school in the hope  that  they

will  be  taken  care  of by  the  schools.  Since

students  spend about 5�  hours in the  school  and

most  of the time at home, then if parents do  not

take proper care of their children but allow their

children to wander about and to get mixed up  with

bad  elements, they will be led astray. These  are

hut  a  few  common causes; there are  many  other

factors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to produce a rugged and healthy

generation,  which possesses not  only  brawn  hut

brain, we must allow the schools to have a settled

and  peaceful  environment. To achieve  this,  the

maintenance of discipline in the schools  is  most

important.   At  the  moment,  the   tendency   to

indulgence, looseness and self-seeking on the part

of  youths  is still in the incipient stage,  anti

therefore it is time we took steps to arrest  such

tendency.  However, this cannot be done by  merely

holding a few seminars or talking and lecturing by

some experts. It is not a time to sit and talk but

a  time to stand up and act. In this respect,  the

Ministry of Education should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>



shoulder its particular responsibilities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad

Backbenchers are not happy with certain aspects of

our  implementation of policies. As my  colleague,

the  Minister for Communications, has said earlier

on,  any  improvement which has been made  in  the

Ministry of Communications is in a large part  due

to the dissatisfaction of Backbenchers; that it is

largely  due  to the constructive criticisms  that

improvements  have been made. In the  same  way  I

hope that improvements can be made in the Ministry

of  Education,  partly due to the' criticisms  and

dissatisfaction of Backbenchers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member for Delta that because

of  the introduction of technical education, there

is   no  likelihood  of  our  neglecting  academic

studies at all. Probably his dissatisfaction,  and

the dissatisfaction of many other Members, is with

regard  to the lack of linguistic ability  of  our

students  stemming  largely  from  the  fact  that

probably we are expecting too much in too short  a

time.  This question of multi-lingualism  and  bi-lingualism  is  a  recent  phenomenon,  I  am  not

surprised  at his disappointment in finding  that,

in  answer  to  an advertisement for  translators,

there were only 20 applicants who turned out to be

inadequate for the job. I should think it  is  too

general  to blame our educational system  for  the

lack  of proficient translators because if I  were

an efficient and proficient translator, I can make

a much better living elsewhere rather than being a

translator   and  spending  my  time   translating

documents. The mere fact that there were  only  20

applicants with inadequate qualifications for  the

post  or translator does not mean that we  do  not

have efficient bi-linguists or multi-linguists  in

our  midst. They are there, but we expect  to  see

more of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, we must realise that today's child

in   school,  whether  he  be'  in  a  primary  or

secondary  school, is expected to learn much  more

than what was required in my time. In those days,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



first  and foremost, we spent all our time on  one

language.  There was then not that much  explosion

of knowledge as today, such that the child now has

to  divide  his time not only studying  the  great

mass  of  new knowledge and discoveries that  have

come to the fore, but also studying two languages.

On  top  of  that, he is also involved  in  extra-curricular activities. This is where we  have  got

to  be a bit chary anti wary in choosing the  kind

of  syllabus  that  is  required  to  develop  our

children in an all round manner, so that they will

be  technically orientated and will also have  the

academic  background to live a fuller and  a  more

gracious  life.  I  would say that  we  are  in  a

position   of  flux  just  now  and  the  Research

Department of the Ministry of Education will  have

to  spend  more  time in evaluating carefully  the

kind  of syllabus anti teaching that we have,  and

the  kind  of  subjects that are being  taught  in

schools.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased to hear that we have what the

Member for Delta described as linguistic scholars,

who  are being underused in Nanyang University and

his   offer  of  their  services  to  improve  the

teaching  of  language  in  the  T.T.C, is   most

welcome.  For the information of Members,  we  are

not lying idle in the T.T C We are running classes

in  E,L.II, i.e., English classes for non-English

medium  teachers  anti Chinese  classes  for  non-Chinese  medium teachers, to improve their command

of  anti  skills in the languages. All this  takes

time. It does not happen all at once.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another point, I do not know what the Member

for Jurong actually meant when he said that we can

do  something in the way of controlling  the  very

lax  attitude of the students, and their love  for

an  easy  life.  Among the points  raised  by  the

Member  for  Jurong  I would think  that  what  he

expects   us  to  do  is  to  return  to  corporal

punishment  in school. He is an educator  himself,

but  from  reports I have gathered, I  would  have

thought  that  this is a retrograde step.  Anyway,

there is sufficient authority



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



in the school for corporal punishment, if the

case   warrants  it.  The  principal  is   already

empowered, but to allow' each and every teacher to

inflict  corporal  Punishment  on  a  child  is  a

retrograde step. From the limited experience  that

I  have  in the Ministry of Education, I can  well

imagine the amount of abuse that can come up  from

this because among the 20,000 school teachers some

are  probably not quite conversant with the object

of  corporal punishment. Probably some of them may

need  psychiatric treatment, in the same way  that

psychiatric treatment may be needed for those  who

are  unable  to write their names after  being  in

school  for two years, as mentioned by the Member.

Therefore,  it will he very dangerous  to  empower

teachers   in   general  to  administer   corporal

punishment. There are other solutions. But what  I

can  agree  with  him is that we can  improve  the

behaviour  and attitudes of our students  if  more

parents  take an interest in looking  after  their

children while they are away from schools. I think

this trend should spread through a society because

in   a  very  highly  urban  uric!  industrialised

society  the tendency is for more and more parents

to  leave  the training or their children entirely

to  the  schools  So  if parents  will  take  more

interest  and  more  time in looking  after  their

children, half the battle is won.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that some parents do not fulfil the

responsibility of training their children, but  by

and large, most of them do. We only hope that more

anti more parents, having listened to the views of

a professional educator about the role of parents,

will  now take an interest in their wards, so that

it  makes  it  easier  for us  to  give  them  the

requisite education and an all-round education for

their future development.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

before  I beg leave to withdraw, I would  like  to

point  out  that the Minister has not answered  my

question. Is it possible that he is waiting for me

to read another text before answering my point?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned earlier that the complainant must

furnish  his  own name and address  to  facilitate

investigations into an allegation. If there is any

truth,  then action must be taken by the  Ministry

of  Education. But if the allegation is unfounded,

I think the complainant himself should be punished

for  a  false complaint. Sir, I have brought  this

matter  up  because I feel that  if  a  school  is

undergoing  great reform there will  be  lots  and

lots  of  complaints  and counter-complaints.  And

another  related point is that at  the  time  when

principals  were enjoying the post-allowance,  the

teachers  would  make  complaints  against   their

principals before their retirement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> My apology to the Member for

Paya Lebar because I have completely left him  out

while turning over my notes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the point that he raised with regard

to  scurrilous  allegations, the  Member  must  be

aware  that  during  the last  year  we  have  not

entertained    any   frivolous    or    scurrilous

allegations  by anonymous writers.  We  only  take

action  where  there are specific instances  named

and  where, on the surface of it, there  are  some

doubts  as to whether the allegations are true  or

not.  We  do  not  just  act  on  receipt  of  any

anonymous letters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite a large number of his colleagues disagreed

with  his  view  that  seminars  serve  no  useful

purpose.  We  have  received,  as  well   as   the

newspapers,  requests for more of these  seminars.

So  they  must  have served a useful purpose.  The

Member  also  said that most of the  teachers  are

general teachers; that they take several subjects,

and  it  is a waste of time to spend two or  three

hours  listening to a specialist. I say that  even

if  a  teacher does not teach the subject  of  the

seminar  which  he is attending, he  will  be  the

better  man  for it because he is learning  first-hand tips from a specialist who knows the subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot agree with the Member that seminars are

not  well-planned. A lot of work, time and thought

are put into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



the planning of a seminar, and I do not think that

the School Inspectors or officials in the Ministry

of  Education will spend time, effort,  money  and

thought  over something which they think  will  be

useless.  Nor  will they plan the  seminars  in  a

haphazard   fashion,  because   they   know   that

Backbenchers like the Member for Paya Lebar  will

surely  bring it up in Parliament. In the majority

of  cases these seminars are well-planned. I  have

no  doubts in my mind that these seminars do serve

a  useful  purpose for those teachers who  attend,

except  perhaps  for  a few who  probably  arrived

panting, tired, and hungry, and therefore did  not

know what was going on. The rest of them must have

derived   some   benefits  from  attending   those

seminars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered most of the points that

the Member has raised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):Not enough.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> If he can mobilise the members

of  his  union to come and attend a seminar during

the holidays, I say welcome to them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, what I would

like  to clarify with the Minister is this.  I  am

not opposed to the holding of seminars. What I  am

saying is that with this short duration of one  or

two  hours only for the seminars, even if you  can

get the experts to lecture, you cannot make better

teachers  out of those trained in the old  or  new

teaching methods. The period is so short that  you

cannot produce any results at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is this. I have received

complaints from my members against the seminar  on

the teaching of music. The music specialist in the

seminar  was  publicising his own  composition  of

music.  That  cannot be called a true seminar.  On

the  seminar  on  physical  education,  it  was  a

session for the selling of lottery tickets run  by

Inche  Othman  Wok.  Can this  be  called  a  true

seminar? I am not opposed to seminars as such.  In

fact,   I  am  asking  for  longer  sessions   for

seminars, so that teachers can really



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>



learn  something.  I do not want  seminars  to  be

turned  into sessions for selling lottery  tickets

or  Toto  tickets,  or sessions to  publicise  the

compositions of music specialists.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, if the Member had studied

Economics,  he might like to know where  Singapore

is  heading in the next 10 years, or he might want

to make or to listen to a good analysis, and if he

had attended the talk given by Dr Gob Keng Swee at

the  Symposium  at  the University  of  Singapore,

which  lasted  less than an hour,  then  I  wonder

whether  he would still be of the opinion  that  a

seminar  of one, two or three hours is useless.  A

seminar  does  not  improve  one's  knowledge   or

understanding  of a situation,  but  to  make  one

understand the situation and therefore make one  a

better teacher.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the selling of tickets, it is

probable that some teachers undertook this  extra-mural  activity. It could not be, and I would  not

say  that  the organiser of the seminar encouraged

ticket-selling  among his fellow members.  But  in

the   other  case  of  publicity,  if  the   music

specialist  in the seminar is a good  composer,  I

see  no  reason  why he should not  publicise  his

composition. It is up to the teacher  to  evaluate

whether  the composition is worth their  while  or

not. I would not say outright that the composition

is useless; it may have its own merit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, before I beg

leave to withdraw, I wish to say that the Minister

for  Education mentioned the talk given by another

Minister  at the University of Singapore.  I  have

more  confidence  in  our Cabinet  Ministers  than

experts. Although I am not very satisfied with the

answer, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of

of   a  Visiting  Professor  to  the  Ministry  of

Education,  I  shall be grateful if  the  Minister

will be kind enough to inform the House about  the

provision  of  a salary scaled at $1,950-50A-2,050

for  this  post.  What  is  the  purpose  of  this

appointment,  and what is this Visiting  Professor

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this provision of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of

Messrs J. F. Conceicao and Yen Choo Kok-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I received several complaints from

principals that for the past year they  have  been

filling  in  more than 100 different  forms.  They

complained that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>



these  forms are very complicated and have  to  be

completed  in English. It is not easy to  fill  in

all  these  forms. Sometimes when forms have  been

filled  in  and  submitted  to  the  Ministry   of

Education,  they  are returned because  they  have

been wrongly filled. As a result, a lot of time is

wasted  before all the forms are properly  filled.

If a school principal is kept busy with this form-filling  exercise, then the rest of his work  will

have to be sacrificed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take this academic year by way of

illustration. So far, more than 20 forms  have  to

be  filled  in by principals. In one  instance,  a

form  is to be filled in by school children giving

the  constituency to which they  belong.  In  this

respect, even the teachers themselves are not sure

about  what  is  required. The students  are  also

confused,   because  they  do   not   know   which

constituency they belong to. When they  ask  their

parents,  they too do not know. So they just  fill

up the forms haphazardly, as a result of which the

necessary  correct information is not obtained.  I

have  also  been  given to understand  that  these

forms  are required by the Research and Statistics

Department  to  ascertain the school  requirements

for the next ten years. If this information is  to

be  supplied in such a great hurry. I do not  know

whether they will be of any use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know what is the exact

function of the Research and Statistics Department

in  the  Ministry  of  Education.  What  has  this

department  done  so  far  to  be  of  benefit  to

education?  Can  the  Minister  concerned   please

enlighten the House?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the

Member for Jurong complained about the Ministry of

Education  changing its policy  without  planning,

but  now  he  is  complaining  that  we  send  the

principals  too many forms calling for statistics.

I  do  not see how the Ministry can make any plans

without statistics and data.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sending of the various forms to schools

asking  for  details is an annual affair,  We  are

trying our best to send



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>



them  out in one lot so that the schools can  fill

them up either at the beginning: or at the end  of

the term,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the particular form mentioned by

the  Member, he has correctly pointed out that  it

is  designed  to  make  a study  of  the  mobility

patterns  of  the student population,  and  so  to

enable  us  to prepare a school building programme

for the next ten years. The Education Ministry has

already  clarified that the information, regarding

the constituency where the student is residing, is

supposed  to be filled in by the teacher  and  not

the  student  or his parents. This information  is

only used as a rough guide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked about the work of the Research

Unit.  The  Research  Unit has various  functions.

amongst them the appraisal of the education system

-I believe the Member for Jurong is extremely keen

on  this - the evaluation of teaching methods, and

curriculum  development. Over the last two  years,

the  Research Unit has done some 20 reports, which

have proved extremely useful to the Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

if  the  forms to be filled by the schools are  of

any use, then I have no objection. But as far as I

know  there are some forms which have been  filled

in and submitted to the Ministry of Education, but

they were just shelved without putting them to any

use at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister to give us an

assurance that, in future, all forms to be  filled

in by Chinese schools should also be in Chinese.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> I can give assurance to the

Member for Jurong that we will try our best to get

the forms translated into all the four languages.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view of

the  assurance given, I beg leave to  withdraw  my

amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1161.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that after the readjustments

of   salary  scales,  following  the  negotiations

between the Ministry and the Teachers' Unions, the

post  of  "Principal"  does  not  appear  in   the

Estimates any longer. Teachers are no longer known

as teachers. All teachers and principals are known

as Education Officer, Senior Education Officer and

Principal  Education Officer. All the salaries  of

these   Education  Officers  have  been   properly

regraded too, in view of this, I do not understand

why  there  are  still two posts of Principals  of

Secondary  Schools,  Grade  G,  appearing  in  the

Estimates.  Can  the  Minister  concerned  explain

which are the two schools that require a Principal

at Superscale G, and why?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, I hope the Member for

Jurong  does  not  imply in his question  that  we

should abolish the two Superscale promotion  posts

for  secondary school principals. I agree with him

that  the  designation does not sound  very  well.

Perhaps   it  should  rear!  "Education   Officer,

Superscale  G" instead of "Principal of  Secondary

Schools".  But  this is a minor  point.  Promotion

posts  to Superscale grade are very hard  to  come

by.  We  have only two and we intend to keep  them

for   the  promotion  of  those  in  the  teaching

profession.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Minister

has  not  told this House whether or not  the  two

Principals are for two separate schools, and  what

are the schools.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, as the Member for Jurong

is aware, the newly revised salary structure is to

allow  for greater flexibility. Therefore,  we  do

not  intend to designate the principal of any  two

schools for these two Superscale G posts.  At  the

moment,  these two Super-scale posts are  held  by

the  Principal  of  the  Raffles  Institution  and

Principal  of the Raffles Girls' School.  Sir,  if

the Member will refer to last year's Estimates,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>



he  will  see that it  was  designated  as

Principal,  Raffles  Institution,  and  Principal,

Raffles Girls' School. But this year, it has  been

designated as "Principals of Secondary Schools" to

allow for the necessary flexibility.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view of

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1191.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent restructuring of the Education

Service has enhanced the promotional prospects  of

the serving officers in the Education Service. May

I know what steps have been taken by the Education

Ministry  to determine the criteria for  assessing

the  merits  of deserving Education  Officers  for

promotion from one grade to another? How and  when

will  the  Ministry  conduct  the  next  promotion

exercise,  and  how regular will future  promotion

exercises be conducted?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe

the  Member  for  Moulmein will recall  that  when

agreement  was  reached on  the  restructuring  of

salary scales, it was pointed out that it may take

a  few  months to finalise the conversion. 1 think

we  will he able to finalise it by the end of this

month. Meanwhile, we have already drawn up certain

criteria  for promotions for the consideration  of

the Public Service Commission and the Ministry  of

Finance.  This  involves a newly  developed  Staff

Confidential  Report  which, among  other  things,

takes  into  account assessment on the performance

of  teachers, including personality,  E.C.A.,  and

work  in  community services. As soon as agreement

is   reached,  we  will  carry  out  a   promotion

exercise.  The promotion exercise will be  carried

out for Group III officers first. Being smaller in

number,  we  will carry out promotions  first  for

craft  teachers, and then for technical  teachers.

As for frequency of these exercises,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>



I am afraid I am not able to answer  the

question,  but it is supposed to be flexible.  For

the coming exercise, we do not know the number  of

promotion posts that will be available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I have answered most of the points

raised.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> This is subjected to the final

agreement  with  the P.S.C, and  the  Ministry  of

Sia Khoon Seong -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1192.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> I am not moving amendment

(9), Sir,If I may proceed with my next amendment.

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 he

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1211.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recent restructuring of the Education

Service,   promotional  opportunities  for   aided

school teachers will be considerably enhanced.  In

view  of the fact that the promotion exercise  for

aided  school  teachers does not  come  under  the

purview  of  the  Public Service Commission,  what

steps  will be taken by the Education Ministry  to

ensure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



that  promotion exercises are conducted for  them,

regularly and fairly? Will the Education  Ministry

also   consider  seeking  the  Finance  Ministry's

concurrence  to  allow aided  school  teachers  to

apply  for holiday bungalows recently acquired  by

the   Government   from  the  Royal   Air   Force,

particularly in view of the recent policy  of  the

Finance Ministry to let out such holiday bungalows

to members of the public?



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard

to  the  first  part  of the question,  a  Special

Committee, headed by the Director of Education  as

Chairman,  has been formed, and it will study  and

review  the  position and carry  out  a  promotion

exercise  for all aided school teachers.  It  will

also  follow  the  same pattern as  the  promotion

exercise for Government school teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question regarding holiday

bungalows,  aided school teachers  can  apply  for

bungalows  as any other member of the public.  The

fees  chargeable to them will be the same as those

for  the  public. Incidentally, I  would  like  to

point  out  that bungalow allocation is under  the

charge of the Ministry of Finance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, I am not happy with the

reply  to  the second question. However, since  he

has passed the buck to the Ministry of Finance,  I

will in due course raise the matter again with the

Minister for Finance. Sir, I beg leave to withdraw

my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1221*.(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the new Minister for Education took office,

he  shelved the Institute of Education Act. It was

a  great disappointment to the teachers and  as  a

result, some of them left the Education Service. I

understand that the School of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>



Education in the University of Singapore has  also

closed  down  recently. I would like  to  ask  the

Minister   concerned   what   opportunities    for

advancement are there left available for ambitious

and promising teachers? Are there training courses

for teachers to acquire degrees in the T.T.C.?  If

there  are, ambitious teachers in the primary  and

secondary   schools  can  undertake  such   degree

courses  and  thus our education  system  will  be

improved.  I wonder whether the Minister  has  any

information on this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, why is

discrimination shown by the Ministry of  Education

towards   the  Indian  graduates  in   the   Tamil

secondary schools? Although these officers possess

university  degrees  and  have  gone  through  the

T.T.C, they are not paid a graduate's salary.  In

other  words,  their degree is not recognised  and

they  are  not paid accordingly. It  is  time  the

Ministry looked into this discrimination  and  put

an end to it once for all.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir,I am afraid

the Member for Jurong has completely misunderstood

the  Minister when he said in Parliament last year

that  we were reviewing the role the Institute  of

Education  would play. In fact, with  the  closing

down  of the School of Education in the University

of Singapore, the T.T.C, will enlarge its function

and  take over the work of the School of Education

in  preparing students for post-graduate  degrees.

like Master of Education and Ph.D. (Education). If

he wants to know more about the degree of Bachelor

of  Education, I would like to refer  him  to  the

report  by  Lord  James who was appointed  by  the

British  Government to study the question  of  the

role  of the Institute of Education in the  United

Kingdom. The finding is very revealing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the query raised by the Member

for  Anson,  there is absolutely  no  question  of

discrimination.  As far back as  1961,  a  Foreign

Qualifications Committee was set up by the  Public

Service  Commission  to assess the  qualifications

and to consider the merits



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



of  applicants  possessing foreign degrees.  As  a

result,  many  teachers in  possession  of  Indian

university  degrees  were put on  the  appropriate

salary scale. Since then all teachers with foreign

qualifications,  irrespective of  the  country  of

origin, have been considered on individual  merit

for emplacement on the appropriate salary scale.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, there are

some  graduates who are trained teachers, but they

are put on a salary scale not on par with those in

the English stream, Why is it so? After all, their

education js higher than Senior Cambridge  or  the S.L.C.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the

findings  of the Foreign Qualifications  Committee

was  that, and I believe the Member for Anson will

agree   with   me,  different  universities   have

different standards.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard

to recognition of foreign degrees, while accepting

the  fact that it is the prerogative and the  role

of  the  Special Committee, a set-up by the P.S.C.

to  assess foreign degrees, the point at issue  is

this.   This  particular  Committee  was  set   up

sometime  in 1961, and is no longer active.  Since

then, there could be deserving cases requiring the

assessment  of this Committee. Perhaps a  solution

to  this particular problem is to resuscitate this

Committee  so that it could assess the  merits  of

foreign degree holders.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all foreign

qualifications  should  be  considered  on   their

individual  merits, and there is  no  question  of

giving a blanket recognition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  do not wish to concern myself too much with the

closure  of  the School of Education, so  long  as

opportunities for further education are  given  to

ambitious  and enterprising teachers. I beg  leave

to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn,

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1251.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the introduction of the Educational

Television Service, there have been programmes for

technical and primary schools. However, all  these

programmes  are screened in the daytime.  Sometime

ago   the  Adult  Education  Board  announced  its

intention  to  introduce  E.T.V, programmes   for

adults. So far there is no sign of it. May  I  ask

when  will  these E.T,V, programmes be  introduced

for our adult population?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder

whether  the  Member for Anson watches television.

The  E.T.V, service for adults was introduced  as

far as five years ago. There is a programme titled

English  for  Everyone, dramatised by "Connie  and

Walter".  It  was produced jointly  by  the  Adult

Education Board and the E.T.V. This is followed by

"Slim   John".  In  addition  to  this   programme

designed  specially for adults,  there  arc  other

programmes,  which the Member for Anson  has  made

reference  to,  which have been repeated  on  T.V.

over the last five years. These are being telecast

during  viewing  hours  on  Sunday  evenings.  The

programmes  include Health Education,  Discovering

Science,   etc.   With   the   establishment    of

C.E.P.T.A., that is, the Centre for the Production

and  Training  of Adult Education and  Television,

the Member can be rest assured that both the range

and  intensity  of  E.T.V, for  adults  will   be

increased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 he

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the current campaign to promote

industrial safety conscious



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



ness, I would like to enquire what steps have been

taken by the Ministry of Education to promote such

consciousness  in  the technical  workshops.  What

schemes  are  there, if any, to cover occupational

risks   and  accidents  for  teachers?  Will   the

technical teachers in the aided schools be covered

by  any  insurance scheme in case of accidents  in

the technical workshop?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, today, our

secondary schools are giving emphasis on technical

education.  This  is a very sound  policy  indeed.

However,  on  second thought, do all our  students

have  an  aptitude  for technical  education?  The

aptitude  test  at  present carried  out  is  very

unsatisfactory.  It takes into  consideration  the

school   examination  results,  and  the  workshop

practice. From the results of this test  only  the

best  students  go to the technical  schools.  The

rest  are  left  to  plod their  way  in  academic

schools.  This system of selection will mean  that

the  State  is liable to lose political scientists

and  experts in the other fields. Moreover, do  we

have enough technical schools in Singapore? Are we

not  emphasising  too much on technical  education

and   producing  too  many  school  leavers   with

secondary  technical education and thus produce  a

surplus of technicians?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am not speaking Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  emphasis  on education has been shifted  from

the  academic to the technical, resulting  in  the

Establishment    of   the   Technical    Education

Department.  Technical education  has  been  given

priority  from all quarters, and consequently  the

officials  in  the Technical Education  Department

seem to have become rather arrogant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received complaints from principals and

teachers that there is too much bureaucracy in the

Technical  Education Department. I  have  personal

experience of this attitude. I have tried to  take

up the case of a teacher who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



claims recognition of his past teaching experience

but  without results. I wrote two letters  on  the

14th of June and the 21st of July last year to the

Technical Education Department. There was not even

an  acknowledgement, not to say of achieving a due

reply.  Such  treatment is meted  out  even  to  a

Member of Parliament, and let us not mention about

treatment to members of the public. I do not  know

whether  or not letters from Members of Parliament

carry   any  weight,  or  is  it  a  question   of

inefficiency  in  the department itself?  I  would

like the Minister to explain this in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to raise is the question

of textbooks for technical subjects. We are on the

fourth year of technical education. However, there

are  still  no proper textbooks for the  technical

students.  There is only the syllabus on technical

education, and because of the dearth of  textbooks

different  teachers have devised  different  notes

for  distribution to students. As  a  result,  the

progress  in technical education differs from  one

school  to  another.  I do not  know  whether  the

Technical  Education  Department  has  taken   any

action to produce textbooks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have also received complaints

from  principals  of schools  which  do  not  have

technical  classes for Secondary III  and  onwards

that,  as a result of the aptitude test all  their

best  students have been selected  to  go  to  the

technical schools. This has been mentioned by  the

Member  for  Anson just now. If the best  students

are  selected for the technical classes, what will

happen to the teaching of the humanities and other

social  sciences? Of course, we will  produce  the

best  of  technicians, However, if we do not  have

people with a knowledge of the humanities and  the

social sciences, then we can at best build only  a

technical  society which can be listless.  In  the

long-term  interest of the nation, I do  not  know

whether or not this is good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that after these students have

been  selected for the technical classes in  other

schools, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



extra-curricular  activities, in  particular,  the

uniformed  groups in their schools,  are  affected

and put at a great disadvantage. They cannot carry

on their activities because the best students have

been  taken  away. I would like  the  Minister  to

think of a solution to this problem.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry

has  always  been  aware of the  need  to  develop

safety  consciousness and correct work habits  and

aptitude  among technical students,  In  fact,  we

consider  this  an  integral  part  of  the  whole

training.  In  most  technical  schools,  we  have

introduced instruction in first aid, and  in  most

schools  we  have  such  a  set-up  as  a   safety

committee. Constant care is always taken to stress

the  safety  aspect of workshop  practice  to  the

students by the teachers. In fact, pupils are  not

allowed  to use any machine unless they have  been

briefed by the teachers on its proper use and  the

safety precautions to be taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member for Moulmein also raised

certain  issues  about the question  of  insurance

coverage   in  case  of  accidents  occurring   in

technical  schools.  All  technical  teachers   in

Government schools enjoy the same coverage as  any

civil  servant.  So  there is  no  question  of  a

separate    insurance   scheme   to   cover    any

occupational hazards encountered by them.  In  the

case  of  aided schools, their technical  teachers

are in a position similar to all other teachers in

aided  schools, where there is no insurance scheme

to   cover  them.  It  is  up  to  the  management

committee  of  the school to decide  whether  they

should provide such an insurance scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been no major injuries sustained by

the  technical students so far, largely due to the

safety  precautions that we have taken, But should

any  accident occur to students in the  Government

schools,    the   Government   will   take    full

responsibility of the accident, as in  the  recent

case of accident in Anderson Secondary School.  In

the case of aided schools, I am afraid the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>



first  claim will be on the management  committee.

To  the best of my knowledge, there is no precedent

case yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member may be interested to know that for the

students  of  the only Government-aided  vocational

institute,   i.e.,   the  Boys'   Town   Vocational

Institute,  there  is a limited form  of  insurance

cover  for  each  student provided  by  the  school

management.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has some misgivings about

the  channelling exercise. As pointed  out  by  the

Member himself, the channelling exercise was  based

on  (a)  aptitude;  and  (b) their  performance  in

related  subjects, i.e., Language, Mathematics  and

Science  over the first two years in the  secondary

school. As far as we are concerned, the preliminary

evidence seems to indicate that the system  we  are

adopting   is   functioning  very   satisfactorily,

although I must admit that no amount of testing and

measurement is 100 per cent accurate, and there  is

bound to be a few exceptional cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid it is not true that we have put too

much  emphasis on technical education.  After  all,

technical  education is only part of  an  all-round

education to be provided in secondary schools.  And

there is, therefore, no danger of over-training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member also asked for the number of

technical   students.  The  intake   of   technical

students   depends  very  much  on   the   manpower

requirements  of  our industrialisation  programme.

Our  present level, which is roughly one-third,  or

one   in   every  three  school  leavers  will   be

technically  biased, is, I think, about  the  right

level  for  any country. I do not think  we  should

increase it any further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong referred to the efficiency

of  the  Department of Technical Education. I  must

apologise if the Department has not replied to  his

letter.  It must be due to an administrative  slip-up. I give him my assurance that it will not happen

again  and, in future, all such inquiries  will  be

acknowledged immediately. The particular case



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>



that the Member for Jurong has raised has become so

famous  that  it has also come to my  ears.  It  is

about  a  teacher with teaching experience in  some

other  countries,  and the delay  was  due  to  the

prolonged  correspondence between the Ministry  and

the  foreign government on the recognition  of  his

experience as a teacher.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical education has only been introduced very

recently  and we have not really drawn  up  a  very

comprehensive list of textbooks to be used; we have

to  bear in mind that the system we adopt, which is

the  modular  system,  is  quite  unique.  We  will

develop  the  textbooks  to  be  used  by  all  the

technical  students. The guidelines we  provide  to

the  teachers are very comprehensive and, in  fact,

are  based on a programme-learning approach,  which

is  fairly satisfactory. In fact, the Member may be

interested  to know that we are in the  process  of

developing textbooks for metal work at the moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Members for Jurong and Anson raised the

question  of  students  being  transferred  out  of

academic  schools to attend technical  schools.  We

tried to rectify this by introducing the concept of

the   arrangement  of  centralised   workshops   at

Technical  III  and IV      levels,  which  is  now

being  practised for 16 schools, whereby a  student

will  remain  in  his  own  school  but  go  to   a

centralised place to study the technical  subjects.

This  arrangement  unfortunately  will  affect  the

E.C.A  activities of the students  and,  therefore,

both the supervisor of the centralised workshop and

the  principal of the sender-school have been asked

to   liase   with  each  other  to  cut  down   the

interference  with  the E.C.A, activities  of  the

students as much as possible.

by  the Ministry of Education places great strain

both  on  the  teachers and the pupils  in  those

schools   which  annually  participate  in   this

Festival,  I  wonder  whether  the  Ministry   of

Education  has  considered  the  desirability  of

zoning  the schools into two zones, so  that  the

schools  need  only to take part  in  the  Annual

Youth Festival once in two years.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, the Singapore Youth

Festival   is,  in  the  nature  of  things,   an

excellent   opportunity  for   highlighting   the

achievements  of our youth and the rich  cultural

heritage  of a multi-racial society. The Festival

brings  about  a  sense  of  fulfilment  in  many

schools and also serve as a source of inspiration

to  others.  However, if and when the  activities

connected  with  the  Youth Festival  become  too

onerous,  we will consider holding it biennially,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Sia Khoon Seong -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(21) That the sum to be allocated for Head

080!  be  reduced  by $10 in respect  of  subhead

2257.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (21), Mr Sia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> I am not moving, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801

be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2458.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am taking this opportunity to enquire

from the Minister as to what is being done in the

area of career guidance in the technical and  non

technical streams. From my own personal enquiries

from school leavers and some of the youngsters in

the  final year of secondary education,  I  often

get the idea that they seem to be rather vague as

to  what  they  want to do or what they  can  do.

Perhaps  more can be done in the area  of  career

guidance  not  only by the Ministry of  Education

but  also  at  the  school level.  Perhaps  there

should  be  teachers  delegated  to  the  special

charge   of   guiding  the  pupils  as   to   the

requirements of commerce and industry.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, the unit under the

Technical  Education  Department  is   only   for

administrative convenience but it covers work  on

all  aspects.  In fact, in each secondary  school

there  are  at  least  two  career  teachers   to

organise    and   co-ordinate   career   guidance

activities,  and there are about 200 teachers  in

this   category.  The  activities  cover   talks,

seminars,  exhibitions, excursions to  factories,

and  also  include publications  of  the  various

literature for the benefit of the students.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0801 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that there is a reduction in the

vote for this subhead, from $7.00() to $5,200.  I

would like to enquire what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



educational  exhibitions, career conventions  and

teachers' seminars were held last year? Moreover,

why is there a reduction in the vote for the next

financial  year  instead of an  increase,  seeing

that  they  are such highly desirable educational

activities?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the sum of

$5,200  was  based on the expenditure  which  was

incurred  over the last financial year. I  cannot

give    off-hand   what   type   of   educational

exhibitions,  etc., were held last year.  If  the

Member could give us notice, we should be able to

give further details.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also raised the question why there is a

decrease  instead of an increase in the vote.  We

were  hoping  that,  by soliciting  participation

from  the industrial sector, we would be able  to

carry out more such exhibitions at the same  cost

as  has  been  done  for  many  of  the  previous

exhibitions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> In view of the explanation

by   the  Minister  of  State,  I  beg  leave  to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0801

be reduced by $100*.(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Sia Khoon Seong and Ng Kah Ting.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government Printing Office is now a

commercial corporation and is competing with  the

private  sector in placing tenders prom statutory

boards  and private firms for printing work.  But

in  respect of the magazine Harapan which I  know

is printed by Eurasia Press, why was the printing

job  not  given  to the Government Printer?  Were

tenders  invited  before the  job  was  given  to

Eurasia Press? What was the cost per copy charged

by  Eurasia  Press as compared with that  of  the

Government Printer?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because a lot of technical work is required, I

wish  to  know how many Malay students from  both

the Malay and English streams have opted for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>



technical education? From this number,  how  many

have  passed and how many have failed? Are  these

technical students given the opportunity  to  opt

for  the particular subjects of their choice,  or

are  they being taught technical subjects not  of

their choice?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that I wish to know, Sir, is -

this,  The  Government has encouraged its  staff,

including   the   teachers,  to   enhance   their

knowledge. Those teachers who wish to go  to  the

university  after having served 10 or  12  years,

can  they be given study leave, if they have been

accepted  by  the  University of  Singapore,  the

Nanyang University or the University of Malaya?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> I am not speaking, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in filing my

amendment on this subhead, I originally wanted to

speak  on a variety of topics pertaining  to  the

Ministry  of Education. But it appears  that,  in

tact,  most  of  the  points  have  already  been

covered   by  my  colleagues,  the  Backbenchers.

However, there is still one small point  which  I

wish  to  raise since I have missed it just  now,

and  that  is, the Milk Feeding Scheme  that  has

been   introduced.  This  is,  in  fact,  a   new

provision which comes under subhead 2127.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally welcome the setting up of such a

scheme  in  our  schools.  I  presume  this  Milk

Feeding  Scheme  is for primary school  children,

but I would like to know whether the provision of

$10,800   is  sufficient  for  all  the   primary

schools. I understand that this is a pilot scheme

to  cover  only a few primary schools,  and  that

children are given powdered milk, But it  appears

to  me  that in some schools the children do  not

like either the taste of the powdered milk or its

colour. Therefore, these schools tried to  induce

them  to drink by adding some colouring. But this

does not go a long way to make them drink either.

Subsequently,  I was told that sugar  was  added,

but I do not know what the result is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to seek some clarification from

the Minister as to what steps are being taken  to

encourage more school



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>



children  to  take  to the drinking  of  milk,  I

believe  that this supply of powdered milk  comes

from  UNICEF.  Has  the  Ministry  any  plans  to

supplement this scheme by giving a better type of

powdered milk instead of the present supply which

has  no  taste and has to be sweetened by  adding

sugar?  In  this respect, can the  Minister  also

inform this House as to the number of schools and

the  number of children who are under this  pilot

scheme? And will this scheme be extended  to  all

primary schools?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

answer  the  question raised by  the  Member  for

Punggol?  This Milk Feeding Scheme is  run  on  a

nation-wide basis. I think it applies practically

to  all  the primary schools. Unfortunately  milk

does  not  agree with the Asian stomach.  Whether

you  add  colour, flavour, or sugar, I think  the

Asian  people  still do not quite like  to  drink

milk,  I  believe we do not belong  to  the  zone

called  the "milk drinking belt", Anyway, we  are

encouraging the milk-drinking business by  adding

flavour  to  the  milk  for  the  primary  school

children  to induce them to drink. I  think  that

answers the point on milk drinking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think

I  can  disagree  with  the Minister  of  State's

assertion  that the Asian stomach does not  react

favourably to milk. I am a layman to diet, but  I

would  have thought that most of us, if not  all,

were  fed  with  milk in our  infant  years.  The

Minister  of  State in all probability  was  also

brought up on milk to a certain extent! As I have

said,  it was probably the type of powdered  milk

with a taste which the children did not like, and

the  quality  was not too good. I  am  not  quite

sure, but perhaps his Ministry would care to look

into  this  to  see why a good number  of  school

children  do not like this kind of milk  supplied

to them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, no doubt I was brought

up  on milk also, but when we were young we  were

always hungry; there was not much choice!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education does not have to carry

out  an  investigation to find out why  our  young

children  do  not  like to drink  milk.  In  fact,

research  has  been carried out  by  international

agencies  and it proved that we do not  belong  to

the  "milk  drinking  belt". No  doubt  there  are

people who drink milk, but I think this is just  a

diet-preference.  Incidentally,  this  is  skimmed

milk which tastes slightly different.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff:</b> Sir, my question has not

been answered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in answer to

the  Member for Kampong Kembangan, I hate to  have

to  disappoint him. One of the questions he  asked

calls  for  details  as to  the  number  of  Malay

students  who  have  been  admitted  to  technical

streams  in  the schools, and how many  have  been

able  to be admitted into classes of their choice.

If he were to put in a notice for Oral Answer then

the  relevant details will be given. 1 thought  we

are here debating matters of general policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to his query on the publication of

the   Harapan,  with  your  kind  permission.   Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  I  would  like  my  Parliamentary

Secretary  to  reply to it because he  is  closely

connected with this magazine.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff:</b> What about study leave?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> As regards study leave, my

Parliamentary  Secretary  is  au  tab'  with   the

question, and he will also answer that question.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ghazali Bin Ismail (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Inche Mohd. Ghazali Bin Ismail):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  with  regard  to  the  matter   of

Harapan,   raised  by  the  Member   for   Kampong

Kembangan,  the  Harapan is a publication  of  the

Educational Publications Bureau, and  not  of  the

Ministry of Education. It is a magazine mainly  on

current   affairs,  and  is  intended  for   Malay

secondary school students. The articles have to be

submitted to the Ministry of Education for vetting

to ensure that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



contents   are   in   every   way   suitable   for

publication. Of course, the editors of Harapan are

officers in the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point queried on the printing

of  Harapan.  The  contract for the  printing  was

awarded to the lowest tender.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to his other question about granting

study leave to teachers, the answer is yes, if the

subjects  of  study are relevant to  the  teaching

service.  But  each  individual  case  has  to  be

considered on its own merit,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also wanted to know the number of

Malay  students who are successful in their option

for  the  technical stream, and the number allowed

to take the technical subjects of their choice.  I

would  like to inform the House that all technical

students,  irrespective  of  language  media,  are

given  the  opportunity to indicate the preference

for  workshop  subjects. While the  preference  is

taken  into  account,  the final  selection  of  a

student  for the various workshop subjects depends

on  his  aptitude and performance in the  workshop

subjects  in  Secondary I and II levels,  and  his

performance  in the relevant supporting  subjects,

for example, Mathematics and Science.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, there are teachers from the Malay stream  who

wish  to  further their studies by  going  to  the

university  to take up Malay studies.  Is  this  a

relevant subject as mentioned by the Parliamentary

Secretary?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ghazali Bin Ismail -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ghazali:</b> Sir, I think the number of

graduates  in Malay studies is already too  great,

and therefore it is considered not really relevant

to our immediate requirements.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, can the

Parliamentary Secretary inform this House what are

the subjects that are considered relevant?



<br><br>8.00 p.m.
