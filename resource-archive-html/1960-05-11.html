convenient for the Assembly to meet on that day to

fill that vacancy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat</b> asked the

Prime Minister what were the total tonnages of

cargoes

handled by the Singapore Harbour Board during the

first quarters of 1959 and 1960 respectively.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Sun Wing) (for the Prime Minister) (In</b>

<b>Mandarin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was asked by the

Prime Minister to answer this question. The total

tonnage of cargoes handled by the Singapore

Harbour Board during the first quarter of 1960 was

1,391,741 tons as against 1,300,450 tons in the

first

quarter of 1959, amounting to an increase in 1960

over 1959 of more than 90,000 tons.

Prime Minister whether agreement has been reached

with the Johore Government with regard to water

supplied to Singapore, and what was the total sum

claimed by the Johore Government in respect of

such supply from January, 1954, to March, 1960.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Sun Wing) (for the Prime Minister) (In</b>

the City Council forraw water supplied by Johore

or by the Johore Government for treated water

supplied by the City Council to Johore. Proposals

have however been made by both parties, including

the date from which the agreement should take

effect, and the whole matter is under consideration.

<div align="center"><b>PERMITS GRANTED FOR</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>RETENTION OF UNAUTHORISED</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>TEMPORARY HOUSES</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat</b> asked the

Prime Minister under what circumstances will

permits be granted for the retention of

unauthorised temporary houses, and whether such

permits will be granted to unauthorised temporary

houses built after 1st June, 1959.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Sun Wing) (for the Prime Minister) (In</b>

<b>Mandarin):</b> Mr Speaker, I was asked by the Prime

Minister to answer this questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer depends upon whether it is State land

or private land that is affected.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards State land, the policy is that

encroachments will not be permitted under any

circumstances. All unauthorised structures on

State land are demolished summarily whenever and

wherever found. Where unauthorised houses are

already in existence, the Government has decided

to evict the occupants only in those cases where

the land is required immediately for public

development. In other cases, and until such time

as the land is required for public development,

the unauthorised occupation will be regularised by

requiring the occupant to pay a fee for a

Temporary Occupation Licence. The quantum of the

fee is according to a sliding scale, having regard

to the area of land occupied, the locality and

such other factors. A portion of the fee will be

credited to the tenant's account, will accumulate

each month, and will be refunded to him when he

demolishes the house and vacates the site. All

fees are payable with effect from 1st January,

1960.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning private land, the policy is that

action will be taken against all unauthorised

houses. As regards unauthorised houses already in

existence, permits for retention may be issued

under the following conditions only:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the land owner's permission has been given

to the occupier of the unauthorised

structure;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the unauthorised house is or can be

made structurally sound and does not constitute a

fire

or health hazard;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Court action has not resulted in the

issue of a Mandatory Order, and conditions

(i)  and (ii)  have been complied with.

<div align="center"><b>TOTAL ESTIMATED AND ACTUAL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>REVENUE FOR FIRST QUARTER OF 1960</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat</b> asked the

Minister for Finance

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



what were the total estimated revenue and the

total actual revenue for the first three months of 1960.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon.

Member asked for details of the estimated total

revenue and actual total revenue for the first

quarter of this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimates of revenue are framed on an annual

basis and not on a quarterly or monthly basis. The

reason is that certain major items of revenue, of

which income tax is the outstanding example, are

not collected by regular and equal monthly

amounts. In the case of income tax collections,

for instance, the main harvest will be reaped

during the months of  June, July and August. The

reason is that a time limit is set for the waiting

of returns of income, only after which can the

Department get down to the raising of assessments.

Nevertheless, it does not mean that the Government

does not continually examine each item of revenue

to see whether or not its performance comes up to

expectations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the hon. Member, I can give him two

assurances. First, the revenue position for the

main items of revenue is satisfactory. Second, all

efforts have been made to collect for the State

revenue due to it, so that the final outcome will

be as envisaged in the Estimates of Revenue, if

not better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, we have today before the Assembly the

Income Tax (Amendment) Bill which will ensure more

effective assessment and collection of income tax.

Doubtless I can take it that the concern which the

Member has expressed over the collection of State

revenue would be more positively expressed in the

form of support for the amending Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second part of his question, that

is, the total revenue for the first quarter of

1960, I submit a table for the information of the

Member.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It will, of course, be for the

information of all Member

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Minister for Labour and Law did not give the

reasons for cancelling the registration of the

union concerned.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I must treat the

matter as sub judice. I do not think any further

questions can be asked.

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, is it

the intention of the Government to make rules, or

to legislate either directly or indirectly to

compel an employee to become a member of any

union?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is a different question.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, will the Minister be good

enough to give us the reasons for cancelling the

registration of that union?

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the grounds have

already been communicated to the union concerned.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Could this House be informed of

those grounds?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the method of

approach would be to await

expect that information will reach Opposition

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the applications for

registration of only two trades unions are

pending, One is an amalgamated union in the rattan

industry. That application has been deferred

because the union has failed to furnish the

Registrar with a copy of its rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other application is from a federation of

trade unions which submitted its application as

recently as 13th April, 1960. The rules of this

federation are under consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been no undue delay in dealing with the

applications of these two unions.

been established and functioning during the same

result, secured employment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the number of

factories which closed down during the period in

operating during the same period is 77. The

estimated number of persons who lost their em

ployment when the 42 factories closed down is 473.

The estimated number of persons who secured

employment when the 77 new factories opened is

1,641; a very creditable balance sheet! The number

of factories which closed down prior to 1st June,

1959, but which restarted operations during the

period is 2. This is given for the information of the

Member for Cairnhill. The estimated number of

persons employed when these factories restarted is

450.

all. The Minister is entitled to give his inform

advice.

colleague the Minister for Finance, has just said

in an undertone, we have inherited a terrible

problem from the previous Government, but we have

got its measure and we are doing our best in a

very difficult situation. I think we are doing

much better than the previous Government can ever

claim they have done.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Could the Minister then please

justify his statement in the Press - that if a

minimum rate of interest payable on contributions

to the Central Provident Fund.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under the Central

Provident Fund Ordinance, the Central Provident

Fund Board is obliged to declare a minimum rate of

interest of 2½ per cent per annum, and the Board

is precluded from declaring any higher rate of

interest unless and until the assets of the Fund

valued at the current market price exceed its

liabilities by ten per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Fund's assets at current market

prices have not exceeded this limit of ten per

cent.

for considering amending legislation to raise the

and regulations, list of proposed office-bearers, as requested by the Registrar;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions voted by the Assembly in 1958 in

the 1958 Ordinary Estimates under the

Appropriation Ordinance, 1957, were insufficient,

and had to be augmented during the year by supple

mentary estimates. The additional amounts under

the various heads are shown in the First Schedule

to the Bill. They total $18,555,163.78. In the

case of the Development Estimates, the excess

expenditure of $338,154.04 is shown by the amount

and under the various heads in the Second Schedule

to the Bill. These excesses have all been covered

by supplementary votes approved by resolutions of

the Legislative Assembly during 1958, except for

certain payments under heads 22, 24, 46 and 47,

which Members will remember approving in Cmd. (New

Series) 28 of 1959 earlier this year. The Bill

seeks to give legal sanction to these

supplementary votes.

the name of the Member for Geylang Serai in

relation to subhead 22.

<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 9 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 22.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of my amendment is

to seek clarification from the Minister for

Finance with regard to the actual cost of the

motor launch and the probable expenditure for the

carriage of mails. It would appear here, Sir, that

the two separate expenditure have been lumped into

one sum of $138,000.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon.

Member has quite rightly noted that this

particular item is, in fact, a composite one. This

is done deliberately so that whoever will be

supplying us with the new vessel will not know the

amount that we are prepared to pay. So until

tenders for the vessel have been called for and

the deal closed, I am afraid this particular item

must remain a secret.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in that

event, could not a token vote of $10 be put in

instead of the total amount?

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That could well be done, Mr

Speaker, but it would mean a fair amount of

tidying up has to be done in the Treasury records

later, and since this expedient is open to us, it

is probably as good as any.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

would it not be possible for these mails to be

carried by launches belonging to the Police or

some other department now under the control of the

Government?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, the Curlew has

been employed in carrying mails ashore for the

Postal Department for the last 26 years or so. It

was withdrawn from use at the beginning of this



year on the recommendation of the Board of

Survey, and it was then already 27 years old, and

the Surveyor-General of Ships confirmed that

further repairs and maintenance would be most un

economic. Efforts were made to obtain a temporary

replacement from among launches of other

departments, but no vessel has been found with

holds for the mail. The possibility of converting

a vessel for this work has also been explored by

the Surveyor-General, but with an equal lack of

success.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the hon. Member wish a vote to

be taken?



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of

I beg to withdraw the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again the purpose of my amendment is to seek

clarification from the Minister for Finance as to

the term "Progress Assistants". I am just

wondering what the duties and responsibilities of

the Progress Assistants are.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the department for planning is now

former Singapore Improvement Trust Miscellaneous

Division, three appointments of Progress

Assistants in the Planning Department. Two of the

June 1957, when the Member for Geylang Serai was

responsible for the Singapore Improvement Trust.

School Certificate and seven years'

clerical/administrative experience. The duties are

as follows: registration of development

applications, consultation on development

applications, preparation of reports on planning

applications, preparation of purchases of

possession, maintenance of a close and thorough

applications with a view to decreasing the time

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.19 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Sun Wing)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Control of Rent (Amendment) Ordinance, No. 4

of 1960, which temporarily suspends for a period

of six months those sections of the Control of

Rent Ordinance which operate to the detriment of

farmers and tenants of attap and wooden huts,

expires on 23rd July, 1960.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



It is the intention to introduce new legislation

to protect farmers and others engaged in food

production and to do what is fair and just to

those popularly called squatters. However, in view

of the prorogation of the Assembly and the

business at the opening session, it has been

necessary to introduce this as an urgent Bill at

this sitting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new legislation is being drafted. It has

provisions for long leases and, in certain cases,

for compensation in accordance with the People's

Action Party's announced programme. The effects

and ramifications of this legislation have to be

carefully studied and weighed, particularly in

regard to land use, development needs and quantum

of compensation. Hon. Members will therefore agree

that the circumstances warrant, a further

extension of the provisions of Ordinance No. 4 of

1960 to enable the new legislation to take its

course at the next session of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I would like to point out with emphasis that

in the drafting of the Control of Rent Ordinance,

this Government will see that the interests of the

farmers are protected. They will not be victimized

by the private landowners either by raising rents

or causing them to be evicted. The increase of

rents and the eviction of the farmers only enhance

the interests of the private landowners, but they

are; detrimental to the immense benefits derived

from the social production by the farmers. However

for the sake of industrial development, it is

necessary to provide sites for the building of

factories and also the building of schools and

hospitals. This may give rise to a situation where

the interests of the farmers may conflict with the

long-term interests of the State, especially when

there is a need for the State to acquire land from

the private landowners. Of course, if this

conflicting situation can be avoided, we will

certainly do our best to avoid it. But all of us

are aware that Singapore is a small island. Sites

have been fully developed. It seems that a

conflict between the interests of the farmer and

the national interests cannot be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



avoided. However, I will have this point thrashed

out so that people can make

preparations in regard to this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Opposition is not against this Bill. But the

Opposition must draw the attention of this House

to the fact that this is the third time that this

Bill has come up before this House. At the sitting

on Jan. 13, this year, the Minister for National

Development tabled a similar Bill on a certificate

of urgency. During the debate, Sir, I pointed out

to the Hon. Minister for National Development that

the Opposition was in support of this Bill. I

would take the liberty, Sir, of quoting what I

said from Hansard, Vol. 12, No.

1, Col. 50:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister has said

that the Bill is an involved piece of legislation

and that it may result: in many representations

from interested parties. Would the Minister please

say whether he anticipates that the Bill can be

presented to this Assembly in time before the six

months is over? If he cannot do it, we are even

prepared to extend the period to one year. We are

just as interested in looking after the interest

of the farmers as the Government."



<br><br>And the Minister for National Development boldly

replied:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Deputy Speaker, the new Bill will be

presented and passed within the six-month period."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Sir, is another instance of the P.A.P.

Government saying things that they do not mean or

they do not mean what they say.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, in moving the Second reading, the hon.

mover of this motion should have said, "We are

sorry that we have not been able to get this Bill

out in time, and we therefore ask for an extension

of another six months." Instead of which the hon.

mover keeps on repeating the same thing over and

over again. "We have the interests of the farmers

at heart". So have we. We were prepared to give

the Minister for National Development one year. He

did not require it. He said he could do it within

six



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



months. It may be, Sir, that because the Minister

no longer has the power to look after this

particular job, the Bill could not be presented in

time.



<br><br>3.26 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Leader

of the Opposition always treads on rather risky

and dangerous ground. Firstly, if he were so

anxious and desirous of helping the poor farmers

and squatters, why did he not suspend the

operation of these two clauses of the Bill when he

had the power to do so?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, the reason why the Bill has not

been tabled for First Reading before the

prorogation of this House is that unexpected

difficulties have arisen as to how to assess

compensation other than by referring it to the

Rent Conciliation Board. We are trying to work out

a procedure whereby if the straightforward formula

which the Government uses as a basis for

compensation, and which private developers would

have to pay their squatter tenants cannot be

satisfactorily accepted by both parties,

then there must be a much more simple procedure

than a reference to the Rent Conciliation Board.

It may well be that we are unable to discover a

more simple and expeditious method. This might

have the undesirable result of increasing the

already heavy work of the Rent Conciliation Board.

But if we had up to July to do it, I think we

could have tabled the Bill for First Reading now,

move the Second Reading, Committee stage and Third

Reading in June. It is not July yet and the Bill

is not due to expire until the 23rd of July.

Unlike the last Labour Front Government which went

on and on and on and never knew when to stop, we

decide that once a year the Assembly should be pro

rogued and we should have the House tidied up, all

papers nicely bundled up for the year. Therefore,

because the Assembly is going to be prorogued

after our sitting on 1st of June for the election

of the Speaker, all Bills will die, as we do not

intend to have the opening of the next session

until some time in July itself, and then seven

clear days



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>



for the debate on the Government's policy address.

We have thought it prudent thereafter to put in

this Bill by an extension of six months rather

than inconvenience the House in July.

<br><br>3.29 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, the Control of Rent Ordinance

(Cap. 242) has been amended on two previous

occasions in order to suspend the two sections

under discussion. On the second occasion, Mr

Speaker, Sir, it was the Control of Rent

(Amendment No. 2) Bill. This is the third occasion

on which the Government is coming to the House to

ask for a third extension. In view of this, should

not this be the Control of Rent (Amendment No. 3)

Bill rather than the Control of Rent (Amendment

No. 2) Bill, because (Amendment No. 2) Ordinance

was debated at the sitting on the 13th of January

this year? That is one point. While appreciating

that -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think that probably is a

point which could well be

made in Committee. We are now on the principle of

the Bill.

<br><br>3.30 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The other point is that we do

appreciate that the amendments to these sections

will involve difficult points of law and

procedure, and it was because of that that we

offered the Government a further six months to

what they had asked the House. Even now, Sir, the

Opposition is prepared to give the Government

another six months should they find difficulty in

so far as procedure is concerned and in tying up

these two difficult sections and balancing

conflicting interests.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We do not require your

patience in this matter.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Parliamentary Secretary, in

the Bill."

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, this is the third

occasion on which the Government is coming to the

House with a request to extend the operation of

these two sections. In view of that, Mr Speaker,

Sir, I was wondering whether clause 1 should not

read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This Ordinance may be cited as the Control of

Rent (Amendment No. 3) Ordinance, 1960..."



<br><br>and not "(Amendment No. 2)" as it now stands.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The answer is in the Clerk's

office. That is, the Control of Rent (Amendment

No. 2) Bill was introduced in 1959 and it was

passed in 1960. It then became the Control of Rent

(Amendment) Ordinance, 1960. Consequently, this

Bill will now become the Control of Rent

(Amendment No. 2) Ordinance, 1960.

<div align="center"><b>MERCHANT SHIPPING</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL</b></div>



Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That they Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ships which leave Singapore fall into one of

three categories: foreign-going ships which

operate over the high seas of the world, home-trade ships which operate only within what is

known as home-trade limits, and local-trade ships

which operate only within what have been defined

as local-trade limits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many countries, it is the practice to allow

officers who do not possess foreign going masters'

certificates to command vessels which operate

within limited areas as long as these officers

have satisfied the local authorities as to their

knowledge of navigation and maritime law. This

practice is followed in our local Merchant

Shipping Ordinance which prescribes the different

manning scales that are required for ships in each

of these three categories: foreign-going, home-trade and local-trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some time now, it has been recognised that

the manning scales prescribed for such ships in

the existing Ordinance are unnecessarily

complicated and restrict the opportunities of

locally qualified mariners from command of these

ships. As an example of man-made complications,

the present law classifies those who can command

ships of 25, 75 and 100 tons. This is the policy

of the past which we now seek to remedy. The

effect of such a restrictive policy only serves to

discourage our local citizens

from making the sea a career. As a consequence of

this complication, we have at present a multitude

of certificates of competency issued to local

mariners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various unions of local mariners have long

protested against the situation I have described.

They have constantly agitated for an extension of

the local trade limits. The P.A.P. Government re

cognises the validity of their claims and has

carefully examined ways and means to meet them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shipping, however, is an international business.

It is futile for us to legislate shipping laws of

our own if there is no concurrence from the

governments of other countries to which our ships

go. For example, recently, a Singapore registered

ship, the motor vessel "New Constitution", was

detained in a neighbouring



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



territory because it was not up to the manning

standards of that territory. Such cases will not

occur when all territories have an agreed manning

policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before drafting this Bill which is now presented

to the House it was necessary, therefore, to seek

a common agreement between our Government and the

Governments of the Federation of Malaya, North

Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei. At the request of the

Singapore Government, a meeting of the marine

officials of the

five Governments was recently convened. At this

meeting, agreement was reached on an extension of

the local-trade limits along the Sarawak and North

Borneo coasts and a simplification of the manning

scales for local-trade ships. The terms of this

agreement are embodied in clauses 2 and 3 of the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also agreed at this meeting that each

territory could, as a domestic matter, provide for

more simplified manning scales for small vessels

operating on or near their coasts. The Federation

of Malaya and Singapore representatives agreed on

a simplified manning scale to operate within

thirty miles of ports in the Federation and

Singapore. This simplified scale is in sub-clause

(3) of clause 3 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of all these changes is to widen the

scope of employment potential for local officers

and engine-drivers. The size of ships which they

may command is now increased. There is also an in

crease in the horsepower of ships' engines which

local engine-drivers may take charge of. Finally,

the geographical limits within which locally

certificated mariners may command ships are being

extended. These limits have been drawn up in the

chart accompanying the Bill and Members of the

House will notice that there is a considerable

extension of these limits up to Tawau on the

Borneo coast.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these changes have been referred to the

unions of the officers concerned, to the

associations of ship owners and to marine

insurance companies who do not object to the new

proposals embodied in this Bill. The proposals

have been received enthusiastically by the unions

of local officers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment to the Merchant Shipping Ordinance

is a great achievement of international co-operation. The lifting of the repressive

restrictions of the past should now stimulate the

development

of a flourishing merchant marine in the waters of

South-East Asia and encourage our citizens to look

to the sea for a living and a career.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the working of the Financial

Procedure Ordinance, No. 39, of 1959, since its

coming into operation on the 31st July, 1959, it

has been found that subsection (5) of section 16

leads to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



practical difficulties. That subsection is worded

to provide that warrants issued in respect of one

financial year shall lapse at the end of the year.

This is in order for warrants such as the General

Warrant authorising approval to spend money in the

Estimates. But for certain other types of

warrants, it is not practicable. This is because

in practice it is not possible to close the

State's Account on the last day of the year.

Invoices for the year and statements of account

from overseas administrations and agencies come in

later. It becomes, therefore, necessary to issue

warrants to the following year to enable the

closing of the previous year's accounts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this Bill is to enable the

necessary warrants to be issued retrospectively to

effect financial adjustments to this Account.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The publication of this Bill, both in the

Federation and Singapore, has aroused some comment

in the Press and elsewhere. No doubt partly

because of this, the Federation Government decided

to withdraw their Bill at the Second Reading, and

this gave rise to hopes that we in Singapore might

do likewise. Actually the reason why the

Federation Government withdrew the Bill was not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



that they wavered in their resolve to implement

the policies underlying the Bill. It became

apparent to both Governments that much of the

objections raised against the provisions of the

Bill rested on misunderstandings and

misconceptions. Accordingly it was agreed between

the two Governments that a meeting of their

Finance Ministers, with Government Backbenchers

and their official advisers could profitably

discuss public response to the Bill and how best

the provisions of the Bill could be explained and

presented to the public. A meeting duly took place

in Kuala Lumpur on the 0th of April and agreement

was reached on all points. This meeting proved

most useful in that it drew attention to many

points on which public disquiet had arisen, and

the reasons why this came about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of this meeting, a number of

amendments were agreed upon, all of which are of a

minor nature, and I will move these amendments at

the Committee Stage. But first I wish to discuss

some basic considerations. Income tax legislation

must be as close as possible in the two

territories. And this is no more than a realistic

admission of the essential economic unity of the

two countries. At all stages of the drafting of

the Bill, continuous discussions took place

between the two Governments both at official and

Ministerial levels. This Bill represents the

fruition of the co-operative effort made by the

two administrations in tackling a problem common

to both. I may, perhaps, be allowed to place on

record the keen and detailed personal interest and

initiative taken by my Federation opposite number,

the Hon. Mr Tan Siew Sin, in the drafting of the

Bill now before us. His contribution to our

deliberations was a most valuable one, as my

colleagues who accompanied me to Kuala Lumpur can

testify.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the interest taken by certain sections

of the public in this Bill, I consider it

necessary, at the Second Reading, to discuss the

principles of the Bill in more detail than is

perhaps customary in this Assembly. Many

professional and trade organisations have written

to me



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>



expressing their opinion on various clauses of the

Bill. This is not the proper place to answer these

bodies but there is a common thread running

through much of what they have to say and it would

not, therefore, be out of place to refer generally

to some of these. I shall, of course, be sending

detailed replies to these associations in due

course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let, me now deal with the specific clauses of

the Bill. Clause 1 provides that the Bill shall

come into operation with effect from the 1st of

January, 1960, unless it is otherwise expressly

stated. A harmless enough provision. But it has

given rise to the charge that this constitutes

retrospective legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, restrospective legislation is not

unknown in the annals of Income Tax legislation - I

have been advised that there are, for instance,

section 20 of the U.K. Finance Act, 1922 and

section 242 of the U.K. Income Tax Ordinance, the

details of which, need not detain us here. But

clause 1 of the Bill cannot be cited as an example

of retrospective legislation. Tax assessments

relate to a year of assessment and to allow

amendments to operate as from the date of the

passage of the Bill would lead to anomalous

assessments during the year. For instance, the

Bill introduces a new element, namely, the

taxation of incomes derived from certain types of

settlements. It would be wrong to tax such incomes

during the current year, when the assessments are

raised after the passage of the Bill and exempt

those assessed before that date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 has not aroused much controversy. It

gives the Minister authority to issue to the

Comptroller-General or the Comptroller directives

of a general character not inconsistent with the

provisions of the Ordinance. However, I note, in

the Notices of Amendments to Bills in Committee

that the clause does not meet with the approval of

the Member for Farrer Park. I do not intend to

anticipate his objections, and will now move on to

clause 3, which regulates the exchange of

information between the Tax Administrations of the

Federation of Malaya; and Singapore. Again the

Member for Farrer Park does not wholly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>



approve the clause as it stands, but we shall

doubtless come to that in Committee stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 4, we come against what looks like a

minor outcry. This clause provides that income

from settlement shall be deemed to be the income

of the settlor if the beneficiary is a relative of

the settlor and if he is unmarried and less than

21 years of age at the commencement of the year of

assessment. In simple language, this means that a

man cannot reduce his tax liability by, for

instance, giving shares in his business to his

young children. When you go through the Income Tax

files of certain persons, you will be astounded at

the number of boys and girls who are nominal

partners or shareholders of the businesses of

their fathers. In some families, hardly is a baby

born before he becomes a registered partner or

shareholder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, all this is going to stop and about time

too. But this does not prevent some people raising

objections to clause 4. Settlements made by

parents in favour of their children it is claimed,

is a singularly Eastern virtue, inspired both by

motives of prudence and love of the family. Why

should virtue be discriminated against? Mr

Speaker, Sir, I am all in favour of the principle

that virtue should be rewarded. In a well ordered

society virtue will doubtless bring about its own

reward in, for instance, the form of greater

happiness. But in the imperfect world we live in,

this does not always happen and so some people

lead a life of virtue in the hope of a reward in

the hereafter. But it is a novel proposition that

the reward for virtue should be given by a

Minister for Finance here and now, more especially

so when its exercise would lead to a diminution of

the State Revenues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore not possible to agree to the

request that income from all forms of settlements

to minor relatives be exempted from taxation. Nor

is the Government willing to allow exemption in

respect of income from irrevocable settlements in

favour of minor relatives.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One criticism against clause 4 which I have come

across is its allegedly retrospective effect on

settlements previously entered into. I cannot see

how the, question of retrospective taxation comes

in at all since these settlements will be taxed

for the first time in 1960. And it would surely be

inequitable to tax future settlements and not

existing ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 strengthens the hands of the Comptroller

against evaders of income tax. The need for these

powers are so apparent that not much need be said

other than to state that these powers are

perfectly normal ones and are contained in the

taxing legislation of most countries of the

Commonwealth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 requires all businesses to keep proper

records of their transactions. Under the existing

legislation a person need not keep any records at

all unless the Comptroller specifically directs

him to do so. And of course when matters have

reached this stage, much damage has already been

done. The purpose of the clause is to make tax

evasion more difficult to carry out and more easy

to detect and punish. No one would object to that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary, in the application of this

section of the Bill, to frame a proper strategy.

It is important that we do not waste time and

effort straining after the small fry while

allowing the big fish to escape. I have discussed

this matter with the Comptroller, especially the

application of clause 6 (1) (b). This requires all

businesses with gross receipts exceeding $18,000 a

year from sales of goods or $12,000 a year from

the performance of services to issue serially

numbered receipts. The Comptroller under sub-clause (3) has the power to waive this requirement

in respect of any person or class of persons. It

has been agreed that for the current year of as

sessment, the following categories of persons will

be exempted from the requirement to issue serially

numbered receipts:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) All hawkers unless individually directed by

the Comptroller to issue receipts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Market and roadside stallholders (not shop-keepers) unless individually directed by

the Comptroller to issue receipts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Retail traders carrying on businesses in

premises for which the rent paid does not

exceed $50 per month and not more than

three persons assist in carrying on the business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) All traders whose gross receipts did not

exceed $36,000 in the previous year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Taxi drivers, trishaw-riders and self-employed boatmen plying for passengers in

the harbour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are extensive exemptions. If any business

not covered by the above wishes to obtain

exemption from the provisions of sub-clause (1)

(b), it may apply to the Comptroller. It may be

appropriate for me to say something about

Government's policy in this matter. There are two

aspects of the question I want to discuss. First

there is the general problem of inadequate record

keeping and accounting systems of private

businesses. The second deals with possible

differences in the administration of this part of

the income tax law as between Singapore and the

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as regards the first problem, it has been a

long standing complaint that the taxpayer who

discharges in full his tax liability are the

salaried employees and the public corporations

with modern accounting systems. Other persons, in

cluding sole proprietorships and partnerships, are

suspected of extensive tax evasion because of the

inadequate system of record keeping. If you are

paid a salary of $1,000 per month, you can hardly

hope to pretend to the Comptroller that you did

not earn such an amount. But there is no assurance

that receipts from miscellaneous small and medium

businesses are properly accounted for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure proper accounting in this sector of the

economy would mean not merely the passage of the

necessary law.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>



There are two further requirements. First the

machinery of enforcement must be built and geared

into action. Next there must be widespread

consciousness among the public who buy things that

the retailer must be made to observe the law. When

the public is aware that tax evasion is a

reprehensible crime whose victim is the public

itself, then we shall be able more adequately to

enforce the law. It will take time and effort to

build up public opinion along these lines. This we

must and shall do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the possible different application of

this clause as between the Federation and

Singapore, it must be remembered that the scale of

personal reliefs in Singapore for the time being

is higher than that in the Federation. So long as

this is so, the Comptroller in Singapore can be

freer in the exercise of his powers of exemption

under sub-clause (3). But the position must be

kept under continuous review, and in principle it

is desirable that in the Bill itself the limits

for automatic exemption from the issue of receipts

should be kept identical in both territories.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may now move on to clause 7. This requires an

employer to retain for a period of 30 days any

moneys owing to an employee who has ceased employ

ment with him, unless the Comptroller releases him

from this obligation before then. The penalty for

infringement is laid down in clause 15. Some

employers have expressed the fear that under

clause 15, they may be saddled with the tax

liability of an employee who disappears as soon as

he has received his pay packet. This apprehension

is groundless. For if the employer does not hold

any money payable to an employee, as would be the

case in the instance quoted, he is free from any

obligation under clause 7.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some explanation is due for the extension,

provided by clause 8, of the period, during which

additional assessments may be raised, from six

years to twelve years. It has been found impos

sible to dispose of all cases of suspected evasion

given the present number of experienced staff. The

position is improving but there is a backlog of

cases



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



arising from the post-Korean War boom years of

1950-52. It is not easy to obtain convictions for

fraud but the proposed amendment will ensure that

omissions of income, when discovered, can be

included in the assessments for the relevant years

and that the tax not lost forever.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 9 and 10 introduce a radical change in

regard to the payment of tax which is the subject

of appeal or objection. Section 85 of the

Principal Ordinance, which is repealed by clause

9, allows the deferment of payment of disputed tax

until the objection or appeal is determined.

Clause 10 lays down that the tax must be paid

first though the Comptroller may at his discretion

allow an extension of time. These new proposals

have caused agitation in certain quarters. Fears

have been expressed that these clauses now give

the Comptroller untrammelled power to ruin a

person, if he is so disposed. The critics would

hardly be satisfied with the argument that there

is no reason to suppose that the Comptroller would

be so disposed and would not exercise his powers

other than in accordance with accepted principles

of tax assessment. The lurking fear remains.

Supposing the man, acting in all honesty, makes a

mistake?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to defend these clauses on three

grounds. First, let us consider how the large

majority of disputed assessments arise. Let us

stick to real facts and practices and not move

into the world of hypothesis and fancy. The great

majority of disputes over assessments are those

raised in consequence of information obtained on

investigation. These reveal an accretion of assets

whose sources the taxpayer cannot explain satis.

factorily. This, in itself, does not justify a

prosecution for fraud. But the possession of these

assets is not in dispute and it is in such

instances that assessments are raised and almost

invariably disputed. The tax therefore is only a

part of these assets and it is not possible for

the assessee to be made bankrupt solely by virtue

of his tax liability unless he has in the meantime

squandered his assets by extravagant and possibly

profligate dealings.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason why the present system of

deferred payments must cease is that it is only

too apparent that too many taxpayers are taking

advantage of the existing legislation to postpone

the day of payment. On the 31st December, 1959,

the amount of tax outstanding on objections was no

less than $30 millions. If we apply the current

rate of interest, this would mean a loss to the

revenue on interest alone of nearly $2 millions a

year. It is therefore obvious that the present

position is utterly scandalous and cannot be

allowed to continue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally for those who consider that the new

proposals give abnormal powers to the Comptroller,

let me say that similar provisions appear in the

tax statutes of India, New Zealand, Australia, Cey

lon, Canada and Hong Kong. Hong Kong has never

acquired the reputation of harshness towards

businessmen and when their Income Tax Ordinance

closes this particular loophole, we are well

advised to do likewise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining clauses of the Bill are not

controversial, except perhaps for clause 14. The

objects of all these clauses are described in the

explanatory statement to the Bill and I need not

therefore dwell upon them except for clause 14,

over which a great deal of the apprehension caused

appears to be misplaced. Objection is taken to the

provision that in certain classes of civil or

criminal proceedings, a statement of the

Comptroller shall be accepted as a prima facie evi

dence so far as it relates to, a statement of

fact. From this position, a great leap forward is

taken by some of the melodramatic critics to the

conclusion that a man is presumed guilty unless he

proves himself innocent. Consequently clause 14

stands condemned as a fundamental breach of

natural justice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, no one can say that I am a hard-

hearted person or that I am insensitive to the

principles of natural justice. But I confess I am

quite unmoved by these pleas. I suggest that

before these persons take off into the realms of

fantasy, they may do well to ask themselves in

what kind of proceedings this clause would apply.

The answer is given in sub-clause (3) (b) which

explicitly excludes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>

proceedings for an offence punishable by

imprisonment. And this brings us to section 94 of

the Principal Ordinance which defines such

offences. These consist principally of the

failures to make returns in time and failure to

pay tax within the prescribed period. These are

relatively trivial offences though the number of

offenders is large. It is therefore necessary to

make provision for the expeditious disposal of

such cases. I am advised by my colleague, the

Minister for Labour and Law, that the practice of

creating a presumption does not run counter to ac

cepted legal principles, and there are many

instances in legislation both in our country and

elsewhere of this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to conclude my speech

with a few general remarks on the course in which

I hope this debate will take. The Government is

fully aware that the Bill provides for an

extension of powers granted to the tax

authorities. We are also aware that any extension

of power granted to the executives carries with it

a certain degree of risk. This is inevitably so in

the nature of things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How are we to assess the degree of risk as

against the possible advantages in the way of

improved efficiency that will be brought about?

There are two possible approaches. The first is to

take a purely academic and theoretical approach

and to raise one's hands in horror at every

conceivable and even inconceivable possibility of

abuse of power. I suggest that this approach is

fruitless and sterile.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must judge this issue on the facts as they are

as regards the efficiency and competence of our

tax administration. In Singapore we have a small

and comparatively young income tax department.

This department, like all other Government

departments, has gone through the stresses of

malayanisation. But I think it will be a fair

appraisal of the work they are doing to say that

they are a technically competent and responsible

group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is working out a scheme whereby

officers of the Income Tax Department can have

improved terms of conditions of service in order

that efficient officers can achieve promotion to

the topmost post. This will help further to raise

the level of professional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>



competence of officers of the department. Already

there are signs of improved efficiency in tax

assessments and collections. For instance, in the

first four months of the year, the amount of tax

collected has been considerably greater than that

for the corresponding period of last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking all matters into consideration, I have no

hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the

powers which will be granted to the tax

administration by this Bill will be used with

fairness and responsibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opposition, of course, is free to say what

they like but their remarks will bear greater

weight if they would refrain from taking the

purely theoretical approach and instead tackle the

problem as a practical problem of tax administra

tion. If they take this attitude when discussing

specific provisions of the Bill, then I have no

doubt that the tax administration, in the

execution of their work, will bear their views in

mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.20 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there can be very

little doubt that there is a great deal of tax

evasion in Singapore. We on the Opposition side

will support the Government in every reasonable

measure it takes to bring to book and to heel all

those people who are now evading taxation, because

for every person who evades taxation, a correspond

ingly heavier burden is put on the honest citizen

who pays his tax regularly, punctually and to the

full amount that he is due to pay under the law.

Therefore, all these evaders put a very heavy

burden on the honest citizen, and any attempt by

the Government to bring these people to book will

meet with the support of the Opposition. But in

framing proposals to bring these evaders to book,

Mr Speaker, Sir, one has always do keep a proper

balance between the powers given to officials and

undue infringement on the personal liberties of a

private citizen. Our system of society is based on

that conception of the law and it has worked very

well up to now, except, it seems, in so far as

income



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>



tax goes. Therefore, the Minister has brought in a

number of amendments which he hopes will bring to

book all these evaders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have on a number of occasions said in this

House that the making of a law does not mean that

the offender will be brought to book. The most im

portant thing is to have an organisation which is

capable of spotting the offender, and having

spotted him, to bring him to book. I make so bold

as to say, Mr Speaker, that if all the existing

provisions of the existing Ordinance have been

fully availed of by the tax officers, there would

not have been this deficit, or this non-payment,

of $30 million to the extent that there is now,

and many more taxpayers would have been on the

roll of taxpayers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister, I think, in his speech on

the Second Reading of the Bill, did concede the

point that whatever laws you may have it is the

machinery of enforcement that is the import

ant thing. Mr Speaker, Sir, even if the powers

given to the officers are twice that which the

Minister seeks to obtain from this House, but the

machinery of enforcement is not there, then not

all the powers given to him by this House will

enable his bringing on to the tax roll greater

numbers of people who should now be on it, thereby

resulting in a greater collection of taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the taxing office - the Comptroller

and his staff - have been given a weapon under the

taxing Ordinances. I do not say this in any sense

of disparagement, Mr Speaker, Sir, but if they

knew how to handle that weapon efficiently, then I

think much more could have been done. The gun has

been placed in the hands of the taxing departments

to bring to book the offending taxpayer and the

evader. But it appears that the taxing officials

have not yet learnt to use that gun properly. And

because they are unable to use it properly and to

shoot the tax evader with the first or second or

even third shot, they are now asking the Assembly,

"Give us a hand grenade. We can spot the thief. We

can spot the musang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>

amongst the chickens. We do not know how to use

this gun to pick off the musang, but if you will

give us a hand grenade, we will throw it in the

direction of the musang and we will surely get

it."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As well as the chickens!

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> But in getting the musang, he has

already got all the chickens. Now, that strikes

me, Mr

Speaker, Sir, as the general intent and purpose of

the amendments sought for by the Minister. I have

filed a number of amendments and I have also given

notice that I will speak on the various clauses.

As the Minister himself has on the Second Reading

dealt with the Billclause by clause, I think it

will be more appropriate for me to speak on these

various clauses in the Committee stagerather than

now.

<br><br>4.26 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

we are glad to note that the Opposition is just as

helpful as we are in looking after the machinery

of the Income Tax Department. We all know that for

a long time the Income Tax Department has been

considered fair game for all and sundry who wish

to measure wits with the Government officials.

Income tax evasion has been the result. Some

people have developed this game of tax evasion

into a fine art, more often than not with the help

of legal and specially trained personnel in

accounts, and those who know the workings inside

the Income Tax Department. That tax evasion is

rampant has been admitted by everybody. Many have

indulged in tax evasion unashamedly. They do not

consider it a heinous crime to get the better of

the Income Tax Department. They have no

inhibitions about it with friends and in their in

timate circles. It is not uncommon, Sir, for

certain tax evaders to get together and discuss

amongst themselves ways and means whereby they can

match their wits against the probing powers of the

Comptroller of Income Tax.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has just mentioned

something about the evader. But what about those

who are more circumspect and who go about the

business in the so-called legal way? For example,

as the Minister has just mentioned, we find the

very rich very magnanimously and generously making

provisions for the comparatively young and

unmarried children and relatives in their so-

called settlements. While not questioning their

right to provide for dependants, it is quite

obvious also that

such settlements are cunning devices of the rich

to cock a snook at the Income Tax Comptroller. And

there is nothing the Income Tax Comptroller can do

about it. Then again there are those who, though

caught and accordingly assessed, still manage to

employ delaying tactics in rather frivolous and

systematic appeals to the Board of Review. The

huge sum which the Minister says has been held up

as a result of all these appeals is simply

shocking. One can imagine how the building of

schools and hospitals has been held up because of

these prolonged tactical appeals. It is not fair

for a small number of people to hold up

developments which are of benefit to the large

majority of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember, Sir, that we are now a self

governing State. All of us must now bear our fair

share in the responsibility of building our

economy. It is only right that the responsibility

should fall more on the shoulders of those best

able to bear it and, as mentioned by the Member

for Farrer Park, tax evaders throw an extra burden

on the shoulders of the rest of the population.

The P.A.P. Government has always the interest of

the masses at heart. This Bill, Sir, as has

rightly been called in the newspapers and

elsewhere, is a war on tax evaders - those, you may

say, anti-social elements who deprive the masses

of enjoying the maximum benefits that State

revenue can bring to the people. This Bill will

endeavour to close the net and loopholes against

tax evaders. Where loopholes still exist, it will

become increasingly difficult and hazardous for

tax evaders in view of the increased penalties.

This Bill is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



meant to harass the taxpayers as has been

suggested by some quarters. In fact, far from

harassing the taxpayers, this Bill will protect

the honest taxpayers. It allows the Comptroller an

opportunity to separate the black sheep that have

so far besmirched the good name of honest

taxpayers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill deserves the support of all who have

the welfare of the people of Singapore at heart.



<br><br>4.32 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we

on the Opposition side are in favour of any fair

and just measure to prevent tax evasion, but we

feel that in the case of an important and

controversial amending Bill like this one, it

would be better if it were to be referred to a

Select Committee to enable interested bodies and

individuals to make proper representations and to

appear before the Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, Sir, that it is now too late for a Select

Committee to be appointed, but if one were to be

appointed, it would remove from the minds of the

many would be representors that they are treated

unfairly. After all, Sir, this country lives on

trade and if traders feel that they have been

treated unfairly -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Then they will not make

profits

<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> - then they may go over to

other places like the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the interest of the working people and

the unemployed, may I suggest that, where

possible, controversial Bills be referred to

Select Committees instead of their being rushed

through all stages?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I was happy to know that

the Member for Tanglin was unable to castigate the

Bill publicly. He felt that had representors been

allowed an opportunity to do so in the quiet

precincts of a Select Committee, they would

undoubtedly have felt more satisfied after having

been heard out.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody in this Chamber who represents the

people of Singapore subscribes to the principle

that tax evasion is morally wrong. Everybody knows

that professional accountants, income tax

consultants and legal advisors all start off on

the major premise that it is fair game to beat the

income tax man. We have inherited the British

tradition that if you are able, either by your wit

or your ingenuity, to go round the fiscal laws,

then good luck to you. I am glad to see that the

Member for Farrer Park is consciously suppressing

his more natural attitude to tax evasion and to

those who help tax evaders in a legally, orderly

and effective manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one argument which would move us.

If the Opposition can show that any of these laws

would result in a man being taxed for what he has

not got, then we, as the Government, would be the

first to make sure that not only is he not taxed,

but that if in the unfortunate event he has been

made to pay for something he has never earned,

then it will be refunded to him. But all this

raising of hands for the poor, good, honest

taxpayer as distinct from the tax evader is a lot

of hypocrisy if, having subscribed to the major

premise that tax evasion should be stopped, we

then come round, by devious arguments, to the pro

position of allowing it within certain limited

ranges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly support what the Minister for Finance

has said, that if other countries like Hongkong,

more renowned for their kindness and softness of

heart to industrialists and merchants, have found

it necessary to deal with them not so much with

handgrenades as with dumdum bullets, then I say by

all means let us give our Income Tax Department

the dum-dum bullets. Sir, in other parts of the

world, there is the idea of maintaining two or

three sets of accounts - one is for the income tax

man, the second is for your partner, and the third

is for yourself and your family. Where you do not

have such practices, it might well be that you do

not require bullets that will pierce through

bullet-proof vests. But where you meet taxpayers

who are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>

also tax evaders, then it is not only the number

of people who are not paying taxes, but also the

number of people who are not paying proper taxes

who are involved. Where they have got this armour

plating, I say that we, as good legislators had

better ensure that in the interest of the people

our tax collectors have got the necessary

instruments of extraction.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Ramaswamy (Bukit Merah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I am glad to know that the Opposition are with us

in realising that tax evaders should not be let

free, but I do not understand why they object to

these powers being given to the Income Tax

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to deal with a few of the devices of the

tax evaders and how the Government is planning to

put a stop to them. The Member for Tanglin has

said that this Bill should be referred to a Select

Committee. What is there in this Bill for a Select

Committee to consider when everybody is agreed

that tax evasion should be eradicated? There is

nothing controversial about the question of

settlement. Mr Speaker, Sir, there have been

references to the natural instinct to provide for

one's family, and suggestions that the proposal to

ignore settlements would appear to deny a person's

right to spread out the incidence of tax by the

disposition of his own property. The natural

instinct of a person to provide for his family

does not primarily involve the creation of a

settlement. In the case of the poorer classes, the

lack of assets normally precludes the creation of

settlements and, therefore, parents provide for

their families in the form of food, clothing and

accommodation. It is usually only where the crea

tion of settlements results in considerable

savings of tax that action is taken by taxpayers

to provide for their children and others. It

cannot be conceded that to prevent the rich from

relieving themselves of tax evasion by these means

is a harsh measure. It must be emphasised that the

tax in this case is not retrospective. To permit

these persons, prior to the passing of this

legisla



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>



tion, to be relieved of their obligation and only

tax those who were not smart in the past would not

be just and equitable. You can find similar

legislation in other parts of the world - India, the

United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and

Palestine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then comes the payment of tax despite objections

and appeals. First of all, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to point out to Members of the

Opposition that countries like India, Hong Kong,

New Zealand, Australia, Ceylon and Canada have

similar legislation. S.P.A. members and local

capitalists have often pointed out to us that Hong

Kong is an example for setting up conditions

favourable for investment. Hong Kong has this

legislation and this provision for the payment of

tax despite objections and appeals. Why should we

not have it too? In India, they have had it for

the last two decades, or even for a longer period

than that. Ceylon has the same legislation. Nobody

will deny that a large number of taxpayers delay

payments merely by lodging appeals. It can be

argued the Comptroller has power to apply to the

Income Tax Board for an order for payment of

security towards the tax assessed, and if the

Board of Appeal finds that the appeal is vexatious

or frivolous, it can order the appellant to pay

$250 only. What is this $250 compared to the

thousands of dollars which are due to the Income

Tax Department? I was once told - I do believe it -

that the interest earned by an appellant during

the

period it took to hear the appeal was enough to

cover his lawyer's expenses and other incidentals,

and he had a surplus. Therefore, payment of tax

before the appeal, i.e. despite the appeal, should

be enforced. I would like to point out, Mr

Speaker, Sir, that we are not making a precedent,

and it is time now that we follow other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the suggestion that the taxpayer may be

made bankrupt by the Income Tax Department

enforcing this provision. It is most unlikely,

Sir, that any Court will adjudicate a taxpayer

bankrupt where it is not financially possible for

him to pay his tax. The

tax



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>



authorities will think twice or thrice before they

begin to waste money to recover an irrecoverable

debt. The fact that the taxpayer possesses a lot

of wealth should have been the reason why action

is taken and the taxpayer then disposes of all his

wealth and says that it is a hardship on him to

pay the tax. Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

say that these powers are quite necessary for the

Tax Department.



<br><br>4.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Baharaddin Bin Moh Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharaddin Bin Mohd. Ariff (Anson)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe Opposition

Members on the other side understand the reasons

why we are determined to bring in these tax

evaders. It should be noted that the P.A.P.

Government will not impose a heavy burden on the

people. But, Mr Speaker, Sir, to save people from

having to shoulder more responsibilities, we are

trying to get hold of those tax evaders. One of

the best methods to achieve this is by amending

many of the provisions of the old Income Tax

Ordinance. We find that this is the consensus of

opinion not only in Singapore but also in the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, a meeting was held between the

representatives of the Governments of Singapore

and the Federation of Malaya, and as has been

stated by the Minister for Finance, both the

Ministers for Finance of Singapore and the Fede

ration were present at this meeting. Those who are

responsible people and who go thoroughly and

carefully through the

amendments, will say that the amendments proposed

are good indeed. But to those who are

irresponsible, Mr Speaker, Sir, people who object

for the sake of objecting, as has been expressed

by the Member for Farrer Park, naturally the

amendments will not be good. Mr Speaker, this

matter should be considered in this light, that we

should not impose a further taxation burden on

those people who are already paying their tax

properly. But it is appropriate to catch those who

are tax evaders. At the meeting referred to, Mr

Speaker, there were many clauses in this amending

Bill which did not meet the approval of members of

the Federation Government. But in view of the fact

that many development pro-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>



grammes have been announced by the Federation

Government and that we in Singapore have also

similar projects, both Governments agreed to work

in close collaboration with each other and approve

these amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the amendments concerns investigation into

the books. In the Federation, this clause has been

deleted, but we have reached agreement with the

Federation Government on many other amendments. I

think the Opposition side should be careful when

they criticise and oppose the clauses which will

be discussed at the Committee stage later on.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I spent

quite a lot of time yesterday preparing for this

debate, but after having heard what the Opposition

has had to say, I am wondering whether or not I

have not wasted all this time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Opposition Members say that they are

completely in agreement with the Government that

tax evasion is a very bad thing. But when we

propose that something should be done about it,

they say, "Better not! The present position

regarding powers is good enough. Before we do

anything rash, let us refer this matter to a

Select Committee." Mr Speaker, Sir, that is not

the way the P.A.P. Government look at things. If

we think that the position is bad and needs

remedying, we get down to the job of remedying it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In winding up the debate, I am not required to

say a great deal, simply because there is not much

for me to refute other than one point, perhaps two

points, raised by the Member for Farrer Park. He

said that if only the present powers available to

the Comptroller were used, the tax of $30 million

which I mentioned in my speech could easily be

collected. I am astonished that, as a lawyer, the

Member for Farrer Park could come to this

conclusion. Section 85 of the principal Ordinance

lays down quite definitely that the taxpayer need

not pay any tax under dispute until the dispute is

settled either before a Board of Review or a Court

of Appeal. So this huge amount of tax is just

being held back from Government by persons who use section 85.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



to deny to Government, for some time at least, the

payment of tax due to the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has also said that he

considers that if administration were to be

improved, the existing powers are quite adequate.

I have already cited one case where the existing

powers are quite inadequate. But he on his side

has not given any details to support his

proposition. I therefore remain firm in my

conviction, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the powers

requested in the Bill are both reasonable and

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a convenient time to suspend?

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>5.32 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2-

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is an amendment standing in

the name of the Minister for Finance which I

think is consequential on the new clause. It

might be more convenient to deal with that

amendment under the provisions of Standing Order

71, paragraph 11, which reads:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After all clauses and schedules have been gone

through, any Member may, with the leave of the

Chairman, move an amendment to a clause or

schedule already passed, provided that the

amendment is made necessary by an amendment made

to any other clause or schedule."



<br><br>Is that agreeable?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We will do that then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 2 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the clause reads,

it appears that the intention is to give the

Minister this power:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Minister may from time to time give the

Comptroller-General or Comptroller directions of a

general character, and not inconsistent with the

provisions of this Ordinance, as to the exercise

of the powers and discretions conferred on the

Comptroller-General ... ".



<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, I am going to suggest to the

Minister that this power is not only not necessary

but it would also lead to conflict with certain

provisions of the law. I refer now to section 7 of

the Income Tax Ordinance. Section 7 reads as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Malayan Board of Income Tax may from time to

time make rules-"



<br><br>with regard to a number of matters -

(a), (b), (c) and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(d) generally to give effect to the provisions,

other than the provisions of section 49 and

of Part XII of  this Ordinance."



<br><br>Section 49 of the Ordinance is a section dealing

with double taxation provisions, and Part XII of

the Ordinance deals with the procedure on appeals

from the assessments of the Comptroller. So that

section 7 (1) (d) seems, to my mind, the same as

the purported new section 3A:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Minister may from time to time give the

Comptroller-General or Comptroller directions of a

general character, and not inconsistent with the

provisions of this Ordinance, as to the exercise

of the powers and discretions conferred on the

Comptroller-General...".

<br><br>As the Minister himself has said, it is of vital

importance in the administration of the income tax

laws of Singapore that we should be on all fours,

or nearly on all fours, with the Federation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



as far as possible. Now it was with that intent

and purpose that the Malayan Board of Income Tax

was brought into existence under the provisions of

the Income Tax Ordinance. The composition of the

Malayan Board of Income Tax is such that it has

representation both from the Federation of Malaya

and from the State of Singapore. And the intention

was that it would be the Board which would make

various decisions on the day-to-day administration

that would arise from implementing the Income Tax

Ordinance. Because of the necessity that the

implementation and administration should be

similar in both the territories, it therefore

became necessary for one body to give directions

to both the Comptrollers as to how they were to

administer the Ordinance. I take it, Mr Speaker,

Sir, that that was the intention and purpose of

creating a Malayan Board of Income Tax on which

there were representations both from Singapore and

the Federation of Malaya. If this section 3A

passes into

law, there will, in effect, be three persons who

will give directions to the Comptroller as to how

the provisions of this Ordinance are to be

administered. Whether the Minister can over-ride

the rules of the Malayan Board of Income Tax or

vice versa, it is not for me at this juncture to

state. It would tend to create not only confusion,

Mr Speaker, Sir, but it would also tend to create

a state of affairs where the Minister in Singapore

might give directions to the Comptroller here that

a certain provision of the Ordinance should be

administered in a certain way, and the Minister in

the Federation, in respect of the same section,

might give different administrative directions to

his Comptroller which would result in different

administrations of one particular section. If sec

tion 3A passes into law, the Minister here would

have power to give directions of a general

character and not directions which he could give

to the Comptroller with regard to a particular

assessment. Therefore, why it is necessary to pass

this particular section 3A, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

at a loss to understand. I think section 7 of the

exist

ing Ordinance provides for it, and there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



is no need to bring in the new section 3A. If it

is brought in, not only will it create confusion

in Singapore but I think it will also lead to

disparity in administration of the two Ordinances

both here and in the Federation. It is vitally

important that not only should the income tax laws

in the Federation and here be the same, but that

the implementation and administration of the laws

should also proceed on similar lines. I think

section 7 of the Ordinance should prevail rather

than the intended new section 3A.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member

for Farrer Park has not paid sufficient attention

to the actual wording of this new section. I will

find that it is specifically stated there that

though the Minister may give the Comptroller-General directions of a general character, the

directions which he gives must not be inconsistent

with the provisons of this Ordinance. If he gives

any specific instruction to the Comptroller-General which is inconsistent with the procedures

which have been laid down with the approval of the

Malayan Board of Income Tax, then he would be

contravening the provisions of this Ordinance.

That is not the intention. Now, all Ministers have

departmental duties to discharge. As political

heads, it will be necessary for them to see that

the law is administered, and they can give, say,

general directions to their departmental heads as

to the way in which they want the work of the

department to be carried out. That, I suggest, Mr

Speaker, Sir, is not in any way in conflict with

the rules which are laid down by the Malayan Board

of Income Tax. That is all that the new section

seeks to do.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I appreciate what

the Minister for Labour and Law has said, that the

Minister for Finance can only give directions of a

general character not inconsistent with the

provisions of this Ordinance. But the purported

new section, Mr Speaker, Sir, does not say "not

inconsistent with the provisions of this Ordinance

or any rules made there under". It does not say



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



that, to begin with. In any case, section 7 (1)

(d) of the Ordinance gives exactly the same powers

to the Malayan Board of Income Tax. They can give

effect to the provisions, other than the

provisions of section 49 and of Part XII, of this

Ordinance by framing rules and laying them before

the Assembly, and on the Assembly passing them,

they will have the effect of law. Whereas here,

the Minister, merely by an administrative note to

the Comptroller, could ask him to do a lot of

things under the Ordinance not inconsistent with

the provisions of this Ordinance. My question to

the Minister is this. If the new section 3A is

intended to increase the efficiency of the Income

Tax Department, and also to see that tax evasion

is brought to heel, then all these powers are

adequately contained in section 7 of the

Ordinance. Now if it took the matter any further

and gave the Comptroller added powers to do it,

then I would agree. But it does not do any more

than what is already contained in section 7 (1)

(d).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noticed, Mr Speaker, Sir, that for the

last two or three years the Malayan Board of

Income Tax has been by-passed on every possible

occasion. Matters which could have been referred

to it have not been referred to it by Ministers

both here and in the Federation. By getting

together over the table, they have decided how the

law should be administered, so far as income tax

is concerned, and what the amendments should be.

Previously the position was that any matter

affecting the administration of income tax law - amendments or any other matters pertinent to

income tax - was always referred to the Malayan

Board of Income Tax for their advice and their

views.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a feeling, Mr Speaker, Sir, that if

this new section 3A is passed into law, we might

as well write off section 7 from the Income Tax

Ordinance, that in future the Malayan Board of

Income Tax will cease to have any meaning

whatsoever under this Ordinance, and that the only

thing it can do is probably to give ex-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>



emptions to charities. So far as section 7 is

concerned, it will be absolutely hamstrung and the

only persons who would matter then in the

administration of the Ordinance would be the

Minister here and the Minister in the Federation.

If it is the intention of the Minister here and

the Minister in the Federation that section 7

should be wiped out, then they are correct in

advocating this new clause. But they have not said

so. So long as section 7 remains on the statute

book, it seems to, me that there is absolutely no

need for a new section 3A.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when we took

office we found the Malayan Board of Income Taxis,

as the Member for Farrer Park has stated, in a

somewhat peculiar position in that their

functions, which were originally thought

appropriate to them, had not in recent years been

considered part of their normal functions. This

may have a long and complicated history, the

details of which I am not aware, but it may be

that the Board itself already performed much of

the important matters, such as laying down

procedures and forms for the effective discharge

of administration of the Income Tax Ordinance, and

that the other matters requiring decision at

higher levels could be discharged quite

effectively at ministerial level. The Member for

Farrer Park said that if you had one pan-Malayan

co-ordinating body which is in a position to

give directives to the two administrations, then

why is this new section 3A necessary? This section

is necessary because it will not be possible to

send matters of temporary importance for the

consideration of the Board. May I give an example?

I have already mentioned in my speech during the

Second Reading of this Bill that, in order to

combat effectively tax evasion, it is necessary to

make the public more conscious of the effect of

tax evasion upon themselves. This is a matter in

which the political leadership rather than the

administration must provide the leadership and

initiative. At the same time, when we are

organising a campaign against income tax evasion,

it is necessary to co-ordinate the campaign with

the policy of the Income Tax Department. Clearly,

this is not a function which could



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>



be referred to the Malayan Board of Income Tax,

because it deals with a situation which is

changing very rapidly from month to month, perhaps

from week to week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, although the general laws relating to

income tax and even specific rules made under the

Ordinance should be uniform in the two

territories, it does not mean that the

implementation should be identical. I have already

referred to the fact that the higher rates of

personal relief in Singapore would mean that in

the application of the powers of exemption under

clause 6 of this Bill, the Comptroller in

Singapore would have much greater freedom to grant

exemptions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as my colleague, the Minister for Labour

and Law, has pointed out, these directives are of

a general character and they should not be

inconsistent with the provisions of the Ordinance.

I can see no objection whatsoever to the clause as

it stands.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in replying the

Minister made the point that clause 2 is necessary

as part of the campaign to get more tax and to

make the public more conscious that Mr A is

evading tax, and that he should not be assisted in

the evasion because, by that, the law-abiding

citizen - the man who does his duty to the State - is

being made to pay for Mr A who is evading it.

That is not something which any legislation can

take care of and certainly this particular income

tax legislation does not even seek to do it. No

legislation can do it. You may remember, Mr

Speaker, Sir, the very interesting debates we have

had about how Ministries should have their roots

in the masses of the people and why it was

necessary to have Political Secretaries. To bring

home to the public the policies of a particular

Ministry or a department, it was necessary to have

a Political Secretary. Well, a job like this, I

suggest with respect to the Minister, is something

which his Political Secretary might adequately do.

Who can say that he will not be able to accomplish

it thoroughly? But for a Minister to seek to take

on to himself a job which can be done more

efficiently and more adequately by his Political

Secretary - I do not think I can take this any

further, Sir,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>



except to say this, that the effect of the new

section 3A - I am prophesying this - will be to kill

the usefulness of the Malayan Board of Income Tax,

except in two aspects : these are two separate

functions where they are called upon to exempt

certain charities or pronounce on certain

institutions regarding whether any contribution to

those societies would be exempted from income tax.

Except in regard to those two matters, the Malayan

Board of Income Tax will cease to have any useful

purpose. If it is the intention of both the Gov

ernments to lay to rest the Malayan Board of

Income Tax, no appropriate section other than the

present one can be framed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we on this side of

the House are very accustomed to the prophecies of

the people who are members of the Singapore

People's Alliance. During the election campaign,

while perambulating around the Mountbatten area, I

remember I used to hear the Member for Mountbatten

screeching and begging all women of Singapore -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I was wondering how all this

"perambulating around Mountbatten" is relevant to

the clause we are debating.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Farrer Park was indulging in prophecies. It is my

duty to show thatall these prophecies come from

false prophets, in the sense that I have heard

this myself - that the Member for Mountbatten used

to screech and tell all the women of Singapore,

"For God's sake, think wisely before you vote. The

moment the P.A.P. is returned, you will all lose

your jewellery." We have seen her here, Mr

Speaker, Sir, every time -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I cannot see how that

statement is, in fact, relevant to this particular

clause. I do not know whether the Minister is now

thinking of laying his hands on jewellery. I

cannot see how relevant that is to this clause. I

think, perhaps, if there have to be prophecies,

they should be prophecies which are relevant to

the clause.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is one point

only that I want to deal with. I think the Member

for Farrer Park suggested just now that if it was

written into the law that the Minister may not

give directions which are inconsistent with the

rules that are made under this Ordinance, then he

would be satisfied. Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for Farrer Park has been a lawyer for very many

years, and he knows that anything which is

inconsistent with the provisions of an Ordinance,

even if it is the rules made under an Ordinance

which are at variance with the Ordinance, is ultra

vires. So that it will not be competent for the

Minister under the provisions of this clause to

make any directions which are in any way

inconsistent with any rules made by the Malayan

Board of Income

Tax, because if he gives directions which are at

variance with the rules made by the Malayan Board

of Income Tax, then that would be inconsistent

with the provisions of the Ordinance itself, Sir,

and the Member for Farrer Park very well knows

that that is the legal position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3-



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 22, to leave out "or on his

behalf".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of this amendment

is to bring out features in this particular new

section with which I do not agree. With the new

subsection (8), Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no

quarrel. But with regard to the new subsection

(9) , what it seeks to do is to give the

Comptroller this power:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;". . . the Comptroller may produce or cause to

be produced in any Court, in any proceedings

relating to income tax, a copy of any particulars...".



<br><br>Mark the phrase, Mr Speaker -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... a copy of any particulars contained in

any document or return transmitted to him by the

Comptroller of Income Tax, Federation of Malaya,

under the provisions of any law in force in the

Federation corresponding to the provisions of

subsection (8) of this section, certified by the

Comptroller or on his behalf to be a correct copy

of such particulars:".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take it that there will be corresponding

legislation in the Federation. If as a result of a

request made by the Comptroller here to the

Comptroller in the Federation, a letter is sent to

the Comptroller in Singapore setting out certain

particulars in the body of the letter, and if it

is necessary for those particulars to be produced

in Court, then all that would be necessary for the

Comptroller to do would be to extract the

particulars, type them on a piece of paper and

produce them in Court as evidence, and the Court

has to accept them without question, except under

the provison where it says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(a) the Comptroller may produce or cause to be

produced the original of any such document or

return in any case when it is necessary to prove

the handwriting or the

signature of the person who wrote, made, signed or

furnished such return or document,

but only for the purpose of such proof;".

<br><br>So that if the Court insists on knowing whether it

was the Comptroller who signed it, then that

letter or document will be produced only for the

purpose of proving that it was signed by the

Comptroller. So far as the copy of the particulars

is concerned, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is quite clear -

at least to my mind -  from this section that nobody

can inspect the original document which was

received by the Comptroller in Singapore with a

view to checking whether the typewritten copy

produced in Court is the same as the particulars

set out in the original document. That is as I

read it. If my reading of that section is

incorrect, Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall be glad to

hear of it. But I cannot understand why the

Comptroller cannot produce the original document

in Court. It is not a State secret. It is

something dealing with an individual taxpayer who

has perhaps been evading tax. The Comptroller in

the Federation has given the Comptroller in

Singapore certain information. On that information

certain Court proceedings ensue. Why all this

secrecy? Why cannot that document be produced in

Court? That is all I ask. Why go to this

subterfuge and say, "You shall, only produce the

original document to prove the signature, but not

the contents. Also you cannot inspect the contents

and you will have to be satisfied with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>



a copy of the particulars produced by the

Comptroller's Department purporting to be a copy."

And on such a serious matter as this, apparently

it could be certified by the Comptroller "or on

his behalf". The matter is so important in this

case that if you must have a copy, then at least I

think only the Comptroller should be allowed to

sign it and not by someone "on his behalf". If for

some reason or other - perhaps the Minister might

tell us - it becomes necessary to do this, then I

suggest that this should be exercised very

carefully, and the only person who should be

allowed to certify it should be the Comptroller

himself and not anybody on his behalf, because I

think it would not be right that in an important

matter such as this some officer in his Department

should certify it as correct when it might not be

correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would be glad for some information as to

the necessity for this new section to be drafted,

whereas in the normal course, under the Evidence

Ordinance, the production of the original document

would be obligatory.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, not being a

lawyer, I am not fully conversant with the details

of thee law of evidence, but it seems to me that

the Member for Farrer Park used rather strong

language when he referred to the provisions of

this section as amounting to subterfuge. Surely in

these matters where documentary evidence has to be

produced in Court the officials responsible can be

relied upon to act with integrity. There are

probably very strong reasons why the originals

could not be produced in Court. Let us not forget

that the two administrations are separate in the

sense that they are run by Governments with

separate

political identities, and it will therefore be a

very serious departure from normal practice for a

department of one Government to send the original

returns and documents belonging strictly to itself. This section tries to bring about a better

degree of co-ordination between the two

Governments in the two territories in regard to

proceedings in Court and I am quite satisfied that

the provisions go as far as possible under the

existing circumstances.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I add to what my

friend and colleague has said by drawing the

attention of the Member for Farrer Park to the

Evidence Ordinance which he knows quite well? All

official secrets are protected from disclosure in

the Courts and the permission of the Head of State

has to be obtained before any of that official in

formation can be disclosed in a court of law. The

Member for Farrer Park knows very well that

provision of the Evidence Ordinance. This

particular section refers to official information

that is passing from one Comptroller to another

about, say, tax evasion and all that sort of

thing. Under these provisions, the original

document can only be produced when there is a

doubt as to the authenticity of that document,

that is, when there is a question as to whether

that document is a bona fide document, and it is

necessary to establish the source of that

document. The question of handwriting arises and

that is why such a document can be produced in

Court when it is necessary to prove "the

handwriting or the signature of the person who

wrote, made, signed or furnished such return or

document, but only for the purpose of such proof".

The contents of that document are protected from

disclosure and it would be within the discretion

of the Comptroller to certify what particulars may

be disclosed. It is not necessary for him to

certify that himself. He could leave it also to an

official to do so on his behalf. That is all that

the section says. I can see no difficulty in that,

Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> With great respect to the Minister for

Labour and Law, I do not agree with him. I am

suggesting to him that it is necessary for the

Government to frame this section as it has been

framed, because of the simple reason that by

virtue of the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance

such a thing could not have happened. Because if

it is an official secret, if it is a document cov

ered by the Official Secrets Ordinance, then, of

course, it will be covered by it and it need not

be produced. This section, Mr Speaker, Sir, has

been framed in order to give protection to the

Comptroller where he does not otherwise have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



protection under the existing law. That is why

this section is necessary. Now to say that there

is already protection for such a document, and

then to suggest that the new section makes doubly

sure of that, we are providing this section to my

mind, if I may say so, that is absurd. This

section is intended to perform a specific

function. Without this section, the original

document would become producible in Court and no

body could then have said, "I heard from the

Comptroller in the Federation that such and such

is the position." That would be hearsay evidence

and that would not be admissible in Court. What

this section seeks to do is to get over the

hearsay rule by saying that the production of a

copy shall be admissible in Court. If it is a

document relevant to an official secret, it is

already protected under the existing law, and this

section is not necessary. This section only

becomes necessary because the particular document

sought to be put before the Court has not got the

protection of the Official Secrets Ordinance. That

is why this is necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance says, "Because it is a Federation Government letter - perhaps because of

some protocol or something like that - that document

is prevented from being produced in Court." Mr

Speaker, Sir, I am not an expert on those matters.

I am only a poor humble lawyer and I only know

what is evidence in Court and what is not evidence

in Court. When a man is being charged in Court, I

only know that the best evidence should be pro

duced against him when it is available. The

document is available and if a person who is being

charged by virtue of the information contained in

that evidence might be able to refute the charge,

then it is only fair that that document should be

produced in Court. Mr Speaker, Sir, even if the

Government say that it is because of protocol or

for some reason or other which they have not yet

explained that such a document cannot be produced

in Court, and only a copy of the particulars

contained in the document can be produced, they

have yet to answer my question: why is it

necessary for a mere official in the De-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



partment to sign on behalf of the Comptroller?

Why cannot the Comptroller sign it himself? I dare

say, Sir, that not more than three or four cases

would go to a Court in one year on a particular

document like this. Not only must justice be done,

but it must also be seen to be done. In a case

like this where the State is departing from the

normal accepted code of evidence, I think the

Government should try to see that all loose ends

are properly tied up and that there is no

possibility of any sort of error. What I am

seeking by this amendment is to give this power of

certification only to the Comptroller and not to

anybody else. Is that too much to ask?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a pity that we

have got to waste such a lot of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park knows the Evidence

Ordinance and it is there laid down very clearly

that all official documents relating to affairs of

State are prohibited from disclosure. Disclosure

can be made only when the permission of the Head

of State is sought and obtained. That is the

general principle. The hon. Member knows very well

that

these are official documents passing between the

Federation Comptroller and

the Singapore Comptroller relating to a man's

taxation. In these documents, there would be a lot

of official and secret information, and in

proceedings against any person for tax evasion,

only particulars which are relevant should be

disclosed. The Ordinance provides for that

disclosure. Only relevant particulars which are

certified by the Comptroller may be disclosed.

There might be circumstances when the Comptroller

cannot certify this himself. He may be away. The

matter is an urgent one and the Court wants the

production of the document. The relevant

particulars will be certified by an official on

behalf of the Comptroller. That is all that the

section provides for. The Member for Farrer Park

should look at proviso (b). It clearly says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"the Comptroller shall not in any case be

compelled to produce in any court either the

original of such document or return or a copy

of any particulars contained in such document

or return."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



What the Comptroller does is to provide a

certified copy of the relevant particulars. The

Court itself will have a look at the document.

When it is a question as to whether that document

really comes from the source to which it is

attributed, then only may the original be

produced. This is in conformity with old

established and well-known legal principles. We

are not in any way departing from those well-known

and established principles in the drafting of this

particular section.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I think the Minister for Labour and

Law has not understood me. I am not challenging

what he has said. What I have done is this. I have

addressed my arguments to this House under two

heads. It is difficult to understand why the

original document cannot be produced. If it cannot

be produced for some very good reason which the

Government may advance, then please tell the House

why the Comptroller himself cannot certify as

correct the copy to be produced in Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may well be that, on the first point,

they have answered that for reasons of protocol or

some other reason, the Federation Government might

object to its Comptroller's letter being produced

in our Courts. All right, I will accept that

argument. But what is the reply to my second

question which I put to the Government, that is,

why is it necessary for the letter to be certified

on his behalf? Why cannot the Comptroller do it

himself or his deputy?

<br><br>6.15 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when two

lawyers enter into an argument about the law, the

layman joins in at his own peril.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park asked two straight

questions. First, why cannot the original

documents be produced? I have explained at great

length that these are documents belonging to two

separate Governments. It is quite different if,

say, someone in England were charged in the City

of Manchester for tax evasion. The files then are

in the Inland Revenue Department in London. It is

a simple matter for the original documents to be

transmitted. But here there are two separate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>



Governments, two separate political entities, and

therefore it cannot be assured that in every

instance the administration in one territory is

willing to part with the original documents which

are most valuable records in its Income Tax

Department. That answers the first point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his second point - why the Comptroller

cannot certify these copies  - my answer is there is

no reason why he should not. There is nothing in

this Ordinance to say that the Comptroller must

not certify the correct copy. In the detailed work

of administration, surely some discretion must be

left to the Comptroller - whether he thinks the case

or the documents are important enough to warrant

his own signature or whether he can leave it to

his Deputy or his assistants. I have a feeling

that in regard to the second issue, the Member for

Farrer Park is not really raising any matter of

profound importance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, with due respect to the Minister

for Finance, I really think I am raising an issue

of fundamental importance in the administration of

justice, as I see it. I accept the Minister's

statement, Sir, that because of State reasons the

original documents cannot be produced. For the

purposes of my argument, I accept that. But the

law, as it is framed here means this: that if

that particular document contains certain particulars relevant in the prosecution of a tax

evader, then all that need be done

is for those particulars to be copied on to

another sheet of paper and certified by the

Comptroller or somebody on his behalf. Now, nobody

on the side of the evading taxpayer has an

opportunity to compare whether the particulars set

out on the copy are correct; whether the particulars are set out word for word; or whether

there has been any mistake. Nobody has the

opportunity to do that. Under normal conditions a

defendant or

an accused person has the opportunity of

inspecting the original and comparing it with the

copy to see that the copy is correct. In this

particular instance, he has not got the

opportunity. All I am asking the Minister is this: since the matter is of such fundamental

importance to the taxpayer, the person who

certifies it as

correct must be a very high official, or the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>

highest official in the Department, i.e. the

Comptroller himself. Because the Comptroller will

see that the copy which goes out under his hand

has been compared by him and he will himself

certify it as correct. Whereas under the new

subsection as it now stands, if anybody certifies

the copy for and on behalf of the Comptroller,

"XYZ (Signature illegible)", apparently it is

admissible in Court. That is not my idea of

justice.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

understand what we are quarreling about. The

definition of "Comptroller" in the Income Tax

Ordinance says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"Comptroller" means the Comptroller appointed

under section 5  of  this Ordinance and

includes, for all purposes of this Ordinance

except the exercise of the powers conferred

uponthe Comptroller by sections 95, 96 and 99 of

this Ordinance, a Senior Assistant Comptroller

or an Assistant Comptroller so appointed;".



<br><br>Therefore, it means that the Comptroller, or any

Senior Assistant Comptroller or Assistant

Comptroller on his behalf, can sign and certify

the documents.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does the Member for

Farrer Park seriously say here in this Assembly

that we are doing something foolish in allowing a

discretion to the Comptroller to nominate officers

to certify documents on his behalf? Does he

seriously say that the Comptroller would allow a

peon in his Department to certify such

particulars?

Is he seriously saying all that? Surely the

Comptroller is given discretion in this matter.

There must be somebody to certify these documents

when the Comptroller himself may not be here. He

may be away and there might be a real occasion

when the document must be produced to the Court,

and there must be somebody to certify that those

particulars

are a true and correct copy of the original

document. Now, it would be a responsible official

who will so certify. He would have to look at the

original document. He would have to look at the

typewritten document. He would have to compare

both documents, word for word. And only when he is

satisfied that it is a correct copy of the

particulars will he then certify. That is how the

business of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>

Government is carried on. I have not yet heard of,

say, a Head of Department leaving it to his peon

to certify such particulars - the whole contention

is absurd, Mr Speaker, Sir!

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am glad that the Minister for Law

says that the administration of a Department

should not be carried on in the silly manner which

he suggests. I might also say to him, with equal

respect, that the laws of a country should not

also be framed in such a way as to, lead to

fantastic results. What I am saying is that the

law, as it is framed here, might easily lead to

that, and yet be lawful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I am obliged to the Member for Redhill [sic]

for drawing the attention of the House to the

definition of "Comptroller" in section 2, which

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"Comptroller" means the Comptroller appointed

under section 5 of  this Ordinance and includes,

for all purposes of this Ordinance except the

exercise of the powers conferred uponthe

Comptroller by sections 95, 96 and 99 of this

Ordinance, a Senior Assistant Comptroller or an

Assistant Comptroller so appointed;"'.



<br><br>So, Mr Speaker, Sir, even under the definition of

"Comptroller", for purposes of sections 95, 96 and

99, only the Comptroller himself can exercise

those functions. So you see the law is not being

such an ass. It says, "for the purposes of section

95", and section 95 is a provision for penalty for

making incorrect returns. What I am suggesting, Mr Speaker, Sir, is: if the words in the new

subsection (9) did not have the words "or on his

behalf", then the effect of it would be that the

Comptroller could sign it, a Senior Assistant Com

ptroller could sign it, or an Assistant

Comptroller so appointed could sign it. What I am

asking the Government to accept is this: that the

power to sign

as correct a copy of such particulars should be

restricted to the Comptroller himself, a Senior

Assistant Comptroller or an Assistant Comptroller

so appointed. That would be the effect of the

amendment. Mr Speaker, Sir, the words "or on his

behalf" must be given a meaning. It must mean that

the Government intends that persons other than the

Comptroller, the Senior Assistant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>



Comptroller or an Assistant Comptroller so

appointed can be allowed to sign. That is why the

words "or on his behalf" appear. All I am asking

the Government to consider is this: is it not fair

in circumstances such as this, that only the

Comptroller as envisaged in the defining section

of the Income Tax Ordinance should be allowed to

certify?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid

I cannot quite follow the reasoning of the Member

for Farrer Park. He says his original objection

was to the effect that copies of documents and not

the originals are produced. Now, he is satisfied

that properly certified copies can be accepted as

evidence in Court, provided that the Comptroller

and not others certifies such copies. The Member

has quite lightly pointed out that in the

discharge of certain functions under the

Ordinance, powers are exercisable only by the

Comptroller and not by a Senior Assistant

Comptroller or an

Assistant Comptroller; in particular, he has cited

section 95. But surely there is a difference

between the duties under section 95, and also in

other sections which are only exercisable by the

Comptroller, and this particular business of

certifying a document.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In section 95 there is scope for the exercise of

discretion, namely, the composition of offences

committed under the section. In such

circumstances, I would agree that the Head of De

partment should exercise this power wholly. But in

the case of certification of copies, surely in a

Department with properly regulated rules,

certification by any of the Senior Officers

deputised by the Comptroller would be quite ade

quate. Honestly I cannot see what possible

objections the Member for Farrer Park has to this

section.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4-



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to have the assent of the House to move an

amendment to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



clause 4, under the provisions of Standing Order

32. I have discussed this particular amendment

with the Member for Farrer Park, and he has raised

no objection to it.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the Minister will indicate

what the amendment is.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The amendment is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 3, line 3, to leave out the word "or" and

insert the word "and".



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Standing Order 32 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Notice shall not be dispensed with in the case

of a motion or in respect of any other proceeding

for which notice is required except with the

consent of the Speaker and the general assent of

Members present."



<br><br>An amendment of this nature would require the

requisite two clear days' notice. I give my

consent. Is it the pleasure of hon. Members that

the amendment be moved?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 3, line 3, to leave out "or" and to

insert "and".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 deals with the question of income

arising from settlements. In this particular

subsection, it is stated that where a settlement

is made for the benefit of any relative of the

settlor who is unmarried or has not attained the

age of 21 years at the commencement of the year of

assessment, the income shall, on such settlement,

be deemed to be the income of the settlor and not

the income of any other person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the subsection now stands, there is a certain

amount of ambiguity, and it is not the intention

of the legislation to tax a settlement made to

relatives who are unmarried and have exceeded the

age of 21 years. As the subsection stands, it may

mean that an unmarried relative could not be

subject to tax-free settlements even though he or

she has exceeded the age of 21 years. And that is

not the intention of the Bill. Accordingly, I move

the amendment as stated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member wish to move a

further amendment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> No, Sir. I wish to speak on the

clause.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I first propose the Question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am sorry, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 4 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I inadvertently

omitted to give notice of certain amendments. Had

I been aware of the implications, I would

certainly have given notice of the amendments.

Sir, the matters which are exercising my mind are

new subsection (5) , and paragraph (a) to the

definition of "settlement" appearing in page 4,

line 40, and in page 5, Mr Speaker, Sir, new

subsection (7) (c).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point concerns subsection (5); the next

one is "settlement" in subsection (7) (a) and the

third is subsection (7) (c).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps this is an opportune moment for me

to reply to the Prime Minister when he was

accusing me and my ilk of doing the Government

down by advice. Sir, it has never been the conten

tion of any government that tax avoidance is

illegal. Tax avoidance is a perfectly legal thing.

It is a matter on which highly paid lawyers and

accountants are engaged. There is absolutely

nothing illegal about tax avoidance. It is tax eva

sion which is illegal, and no lawyer or accountant

worth his salt would advise his client to evade

tax which is lawfully due under the Ordinance to

the government. So when lawyers advise their

clients, it is on how to get round the Income Tax

Ordinance with a view to avoiding tax. That is

perfectly legal. I think even the Minister for

Finance will accept that. And settlements up till

now have been legal. They have been stamped.

Government is extracting stamp duty from them.

They have been registered in the Registry of

Deeds. They have been perfectly legal documents.

They have operated to take away from the Govern

ment certain tax. The Government now

think that that should not be so, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



they have therefore put in this clause 4 which

will bring in settlements for the purpose of

income tax. With that particular aspect of it, Mr

Speaker, Sir, I have no quarrel. It is with

subsection (5) which says this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If any question arises as to the amount of any

payment of income or as to any

apportionment of income under this section that

question shall be decided by the Comptroller,

whose decision thereon shall be final."



<br><br>In other words, what this subsection seeks to do

is to give the Comptroller power in respect of a

particular item of taxable income which he does

not have with regard to the other items of taxable

income, because every other taxable form of income

is a matter on which the taxpayer could go to

appeal, on the basis that the Comptroller was not

right, or that he has based his assessment on in

correct facts or figures. But apparently when it

comes to a settlement, any decision by the

Comptroller shall be final, and this, Mr Speaker,

Sir, is completely not in keeping with the other

provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance. That is

the first point, Mr Speaker, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the second point is subsection (7) (a)

regarding settlement

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"a settlement which in the opinion of the

Comptroller is made for valuable and adequate

consideration;".



<br><br>In other words, if the Comptroller says, "In my

opinion, this is made for valuable and adequate

consideration," that apparently is the last word

on the subject. There again there is no appeal to

the courts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then thirdly in subsection (7) (c), on page 5,

lines 11 and 12, are these words "in the opinion

of the Comptroller".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (7) (c) reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"any agreement made by an employer to pay to an

employee or to the widow or any relative or

dependant of such employee after his death such

remuneration or pension orlump sum as in the

opinion of the Comptroller is fair and

reasonable;".



<br><br>There again he has undisputed powers of saying

what is fair and reasonable, and that apparently

is the end of the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think these are matters which

should be treated similarly as other items of

taxable income



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>



are treated. I know it is too late, Mr Speaker,

to move my amendments, but

if the Government agrees, I understand there is a

procedure under the Standing

Orders whereby this can be rectified on

recommittal. I would urge upon the Government that

the words "in the opinion of the Comptroller"

should be omitted from "settlement" in subsection

(7) (a) and the words "in the opinion of the

Comptroller" should be omitted from subsection (7)

(c). I would also urge upon the Government that

subsection (5) should be amended in such a way as

to leave out the words "whose decision thereon

shall be final".

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, can we go on to

further clauses and come back to this one later?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Strictly, of course, under Standing

Order 71, paragraph (7):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A clause may be postponed, unless a decision has

already been taken upon an

amendment thereto. A postponed clause shall, in

the absence of an order to the contrary,

be considered after the remaining clauses of the

Bill have been considered and before new clauses

are brought up."



<br><br>But if the Minister moves that notwithstanding the

Standing Order this particular clause be

postponed, and that has the assent of the Members,

and there is no dissenting voice, then, of course,

it can be done. Perhaps the Minister would like to

move?

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That notwithstanding the Standing Order

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is an amendment in the name

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Clause 5 accordingly by general

agreement postponed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 6 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, there are two aspects of this

clause on which I wish to address

the House. The first one is contained in the new

section 67 (1) (b) which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (2)

of this section, every person carrying on or

exercising any trade, business, profession or

vocation -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) shall, if the gross receipts from such

trade, business, profession or vocation in

the preceding calendar year exceeded

eighteen thousand dollars from the sale of

goods, or twelve thousand dollars from the

performance of services, issue a printed

receipt serially numbered for every sum

received in respect of goods sold or

services performed in the course of or in

connection with such trade, business,

profession or vocation, and shall retain a

duplicate of every such receipt:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that where a machine is used for

recording sales a receipt may be dispensed

with if the Comptroller is satisfied that -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) such machine automatically records all

sales made; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the total of all sales made in each day is

transferred at the end of such day to a

record of sales."



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, under the new section 67 (3) of clause 6 of

the Bill, it appears that the Comptroller is to be

given powers to waive all or any of the provisions

of subsection (1) of this section in respect of

any person or records or any class or description

of persons or records.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister himself in his speech on the Second Reading of the Bill has denoted "class" as meaning

persons who would be exempted from it, unless the

Comptroller calls upon them to comply with the

provisions of the proposed section 67 (1) (b). How

the department is going to administer section 67

(1) (b), Mr Speaker, Sir, I am at a loss to under

stand. $18,000 a year in the sale of goods merely

means that if there is a turnover of $50 a day,

then that person comes within the ambit of the

proposed section



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>



67 (1) (b). To take an instance of a coffee shop.

All coffee shops carry on under eating-house

licences. I understand there are well over a

thousand of such coffee shops carrying on under

eating-house licences. The coffee shop proprietor,

I am told, runs his own business. He sells coffee,

tea, Postum, Ovaltine, aerated water and

cigarettes. As part of the establishment, there

are a number of hawkers who sell their individual

wares inside the shop under and by virtue of the

eating-house licence. Is it the intention of

Government that all such hawkers who sell within

coffee shops should issue receipts? Because,

technically speaking, they are all selling under a

licence issued to the proprietor of the coffee

shop. Are all the sales arising from the sale of

food in that coffee shop to be credited to the

coffee shop owner, or will they be credited to

each of the hawkers who is plying his wares in the

coffee shop?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Minister has said that certain

categories of persons would be exempted, I find

that once this section has been enacted, then all

persons whose sales come to $18,000 and over would

be brought within its ambit, and it would be very

difficult for the Comptroller to make specific

exemptions in certain cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, Mr Speaker, Sir, is the

proposed 67 (2) which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Comptroller may by notice in writing to any

person carrying on or exercising any trade,

business, profession or vocation, or by a notice

in the Gazette in respect of any class or

description of any such person, prescribe -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the form of the records to be kept under the

provisions of paragraph (a) of subsection

(1) of this section, and the manner in which

such records shall be kept and retained; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the form of the receipts to be issued and

the duplicates to be retained under the

provisions of paragraph (b) of subsection (1)

of this section, and the manner in which such

receipts shall be issued and such duplicates

shall be retained,



<br><br>and every such person shall be bound to comply

with such notice.".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was wondering, Mr Speaker, Sir, whether this

function of keeping adequate records should not be

left to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



Board of Income Tax to prescribe rather than to

the Comptroller in the Federation or here, and

whether it could be more adequately dealt with by

the Board of Income Tax rather than the

Comptrollers in the two territories.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

quite clear what was the purpose of the last

incursion of the Member for Farrer Park into the

deliberations of this Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think he will argue against the

necessity for businesses to account properly for

their receipts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did raise one or two questions, namely, in the

case of a coffee shop, whether the separate stalls

that operate on the premises would be lumped to

gether as one business, or whether they would be

considered separately; and, of course, the answer

is that they would be considered separate units.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for passing on the authority of deciding how

the provisions of this clause should be

administered to the Malayan Board of Income Tax,

may I say that a pan-Malayan Board of this nature

cannot meet often enough and long enough and go

into sufficient detail to give directives that

will be needed? I have already explained the pur

pose of this clause and the manner in which it is

intended that its provisions should be

administered. It is my belief that eventually we

hope to arrive at a system whereby all businesses

keep proper accounts of their receipts and sales

regardless of whether they are large or small. But

we are very far from achieving this position. In

the meantime, the purpose is to concentrate on

those businesses from which we are likely to get

some form of return by way of income tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of automatic exemption, I

did explain in my speech on the Second Reading

that it is necessary, for obvious reasons, to have

similar legislation in the two territories. The

fact that personal reliefs are much lower in the

Federation would mean that it is desirable to have

a fairly low form of limit of exemption in the two

Ordinances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 8 stand part of

the Bill."

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the intention of

this amendment is to extend the field of

limitation within which the Comptroller can take

action from 6 to 12 years. In so far as fraud or

deliberate evasion of income tax is concerned,

there is no time limit and the Comptroller can

take action at any time if a fraud is discovered.

It would appear, Mr

Speaker, Sir, that where an honest mistake has

been made either by the Comptroller or by the

taxpayer, it is intended that the mistake should

remain hanging over the taxpayer for a period of

12 years, and not 6 years as it is now. Where the

mistake has happened on the part of the

Comptroller, I find it difficult to see why he

should be given a further six years in which to

rectify his error and charge the taxpayer with the

tax that he had failed to tax him with in the

first instance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point which arises out of his

amendment, Sir, is that this would mean that every

business, which keeps accounts up to six years

now, would be obliged to keep them for 12 years,

because if anything does occur after the 7th or

8th year, the Comptroller is not going to listen

to the statement, "Well, I thought six years was

the limitation period and I have destroyed my

books." It means an additional burden on the

preservation of records for the purposes of income

tax. I do not know why it is

necessary to fix it at 12 years. I would have

thought, Mr Speaker, Sir, that if a mistake is to

be discovered, it would have been discovered

within the 6 years. Beyond the 6th year and within

the 12th year I do not know what possible fresh

evidence could be brought up, except what the

Minister himself said in his speech on the Second

Reading, that because the tax office had not been

sufficiently geared to its work, the assessment

and collection of taxes had not been carried out

in the way that it should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>



have been. So it seems to me that the real reason

why 6 years is being amended to 12 years is that

the tax department has not been sufficiently

geared to do the job. Mr Speaker, Sir, I doubt

very much whether that is a sufficient reason to

extend it from 6 to 12 years.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have dwelt

at length in my speech on the Second Reading on

the reasons for this amendment and I have very

little to add to it. I do, however, wish to remind

the Member for Farrer Park that the Income Tax

Department is a comparatively new department and

that the work of income tax investigation is a

highly skilled one. The Department was no more

than 4 or 5 years old when the Korean War boom

broke out during which time enormous fortunes were

made and never properly recorded. The work of

investigation takes many years to complete. In a

young department such as the Income Tax Department

was then, it is quite natural - it is, in fact, to

be expected - that they could not possibly cope with

the problems an the scale which developed during

those years. It is not for me to apologise for

anybody, because during that time the reins of

government were not in our hands. But we intend to

strengthen the Investigation Unit of the

Department. Steps are being taken to have the

officers trained abroad, and when they develop

sufficiently powerful muscles, there will be

victims for them to operate on.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, there is no magic in

either 6 or 12. I venture a

guess that it was 6 in the first instance, because

it followed the British Limitation Act, 1939. If

the Member for Farrer Park was sufficiently

interested to know what the Government of the

Federation thought of the matter, he would have

found that they were in favour of keeping things

open till eternity. It was because we have, as our

Minister for Labour and Law, a man trained in the

jurisprudential principle that theoretically there

should be finality in the affairs of man that we

have left it at 12 years.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park begins with the

assumption that the Income Tax Department consists

of a lot of perverse types who would go out of

their way to give offence and cause mischief

amongst a lot of innocent tax-paying citizens. Of

course, he knows very well that that is not the

case. The Income Tax Department consists of

officials who are extremely sensitive to charges

of undue harassing of the public. The only people

likely to be harassed are those who have not paid

their taxes according to what they should have

done. Far from their being unable to produce

records on the basis that they did not know that 6

years was not the end of all things, I think the

problem would be not just the production of

records, but the credibility of the records. I ven

ture to hazard the guess that the people who are

likely to be affected by this clause, and for whom

Members of the Opposition are expressing such

grave concern, would not be worth the special

treatment which they hope would be afforded them

by our leaving it at 6 years. The Income Tax

Department should find out a mistake immediately

after it has been made. If the people concerned

are good, honest tax-paying citizens like myself,

they would point out to the Income Tax Department

that they made a mistake the moment the letter

arrived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I am not saying that the

officials in the Income Tax Department are a lot

of ogres and goblins. I have met some very nice

people in the Income Tax Department, and they are

quite human chaps who completely sympathise with

you but yet extract your teeth. That is their job.

Of course, they have to extract teeth just like a

dentist does, but although the extraction is

painful, one does not say that they

are inhuman. They are quite human chaps. They

sympathise with you while it pains you, but they

get on with their job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further point arises on this amendment, Mr

Speaker, Sir. Under the existing Ordinance, six

years being the period



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



of limitation, some assessments have been barred

by limitation from being further reopened. Is it

the intention of this particular clause to reopen

all the assessments which are now barred by law?

If the Minister for Labour and Law will remember,

he went to some pains to explain to the House,

when he was moving the Limitation Bill - Mr

Speaker, you may remember too - that everything that

had been put an end to

by limitation at the time when the Bill was being

moved would not be revived by the new Limitation

Ordinance. So might I ask the Minister for Finance

whether such solicitude also is in his mind in so

far as taxpayers are concerned?

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The brief answer is that we

have every intention of reopening the cases and

charging tax to the hilt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 9 stand part of

the Bill."

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It appears to me that perhaps

clauses 9 and 10 could be taken together.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir. I was going to

ask you whether clauses 9 and 10 could be taken

together.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The debate could range over clause

10.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, this is a provision which says

that if you want to appeal,

you must first pay the tax before you appeal. I

suppose there is something to be said for that.

But there is also the other point of view which I

should like to put to the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of a recent case where the income tax

officials - with a smile on their faces no doubt -

assessed a particular gentleman in the "small" sum

of $1.8 million or thereabouts. He took a serious

view of this matter and he appealed. But that was

in the good days before the amendment came into

force.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>



So naturally the payment of tax was stopped. But,

of course, the Comptroller could have gone to the

Board of Review and got sufficient security.

Whether he did that or not I do not know. But the

point of my story, Mr Speaker, Sir, is this :

that after eight days of hearing the appeal,

apparently the Board of Income Tax reduced his tax

by a "paltry" sum of $1 million! If that

particular case had come up after this Bill had

been brought into force, he would have had to pay

his $1.8 million which he might not have been able

to pay, and therefore he would have been deprived

of an appeal. It is not for me to say what would

be the consequences which would ensue

thereafter. Whether he would have to face the

bankruptcy court and whether the judge would be

sympathetic to him, it is not for me to say. It is

purely hypothetical. The Minister for Finance has

said that there are $30 million outstanding today

in the way of taxes in respect of which appeals

have been lodged. May, I, with respect, suggest to

him that the reason for the difficulties which he

is facing is because his Department is not

sufficiently geared to proceed with these appeals

expeditiously? It should be possible, Sir, for

these appeals to be proceeded with expeditiously.

What I cannot understand is why the cases take

years and years before they are brought up for

final hearing before the Board of Review. In a

normal civil suit, after filing a complaint, you

get the case

heard. The difficulties before the Board of Review

are not the same as those

before the civil court. There are no pleadings.

Things are clear-cut. They

should be clear-cut - at least it seems to me. The

issues have already been

determined in the mind of the Comptroller and he

should be ready to go to the Board of Review quite

quickly after disagreement between the taxpayer

and himself. But for some reason or other,

apparently that cannot happen. This clause, as it

is framed, Mr Speaker, Sir, might cause hardship

in genuine cases. Could not this clause be so

framed that, in the case of a frivolous appeal,

the Board could be given sufficient power to

penalise such an ap



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>



peal? Or where there is an appeal and the

Comptroller's decision is upheld, then the

taxpayer could be called upon to pay the rate of

interest from the date of raising the taxation up

to the date of appeal? As the Minister has said,

if that money had been invested at eight per cent

interest, it might have yielded so much. So why

not do something like that? Although the intention

of the Government is to rake in the money, I think

it must also accept the position that in a number

of cases hardship could be created. I am

suggesting to the Government that they could

alleviate that hardship and yet maintain their

income by charging a heavy rate of interest which

the Board would be allowed to charge in case the

decision of the Comptroller is upheld.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member for Farrer Park is

aware that there is a fundamental principle in

matters other than imprisonment, that no party

should, by the lodging of an appeal, prevent any

award or order that was made from being executed

against him. The only exception is where a person

is to be imprisoned. Because it is not likely that

he will abscond where he can put up sufficient

surety that he would be present

for the bearing of his appeal, he is then let out

on bail. On principle, there is no reason why a

party should have an order or an award that has

been made against him postponed just by the lodging of an appeal. There is provision here,

provided the Comptroller in his discretion

considers that it is a valid point upon which

there could be some doubt - an honest bona fide

difference of opinion on assessment - to extend the

time limit for the payment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion put forward by the Member for

Farrer Park is impracticable. There is no

appellate court which has the right to punish a

frivolous appeal as distinct from a non-frivolous

appeal. You will then not only have to decide the

rights and wrongs of a particular case, but you

will also have to decide whether it was frivolous

or otherwise to have appealed. The only form of

punishment that can be exacted from

the appellant is to make him pay the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>



cost. As has been explained by the Member for

Redhill, the business of a lawyer is to stall. The

longer he stalls, the more interest capital earns,

either in business, industry, stocks and shares or

in general speculation. It is worth the

speculator's while to pay his lawyer, pay such

costs as are awarded against him, pay even the

interest if it is a moderate six per cent per

annum - because, according to the pawnbrokers, one

can get 10.9 per cent interest per annum by

investing with them - and still have something to

show for it. All reasonable appeals will be

allowed. If the gentleman in question has a $1 mil

lion estate, and it is an honest bona fide case, I

am certain that he would receive due consideration

from the Comptroller of Income Tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this passionate plea as to why there are no

quick trials is, in my humble submission, a lot of

histrionics. As all members of the Bar know, there

are no quick appeals, because the appellant is not

very anxious for a quick appeal.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to mention to the

Prime Minister that the constituency of the Member

referred to is not Redhill but Bukit Merah.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I myself made the same mistake in

respect of the same person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister accuses me, of histrionics. Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not capable of histrionics.

I think the Prime Minister is capable of it. He

himself is indulging in a little bit of

histrionics to get over the issues, which I have

raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He throws a red herring across the trail

by saying that once a judicial order is made, and

then it has to be carried out. Of course, Sir, I

accept it. But this is not a judicial order. This

is just a statement by an official saying, "You

owe me so much." It is just a matter of opinion

Mr Speaker, at that stage. The taxpayer thinks he

owes so much. The Comptroller thinks the taxpayer

owes so much. In the eyes of the law, it is a

matter of opinion. The Comptroller thinks this and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



The taxpayer thinks that. But it ceases to, become

a matter of opinion when a judicial body has

pronounced upon it. Being called upon to pay on

the opinion of the Comptroller should not penalize

all I am saying is that at the stage when it is a

matter of opinion the taxpayer. If the opinion of

the Comptroller is right and the State has been

deprived

of the use of that money for a year or two, then,

of course, the taxpayer should be called upon to

pay a proper rate of interest on that money,

thereby preventing any abuse of the processes of

the Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister says that the appellant should prosecute the appeal. Mr Speaker, Sir, can the

Comptroller not prosecute the appeal? There is

nothing in the Ordinance to prevent him from doing

that. In fact, I should think that as the

Government are at the losing end, they would

prosecute the appeal and not let the initiative

lie in the hands of the taxpayer. Naturally, if

the initiative were left in the hands of the

taxpayer, he would dodge. Why should he not? He

would not be sensible if he did not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I was careful to use the word

"award". I never said that

it must be an order of the Court before something

has to be executed. I said any award by any

arbitrator or any party. And I said in this case,

by the Comptroller of Income Tax. From the very

fact that there is no finality until the Court of

Appeal has sat in judgment on a particular issue,

it does not mean that an award then existing

should not be executed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Comptroller prosecuting the appeal, I

think it is a well-known

practice at the Bar that, as between friends, as

between brother advocates, as

between the Comptroller of Income Tax and

advocates where they are reasonably

polite to one another, a little amount of leeway

is usually given. Such leeway can

extend to six months, one year, or 18 months. All

we are saying now is, "By

all means let us do things in a civilized and

leisurely manner. But let us have the

money down first."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, if the money is put down

first and if, in an appeal where $1½ million is

involved the Board of Review cuts it down by $1

million, would the Prime Minister agree to give to

the taxpayer a return of eight per cent per annum

on the money deposited with the Government and

which it has used for two years?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think the Member for Farrer

Park is fully conversant with the principle that

the Crown never pays costs in these matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this amendment is that at the time

that this Bill would have gone through much

earlier than it actually did. It is,

therefore, necessary to extend the date by which

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17-



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 11, line 26, after "who", to insert

"wilfully".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of this amendment

is to penalise only the person

who had intent wilfully and deliberately to

defraud the Department when making an incorrect

return. As the proposed section is worded, it says

this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"95.-(1) Subject to the provisions of PartXII of

this Ordinance, every person who -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) makes an incorrect return by omitting there

from or understating therein any income of which

he is required by this Ordinance to make a return;

[etc.]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall pay a penalty equal to the amount of

tax which has been undercharged in consequence of

such incorrect return or information, or which

would have been so undercharged if the return or

information had been accented as correct."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the incorrect return might have

been an honest mistake. The intention of this

section, as framed, is to catch anybody who "makes

an incorrect return". Now, he might have forgotten

it, or he might have thought that it was not

income within the meaning of the Ordinance and

therefore omitted to state it in his return,

without any wilful intent to defraud the

Government, or any deceit or fraud on his part. Is

it the intention of the Government to extract a

penalty equal to the amount of tax which has been

undercharged in consequence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>



of such incorrect return, and on top of that also

to extract that amount which

he would have had to pay had the correct return

been submitted?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Government probably means in this

proposed new section is to penalise the person who

deliberately does this with a view to cheating the

Government. If the word "wilfully" is inserted, it

will look after that situation, and anybody who

innocently makes an incorrect return because of

forgetfulness or a mistaken view of the

interpretation of the Ordinance would not get into

trouble with this particular section.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid

I cannot agree to the proposed amendment for two

reasons. First, it will be the hardest thing in

the world to prove that any act is done with a

wilful intention. When it has been

pointed out to any taxpayer that such an omission

has been made, it is all too

easy for him to say that he had forgotten, or that

he had made an oversight. Let us always remember

that the filling of an income tax return is not an

under

taking lightly to be embarked upon. It is a

discharge of a very serious social

duty which the individual owes to society. If in

the course of discharging such a duty, and through

carelessness he fails to make a correct return (as

a result of which revenue suffers), then I think

it is very just and proper that a penalty should

be imposed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This particular section distinguishes between the

making of incorrect returns with reasonable

excuse. The other offence where a person cannot

provide any reasonable excuse comes under

subsection (2) of section 95, and the penalties

are correspondingly heavier.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if that is the

intention of the Government, I must say it is very

serious and very drastic. I believe this is one of

the occasions where an honest mistake results in a

penalty being imposed on the citizen. I am sure

there must be cases where even the Comptroller

will admit that honest mistakes are made. Is it

the intention that such a person should be penal

ised because there are no two ways about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



it? There is even no discretion in the hands of

the Comptroller to waive the

penalty, "subject to the provisions of Part XII of

this Ordinance". Part XII is the Appeals section:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"95.-(1) ... every person who -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) makes an incorrect return by omitting

therefrom or understating therein any income

of which he is required by this Ordinance to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall pay a penalty equal to

the amount of tax which has been

undercharged in consequence of such

incorrect return or information, or which

would have been so undercharged if the

return or information had been accepted as

correct."



<br><br>The Comptroller must exact it; no discretion is

given to him. I am afraid it

is a very -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Subsection (3).



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Compounding.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Compounding, as I understand it, only

relates to:



<br><br>"any offence punishable under subsection (1) or

(2) of this section, and may before judgment stay

or compound any proceedings thereunder."



<br><br>There are no proceedings envisaged under

subsection (1), Sir, under which no offence

occurs. An offence only occurs where:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(2) Every person who without reasonable excuse

or through negligence -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) makes an incorrect return by omitting or

understating any income of which he is

required by this Ordinance to make a return;

or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) gives any incorrect information in relation

to any matter affecting his own liability to

tax or the liability of any other person or

of a partnership,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be guilty of an

offence ...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (2), Sir, is identical with subsection

(1) in so far as paragraphs (a) and (b) are

concerned. But under subsection (2) "who without

reasonable excuse or through negligence" does it,

then he is guilty of an offence which

the Comptroller may compound. As under subsection

(1), no offence is committed, and I do not see how

the Comptroller can compound something in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>



respect of which there is no offence. It would

appear to me, Sir, that as the proposed section

now stands, it is a statutory obligation on the

part of the Comptroller to extract the penalty on

top of the tax so lost.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the distinction is

drawn between the honest type of mistake which the

Member for Farrer Park has spoken about, and the

deliberate evasion where an offence has been

committed without reasonable excuse or through

negligence. In the first case, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

do not see why, if he has made a mistake and has

been undercharged because of that mistake, he

should not be made to pay when he is found out. He

should be made to pay. Why should he be in a

better position than the man who does not make a

mistake and pays the income tax that is due? He

should be in no better position than that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, where it can be proved that the

failure to pay was without reasonable excuse or

through negligence, there are additional penalties

prescribed. The person concerned can be required

to pay double the amount that he has been

undercharged, and where it is serious enough he

can be fined or imprisoned in default. Of course,

the Comptroller has the power in both cases to

compound.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps I ought to point out to the

Minister that subsection  (3) as it now reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Comptroller may compound any offence

punishable under subsection (1) or (2) of this

section, and may before judgment stay or compound

any proceedings there

under."



<br><br>would appear, on the face of it, to be nonsense in

regard to subsection (1), because under subsection

(1) there is no provision that the action done

becomes an offence. I am just wondering whether

the words have not been inadvertently left out -

after "shall" in line 36, to insert, "be guilty of

an offence for which on conviction he shall".

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Yes, that appears to be so.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That would cover the point made by

the Member for Farrer Park. If the Minister will

then beg leave to move that amendment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg leave to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 11, line 36, after "shall", to insert "be

guilty of an offence for which on conviction he

shall".

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it the pleasure of hon. Members

that that amendment be moved?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Minister then move

formally?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 11, line 36, after "shall", to insert "be

guilty of an offence for which on conviction he

shall".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are back now to the original

amendment. I do not know

whether the Member for Farrer Park would like to

pursue his amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> As far as I am concerned, I still

think that to penalise a man for an

honest mistake which he did not know he had made

is contrary to every principle that I know of,

Sir, and I should certainly object to that. There

might be a difference of views about the interpre

tation of the word "income"; and the law says he

shall be guilty of an offence. I admit this

particular amendment does now give the Comptroller

a discretion whereby he could waive the whole of

the penalty if he so desires, and he probably will

do that with a smile. In view of that, may I have

leave to withdraw the amendment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 11, line 42, to leave out "or through

negligence".



<br><br>So that the clause would then read -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(2) Every person who without reasonable excuse -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) makes an incorrect return . . .".

<br><br>Sir, I am wondering whether "or through

negligence" takes the case any further than

"without reasonable excuse". Is the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>

suggestion that sometimes "without reasonable

excuse" may not connote the idea of negligence? I

would have thought that the phrase "without

reasonable excuse" takes in negligence too.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Has the Member anything further to

say?

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> No, Sir, I was just going to say that

the present section 95 (1) reads: "Every person

who without reasonable excuse . . .". But the

proposed section 95 (1) has, in addition to those

words, a new set of words - "or through negligence".

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the first thing that

occurs to my mind is that a person might have an

excuse, but it may not be a reasonable excuse. The

next thing, Mr Speaker, Sir, is negligence. If

you cannot get him on the first, you get him on

the second.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Bock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

proposed section 95 (1) is meant to cover

negligence. When a taxpayer neglects to insert or

to give a correct return, he is punished with only

one fine. If he does a thing without a reasonable

excuse, he is punished twice.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, where it is an

honest mistake, whether it is an honest omission,

it still comes under the provisions of the new

section 95 (1). But where he is at fault, he is

dealt with under the provisions of section 95 (2).

There is a distinction between the two

subsections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17, as amended, ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18-

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not remember the Member for

Farrer Park giving notice that he wished to speak

on clause 18.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 19 and 20 ordered to stand part of the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 21 stand part of

the Bill."

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> On a point of information. Is it the

intention of the Government,

by virtue of this clause, to produce in Court as

evidence against the person,

statements which he has made to the, Comptroller,

and with those statements

to secure a conviction against him? It could well

be that the Comptroller or

somebody in his office could make certain promises

to him. As a result of those

promises, Certain statements might be made;

certain documents might be written. Is it the

intention that those statements and those

documents which have been extracted under promise

would be admissible in Court, and that such state

ments or documents could be used to secure a

conviction against that person under this

Ordinance? It appears

to me that if that is the purpose of this new

section then Government believes that to catch a

skunk, Government has to use skunky methods!

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That is indeed the purpose of

this clause, Mr Speaker, Sir, and I see nothing

wrong with it. In principle, this follows a

similar provision in the U.K. legislation, section

34 of the Finance Act, 1942. I may perhaps be

permitted to quote a reply to a question asked in

the House of Commons on the 5th of October, 1944,

as to the present practice of the Commissioners of

Inland Revenue in regard to instituting criminal

proceedings for alleged fraud under revenue. Sir

John Anderson stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The practice of the Commissioners in this matter

is governed by section 34 of the

Finance Act, 1942, which makes provisionfor the

admissibility in evidence of any disclosure made

in the circumstances there set out. This section

indicates that the Commissioners have a general

power under which they can accept pecuniary

settlements instead

of instituting criminal proceedings in respectof

fraud or wilful default alleged to have been

committed by a taxpayer. They can, however, give

no undertaking to the taxpayer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



that in any such case they will accept such a

settlement or refrain from instituting criminal

lproceedings, even if the case is one in which the

taxpayer has made a full confession andis given

full facilities for investigating the facts. They

reserve to themselves completediscretion in all

cases as to the course which they will pursue. But

it is the practice to beinfluenced by the fact

that the taxpayer has made a full confession and

is given fullfacilities for investigation into his

affairs and for examination of such books, papers,

documents or information as the Commissioners

may consider necessary."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Postponed clauses. Clause 4. Dr

Goh.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for Farrer Park raised the point as to the

propriety of the proposed subsection (5) of the

new section 33A and certain paragraphs of subsec

tion (7). Perhaps I may be permitted to explain

the purpose of these subsections and how they will

operate in actual practice. If after the passage

of this Bill

which taxes income from certain types of

settlements, we get a situation where the settlor

says that the income is apportioned in another

way, then the Comptroller has the authority to

decide what was the amount of payment of income

and what was the apportionment of income between

the beneficiaries. It is easy to imagine that

where you have, for instance, a settlement in

favour of, let us say, two relatives, A under 20

years of age and B aged 40. It might have been a

certain proportion right now. But after

the passing of the Bill, the proportion could

quite easily be reversed in favour of B who is

above the income limit, thereby avoiding tax in

this manner. In such instances, the Comptroller's

opinion on what the apportionment would be, would

be final, but not as regards the, quantum of the

income nor the amount of tax payable thereon. In

these matters, they can still be the subject of

appeal to the Board of Review. It is necessary to

give the Comptroller such powers in order to

arrive at some finality in these matters.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as regards subsection (7) (a) and (7) (c),

here again the Comptroller will have the authority

to decide whether or not, in respect of

settlements for which consideration has been given

such consideration is adequate, fair or

reasonable. These two subsections will give the

Comptroller the power to decide whether or not a

settlement would come within the provisions of

clause 4. But whatever assessment the Comptroller

makes under this clause can be subject to appeal

to the Board of Review. There are therefore

adequate safeguards in this respect.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, in respect of subsection (5), I

understood the Minister for Finance to mean that

the finality, so far as the Comptroller is

concerned, is in connection with the apportionment

of income arrived at under the settlement between

the various beneficiaries. But my reading of

subsection (5) seems to take it further:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If any question arises as to the amount of any

payment of income or as to any apportionment of

income under this section that question shall be

decided by the Comptroller,...".



<br><br>So that the decision of the Comptroller relates to

two things, Mr Speaker - any income under the

settlement, and any apportionment of income under

this subsection. So the explanation given by the

Minister, to my mind, Sir, only touches upon the

second limb of the subsection and not upon the

first limb.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to a settlement which, in the opinion

of the Comptroller, is made for valuable and

adequate consideration, the Minister said that the

total assessment under the particular section in

the Ordinance would go to the Board of Review if

the taxpayer so desires. But what I was worried

about, Sir, is whether on this particular matter

the taxpayer could appeal against the decision of

the Comptroller. If the Comptroller says that it

is made for valuable and adequate consideration,

apparently then it is not a settlement. Now, if he

makes a ruling on a particular settlement that is,

made for valuable and adequate consideration, does

it then mean that that particular ruling cannot be

challenged? Or does



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



the Minister say that if the whole of the

assessment can be challenged, then his ruling

indirectly is a matter for the Board of Review?

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> My understanding of the

position is that the whole assessment can be

brought before the Board of Review. As regards

subsection (5), if there is any apportionment of

income under a settlement, that would surely cover

the payment of income from that settlement. But

that does not prevent an appeal being lodged on

the total

quantum of income as distinct from amounts payable

under the scheme of distribution as stated by the

settlor.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, may I phrase my question in a

different way? Suppose there are nine items of

income on which the taxpayer is called upon by the

Comptroller to pay tax, and the ninth item is

under subsection (5). So far as the other eight

items are concerned, the taxpayer is in happy

agreement with the Comptroller. The only item

which he is disputing with the Comptroller is item

number 9 which is covered by subsection (5). Would

the Minister say that in the circumstances which I

have now set out, the taxpayer would be at liberty

to take the Comptroller on appeal to the Board?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The opinion of the Comptroller

is final as regards the apportionment of income

between different beneficiaries for the reasons

which I have explained. But as regards the quantum

of the total income arising from the settlement,

that is a case where an appeal could be made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It may be that if the Comptroller

decides that the apportionment should go in a

certain way, then the rate of taxation might

increase. If he decides that it should go another

way, then it could well be that the rate of tax

ation might decrease. In those circumstances,

having agreed to the other eight items, and where

the decision of the Comptroller is against the

taxpayer in the sense that it is putting up his

rate of assessment, would the taxpayer then be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>



able to go to appeal? The substance of the appeal

would be that the taxpayer

contends that the Comptroller has made a wrong

decision under subsection (5);

or would the fact that the Comptroller's decision

is final be looked upon by the

Board as a matter which they cannot reopen?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The position, Mr Speaker,

Sir, as I have said before,

is that there can be no dispute as to how the

income from a settlement is distributed among the

beneficiaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5-

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 5, line 27, to leave out "The

Comptroller" and insert "Where the Comptroller

considers it necessary in the execution of his

duties under this Ordinance he".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment was reached in agreement at a

meeting between representatives of the Singapore

Government and the Federation Government. We

reached this position as a result of fears which

were expressed that the powers which the

Comptroller has under this clause would be

improperly used, so it is specifically stated that

these powers would be exercised only when the

Comptroller considers it necessary in the

execution of his duties.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, it seems to me that this

amendment does not take it very much further than

the existing section. I do not know what

discussions the Hon. Minister had in Kuala Lumpur,

but I venture to suggest that this does not take

it very much further. In fact, from the taxpayers'

point of view, it makes it worse -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Muter: How can it be?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> In a moment I intend to show to the

Prime Minister, the Minister for Law, and the

Finance Minister that it makes it worse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Comptroller shall at all times have full and

free access to all lands, buildings

and places, ...".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, that section, as it stands,

means that the Comptroller can not willy filly

enter the premises. If he is challenged in Court,

the Comptroller will have to show that it was in

the due execution of his duties under the Ordin

ance that he so entered the premises. The mere

statement by him, "I considered it to be in the

best interests of the Ordinance to do it," will

not do, Mr Speaker. But in the case of the

proposed amendment, all it says is



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where the Comptroller considers it necessary ...".



<br><br>Under the proposed amendment, all that the

Comptroller has to say is, "I considered it

necessary to do that." Once the Comptroller makes

that statement, probably the Courts will be shut

out. It is the eternal argument, Mr Speaker, Sir,

that we are having in this House - "where an

official considers it necessary", "where in his

opinion", "he thinks". All these phrases are

intended to shut out the jurisdiction of the

Courts.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this

amendment was considered because there are people

who have not had the advantage of the legal

training and the ability of the Member for Farrer

Park to enter into metaphysical disputations. If

the Member for Farrer Park, as a result of his

profound understanding of the law, considers that

this has not brought matters any further, then I

am prepared to defer to his opinion. Nevertheless,

less sophisticated people would feel assured by

this amendment which is an expression of

Government's intention that these powers shall be

exercised properly and responsibly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I was aghast, Sir, when I

heard the Member for Farrer Park, purely for the

sake of argument, contend that not only in his

opinion does it not take the matter further, but

that, in fact, it enlarges the powers of the

Government and the Comptroller.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if that were

indeed the effect of the amendment, then let me

say that we would be very happy indeed. But as I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



read it, Sir, it is a limitation. An official,

acting bona fide, must satisfy himself that it is

necessary so to enter, in the execution of such

powers as are vested in him in the public

interest, or in the execution of his duties.

Whereas if there were no such limitation, then he

would enter willy nilly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of illustration, may I say this? Supposing

we send a scout to enter a territory. I should

like to believe that if the new section 65B stands

as it is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Comptroller shall at all times have full

and free access ... ".

<br><br>it means what it says. Words are given a natural

meaning. If you travel by aeroplane, then you go

right in and take all the consequences. If not,

you walk in and say, "I am a Member of the staff

of the Comptroller of Income Tax. Produce your

books." Whereas, the section as amended means that

the occupier of the land or the custodian of the

books can say, "Ah, but are you coming here after

due and proper consideration? Is your Comptroller

or superior officer satisfied that it is necessary

in the exercise of his duties and in the public

interest?" Of the two positions, I would say that

the one with the wider scope would protect the

official more. If the Opposition presses the

matter, we are quite willing to withdraw -
