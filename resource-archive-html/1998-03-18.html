<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>MR TEH CHEANG WAN'S DRUG SUPPLY</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  what  attempts  were made to  find  out  how  the  late

Minister  for  National Development Teh Cheang Wan obtained  his

supply of the drug with which he took his own life.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, the

late  Mr  Teh  Cheang  Wan  died of an  overdose  of  Amytal,  a

barbiturate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police, in the course of their investigations,

interviewed  the  doctors  who had attended  to  the  deceased's

health  problems, and the pharmacist who had dispensed drugs  to

him  previously.  None of them said that they had prescribed  or

sold Amytal to him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Checks with the Ministry of Health revealed that it had

stopped using the drug Amytal about a year before Mr Teh  Cheang

Wan's death.  Mr Teh's wife and daughter also could not tell the

police how and where he had obtained the drug.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1542</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir,

may  I  ask the Minister whether the stocks of all the suppliers

of this drug were checked against their records?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I do not see that as a meaningful

exercise  and  I do not think the Police did this, because  they

could  go  round checking all the pharmacies and  what  does  it

prove?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister not aware that under the

Poisons  Act,  a strict record has to be kept by all  those  who

stock  this  poison,  showing  the  amount  of  stock  in  their

possession, how much was released and to whom?  May  this  House

know whether a thorough check was carried out on all suppliers?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, this drug could be obtained anywhere

in  the  world.   It  could  have  been  obtained  from  outside

Singapore.   And if the Police were to be led, as Mr  Jeyaretnam

suggests,  on a wild goose chase in checking all the drugstores,

then  it  is  really  a  waste of Police  resources,  unless  Mr

Jeyaretnam has information to show that indeed somebody actually

prescribed  him and gave him the drug that led to  his  suicide.

Is he suggesting that?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Are we to understand from the Minister that

no  check  was made on all the suppliers?  May we also  have  an

answer  whether  Mr  Teh Cheang Wan returned to  Singapore  from

abroad shortly before his death?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I am really puzzled by the sudden

interest  of Mr Jeyaretnam on this subject of how Mr Teh  Cheang

Wan  got  his drug more than 11 years ago.  The Police had  done

all  they  could to determine how he got the drug by asking  his

doctors,  his  pharmacist  and the people  whom  he  could  have

obtained the drugs from.   Unless the Member is able to give  us

some  lead as to where the late Mr Teh got his drug, I am afraid

that  we will be on a wild goose chase, as Mr Chiam had led  the

House  and the Commission of Inquiry on a wild goose chase  many

years ago.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1543</b></font><br><br>



I  do not know why Mr Jeyaretnam is interested in this question.

I  think nobody, other than the person who gave Mr Teh that drug

or  Mr  Teh  himself, would know where the drug came from.   And

even  if  that person who gave him the drug were to own  up  and

say,  "I  am  the  one who gave", I do  not think  that  can  be

corroborated because Mr Teh is already dead.  So the only person

who  can  really tell where Mr Teh got his drug from is Mr  Teh.

Maybe  for those who are really interested in finding out  where

he  got his drug from, I think that can be done one day when  we

leave  this  world.  And if their path crosses that  of  Mr  Teh

Cheang Wan, ask him the question.  Then their curiosity will  be

satisfied.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I have another supplementary question,

Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right, one last question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right, Sir. Thank you very much. Let

us  have  an unequivocal answer.  Are we to understand that  the

Government made no check on all the suppliers and the Government

was not interested in finding out?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the question has been answered already.

Mr Wong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I think Mr Jeyaretnam is really

making  it  sound  like  there  is  something  sinister  and  is

insinuating  that the Government is on a cover  up  for  Mr  Teh

Cheang Wan.  I think he would not have forgotten that many years

ago  when  he  made  such a suggestion with  his  ill  conceived

remarks, he paid $260,000 for those remarks.  Here, I have given

him answers free of charge and he is still not satisfied.

<div align="center"><b>SAFE WATER SUPPLY</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay</b> asked the Minister for the

Environment  whether Singapore's water supply remains  safe  for

human  consumption and its coastal water safe for  swimming  and

water sports following the recent chemical fire in Tuas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1544</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir,

the recent fire in Tuas poses no danger at all to the safety  of

our water supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The factory that was destroyed by fire on 7th March 1998 is

located outside PUB's water catchment area.  Water that was used

to  fight  the  fire  was  also  discharged  outside  the  water

catchment  area  into the sea at the Northern Tuas  Basin.   The

basin  and  the surrounding area are not used for  swimming  and

other recreational activities. Nonetheless, as a precaution,  we

alerted the factories in the vicinity immediately to warn  their

workers  not  to use the water in the basin.  We also  issued  a

press  statement  on  7th March 1998 to advise  members  of  the

public  to  keep out of the area.  By 9th March, the quality  of

the water in the Northern Tuas Basin had returned to normal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to protect our water resources, my Ministry requires

industries that use or store hazardous chemicals to be sited  in

designated areas such as Tuas and the Jurong industrial estates,

which are outside water catchment areas.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in view

of the high concentration of chemical industries in that part of

the  island,  I  just  like  to ask whether  there  are  special

provisions  to  ensure  that  a  major  catastrophe  would   not

contaminate our water around that area.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, even though these are designated

sites,  we  have  very  stringent requirements  in  place.   For

example,  at  the  building plan stage, my Ministry  would  have

already  checked  and ensured that there are  adequate  measures

such  as  containment  facilities, leak  detection  and  warning

devices,  emergency plans in case something happens.  All  these

are  ready at the planning stage, even before the building plans

are  approved.   This  is to ensure that  in  the  case  of  any

accident, we are able to limit the damage to the environment and

the  health threats to not just the general population,  but  to

people working in the immediate vicinity as well.

<div align="center"><b>(Paper Cmd. 3 of 1998)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of Supply [6th

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head U -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question [17th March, 1998],

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head U of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100. - [Mr Lew Syn Pau].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

Government  does not allow single persons to buy flats  directly

from  HDB.   This is very unfair.  Although two single  citizens

above the age of 35 can buy flats directly from the HDB, to have

two   unrelated  persons  buying  a  flat  and  living  together

harmoniously  is a difficult task to accomplish.    Even  though

they jointly apply for a new flat, they would not be able to get

the  same  kind of subsidy granted by the Government   to  other

citizens.   If the argument against allowing a single person  to

buy  a new flat is that it may be wasteful for him to live in  a

big  flat  all  by himself, perhaps the HDB can restrict  single

persons to buying only 2-room  or smaller flats.  I would appeal

to  the Minister to allow single persons to individually  buy  a

flat  directly  from  HDB, and to give them  the  same  kind  of

subsidy enjoyed by other citizens.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I join Dr

Ker  in making the same plea, because, presently, singles do not

enjoy  subsidised public housing unless they  are  aged  35  and

above.   They would then qualify for new flats under  the  Joint

Singles  Scheme.   Singles  do not find  the  current  situation

equitable  and feel that they are discriminated against  in  the

distribution of subsidies to Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a Straits Times' survey on 26th September 1997 on the

attitudes  of  Singaporeans  to  public  housing,  76%  of   the

respondents believe that the Government should provide subsidies

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1546</b></font><br><br>



singles  to help them own HDB flats.  Based on the 1995  general

household  survey,  the number of single residents  in  the  age

group  between 30 and 49 has increased from 69,000 or 3% of  the

population in 1980 to 184,000 or 6% of the population  in  1995.

In other words, in 15 years, it has doubled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an aside, I would like to humbly point out that the

Nominated MP, Madam Claire Chiang, in an earlier speech in  this

House,  I believe, in the motion on tripartism moved by  NMP  Mr

Cyrille  Tan, said and I quote, "The 1990 Census Report reported

that  single parent family households comprise 60,999 households

with   widowed  parents  and  17,585  households  with  divorced

parents,  representing  approximately 10%  of  all  family-based

households."  Again, to put statistics into perspective, I would

like to humbly point out that according to the Census Report  of

1990,  the  number of heads of households who were  widowed  and

divorced totalled 78,584 or 11.9% of total households.   Out  of

these, 60,999 heads of households were widowed or about 9.2%  of

total households were thus single parent family households  with

widowed  parents, as stated by Madam Chiang in her  speech.   In

the same Census Report, there were 17,585 heads of households or

2.7%  of  total  households who are divorced and not  households

with divorced parents, to quote Mdm Chiang.



<br>12.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyhow, Sir, I join Mdm Chiang and Dr Ker to make this plea

to  Government  to  review  this  policy  for  singles  as  many

Singaporeans who are affected find themselves disadvantaged.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b>

Sir,  first let me thank Members for raising several  issues  on

public  housing policies.  Let me take first Mr Zainul  Abidin's

request for a report of the effectiveness of last year's  policy

review.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public housing situation is now stabilized. As at end

February  1998,  there were 128,800 applicants  on  the  waiting

list.   Of  these,  60,800  are  first-timers  and  68,000   are

upgraders.  Compared to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1547</b></font><br><br>



February last year, we had 141,000 applicants.  So the situation

today  is  better than last year.  The new applications received

by  HDB are now more sustainable.  HDB now receives about  1,000

to 1,500 applications per month.  This trend, if sustained, will

bring  the  annual demand for new HDB flats to a more  realistic

level of about 20,000 per year compared with the 67,000 that  we

received in 1996.  The number of applications under the  fiance-fiancee  scheme has also dropped to a more realistic  figure  of

500 a month, about half the monthly figures that we received  in

1996.  There were also more first time applicants than upgraders

recently.   This  should  be the case as first-timer  applicants

should  be  and are given higher priority in owning their  first

flats.  The revised policies have led to an overall reduction in

the  waiting time for new HDB flats.  First-timer applicants for

4-room and 5-room flats in the north and west zones will now  be

able to book a flat in approximately 2 years, those in the north-east  zone  within  3 years, and those in the Punggol  21  queue

slightly  over 3 years.  Upgrader applicants in all  zones  will

have  to  wait  longer for their flats, about 3 1/2 years  for  the

north and west zones, about 4 years for the north-east zone, and

more  than  5  years for the Punggol 21 estate.  Applicants  are

allowed  to transfer their applications to another flat type  or

zone and their applications will be set back by three months  on

the queue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised resale levy imposed in 1997 has also

discouraged frivolous demand from upgraders whose existing flats

are  already  able to meet their existing needs.  Prior  to  May

1997,  there were about 300 new applications received per  month

from  upgraders who were already existing lessees or  ex-lessees

of  5-room flats or bigger.  This number has now dropped  to  an

average  of  22  per  month.   The  vast  majority  of  upgrader

applications  now are applicants from 4-room or  smaller  flats.

These  applicants are our target group for upgrading to a second

flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the measures have achieved what we set out to do. HDB

is building 35,000 flats in 1998, 27,000 for first-timers and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1548</b></font><br><br>



8,000  for  upgraders.   The waiting time for  first-timers  has

shortened.   We  have weeded out the more frivolous  demand.   I

would  therefore say the overall impact of the 1997 revision  in

the policies has been positive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the resale market for HDB flats as a

backdrop  to  our subsequent discussion.  Resale prices  of  HDB

flats showed huge increases from 1993 to 1996.  In May 1996, the

Government  introduced  measures  to  curb  speculation  in  the

private  residential property market.  With  the  correction  in

prices  for  the private residential properties it is inevitable

that HDB resale prices will also follow suit, especially for the

top-end of the HDB resale market.  A correction of prices at the

top-end  of  the  market will subsequently filter  down  to  the

smaller HDB flats.  The 1997 HDB policy changes also curbed  the

speculative  demand for HDB flats brought about by  easy  credit

policy  for  HDB  mortgage loans.  This correction  in  the  HDB

resale  prices is not unwelcomed, considering the huge  increase

in  prices  from 1993 to 1996.  The correction has  made  resale

flats  more affordable.  Upgraders who need  extra living  space

or  who want a  flat fast can now consider buying flats from the

resale market.  For first-timers, they are assisted by a $40,000

CPF  housing  grant  or $50,000 grant if they  live  near  their

parents.   More  and  more first-timers are taking  up  the  CPF

housing grant to buy a resale flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to pricing and affordability. Several

Members  have  expressed concern that in  the  current  economic

downturn  some  HDB flat owners may not be able  to  afford  HDB

flats  or  they  may face difficulties paying for  the  mortgage

loans.  I would like to reaffirm the Government's commitment  to

provide   affordable  public  housing  to  Singapore   citizens,

especially first-timers and families in the lower income groups.

As  I have said several times, the Government's commitment is to

price new HDB flats such that 90% of Singaporean households will

be  able to afford at least a 3-room flat and 70% at least a  4-room  flat.  This policy has not changed.  In general, HDB flats

are  priced  such that purchasers are able to pay their  monthly

loan instalments  within



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1549</b></font><br><br>



the  30%  limit of their monthly CPF contributions which can  be

used  to  pay  for  their housing.  The cash  outlay  that  flat

applicants  have  to  take out from their disposable  income  is

minimal.  HDB records show that in 1997 the average monthly loan

instalment constituted around 25% to 30% of the gross  household

income of the purchasers.  Also, 80% of purchasers were able  to

service  their monthly household loans entirely from  their  CPF

contributions.   This proportion is very high  considering  that

some purchasers are self-employed with no CPF contributions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further proof that HDB flats are affordable is evident in

the very low loan default rate.  Last year, HDB recovered only 5

flats  out  of  430,000  flat owners with  outstanding  mortgage

loans,  arising from the purchasers' inability to service  their

monthly  loan  payments.  To make sure  that  HDB  flats  remain

affordable   to  Singaporeans  even  in  the  current   economic

conditions,  we  will monitor the affordability indicators  very

closely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul Abidin has raised concern about Government

helping  low  income  families own their flats.   I  can  assure

Members  that MND would keep its eye on the ball and  make  sure

that  low  income  families continue to be able  to  afford  HDB

flats.  In 1994, we announced four policies to allow them to  do

so:   (i)  the  sale  of rental flats to sitting  tenants  at  a

discount;   (ii)  sale of 3-room flats purchased by HDB from the

open  market  and then sold to applicants, also at  a  discount;

(iii)   sale  of  smaller 4-room HDB flats;  and  (iv)  priority

allocation  of  3- and 4-room flats to HDB rental flat  tenants.

These  policies have been very successful and later  on  I  will

announce an extension of this programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min asked about applicants or buyers who may

have lost their jobs in the current economic turmoil and how HDB

can help them service their loans.  HDB has several measures  to

allow home buyers to reschedule their mortgage loans.  First  of

all,  we  allow  them  to  pay  the  mortgage  loan  arrears  by

instalments within a reasonable period.  Secondly, we allow them

to reschedule



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1550</b></font><br><br>



their  loans  up to the maximum repayment period that  they  are

eligible for.  Thirdly, we also allow those in hardship to defer

payments  of the loan instalments for an initial period  of  six

months,  and  with a further extension of six  months  if  their

temporary difficulties continue.  Fourthly, we can also  convert

their  loan  scheme  to an easy repayment  scheme.   Under  this

scheme,  the monthly instalment for the first five years  is  at

75%  of  the  normal instalment amount.  It is  then  recomputed

from  the  6th year onwards to the end of the repayment  period,

based on the outstanding loan on the 6th year.  Finally, we also

encourage  the inclusion of a working family member as  a  joint

owner  so that the CPF monies of the new lessee can be  used  to

pay for the arrears.  Sir, I want to assure Mr Ong Kian Min that

HDB would resort to recovering the flat due to loan default only

as a last resort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong also asked about applicants who may want to change

to  a smaller flat because of their difficulties.  If applicants

are  unable  to  afford the flats they have  booked  because  of

financial  difficulties, they can apply to HDB to  cancel  their

applications or change their applications to smaller flats.   On

a  case-by-case  basis,   depending on their circumstances,  HDB

will consider waiving the penalty fees for the cancellation  and

also the 3-month setback for the change of flat type.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen has asked whether more first-timers are now

applying for 5-room flats rather than smaller units and  whether

we  should have some criteria to make sure they can afford to do

so.   As you all know, HDB has already implemented policies such

as  credit assessment to ensure that applicants buy flats within

their affordability.  The amount of loan HDB grants also depends

on  their  age and household income and is capped such that  the

monthly  instalments  do not exceed 40%  of  the  buyer's  gross

monthly  income.   With  these conditions  in  place,  there  is

therefore no need to impose further criteria for applicants of 5-room flats.  We hope, and we encourage, all Singaporeans to  buy

within their means.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the issue of housing subsidies. The

reason why HDB flats are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1551</b></font><br><br>



affordable  is  because  they  are  heavily  subsidized.    This

question  of  public housing subsidy is a long-standing  debate.

It  started in 1984 between Mr Chiam and the late Mr Teh  Cheang

Wan  and  continued  in 1988-1989 between  Mr  Chiam  and  Mr  S

Dhanabalan.  I assume Mr Chiam now understands housing  policies

and therefore we do not hear very much about this from him.  But

now  we  get a new "Chiam".  Mr Low Thia Khiang wants  to  raise

this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most direct and the clearest manifestation of housing

subsidy  is  the  CPF housing grant of $40,000  for  first-timer

couples  to buy a resale flat.  This is the most direct subsidy.

Furthermore, if the first-timer couple buys a resale flat within

2  km  from  their  parent's flat they enjoy a higher  grant  of

$50,000.  In FY96, 4,692 first-timer families made use  of  this

grant.   A total of $203 million was disbursed.  In FY97,  based

on  current projection, the disbursement of CPF housing grant is

estimated  to  go up to $223 million.  This is the  most  direct

form of housing subsidy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extension of this CPF grant concept is the 3-room buy-back scheme. Here, HDB buys 3-room flats from the open market,

pays  the  going  market  price and  then  sells  the  flats  to

applicants on the 3-room flat waiting list at a discount  of  up

to  $50,000.   That  is  again a very  direct  form  of  housing

subsidy.  Since the scheme started in 1994, HDB has bought  more

than  7,500  3-room flats.  The subsidy involved in this  scheme

amounts to about $375 million over the three years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to new HDB flats. There are 128,000

applicants  on the queue.  Why is that so?  Because the  subsidy

is  greater for those waiting for new flats than the $40,000  or

$50,000  CPF  grant.  If the subsidy is less, then why  wait  so

long in the queue?  The Government's approach to pricing of  HDB

flats and housing subsidy is very clear.  I have explained  this

many times.  Let me reiterate the principles.



<br>1.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will subsidise the smaller flats more than the

bigger flats.  Second, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1552</b></font><br><br>



will  subsidise  the less popular areas more  than  the  popular

areas.   Mr  Low  Thia Khiang said that HDB made  a  development

profit  in the Sengkang contracts.  This is no great revelation.

I  supplied  those  figures last month.  For the  bigger  flats,

especially  the design-and-build flats in Sengkang, HDB  made  a

development profit.  In the Woodlands and Jurong West contracts,

however,  HDB  made  a development loss.  Overall,  HDB  made  a

development  loss  of  $280 million in 1997.   If  there  is  no

subsidy,  then  why  do we still have 40,000 applicants  in  the

North-east queue waiting for flats in Sengkang Town?  The reason

is  very  simple.  Because the average market subsidy of  a  new

flat in Sengkang Town in 1997 was $103,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang gave these numbers, which were supplied

in  February.  I hope he would take these numbers and  publicise

them  in  The Hammer.  Publicise these numbers widely, tell  all

the  Workers'  Party  supporters  that  the  Government  made  a

development  profit in Sengkang and that therefore  they  should

withdraw  from the North-east queue.  We have 40,000  applicants

in  the  North-east  queue.  I assume  the  Workers'  Party  can

command  10-20% of support from Singaporeans.  So I  shall  look

forward  to  perhaps 4,000 to 8,000 of Workers' Party supporters

listening  to  Mr Low Thia Khiang, knowing that  the  Government

made  a  profit  and,  therefore, withdraw from  the  North-east

queue.  If that happens, I will buy Mr Low a very good lunch.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Dinner.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Dinner! Would Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam

object to him having dinner with a PAP member?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr Low wants to publicise these numbers further, I can

help  him even further.  There are 1,400 constituents in Hougang

Constituency who are on the North-east queue.  HDB can provide a

direct mailing list to these 1,400 applicants, tell them that Mr

Low  says  that  Sengkang  flats are not  subsidised,  that  the

Government made a development profit and, therefore, they should

withdraw from the queue.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1553</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are not stupid! They know whether there is a

subsidy  in HDB flats or not.  Mr S. Dhanabalan took some  pains

to explain the concept of market subsidy to Mr Chiam.  I hope Mr

Chiam now understands the meaning of a market subsidy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of market subsidy is nothing new. It is

practised in Hong Kong.  It is a very complicated system in Hong

Kong.   Let  me just explain the gist of it.  In Hong Kong,  the

Hong  Kong  Housing  Authority sells a flat  to  the  Hong  Kong

resident  at  a  price.  When they sell the flat, they  estimate

what  is the market price of the flat that they are selling and,

therefore, what is the price that they are selling, the discount

of the flat that they are selling, compared to the market price.

So if they sell a flat at, say, 35% discount of the market price

-  the market price is compared to the private property in  Hong

Kong  - that 35% discount is levied when the Hong Kong residents

sell  their flats 10 years later.  So when the Hong Kong Housing

Authority sells you a flat, they tell you that this price is  at

35%  discount of the market price.  You are not allowed to  sell

your  flat  until 10 years later.  When you sell  your  flat  10

years later, they levy 35% on the market price.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we do not do such a thing. We allow you to

sell your first flat and you do not pay a levy.  You only pay  a

levy  if you re-enter for a second flat.  We also allow  you  to

sell  after  five years, not after 10 years.  And when  we  talk

about market subsidy in Singapore, we are comparing the price of

HDB  flats to the resale HDB price, not to the private  property

as in Hong Kong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what does this all add up to? In the latest HDB's

audited  accounts  for  FY96, the  deficit  for  sale  of  flats

amounted  to $1 billion.  This comprises the development  losses

that HDB incurred from the sale of new HDB flats as well as  the

market  discount  for  the sale of 3-room  flats  to  low-income

families.  For FY97, the accounts are not audited yet,  but  HDB

expects to incur a deficit of about $600 million for its sale of

flats  activity.  As I said earlier, HDB incurred a  development

loss of about $280 million in 1997.  HDB



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1554</b></font><br><br>



incurred $100 million in the buy-back of 3-room flats, and there

is  another $200 million of subsidies in CPF grants.  All  these

numbers have been published in HDB's accounts since 1985.  There

is  no great revelation in what Mr Low said yesterday.  In fact,

as  I  have  offered,  we will be happy if he  publicises  these

figures  and encourages the people to withdraw from the Sengkang

queue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to CPF grant for the singles. This is an

appeal  made several times by MPs in this House.  I am happy  to

announce  that,  with effect from 1st June 1998, the  Government

will  extend the CPF Housing Grant Scheme to single citizens  to

help them purchase HDB resale flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single citizens who purchase a resale flat under this

scheme  will get a grant of $15,000.  Joint singles who purchase

a resale flat under the Joint Singles Scheme will get a grant of

$30,000.  Why $15,000?  We feel that the singles should not have

the  same  amount of grant as the first-timer couple.  In  fact,

the grant should be less than half, and therefore we have pegged

it at $15,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also say that with effect from 1st June 1998,

singles  can  only  purchase HDB flats from the  resale  market,

either  under  the Singles Scheme or the Joint  Singles  Scheme.

They  can no longer purchase a flat directly from HDB.  So those

who  are  on  the queue now, under the Joint Singles Scheme,  to

purchase flats directly from HDB, we will keep that queue.   But

from  today,  HDB will not take anymore applications  under  the

Joint Singles Scheme for direct HDB flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is that so? Because with this grant, we would like

singles to now purchase flats from the resale market and not add

to  HDB  queue.  In addition, we have been noticing a  trend  of

singles  incorporating  single  elderly  in  the  Joint  Singles

application.  We think this is an abuse of the system because  a

single would bring in another elderly single, a grandaunt  or  a

relative,  but there is no intention at all that the  two  would

stay  together.  They would get a new flat and the single  would

then  stay  in  that flat on her own.  So we  are  stopping  the

Scheme as of today.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1555</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to upgrading. The Main Upgrading Programme

was  introduced  in  1990.  Since then,  we  have  announced  12

batches,  comprising 73,000 flats.  The IUP  now  involves  more

than  100,000 flats.  In other words, almost one in every  three

HDB flats has undergone or is undergoing some form of upgrading,

either  under the MUP or IUP.  This is a very massive programme.

It  is  a  key  programme to share the wealth with Singaporeans.

With  this current economic slowdown, there is a need to  review

the  MUP  and  IUP  schedules.  As we have  announced,  the  MUP

schedule will be slowed down from 15 precincts last year  to  10

precincts  this year.  When the economy recovers, we  will  then

bring the programme back to its original scale.  Similarly,  the

IUP programme will be scaled down to between 16 and 20 precincts

this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Mr Ong Kian Min for his support of this slowdown,

but  not  the  reasons for his support.  Mr  Ong  supported  the

slowdown  because he said that the cost-sharing is a  burden  to

the HDB lessees who participate in this programme.  I can assure

Members  that  this  is  not  so.  First  of  all,  lessees  who

participate  in  the  MUP programme do not  have  to  pay  their

portion of the cost-sharing in a one-off payment.  They can take

a loan.  If they cannot afford the loan, we can keep in view the

loan  until  they  sell  the flat.   So  it  is  not  true  that

participating in the MUP is a financial burden.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau asked whether we could reschedule or

reorganise the MUP programme so that it would not take so  long.

HDB  has  worked out this arrangement in the best way of  saving

cost  and  a  smooth flow of work.  But I leave it to individual

MPs  and their architects and consultants.  If they want to call

a tender with a different way of organising their MUP programme,

they  are free to do so.  The only requirement is - do not  bust

the budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asked for upgrading of 1-room and 2-room

flats.   He  gave  the  impression that  the  MUP  programme  is

targeted at 3-room flats and above and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1556</b></font><br><br>



that  the  1-  and  2-room  flats have  been  left  out  of  the

programme.   That  is  not  so.   Under  the  MUP  and  the  IUP

programmes,  the  1- and 2-room flats which  form  part  of  the

precinct  will  similarly be upgraded.  And if they  are  rental

flats, the HDB pays for all the costs.  So far, 10,000 of such 1- and  2-room flats have been selected for the MUP.  Another 3,800

have  been  selected for the IUP.  Upon completion of  the  MUP,

some of the 2-room flats will be sold to the sitting tenants  at

a discount.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, HDB has a programme to upgrade 1-room

flats, to improve the living conditions of the elderly living in

these 1-room flats.  I have explained this several times.  Since

1993,  we have upgraded 1-room rental blocks and, together  with

the  VWOs,  we will then provide services to the elderly.   This

programme  has been very successful.  The project is  now  being

implemented for 25 1-room rental blocks, comprising 7,800 units.

So the elderly living in these units will benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also take this opportunity to announce that HDB will

undertake  an  Ad  Hoc  Upgrading Programme  for  2-room  rental

blocks.  As  I have said earlier, when the 2-room rental  blocks

are  upgraded  under the MUP, we will sell them to  the  sitting

tenants  at  a discount, after the upgrading is completed.   HDB

has  identified 54 blocks of rental flats that are suitable  for

sale  to  sitting tenants.  So far, 18 of these 54  blocks  have

been  included for upgrading under the MUP.  Another  22  blocks

are  within  the  MUP  age band and will  be  grouped  with  the

neighbouring blocks for MUP upgrading over the next  few  years.

We therefore have the remaining 14 blocks which fall outside the

MUP  age  band.  Under normal circumstances, it will be  several

years before we can upgrade these units and sell them to sitting

tenants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we are taking this opportunity to undertake an Ad Hoc

Programme  to upgrade these 14 blocks in four batches,  starting

from  the third quarter this year and the whole programme should

be  finished by the year 2002.  When we have upgraded the units,

we  will then sell them to the sitting tenants.  So this is  one

of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>



extensions of the programme to allow low income families to  buy

flats even during this economic downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the IUP programme. Several Members have

raised  this issue about lift upgrading.  Let me just  say  that

even  within  the budget of $6,000 per unit, some town  councils

were able to implement lift upgrading.  Nevertheless, last year,

we  increased  the  budget to $7,000 so as  to  facilitate  lift

upgrading  during the MUP.  In response to the appeals  made  by

Members in this House, the Government will now raise the  budget

for  IUP  to $8,000 per unit for the next batch of IUP, provided

you  undertake  lift  upgrading.  If you do not  undertake  lift

upgrading, then the budget is cut back to $5,000.  Then  Members

will be able to implement what they have been saying all along.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked about lifts in private housing estates. Under

the  Land  Titles  (Strata) Act, the management  corporation  is

allowed to collect service and conservancy charges and set aside

a  portion of these charges as sinking fund for the upgrading of

lifts.   If  the sinking fund is not sufficient, the  management

corporation can pass a resolution at the general meeting to levy

the  cost  of  lift replacement from the owners of  the  private

housing  estate.   Therefore, we encourage the  owners  and  the

management  corporations to plan in advance  for  such  cyclical

upgrading works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I have answered most of the queries raised. I

would be prepared to respond if I have left out anything.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Can I confirm with the

Minister that (1) there is no Government subsidy for the new HDB

flats  in  Sengkang?  (2) Does the Government  make  development

profits  from  the  sale of these flats  in  Sengkang?   Another

clarification is: would the selling price of new HDB flats,  let

us say, in the north zone, be increased if more applicants apply

for flats in the zone?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Can I clarify also? I

would like to ask the Minister why the HDB has never published



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1558</b></font><br><br>



the  development cost or the cost of building each  flat.   Will

the HDB be willing to publish the cost of building each flat?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> It looks like I need another session of

economics 101.  The concept of market subsidy ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I am talking about subsidy, not market

subsidy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I am telling you the concept of market

subsidy  is what the commodity will be priced in the market  and

what  you are paying for it.  Singaporeans are not that  stupid.

Singaporeans  will gain no pleasure at all if  HDB,  instead  of

making  a  development loss of $280 million, makes a development

loss  of  $2,800 million because of inefficiency.   Singaporeans

are not interested in what HDB makes or loses.  When they buy  a

flat, they are interested in the value of the flat in the market

and  what  they  are  paying for it.  And  that  is  the  market

subsidy.   And  as I have explained, the market  subsidy  for  a

Sengkang flat is $103,000.  That is why we have more than 40,000

applicants in the queue.  For development contracts in Sengkang,

in   some  contracts,  we  made  a  development  gain,  in  some

contracts,  we  made a development loss.  In a  design-and-build

contract, we price them higher because they cost more and  there

are  extra design features.  There is a bigger development gain.

Overall,  for  1997, HDB made a total development loss  of  $280

million.  And as I have said, the Government's intention  is  to

subsidise the smaller flats and the less popular estates more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the development cost per unit, maybe I need another

tutorial  on  arithmetic  101.   HDB  publishes  in  its  annual

accounts  the development cost of the flats it sells.   It  also

publishes  the number of units it sells.  If you take  the  two,

you  get  the  development cost per unit.  That is  not  a  very

meaningful figure because the development cost per unit, if  you

get  an  average  figure like that, it averages the  development

cost  of  a 4-room flat to an Executive flat from mature estates

to  new  town.   So I do not see the gain in HDB publishing  the

development  cost per unit.  But if you want that  number,  just

take the two figures in the Annual Report and divide it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1559</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I do not think this is economics 101.

It  is  a question of subsidy of HDB flats which is a big  issue

and in fact very complicated.  First of all, the land cost.  The

Government acquires land compulsorily, not at market  price  but

at  a price fixed by the Government.  In the early days, it  was

1976  price, then 1985 price.  Now we have got the January  1991

price.   All these prices are lower than the market  value.   So

the  Government has already made money on the land for a  start.

It  spends  money  on clearance cost.  Then it tenders  out  for

development of HDB flats.  Of course, the Government has to take

away some land for roads and other power plants.  But taking all

that into account, I believe the Government prices the land  for

sale  of  each unit at market value and not the acquired  value.

So the Government has already made money on the land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the contracts, I wish the accounts of HDB could

give  the detailed contract prices of each development.  We have

got  structural and piling cost.  We have got finance  cost  and

electricity, sewerage cost.  I wish they could give all these in

detail.   We can add them all up and see how much the Government

has  spent and the number of units.  Then we would know the true

value  of the flat.  We will take the selling price and  I  will

tell you that there is no subsidy.  The Government makes on  the

sale of HDB flats.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I am sorry I give Mr Chiam more credit

than  it is due.  Apparently, the years of exchange with Mr  Teh

and  Mr  S.  Dhanabalan have made no imprint at all.  All  these

numbers are in the HDB's accounts and they are all added up  for

you.  We do not have to give you all the individual accounts for

you  to aggregate.  These are all in the accounts audited by the

Auditor-General  and published in the HDB's Annual  Report.   It

shows the development cost.  It shows the selling prices and  it

shows the development loss or gain for the whole year as well as

per unit.  So all these numbers have been published since 1985.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam is back to his old hobbyhorse about land prices.

As Mr S. Dhanabalan explained to him way back in 1988, since



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1560</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>1988&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has been buying land from the Government at a price set

by  the Chief Valuer and sold by the Land Office.  That price is

determined by the Chief Valuer.  That price is a fraction of the

private  market land price.  It is not meaningful to talk  about

land  prices based on old acquisition cost.  I have raised  this

example many times.  I will raise it again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you price a unit based on historical cost, it makes

nonsense of the pricing.  For example, we are building flats  in

Gillman Camp.  This is an old armed forces land.  Therefore, the

price  is  free  of  charge.  We are going to  reclaim  land  in

Punggol.   It is going to cost us a lot of money.  So the  price

would  be very high.  If we go by his accounting, we will  price

the  central  area  at Gillman flats much cheaper  than  Punggol

flats.   Why?  Because the land historically is priced  at  zero

cost  to the Government and therefore we should sell them  at  a

much  lower price than Punggol flats.  If that is how  Mr  Chiam

will  run  the  government,  then I think  he  better  gets  his

arithmetics and economics right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir. Is it correct

that, based on my calculation, HDB makes a gross profit of  more

than $44 million from selling of those flats that I cited in  my

speech  in  Sengkang?  I think it is better to get these  things

clear  here.  I am talking about Government subsidy.  I  am  not

talking  about  market subsidy.  For instance,  Carrefour  sells

some  goods which are below market price.  Then you can call  it

market  subsidy, if you want to.  I am talking about  Government

subsidy.   Would the Minister enlighten this House what  is  his

definition of "subsidy" and whether those flats in Sengkang that

I  cited in my speech yesterday under the various contracts  are

subsidised by the Government?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Since 1988, Mr S. Dhanabalan has been

trying   to   explain  to  Members  the  meaning  of  "subsidy".

"Subsidy"  means what the commodity can fetch on the market  and

what you are paying for it.  That is a subsidy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Government subsidy?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1561</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Call it what you like, that is what

Singaporeans benefit from buying an HDB flat directly  from  us.

Mr  Low  has his point.  You can go round.  In fact, I encourage

him  to  publicise  those  numbers that  he  has  and  draw  the

conclusions from there to both the Workers' Party as well as  to

all  his constituents in Hougang.  In fact, I will help him with

the   direct  mailing  list.   Tell  them  that  this   is   his

calculations,  that in the Sengkang flats, the  number  which  I

gave  him,  Government  made X dollars of development  gain  and

therefore  HDB  flats are not subsidised.  Therefore,  as  their

leader  and  elected  representative, he  will  advise  them  to

quickly withdraw from the North-East queue because HDB flats are

not subsidised.  Please do that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir. I do not know

where  the  Minister has got the definition of  "subsidy"  from.

Maybe  it  is  a mixed definition.  What I understand  from  the

Oxford  Universal Dictionary, the definition of "subsidy"  is  a

grant or contribution of money.  But in this particular case,  I

stated  that  for  the Sengkang flats, the  Government  makes  a

profit.  It does not contribute any money in the development  of

the  new  flats.  And I asked him just now whether  the  selling

price of flats in the north zone will increase if there are more

applicants.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I have explained in my speech

earlier,  the  Government's  pricing  policy  goes  on   certain

principles.  First, we will price 3-room flats such that 90%  of

first-time households would be able to afford it.  We buy  these

flats from the market and we subsidise it to the level that  90%

of  Singaporeans can afford a 3-room flat.  Today,  that  direct

grant  is $50,000 per flat.  Similarly, when you buy a new  flat

from Government, you are enjoying a market subsidy, what you pay

for  the flat and what the flat is worth in the open market, and

that  subsidy is $103,000 in Sengkang.  If you say that this  is

inequitable,  I agree with you.  In which case, we should  raise

the prices of flats in Sengkang.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I do not think the Minister has

answered  my  questions.  I have raised two  questions.   First,

what is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1562</b></font><br><br>



the  Minister's definition of "subsidy", and not market subsidy?

I  am talking about subsidy.  Second, will the selling price  of

the new HDB flats in the north zone be increased further if, let

us  say, they are more popular, as the Minister's answer is that

the price is based on popularity?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Subsidy, as I have explained many times,

is  the  difference between what you pay in the market and  what

you  are  paying  today.  That is subsidy.  For the  north  zone

flats,  the  principle which I enunciated is that the Government

will subsidise the less popular areas more than the more popular

areas.   Why?  Because we have a building programme and we  want

to  encourage  Singaporeans to buy into the building  programme.

Today,  we  have  more than 40,000 applicants  in  the  Sengkang

queue.   Why?   Because it is a very popular town.  Because  the

subsidy there is much higher.  Otherwise, why would people apply

for   Sengkang   Town?    [Mr  Low  Thia  Khiang   interrupted.]

Precisely.   And the more you raise about this issue,  the  more

the prices in Sengkang will go up.



<br>1.30 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, thank you for giving

me  this chance to ask the Minister a question.  I think we have

heard  enough  of subsidies.  I am just asking a very  practical

question.   I  think most of us at our meet-the-people  sessions

would  have come across this.  These upgraders who are receiving

keys  to  the new flats face this problem of not being  able  to

sell their present flat.  Would the Minister  allow them to take

up  the  new flats after they have sold their present flat?   Of

course,  we  must make some provisos.  In other  words,  if  the

owner  has  made several attempts to sell his flat, and  we  can

check  this from advertisements in the newspaper whether he  has

really made an attempt to sell his flat, and he gets no response

from  the  advertisements, would HDB be able to buy  back  those

flats at HDB's assessed value?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> HDB will generally allow a lessee more

time to dispose of his first flat, after he has taken possession

of his second flat, based on evidence that he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1563</b></font><br><br>



has  tried to sell off the flat but he could not find  a  buyer.

HDB  will  normally extend the time for him to  dispose  of  the

flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to his second question is no, HDB will not be

the  buyer  of  last resort.  We leave it to the  individual  to

dispose of his flat in the open market.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, according to

the  latest  available statistics, divorces  granted  under  the

Women's  Charter have been increasing substantially, the  number

more  than  doubling in the space of 10 years.  Muslim  divorces

also  saw  a  steady  increase.  The  Department  of  Statistics

reported that the divorce rate tends to be higher among  younger

married persons.  The majority of divorcees were aged between 30

and 39 years in divorces granted in 1996.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In divorce proceedings, the distribution of matrimonial

property is usually an issue.  If the matrimonial home is an HDB

flat, the issue is whether it be offered for sale or retained by

one  of  the spouses.  Several problems have occurred concerning

this  matter.   First, if they purchased  an  HDB  flat  as  the

matrimonial home, they would be treated as upgraders  when  they

sell  their flat following their divorce.  This means that  they

will  be barred from applying another HDB flat for 10 years.   A

couple  who bought a flat in 1989 and who sold it in  1995  will

have to wait until 1999 before they are eligible to apply for  a

new  flat.  Meanwhile, the displaced divorcee will have to  stay

with relatives, friends or rent another flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the spouse who is given the opportunity to keep the

flat  will have to be eligible under one of the schemes, execute

another mortgage and pay the other party a sum that reflects his

contribution.   This may be a mission impossible for  the  lower

income  groups.  In a case that I recently dealt with,  a  young

mother,  who has custody of her two children, has been asked  to

take a new mortgage of $50,000 where she is expected to pay $300

per  month over 29 years, and to provide over $110,000  cash  to

discharge the existing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1564</b></font><br><br>



sum  owed.   She  only earns around $800-$900 a  month.   It  is

impossible for her to come out with such a large sum.   So,  for

this  category of persons, it appears that the rules do not work

at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renting a flat is also a problem, because the divorcee

might not fall within the $800 level.  I think that level is set

too  low.   A  more realistic figure, bearing in mind  that  the

spouse  may have to take care of children, may be around $1,500.

Mind  you,  Sir,   this  does  not  even  mean  that  they  will

definitely  get a flat.  The queues are long and  the  divorcees

are not regarded as a special class.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly, my concern is for the children of broken

marriages.  Nothing could be more traumatic for them than to see

their  parents separating.  On top of that, they find that  they

are  no longer at the home, suffer severe financial hardship and

may have to rely on the goodwill of relatives and the like.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the plight of divorcees who are unable, after they are

divorced,  to come up with funds to cover the cost of  ownership

is  a very real one.  Perhaps a more flexible rental policy  can

be implemented to allow them to live as a family unit as best as

they  can.  We should, at the end of the day, also think of  the

children  who  must  have been through a great  deal  of  mental

anguish.  Let us not make it more difficult for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has just now demonstrated an incredible

ability  to come out with fair and just solutions.  And  I  hope

that  in  this  case,  he will also do  so  for  this  group  of

unfortunate people.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, my topic is on HDB car

parks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of electronic road pricing, the car

population  will grow more rapidly as more COEs will be  issued.

This  will  lead  to  a  greater demand  for  car  park  places,

especially  in  HDB  estates.  I understand that  HDB  has  been

building  multi-storey car parks for both new estates and  those

undergoing Main Upgrading Programmes (MUP).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these car park provisions will meet the new

demand, not much has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1565</b></font><br><br>



been  done  to  increase the car parking places  in  semi-mature

estates.   Presently,  some semi-mature estates  such  as  Bukit

Panjang  are  facing problems of inadequate car parking  places.

Thus,  I  would  like  to  urge the  Minister  to  consider  the

following suggestions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Build more multi-storey car parks in semi-mature estates

immediately  to  overcome the shortage of car parks.   Available

state land or HDB land in semi-mature estates should be utilised

either temporarily or permanently as car parks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Incorporate the construction of multi-storey car parks

into  the  Interim  Upgrading Programme (IUP).   The  Government

should increase the grant for IUP so that multi-storey car parks

can  be built together with the provision of landscaped gardens,

covered  linkways,  and other facilities  in  the  open  spaces.

This  will  reduce wastage when the Main Upgrading Programme  is

implemented for these estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) HDB should standardise the fees for both multi-storey car

parks  and  open  space  car parks to $50  monthly.  This  would

facilitate  the  grouping of car parks for  season  parking  and

encourage residents to use multi-storey car parks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Convert all open space car parks for season parking

only  between  10 pm and 7 am.  Overnight parking  for  visitors

should  be restricted to multi-storey car parks or less utilised

open space car parks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Relocate trees that are occupying car park lots

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I hope the Ministry can take immediate steps

to  resolve the shortage of car park lots in semi-mature estates

before the full impact of the ERP is felt.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, with

the  aging  of  the flats in the older estates and the  frequent

resale  of  flats, there are many incidences of leaking  ceiling

caused by renovation works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present HDB policy, residents who have leaking

ceilings will have to bear the repair cost, because the  ceiling

is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1566</b></font><br><br>



a  party  structure  belonging jointly to the  adjoining  flats.

Therefore, the owners of these two units are jointly liable  for

the  repair  cost.   Normally, when the Area Office  receives  a

complaint,  they  will send their officials to  investigate  the

matter  within three days.  The  Area Office will write  to  the

two parties involved within nine days so that they could proceed

with  the  repair works.  The Area Office would  also  recommend

contractors to the residents who have difficulty in getting  the

appropriate contractor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, repairing a leaking toilet would cost about

$1,200.   This  means  that each unit will have  to  bear  $600.

Normally,  the people living upstairs are reluctant to  pay  for

the  cost  of  repair and this will cause delay in the  repairs.

The  Area Office will then have to inform the legal officers  in

the  HDB  head office and normally this will be done  one  month

after receiving the complaint.  After the first letter is issued

and  if  no  action is taken by the resident living upstairs,  a

reminder will be sent.  So the whole process would take about 73

days  or about two and a half months after the complaint  before

work  can commence.  Very often the people living upstairs  will

say  that  they have no money as an excuse and keep on delaying.

Taking  more than three months to resolve a leaking  ceiling  in

the toilet is indeed a cause of great regret.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are a multi-racial society. If the people living

upstairs and downstairs are of different races they may  have  a

misunderstanding caused by the language differences.  This  will

certainly  be very bad to our efforts to promote racial  harmony

and  enhance social cohesion.  I feel that the Area Office could

resolve  such matters as leaking toilet ceiling easily,  because

as  soon  as  the  Area Office has received  the  complaint  and

investigated,  and  found that the complaint  is  substantiated,

they  could call up the two parties involved and tell  them  the

cost  of  repair and how much they have to pay.  So it could  be

resolved in three to five days' time.  I hope the Minister would

pay more attention to this matter because this is happening more

and more often now.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1567</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, the Transitional Rental Housing

Scheme  (TRHS) was introduced in October 1991 with  the  aim  of

providing  interim housing to young couples who are waiting  for

the  completion of their home ownership flats.  In October 1995,

the  HDB  introduced improvements to the TRHS to make it  easier

for  first-time applicants to get interim housing.  As a result,

the   demand  for  TRHS  flats  more  than  doubled  from  1,200

applications  in  July  1995 to an average  of  2,800  in  every

quarterly  exercise subsequently.  In  the July  1997  quarterly

exercise,  2,840 applications were received for the  500  units.

HDB  introduced various new measures in October  1997  with  the

provision  of 1-room flats and the buying back of 2- and  3-room

flats  from the open market.  HDB increased the number of  flats

offered  under  each TRHS quarterly exercise by  20%,  from  the

current 500-600 units from the October 1997 exercise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I applaud HDB for this effort. However, what I would

like  to ask the Minister is about the waiting time for the TRHS

applicants.  As he has mentioned just now, the queuing time  for

Registration of Flats Scheme (RFS) has been reduced drastically,

from about five years to even two years for some areas.  I would

like to ask the Minister whether there are similar guidelines to

reduce the waiting time for TRHS applicants, because for many of

them  who need interim housing, there is a more urgent  need  to

get  this  housing  because of the size of the  family  and  for

various  other  reasons,  as we hear  from  our  meet-the-people

session  cases.  Therefore, it is more urgent for  them  to  get

this housing.   I would like to ask the Minister whether HDB has

a similar target to shorten waiting time for TRHS applicants.



<br>1.45 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

with regard to the Government's announcement to freeze JTC's and

HDB's  rentals for industrial and commercial properties, I would

like  to  convey  the gratitude on behalf of the industrial  and

commercial sector in Singapore.  This shows that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1568</b></font><br><br>



Government  is beginning to attach importance to the problem  of

exorbitant  rentals  faced  by  the  industrial  and  commercial

sector.   However,  I regret to say that the Government has  yet

to  thoroughly  resolve this problem,  to embody the  spirit  of

common sharing of joy and sorrow among the tripartite parties of

labour, management and Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the years, the small and medium-sized enterprises

have been  loyal tenants of HDB.  In response to HDB raising its

rental  year  by year, they have been taking it in their  stride

and  appear to be rather helpless.   Once they do not accept the

rental increases they will have to get ready to move out  or  to

wind  up  the business which they have painstakingly  built  up.

They  will  have to suffer great business and financial  losses.

Why  has  HDB  been turning a blind eye to the hardship  of  the

tenants?   Is  it because they are not interested in  the  well-being of the tenants?   When adjusting the rentals, HDB seems to

give  people the impression that it is very calculative and very

"kiasu".   In the final analysis, it must be closely  linked  to

the budget objectives set by  HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From HDB's budget, we can see that in leasing out the

industrial  and commercial  properties, HDB's main objective  is

to  make a profit and the rentals are pegged to the highest rate

in  the  market.    According  to the workload  and  performance

indicators  set  down  in the budget, the   rate  of  return  of

commercial  properties has actually been raised   from  8.2%  in

1993  to  11.7%  in 1997, and the rate of  return of  industrial

properties  has increased from 13.7% in 1993 to 19.7%  in  1997.

Although this year HDB has adjusted the estimated rate of return

down to 10.9% for commercial properties, it is still higher than

the  10.7% in 1996.   As for industrial properties, although the

estimated  rate  of  return has been  adjusted  downwards  to  3

percentage  points  lower than the 18.8% in 1996,  it  is  still

maintained  at  a  high  of  15.7%.  Apparently,  faced  with  a

situation of not being able to "have the cake and eat  it",  HDB

will  necessarily overlook the business cost and competitiveness

of its tenants when it fixes its rentals.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1569</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a gigantic landlord, HDB, in fixing the supply of

industrial  and  commercial properties  and  their  rentals,  is

capable  of  influencing the rentals and business  cost  of  the

entire  market. In this difficult time, if HDB still insists  on

maintaining  a high profit, then it will not only be unrealistic

but  also  will force many SMEs to stop their business,  thereby

aggravating  the  adverse conditions of  our  economy.   I  must

emphasize  that  the industrial and commercial  rentals  in  the

neighbouring  countries are already very cheap  as  compared  to

Singapore, in the light of the substantial devaluation of  their

currencies.    It will be extremely difficult for  Singapore  to

compete with them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I would like to appeal to the Government to review

the  objectives and policies of HDB in terms of rental  revision

to  ensure  that  it will  not overlook the overall  competitive

edge of our country while trying to make a surplus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, rentals of private properties have already

come   down.     HDB's   rentals   should   also   be   adjusted

correspondingly to be closer to the market price and should  not

remain at the high level.  As regards the 15% rebate on property

tax  for  commercial and industrial properties, as announced  by

the  Government, I consider it as negligible as compared to  the

very high rentals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to help lighten the rental burden of the

business  community so that  more funds could be  channelled  to

improving the productivity of different business operations, and

at the same time to maintain our competitive edge, vis-a-vis our

neighbours,   I urge the Government to make a resolute  decision

to  take appropriate measures to further lower HDB's factory and

shop  rentals.  At the same time, I hope that related  agencies,

like  JTC and PSA will also take corresponding measures to lower

the  rentals of their industrial land, factories and  warehouses

so as to help  the business community to keep the operation cost

at a reasonable level, and to maintain our competitive edge over

our neighbouring countries.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1570</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, just like the

HDB  residential  estates, the old HDB industrial  estates  also

need major upgrading or redevelopment in order to better utilize

the  land,  many of which are on prime locations.  Redevelopment

will  also  lead to more well designed industrial premises  with

more  modern  and efficient features and facilities.   It  would

enhance  the productivity of lessees and tenants, many  of  whom

are   small   and   medium-sized  enterprises.    Although   the

redevelopment of HDB industrial estates has been announced  last

year, I am not sure if every affected tenant or lessee has  been

informed.   I  would like to ask the Minister whether  HDB  will

inform those affected as early as possible so that they can plan

for their relocation.  I would also like to know the response of

those who have been informed so far.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the economic downturn, I would like to ask the

Minister  what  further measures HDB would take  to  help  their

tenants and lessees tide over this difficult period.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze:</b> Sir, HDB industrial estates were mostly

developed in the 70s and 80s to cater for small and medium-sized

factories  which  were  then  affected  by  land  clearance  and

resettlement.  With continued economic growth over the last  two

decades, the business volumes of these factories have grown  and

factory  space  is  now grossly inadequate  in  supporting  this

expansion.  For example, the roads are very narrow and therefore

constantly  jammed  by  heavy vehicles.  With  the  loading  and

unloading  of goods, sometimes occupying one side of  the  road,

bottlenecks  have  resulted,  affecting  the  flow  of  traffic.

Furthermore,  there is an acute shortage of  parking  space  for

container  trucks.  Defu industrial estate which is  located  in

Paya Lebar constituency is a case in point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of National Development is aware of the above

problems and in February 1997 HDB announced that under  the  HDB

Industrial  Redevelopment Programme it will redevelop industrial

estates  in stages, with the programme ending in the year  2007.

For industrial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1571</b></font><br><br>



tenants  in the Defu industrial estate, they will probably  have

to wait for another 7 to 10 years before their lease expires and

redevelopment can take place.  However, during this  period,  it

is  difficult  for  them to continue to expand production  under

present conditions.  Due to space constraint, some tenants  have

resorted  to  building mezzanine floors illegally  or  undertake

illegal   extensions   of  existing  factory   premises.    Once

discovered   by  HDB  they  will  be  ordered  to  remove   such

alterations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to solve their problems, I would like to suggest

that  HDB  bring  forward the plan to redevelop Defu  industrial

estate as soon as possible.  HDB can compensate the tenants  for

the   unexpired  lease  period  by  offering  them  new  factory

premises.   HDB  should also consider building one  or  two  new

blocks of multi-storey buildings there for those who would  like

to  move  into  a bigger factory space as soon as  possible  and

develop the rest of the estate in stages.  Meanwhile, for  those

who  have to wait a few more years for their new factories,  HDB

should consider permitting some reasonable extension of space as

long  as the extension and the resultant structures meet  safety

requirements.  Where possible, road widening should  be  carried

out and more temporary car parks built for heavy vehicles in the

estate.   In  this  manner,  the inconvenience  of  an  outdated

industrial estate can be minimised for the time being while  the

tenants wait for a totally revamped industrial estate in Defu.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, before I ask the

various categories of land are designated for various uses, some

for  industries, some for commercial, and some for  residential.

There  is a category of retailers or foreign retailers who  have

come into Singapore and who have been using industrial spaces or

land for such kind of retail purposes.  I am not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1572</b></font><br><br>



talking about warehouse sales.  Warehouse sales where warehouses

occasionally  have their sales once in a while for promotion  or

for  clearance,  that is acceptable.  But  I  am  talking  about

industrial  land or warehouses actually being used  as  shopping

complexes.   Land being scarce in Singapore, the proper  use  of

industrial  land should be for industries to generate  jobs  for

high-value added contribution to the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister can look into this aspect of it and not

allow  such retailers who come in with new concepts  and  so  on

using  such kind of industrial land.  The difference is  because

commercial  rentals and industrial rentals vary by  a  very  big

factor, two to three times.  So people who operate in this  kind

of situation, in this kind of land or spaces, have a very unfair

advantage.   The  retail  sector  in  Singapore  right  now   is

suffering  and  it is not a joy to see the state of  competition

being so uneven.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, my topic is on cost

reduction  for  public projects.  I would like  to  propose  the

following  measures to reduce the construction  cost  of  public

projects for the Ministry to consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Design-and-build tenders. All public projects should

not invite more than 3 firms for design-and-build tenders. It is

costly  and  time-consuming to prepare such  tenders  especially

when  details and models are required for the tender submission.

This  would  reduce  wastage of resources  of  the  construction

industry.   I  understand that HDB has adopted this measure  and

would urge all other Government departments to follow likewise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Bulk purchase of basic building materials. All

Government departments should adopt HDB's approach in purchasing

basic  building  materials in bulk for  contractors  working  in

their   projects.   This  procurement  method   provides   price

stability, ensures availability of material supply, and  reduces

the cost of building materials.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Clerk-of-work and resident engineer. We need to review

the roles and impact of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1573</b></font><br><br>



clerk-of-work  and  resident engineer  on  the  productivity  of

public  projects.  The performance of clerk-of-work and resident

engineer  should  be  closely  monitored  as  they  have  direct

influence on the progress of the project.  They should  be  paid

by employers and inclusive of overtime charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Standardization and modularization. Public projects

should  adopt a high level of standardization and modularization

of  building components and elements.  Standard sizes of  beams,

columns, floor slabs, windows and doors will facilitate the  use

of  precast  technology  and  mass manufacturing.   The  use  of

standard components will expedite construction and also increase

productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Project financing. Government departments can provide

project  financing  such  as  advance  initial  payment,  timely

progress payment, and early settlement of final accounts.   This

would  reduce  the borrowing cost of contractors, thus  reducing

the cost of public projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Provide housing for foreign workers. Recently, JTC has

been  purchasing  HDB flats to rent them out to  their  workers.

Likewise,  the  Ministry should also consider either  allocating

low cost land for contractors to build housing for their foreign

workers or build housing for these workers.  In addition, vacant

site  or vacant state land should be let out at lower rental  to

contractors for site office and storage purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Disposal of construction wastes. It is costly to dump

construction wastes such as excavated earth, metal, wood,  glass

and concrete waste.  Presently, all contractors are making their

own  arrangements to dispose these construction wastes which may

be uneconomical at times.



<br>2.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry should centralise and out-source the disposal

of  construction wastes to disposal firms.  Term contracts could

be  called for different regions.  This would provide and reduce

the  cost  of waste disposal drastically, and also at  the  same

time prevent indiscriminate dumping of wastes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1574</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, there are many condominiums and

landed  properties  that are being used as boarding  houses  for

foreign  workers.  As there is a healthy demand for  this,  many

house  owners  are increasingly leasing out their properties  to

foreign workers and, of course, with the permission granted from

URA.  But somehow it seems that the number of applications is on

the increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problem really is the abuse by foreign workers of

these  rented  dwelling units, especially in landed  properties,

particularly terrace houses which house up to 30 to 40 people in

one dwelling unit.  In fact, there are many such rental dwelling

units  in  various parts of Singapore.  In my own  constituency,

the  practice  is  somewhat prevalent  in  the  Cambridge  area,

Carlisle  Road area, and around the Sing Avenue and  Joo  Avenue

areas.  These foreign workers are probably village folks who are

ignorant that they are a nuisance to their neighbours and may be

oblivious  of the mess that they create around the  house,  with

their sardine tins, broken beer bottles and the loads of rubbish

that  they  create.   Or  they  may  be  just  jealous,  perhaps

vindictive,  of their richer Singapore neighbours.  Ignorant  or

vindictive, their action has caused an avalanche of problems for

Singaporeans living in the estate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me highlight some of these problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Many of these foreign worker dwelling units are not

only  packed  with  workers, but are also packed  with  lots  of

wooden  furniture  and  partitions that they  become  real  fire

hazards.   Sir, I refer the House to this Straits Times  report,

4th  January  1998, written by Mr Jasbir Singh, and  he  stated:

"This  is  the second time in less than two months that  foreign

workers have died in a shophouse blaze.  On November 15th,  four

Malaysians were killed in a Jalan Besar fire staying in quarters

like this."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Then, just a few days ago, there is reason to believe

that foreign workers' housing also facilitates mosquito breeding

and  is causing dengue fever.  Straits Times, 14th March, stated

28  cases  of  dengue fever near Tan Tock Seng  Hospital  in  my

constituency.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1575</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) These foreign workers cause noise pollution because

they  tend  to speak very loud, especially at night,  disturbing

the neighbourhood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Some of these foreign workers have been caught for snatch

thefts  or  outraging  of modesty of the females  in  the  area.

Therefore,  having  these workers in  the  area  is  a  security

hazard; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) All these problems result in a drop in the valuation of

properties  in the area which further upsets Singaporean  owners

living in these neighbourhoods.  And it is no fault of theirs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I asked my constituency's private residents' committee

and  the  constituency's secretariat to take  up  this  critical

issue  with the URA.  The reply from URA stated:  "The  Planning

Act   does  not  control  the  number  of  people  residing   in

residential estates and neither does it regulate the  rental  of

residential properties."  In other words, the number  of  people

residing  is not regulated in a particular unit.  Then we  wrote

to  the  Ministry  of Labour.  The reply from  the  Ministry  of

Labour stated:  "It is stated in the work permit condition  that

an employer must provide adequate housing for the foreign worker

employed  by  him."  And they went on and ended  the  letter  by

saying,  "However, the Ministry of Labour is not  the  authority

responsible  for  specifying the building  requirements."   Then

someone   checked  with  BCD  under  the  Ministry  of  National

Development to see whether they control the number of  residents

in a dwelling unit, and BCD has no control either.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have been talking to URA, Ministry of Labour, BCD,

ENV, the Police to solve some of these security problems and  so

on,  and  yet  the  problems  remain unsolved,  except  for  the

occasional  raids  by URA and others on some of  these  dwelling

units.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, certainly this episode looks like an episode out of

the British TV series, "Yes, Minister".  Therefore, I would like

to urge the Minister to look into the following:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1576</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To work much closely with other bodies, like MTI, JTC

and  so  on,  to  ensure that workers are not  housed  in  large

numbers  in urban areas or landed properties but in other  older

flats in outskirts, preferably away from Singaporean housing, if

that can be found.  I think, to some extent, this is being done.

JTC  is buying up more flats.  But I think the pace needs to  be

hastened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Ministry needs to coordinate all the foreign worker

housing-related  matters and find ways to  tighten  the  present

guidelines  and  look  into  possible  changes  in  legislation.

Perhaps  the  Planning Act needs to be reviewed to restrict  the

number  of  foreign  workers that can  be  housed  in  a  single

dwelling  unit,  and to look into things like  fire  prevention,

fire safety and security concerns of neighbouring residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps there is a need for a multi-agency task force

to  be  set up to resolve these pertinent problems that irritate

many  Singaporeans  unnecessarily.  On this  number  of  foreign

workers  in a dwelling unit, I just want to end by saying,  even

the Geneva Convention has got restrictions on how big a prisoner

cell  should  be.   So I think we should not  deteriorate  below

these guidelines.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I

would  like  to  urge  the HDB to take some strict  measures  to

prevent  old air-conditioning units in high-rise buildings  from

becoming  killers.   Recently, it was reported in the  newspaper

that in Tampines Avenue 5, an old air-conditioner unit, weighing

some  10  kg, dropped from the eighth storey of an HDB block  to

the  ground  floor.  Fortunately, it did not hit  any  one.  The

incident happened because the weather-battered metal support for

the  window unit air-conditioner gave way and could not  support

the weight of the air-conditioner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the report, there were a total of three such

incidents  last year, two of them were at Nee Soon  and  one  in

Clementi.  Fortunately, no one was injured by these falling air-conditioners from high-rise buildings.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1577</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that there are about 240,000 units of air-conditioners in these HDB estates and many of them are window-

unit  air-conditioners.  So if there is no  strict  control  and

regular inspection on them, one day disaster may come from above

and  some  people  may be injured or even killed.   If  such  an

unfortunate incident is to happen, then I think it is cause  for

regret.   I think this can be avoided and prevented.  I  believe

that  in the HDB estates, we are now getting more and more  air-conditioners  being installed.  I think we should  do  something

about it to prevent unfortunate incidents from happening.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all these air-conditioners, there are also a lot of

other  problems.   One of them is the water  dripping  from  the

units. In many cases, the outflow pipes of air-conditioners were

not  connected  to the bathrooms, as required by  the  HDB.   In

other words, the water will drip direct into the unit downstairs

and  cause a lot of unhappiness to the people below.  Sometimes,

the  condensed water will drip on to the ground floor, resulting

in moss to be gathered and inconvenience to the residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think HDB should look at this matter seriously and take

more  stringent measures against the culprits.  There should  be

regular  inspections on the air-conditioners in the HDB  estates

to  ensure that the owners have their air-conditioners  serviced

regularly.  Otherwise, they would be a potential danger  to  the

residents.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, with your permission, I cannot

resist  a  quick response to Mr Sinnakaruppan.  I do agree  very

wholeheartedly that foreign workers do deserve clean and  decent

housing  because foreign workers are people too.  But  I  wonder

how  far  away  from Singaporean housing should we  place  these

houses?  In small Singapore, I think maybe we might have to  put

them  out in the kelongs.  I think the point is that we need  to

balance  the interest of foreign workers and our residents  too,

and I do support that point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your permission too, I would like to deal with my

three amendments together?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1578</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> First, I would like to highlight the

difficulties  faced  by  the average  Singaporean  household  in

respect  of  household services.  The Consumers  Association  of

Singapore  has had occasion to blacklist plumbers,  electricians

and  renovation  contractors who have no  qualms  about  earning

excessive fees for their services, and low quality services, and

earning such fees in unconscionable situations.  The usual modus

operandi  of  such scoundrels is to advertise in the  classified

advertisements  of  the newspapers promising services  for  what

looks  like  reasonable charges.  When they have finished  their

work,  which may actually be simple work, they claim that  their

original  fees  have to be increased because of certain  special

work or equipment that they had used, without first seeking  the

consent  of  the householder.  Some of them have  even  inflated

their charges 300 times more than what they have advertised  and

used  coercion to obtain payment, for example, by escorting  the

householders to the ATM machines to withdraw cash.  Others  have

masqueraded  as  contractors engaged by HDB to do  upgrading  of

their  flats.   They have preyed mainly on the elderly  and  the

illiterate  who are more easily awed by officialdom and  threats

of force.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another source of frustration for householders is generated

by  house removers.  These unscrupulous persons advertised cheap

rates  for house removal also in the classifieds and would  even

promise  householders  whatever they ask for:  covered  lorries,

free  boxes; everything moved in one trip, etc.  The householder

then fixes a date for moving and gets all packed up.  On the day

of  the move, the workers turn up late and refuse to work unless

paid overtime, or claim that the items in the house are far  too

many  to be moved in one trip, or turn up with lorries different

from  those promised.  In the end, the householder has no choice

but to pay up because there is no way he can find an alternative

mover  at  such short notice and so late in the day.   Sir,  the

list  of  tricks  goes on and on.  It is time we  licensed  such

services.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1579</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, we have a rather complicated and yet incomplete

system of licensing such services.  Plumbers are licensed by ENV

and  PUB, depending on whether they are sanitary or non-sanitary

plumbers;  electricians are licensed by PUB; certain  renovation

companies  are licensed by HDB, but not all; and house  removers

are   not  regulated  by  any  agency.   They  are  a  law  unto

themselves.   The woes they inflict on unsuspecting householders

come about in the unfair way they conduct their businesses or in

the  poor quality of their services. Householders who have  been

taken  for  a  ride,  however,  cannot  find  redress  from  the

licensing  agencies because the agencies do not appear  to  have

powers to require the tradesmen to do their businesses in a fair

way.   The  so-called licensing is really a register  of  people

with  such  skills and licensing authorities are only  concerned

whether  these  people  have  the  correct  training  or  proper

business addresses for service of notices.



<br>2.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this cannot be right. We are not a nation of robbers

and  highwaymen.  Why do we permit such unconscionable  conduct?

Why  do  we have no laws or licensing requirements to  root  out

such  underhanded ways of ripping off our poor  and  uneducated,

our  law-abiding citizens who entrust their matters to companies

which they mistakenly believe have been cleared and licensed  by

the authorities?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to add to the litany of woes, there are all sorts of

"real estate agents" also who earn 1% or 2% of the sale price of

HDB  flats  and  houses  without doing a single  thing  for  the

householder.   Fortunately, such agents have now got  to  attend

classes  before they are given licences to practise.  And  their

certificates are issued by the IRAS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what we need is a single agency that members of the

public  can go to if they have been taken advantage of by crooks

such  as  these, who will then get their licences revoked.   The

list of licence holders can be checked by householders



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1580</b></font><br><br>



who  need such services.  Advertisers who have no licences  will

not  be  allowed to advertise and the media companies should  be

required  by  law to check such credentials before allowing  the

businesses  to  advertise.  In this way, fly-by-night  operators

will  disappear overnight because they have no way to  advertise

their  services.  The one-stop agency is for the convenience  of

the  public  and to prevent confusion.  It will also  result  in

better control of such tradesmen and professionals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit can be called the Housing Services Licensing Unit

and  will exist to help trade associations to set trade,  safety

and   training  standards  to  instill  professionalism.   These

standards can be formulated and applied by the respective  trade

associations  which should have powers to penalise violators  of

their  own ethical standards.  This could include the  power  to

recommend that recalcitrant tradesmen's licences be revoked.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move now to my last amendment. The Minister said

yesterday  that the Government is "still committed to  upgrading

private estates" but has postponed this in these austere  times.

So  that means when good times return and HDB estates have  been

upgraded,  it  will  be the turn of the private  estates  to  be

upgraded.   Even before that time comes, there will be occasions

where MPs would like to improve and maintain the environment  of

their residents in private estates and develop common facilities

such  as  street  furniture, footpaths  and  neighbourhood  park

facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a situation, it will be good to have an

administrative  infrastructure at the local  level  for  MPs  to

improve  the quality of life of their private estate voters.   I

submit that such an agency and infrastructure already exists  in

the  shape  of the town councils.  They have the experience  and

expertise.  They can be given more responsibilities, such as the

provision  of municipal services, such as cleaning  and  garbage

disposal  and the upgrading and maintenance of common facilities

in  such  estates.  The town councils will then be in charge  of

`real'  towns  and  MPs  will no longer  be  in  the  unenviable

position of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>



being  accused  of  neglecting their private  estate  residents.

Would the Minister please study this proposal?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Sir, feedback received from architects,

engineers  and  developers  indicate  that  although  they   are

generally  satisfied with Government regulation on the  building

and  construction  industry, they would like to  see  a  central

regulatory body to coordinate all approvals required, from  fire

safety   to   compliance  with  other  buildings   and   control

regulations.   What I am proposing is basically a one-stop  shop

for  architects, engineers and developers.  It is also  in  line

with  quality  service that the Government has been emphasising.

I  am  not sure how this can be best organised and whether  this

central  body should come under the purview of the  Ministry  of

National  Development  or the Building  Control  Department.   I

would like to ask the Minister to comment on this suggestion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, can I have your permission to take the

three cuts together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Thank you. The first subject is on

Ministry  of Construction.  The construction industry has  grown

into  a  sizeable  sector contributing 7%  to  8%  to  our  GDP.

Despite its growth, the industry is faced with problems  of  low

productivity,  shortage  of skilled labour,  rising  cost,  poor

image  and a slow growth in the export of construction services.

There   is   a  lack  of  concerted  effort  to  spearhead   the

construction industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above problems are attributed to the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Limited authority and resources of the Construction

Industry Development Board (CIDB).  In 1984, the CIDB was set up

to  spearhead,  promote,  develop and monitor  the  construction

industry.   Although  CIDB has achieved  moderate  success,  the

construction industry is still experiencing the same problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CIDB, being a statutory board under the Ministry, has

limited authority and resource constraints.  As a result, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>



construction  industry  is still unable  to  upgrade  to  better

contribute to our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Lack of one-stop approval centre for building

approvals.   The  development of a building  requires  approvals

from various Government departments, such as URA, BCD, ENV, PWD,

and  so  on.   The productivity and workload of these Government

departments vary.  Thus, approvals for projects may  be  delayed

by one or two departments which are either having heavy workload

or less productive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, Government officers are not accountable for the

productivity  of  building projects.   Thus,  they  may  not  be

motivated to expedite the approval process.  We need to  provide

a  one-stop  approval  service for building  projects  and  give

incentives  to  Government officials who have  made  efforts  to

increase the productivity of projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Bad experiences in venturing overseas. A number of

contractors  have ventured overseas but many have lost  lots  of

money.   Some have wound up their businesses.  While contractors

do  not  expect  the Government to provide any direct  financial

assistance,  they  hope the Government will provide  support  to

reduce their risk exposure when venturing overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent initiative by TDB to include Singapore as a

signatory  in  MIGA is indeed a positive step  towards  reducing

political risks faced by firms venturing abroad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Government should also provide incentives

for  banks  and  supporting  industries  to  join  venture  with

construction  firms to form conglomerates which are  capable  of

competing  in the international market.  I understand that  many

construction  firms  are  well  backed  by  private  banks   and

construction-related  firms  when  they  tender   for   projects

overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, countries like Japan, China and Israel have Ministries

of  Construction to spearhead their construction industries.   I

am sure we can learn from these countries and develop a Ministry

of Construction to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>



spearhead  our  construction industry in  the  next  millennium.

Last year, I gave several suggestions to the Minister to upgrade

the  construction industry.  I hope the Minister will update the

House on the status of the upgrading of the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next topic is on construction dispute resolution.

Despite  all  the  Government's initiatives and incentives,  the

productivity of the construction industry is still low.  One  of

the main contributing factors to this phenomenon is the lack  of

teamwork  and adversarial working culture among parties involved

in  a  building  project.  Construction disputes are  common  at

construction   sites.   These  disputes   often   sour   working

relationships, thus resulting in delays in completion  time  and

poor quality of work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases, parties have to go into litigation to

resolve  their  disputes, thus further increasing  the  cost  of

construction.   If  this situation is allowed to  continue,  the

productivity  of  our  construction  industry  will   never   be

improved.   We  need  to  adopt a more cordial  and  cooperative

approach to resolving disputes in the construction industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must commend the Ministry of Law for initiating mediation

as  a  form  of  dispute resolution.  With the  support  of  the

Ministry,  the Singapore Mediation Centre (SMC) was  set  up  in

August 1997 to provide amicable and fair resolution of disputes.

In  addition,  the  SMC  has  formed an  Advisory  Committee  on

Construction    Mediation   comprising   representatives    from

construction related professional bodies to promote mediation in

the construction industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to declare my interest as a member of

this   Advisory  Committee.   To  encourage  mediation  in   the

construction industry, I would urge the Ministry to consider the

following suggestions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Include a mediation clause in the public standard form

of contract to refer all disputes to SMC for resolution.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Include a condition in the sale of land tender

requiring  private  developers to insert a mediation  clause  in

their contract when engaging construction firms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Provide training grant for construction-related

personnel  to  understand the use of mediation  as  a  tool  for

dispute resolution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Provide more support to SMC to run the centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last topic is landscape along roads and expressways. I

agree  with  the National Parks' mission "To make Singapore  our

garden".   But  we  need to adopt a more practical  approach  to

maintaining greenery in Singapore.  In land scarce Singapore, if

we  strictly  adopt  a  "No removal of trees"  policy,  we  will

ultimately face serious maintenance problems in our landscape.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there have been a number of accidents at the

expressways  involving  water tankers  that  were  carrying  out

maintenance works along these roads.  As reported in The Straits

Times  on  27th January 1998, the LTA has made it mandatory  for

contractors  to  install  shock-absorbing  device  to  safeguard

workers  and  motorists.  Instead of solving  the  problem,  the

authority  has  actually placed a device on our  expressway  for

cars  to  knock.   This solution is indeed very  disturbing  and

costs  the  contractor $40,000 to install such a  device.   This

extra  cost  will result in higher construction and  maintenance

cost of our roads.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Ministry to review its policy of

landscaping and growing trees along the central divider of roads

and expressways.  Landscaping along these dividers poses several

problems:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) It requires frequent maintenance, such as watering,

fertilising  and pruning.  The maintenance trucks cause  traffic

congestion and pose safety hazards to other road users.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Mature trees tend to fall or have fallen branches

during  the  monsoon  season,  thus  endangering  the  lives  of

motorists.  Whenever there is a heavy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1585</b></font><br><br>



downpour,  trees along roads are often reported to  have  fallen

and injuring motorists or causing traffic congestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The leaves of trees and shrubs cause blockage of the

drainage  system  along the central divider, thus  resulting  in

water  ponding in certain areas during rainy days.  These  water

ponds  have  caused  cars and motorcycles to skid  resulting  in

accidents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Workers who are maintaining the landscape along central

dividers  tend  to be too engrossed in their work.   Thus,  they

sometimes disregard their own safety.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the above problems, I hope the Ministry could

review  its  policy  to remove all landscape along  the  central

dividers  of our roads and expressways.  In certain expressways,

the  central  divider  is wide enough to be  converted  into  an

emergency  lane  for ambulance or for diverting  traffic  during

congestion.   Furthermore, mature trees along  roads  should  be

tied  back, if possible, to prevent them from falling  onto  our

roads.   The  above measures would certainly improve the  safety

and traffic flow of our roads.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tay is not here. You can continue with

deep sea fish farming.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, my next topic is on deep sea fish

farming.   I must commend the Ministry for conducting the  pilot

study  on  deep  sea fish farming recently.  In resource  scarce

Singapore where most of our food supplies are imported, there is

a  constant  need to search for alternative food sources.   Deep

sea  fish  farming provides an innovative way for  Singapore  to

breed  fish  for local consumption.  I hope the Government  will

provide   more  support  to  develop  this  industry   as   fish

consumption is growing rapidly among Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are a number of concerns which I hope the

Ministry will address and they are as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Experiences in British Columbia and Canada have shown

that salmon aquaculture farm have been the centre of controversy

for  many years.  These farms have been blamed for environmental

degradation and disruption to wild life in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1586</b></font><br><br>



the  ocean.  The problems associated with open caged aquaculture

include  faecal  pollution, release of dangerous pathogens  into

the  marine environment and disruption in the spawning  patterns

of native salmon.  Recently, I met a professor from Finland.  He

told  me  that  the Ministry in Finland has recently  asked  all

school  children  to boycott the purchase of salmon  to  protest

against   the   uncontrollable  pollution  caused   by   private

aquaculture farms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Another report from Vancouver highlighted the spread of

virulent disease by salmon fish farms.  It attributed the spread

of  this disease to the netcage system which usually fills  high

densities of farm fish.  The jammed and stressful conditions  of

these  netcages  become potential breeding grounds  for  disease

epidemic.



<br>2.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am no expert in aquaculture, I hope my feedback

would help the Ministry to ensure that deep-sea fish farming  in

Singapore is both safe and environmentally friendly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to

update  this House on the intended corporatisation of the Public

Works Department.  There is some concern from the private sector

that  the PWD, after corporatisation,  will compete for projects

with the private sector.   The PWD, given its size and technical

expertise  built  up  over many years,  should  focus  on  large

infrastructure   projects   in  Singapore.    It   should   also

regionalise  to  take  advantage of its  brand  name  and  track

record.  It should also consider helping our local building  and

construction  companies to go into the region.  As Singapore  is

such a small nation with limited resources, we should be careful

not  to  engage  in wasteful competition, but  leverage  on  one

another's skills and competitive advantage to get ahead.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, I propose to take the questions on

rentals of HDB commercial premises and the redevelopment of  HDB

industrial estates.  Let me try and explain the situation in the

HDB commercial and industrial rentals.  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>



situation,  in fact, has changed significantly over  the  years.

Since  1988-1989, we have sold the majority of HDB shops.   Now,

more than two-thirds of HDB shops have been sold.  HDB does  not

rent out any more shops except for small neighbourhood complexes

in  the new towns.  Mr Tay Beng Chuan pointed out that the  rate

of  return on HDB's commercial property department has  improved

over the years.  This is so because the more you get rid of  the

shops,  the better your performance.  The HDB shops are  heavily

subsidised.   So, once you sell away two-thirds  of  the  shops,

your performance improves.  When we sell away all the shops, the

performance will be even greater.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November last year, we announced several measures to

help the HDB shop tenants.  As you know, in many HDB shops,  the

rents are far below market rents, and we have this programme  of

moving  the  rents  up to market rents at the third  renewal  of

their  tenancies.   In November last year, we announced  further

moderation of this adjustment.  But we have to do so because  it

is  very  inequitable.  In the same row of shops, you will  have

one  shopowner  who tendered for a HDB shop recently and he will

be  paying  the market rent of $2,500 per month.  Next  to  him,

there will be somebody who has been resettled several years  ago

and  even though his rent has been moving up by 30% every  three

years  -  he started from a very low base of $300 -  now  he  is

perhaps paying $600.  So I think it is not fair to continue with

this situation.   And it is in our interest to move things to  a

more  equal  level playing field and adjust the rents.   But  we

acknowledge that during this period of economic difficulties, we

should moderate this increase, but we must adjust.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another feature is that with two-thirds of our shops sold,

in  fact, any shopkeeper who feels that HDB rentals are too high

can  easily  rent  a shop from the two-thirds who  have  already

bought their shops.  If we look at the classified advertisements

in  the Straits Times and the Chinese papers, we will find  many

advertisements of shops put out for rent by shopkeepers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>



who  have already bought their shops from the HDB.  In fact, the

market  rent is now set by shopkeepers who own their  shops  and

who are now renting or sub-letting their shops.  So HDB does not

set  the market price.  Two-thirds of the shops are now sold and

this is the group that is now setting the market price.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in the November announcement, we decided on a

one-time  exercise to adjust the rents downwards to  the  market

rent.   As  you know, in HDB tenancies, we will keep  the  rents

frozen  for three years and then adjust it at the end of the  3-year tenancy.  We could have kept the rent at current levels and

then  adjust the rent downwards at the end of the 3-year tenancy

when the rent is due for renewal.  By December, we decided on  a

one-time  exercise to adjust all the rents down  to  the  market

rent,  subject  to  a maximum of 10% drop.  So,  based  on  this

announcement in November, as of today, 2,380 commercial  tenants

and  2,472  industrial tenants have benefitted from  the  rental

concessions introduced in December 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike what Mr Tay Beng Chuan has said, I think HDB has

done more than its fair share to help the shop tenants ease over

during this period.   Again, I can reiterate what Dr Richard  Hu

said, if the situation worsens, he is prepared to consider other

off-Budget measures to assist the SMEs even further.  So I think

you  will not find a more sympathetic landlord than the HDB with

regard to HDB shops and the industrial shops.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the redevelopment of HDB industrial

estates.   I agree with Dr Ker and Mr Lew Syn Pau that  the  HDB

industrial  estates are very old.  Some of them were built  more

than  20  years ago and sorely need redevelopment or  upgrading.

HDB  has  about 10,600 industrial premises under its management.

About  55%  are  single storey terrace workshops  built  in  the

1970s.   The remainder are high-rise industrial shops which  are

about 15 years old.  The House has heard the various problems in

the   industrial  estates.   They  were  built  with  inadequate

electrical loading to meet present needs.  The parking situation

is tight because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>



SMEs  now  use  low  loaders.  They use container  trucks.   The

industrial  estates  were not designed for  such  heavy  vehicle

movement.    Therefore,  last  year,  HDB  announced   a   major

redevelopment programme for its industrial estates.  The purpose

of  this redevelopment is two-fold: (1) to optimise the  use  of

these  sites to build it high-rise, greater intensity so  as  to

optimise  land  use; and (2) to provide better  facilities  that

will   meet  the  operational  requirements  of  the  industrial

tenants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This redevelopment is necessary and long overdue. I know

many  SME tenants will argue that during this difficult  period,

this will cause a disruption.  But no time is a good time.  When

business  is  good,  they will say, "Don't  disturb  me.   I  am

rushing to fulfill my orders."  When business is bad, they  say,

"Don't disturb me.  I can't afford to be going to new premises."

If  we  do  not  do  anything, the premises do  not  meet  their

requirement  and,  over  time,  they  will  be  less  and   less

competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think we must press ahead with the HDB industrial

redevelopment.   What  we  will do  is  to  incorporate  certain

features  that  will help ease them over to these new  premises.

First  of  all,  for  every trade, we  set  up  a  committee  to

understand the requirements of the individual trade.   The  food

industry  is  different from the motor  car  workshops.   It  is

different  from  the light electronics.  So we  have  committees

which  will look into the needs of each trade, so that  when  we

redesign  and redevelop the industrial premises, they will  meet

the needs of each trade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, with this redevelopment, we will also provide the

opportunity  to rehouse the tenants from closely related  trades

within  the  same  industrial complex for better  synergy.   The

premises  will be bigger.  There will be higher ceiling heights,

higher  electrical loads and, therefore, better attuned  to  the

modern  needs of our SMEs.  As far as possible, the  replacement

units  built  by HDB will be located within the same  estate  to

minimise the loss of business goodwill and workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For tenants who are affected by relocation, I take Mr Lew

Syn Pau's point.  We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1590</b></font><br><br>



will  give  them  ample notice to minimise disruption  to  their

business  operations.   Industrial  tenants  affected  by   this

relocation  will be given an ex-gratia compensation  of  $48,000

per  unit.  They are also given an option to either purchase  or

rent  the  replacement units.  Purchasing, of course, will  free

the  tenants from uncertainty in rent review.  HDB will  try  to

keep  the  prices  at affordable levels by  selling  them  at  a

shorter  lease  period of 30 years.  Singapore  citizen  tenants

will be given a 5% discount of the market price.  For industrial

tenants who opt to rent the units, they will continue to pay the

existing  rental  rates  on a per square  metre  basis  for  the

remaining  term  of their existing tenancies.   They  will  also

enjoy  a two-month rent- free fitting up period.  This rent-free

fitting  up period will be extended to six months for  Singapore

citizen tenants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all these programmes in place, together with the

assistance and the financial schemes offered by the Productivity

and  Standards  Board  for local SMEs, I am  sure  we  can  work

closely together to make sure this redevelopment programme  meet

their needs and puts them on a more competitive footing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the next set of questions raised by Dr Toh

See  Kiat,  Mr  Lew  Syn  Pau and Dr Teo on  licensing,  central

regulatory  body  and  Ministry  of  Construction.   My  general

comment to all these points is that there is a standing joke  in

the  civil  service that whenever you get a Minister  or  a  new

Permanent Secretary, to create a sense of change, you centralise

if  the  previous  administration had  decentralised.   And  you

decentralise if the previous administration had centralised.  So

there  is this fad of moving in the spectrum.  This also happens

in the private sector.  You have conglomerates.  Then, in recent

years,  everybody has downsized, core competence,  sub-contract.

Now, you are back to mergers and acquisitions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not intend to go into the merits or demerits of

centralisation  or decentralisation.  I just want  to  make  the

point  that we have arrived at where we are.  We do not  have  a

one-stop  service  for  all  the  building  regulations,  first,

because it is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1591</b></font><br><br>



practical.  You have a super-mega Ministry.  I have no  interest

in  heading  such  a  Ministry.  It is impractical  because  the

regulatory  expertise  lies  in  different  Ministries  and   in

different professionals.  So it is not possible to put them  all

together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we try to do, of course, is to use IT to overcome some

of  these problems.  With the setting up of CoreNet and other IT

applications, you are virtually dealing with a one-stop service,

without physically and administratively putting everybody in one

Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take Dr Teo's point about the merits of a Ministry of

Construction.   Again, personally, I do not see  the  need.   We

have  CIDB  to  spearhead the requirements of  the  construction

sector.   I share the same frustration with Dr Teo in  that  the

construction sector is not improving in productivity as much  as

we  would  like  to,  but  we have different  groups  of  people

tackling  this  issue  together with the Singapore  Contractors'

Association.  I will be very happy to enlist the help of Dr  Teo

in  many  of these committees, so that he can apply his  talents

into some of these issues.



<br>2.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for licensing of household services, basically the

Government licenses or regulates only if there is a safety issue

involved.  For example, Mr Goh Choon Kang very eloquently talked

about  the dangers posed by old air-conditioner units.  I  share

his  view,  and in this type of situation you will see  the  HDB

getting  more  involved in the act.  But it is not  possible  to

license  good  service.  How do Singaporeans choose  the  motor-repair  workshop?   You do not license it,  you  let  the  Motor

Repair  Association  self-regulate.  How do Singaporeans  choose

their  own hair-dressers?  You do not regulate.  Service  levels

cannot  be regulated.  So I sympathize entirely with Dr Toh  See

Kiat.   All  I  can  say is CASE is doing great  work.   Anytime

Singaporeans  face such problems they are encouraged  to  go  to

CASE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases where they masquerade as HDB contractors, we will

go after them.  In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1592</b></font><br><br>



cases  like, for example, the real estate agents, we  will  take

steps  to  educate  them.  HDB in fact runs afternoon  seminars,

both  in English and Mandarin, so that you need not go to a real

estate  agent to sell your flat or to buy a resale flat.  Attend

these  seminars, free of charge, or you pay a  small  fee.   HDB

will take you through how to transact a resale flat and you  are

on your own.  So similarly for all the other household services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps one suggestion that Dr Toh can take is to have term

contractors within your town councils and advertise  these  term

contractors as reliable contractors for your residents.  That is

one practical solution you can take to help your residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the expansion of the jurisdiction of town councils, I am

also very reluctant to do so.  If Dr Toh can solicit the support

of  more Members of this House, I would then consider it.  I  do

not  think  it  is  a good idea to take over looking  after  the

common property of private housing estates.  They are very  well

taken  care of through their own management corporation.   I  do

not see why you want the town councils to do extra work.  If  we

do  implement the upgrading of the common areas in  the  private

housing estates, we will find a mechanism by which there will be

a  Government  agency  to help the MP  or  the  Advisor  to  the

grassroots  organizations to implement the  programme.   But  it

need not necessarily be undertaken by the town councils.  So off-hand,  I would not support the expansion of the jurisdiction  of

town  councils  until I get more favourable support  from  other

Members because this will affect every Member in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will ask Mr Koo Tsai Kee to take the other questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National

Development (Mr Koo Tsai Kee):  Sir, I refer to the question  by

Prof  Chin Tet Yung.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Minister and I share the plight of some of these

divorcees,  the  problems that have been raised by  the  Member.

But I think we have got to re-focus back on basics.  What is the

mission of HDB?  What



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1593</b></font><br><br>



is  their prime objective?  Their prime objective is to  provide

subsidized public housing for all Singaporeans who qualify,  but

in  particular, with special emphasis for first-timers.   So  to

the  extent that HDB has provided HDB flats to the couple before

they  divorced, or even after they had divorced, you  find  that

HDB  has done its primary job.  If HDB were to waive the 10-year

embargo  for  divorcees, we risk slipping into  what  economists

call  "moral hazard", which is the story for the last  6  months

since  the crisis in Thailand broke out.  The problem the Member

has  raised is real and the Ministry will look into it.  But the

problem  is not as serious as he has raised because the divorced

couple  has  an HDB flat.  If they had lived in it for  5  years

they can sell it on the resale market.  The proceeds can be used

to rent an apartment or a flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the divorced couple are very poor, in the case cited by

Prof  Chin - if the wife especially earns below $800  -  we  can

look  at the case sympathetically and HDB is prepared, on a case

by  case basis, to waive the 30-month debarment.  When you  sell

your  flat  you have got to wait for 30 months to  apply  for  a

rental flat.  If he or she is very poor, then we are prepared to

look   into  this  30-month  debarment,  provided  the  divorcee

satisfies all other rental conditions.  So I hope the Member  is

satisfied  with  the  answer.  If he  knows  of  any   specially

deserving  cases, he is welcome to write to me and we will  look

at it specially.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue raised by Dr Teo Ho Pin on HDB car parks, I

have  asked my officers to give me a report.  He tells  me  that

there  are  adequate car park lots provided in  semi-mature  HDB

estates,  especially those since mid-1980s when the  norms  were

fairly  generous.  In Bukit Panjang, where he  is  the  MP,  for

instance, the overall season parking rate is only about 60%.  So

there  is  no  real serious problem in Bukit Panjang.   However,

there could be local problems.  The problem is that some of  his

residents may be reluctant to go to a car park which is slightly

further  away,  say 100-150 metres.  That is why  HDB  has  this

grouping  system  where we group a few car  parks  together  and

encourage residents within the zone to share these car



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1594</b></font><br><br>



park  spaces.  Just for Dr Teo's information, there are  34  HDB

car  parks comprising 11,866 lots in Bukit Panjang estate.   But

the only car park with localized shortage is car park group G20.

I  am  not sure if he is referring to that, but that is the only

localized shortage in the area.  About 5-6% of the residents are

unable  to  purchase a season parking ticket for this  car  park

group.  HDB will look into this special problem and will come up

with some solutions and will inform the MP in due time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue raised by Mr Ong Ah Heng on ceiling leak and

spalling  concrete, first let me distinguish  between  the  two.

Spalling  concrete  is considered a surface maintenance  defect.

There  is  no  cost sharing between the upper  and  lower  floor

lessees  for  spalling concrete within the flats as  it  is  the

lessee's responsibility to repair them.  But I think Mr Ong  was

referring  to  the  ceiling  leakage  problem,  particularly  in

toilets.   Under  the  lease, as he  rightly  pointed  out,  the

parties  sharing  the  use  of  a  party-structure  are  jointly

responsible for its maintenance.  Hence the affected  upper  and

lower  lessees  are required to engage their own  contractor  to

rectify the leaking problem and share the cost of repair  works.

Mr  Ong  is not disputing that this should be the case.   He  is

asking  for  faster remedial action on the part of   HDB  and  I

think  he is appealing to HDB to apply some kind of pressure  on

the  tenants, the upper floor and lower tenants, to  settle  the

problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB on its part will assist lessees to diagnose and

determine   the   cause  of  the  leakage  and  will   recommend

appropriate remedial action.  As to the time lead,  I  will  ask

HDB  to  look into the problem and see whether they can  shorten

it.   But the problem is really not HDB.  The problem is  really

the  tenants, both on the upper floor and lower floor.  I  think

they should take joint responsibility.  They should realise that

when   they  inhabit  the  flats  there  are  certain  ownership

responsibilities and this is one of them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the problem is not very serious. In 1997, only about

1%  out  of  11,000 ceiling leakage cases has such difficulties.

If the leakage is really very bad and affects the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1595</b></font><br><br>



structural  integrity  of  the  building,  then  HDB  will  take

immediate  legal action to enter the premises to carry  out  the

repair and recover the cost from the lessees.  This action will,

as  the MP will appreciate, only be carried out as a last resort

because this is a very drastic action and we respect the  rights

of   the  owners.   Indeed  this  is  practised  widely  in  the

condominiums where the MC will refrain from interfering  in  the

problem of the upper and lower floor neighbours.  They will only

go in when the problem becomes acute.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Transitional Rental Housing Scheme (TRHS), my friend and

MP,  Mr  Sinnakaruppan,  has brought  out  this  problem.   TRHS

exercises  are conducted quarterly, every three months.   First-timer  applicants  who  have been on the Registration  of  Flats

System (RFS) for at least three months are eligible to apply for

TRHS  flats.  I have been told that if you applied  for  a  flat

before  July  last  year then you qualify to go  into  the  TRHS

exercise in January in the next quarter.  Applicants who are not

shortlisted  are nonetheless placed on the reserve list  and  if

there  are  rejected flats then we will ask the  people  on  the

reserve list to select one of these rejected flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked how fast people who have been invited to

select  TRHS flat can get the flats.  In fact, if the applicants

are  not  choosy, they can get it very quickly because over  the

last  year, HDB has increased both the supply and moderated  the

demand.   He mentioned some of the supply modifications HDB  has

made.  HDB has bought more 3-room flats from the open market for

TRHS  applicants.   We  have offered 1-  and  2-room  flats  for

selection,  in addition to 3-room flats.  But very  importantly,

we  have also opened a category called "Flat Sharing".   I  hope

the Member is aware of that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If somebody comes to your MPS and says he needs a flat very

urgently  because  his wife is pregnant or his mother-in-law  is

having problems with him, then we tell him that there is a group

of  flats  called  the "Flat Sharing Scheme",  where  if  he  is

willing to share a flat with somebody else



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1596</b></font><br><br>



and  pay  half the rental and share half the responsibility,  he

can  get  the  flat  almost immediately.  In  fact,  I  can  say

immediately, because the drop-out rate is very high.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in the January TRHS exercise, we offered 600

flats  -   500 flats for non-sharing and 100 flats for  sharing.

We  invited 1,233 applicants to select these flats.  Out of  the

500 applicants selected to pick the TRHS flats, we find that 196

rejected  the flat.  In other words, I offer you a flat,  I  say

"If  you want, there you are."  You say "I don't want because  I

want a better area or I want a better height."  So it is not on.

Even for this group of flats, with assured allocation, the fall-out  rate  is  very  high, almost 20%.  For the  100  flats  for

sharing  purpose, eight took up the offer.  So 92 flats went  a-begging.   For  people  who  really want  a  flat  urgently  for

whatever reasons, my answer to the MP is, if they are not choosy

about  location, if they are not choosy, if they not  too  picky

about privacy, they can get it immediately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I go to the problem raised by Mr Chay Wai Chuen. I think

he  is  quite  right.   As  a rule, URA  does  not  approve  any

independent  retail space in industrial or warehouse development

for  retail  purposes  for  the  reasons  pointed  out  by  him.

However,  showrooms are allowed within the 40% floor area  which

can  be  used for ancillary purposes like office and  cafeteria.

Showrooms  are  restricted only to the  first  storey  level  of

industrial or warehouse developments fronting major roads.   URA

will continue to take enforcement action on unauthorized use  of

industrial or warehouse space for independent retail activities.

There  are  a few in town.  We will look at them and  regularise

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo raised the issue of cost reduction for public

projects.  First of all, I would like to thank him for giving us

very good ideas.   On design-and-build tenders, he suggests that

all Government departments should follow HDB's practice.  I want

to  thank him for complimenting HDB.  This problem has also been

highlighted  in  the  Ministry's  dialogue  with  the  Singapore

Contractors  Association Limited.  They have raised the  problem

that it is very expensive for contractors to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>



go  for design-and-build projects one after another if they fail

in  a few of them.  So we will look into how we can minimise the

cost  for contractors,  because we want to encourage contractors

to  go  for  design-and-build.  This is what Singaporeans  want.

They are prepared to pay a premium for design-and-build flats.



<br>3.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also suggested that all Government departments should

adopt  HDB's approach in purchasing basic building materials  in

bulk  for contractors working in their projects.  This is  going

to  be  very  difficult.  I think it is  not  possible  for  all

Government  departments because none of them have  the  kind  of

volume  of  building programme, like the HDB's.  Certainly  not,

for  example,  Ministry  of Labour; certainly  not  Ministry  of

Education.  They build schools but they are not building in  the

volume that HDB is building flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of Clerks-of-Works and Professional Engineers

(PEs)  has  also  been  highlighted by SCAL.   The  Ministry  is

looking   into   how  we  can  ameliorate  the  problem.    But,

essentially,  the problem must be solved by the contractors  and

the  developers.   It  is a developer and contractor's  problem.

Some  Clerks-of-Works are demanding, for example, concreting  at

night,  thereby jacking up the cost for contractors and creating

noise for residents.  The contractors are very welcome to file a

complaint to BCD, CIDB or to the Ministry officials, and we will

look  at it.  But I understand that SCAL is reluctant to  finger

Clerks-of-Works who are corrupt in their mind and we have  asked

SCAL that they must regularise.  We can only help them, but they

must  take  action on their part.  But, nonetheless, I  want  to

assure the MPs that the Ministry is looking into this problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On standardisation and modernisation, the Member encouraged

public   projects   to   adopt  pre-fab   components,   pre-cast

components, in order to speed up the construction process and to

save  construction cost.  This is being done extensively by HDB.

HDB has a pre-fab technology centre.  I think the MP has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>



visited  it.   For  public  projects, there  is  no  problem  in

encouraging  contractors  to use standardised  components.   The

problem really lies in the private sector.  This is because most

Singaporeans   think   that  pre-fab  buildings   are   not   so

aesthetically  beautiful.  They prefer specially designed,  one-off  buildings.   Nonetheless, the Ministry is  aware  that  the

productivity  in the construction sector is rather  low  and  we

think  that one way to go about it is to encourage more  pre-fab

components.   Perhaps  in  the near future,  we  will  think  of

legislating buildable designs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On project financing, the MP made a few suggestions. He

said  that Government should give initial payment, then,  timely

progress  payments,  and then early settlement  of  final  cost.

Initial  payment is not possible.  The Government can  only  pay

when something is being done, because we are dealing with public

money.   We cannot pay the contract when no work is being  done.

I notice sometimes it happens in the private sector.  But we are

dealing  with public funds, so initial payment is not  possible.

Timely  progress  payments, this is always done.   HDB  and  PWD

always make timely progress payments.  In fact, because HDB, PWD

and  all the Government bodies are such good pay masters we  are

seeing a flood of contracts recently.  Early settlement of final

accounts,  this  is always done.  We always pay  promptly.   Our

problem  is  that we have to chase contractors to  finish  their

jobs early, not that we are delaying their payments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPs suggested providing housing for foreign workers. This

is also a point raised by Mr Sinnakaruppan.  This point has also

been  raised  by SCAL.  So we are looking into how we  can  help

contractors house foreign workers.  One possible way may  be  to

allocate land to SCAL to build dormitory housing, but this is in

a  very initial stage, and I would let the MPs know more of  the

details later on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On disposal of construction wastes, the MP suggested

employing  term  contractors to clear all the debris  caused  by

construction in zones.  Maybe in the western zone, you have  two

term contractors; the northern zone you have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1599</b></font><br><br>



three   term   contractors.   So  these  contractors   will   be

responsible  for clearing all the debris generated  by  all  the

construction within the zone.  I think this is not very easy  to

implement.  But, nonetheless, I will ask the officials  to  look

at  it.   Basically  we  do not know the volume  of  work  in  a

particular sector of Singapore, because some of this information

are  time-sensitive.  So how do we call for contracts?   How  do

term contractors price their services?  Because they do not know

the volume of work that is coming down, and you cannot tell them

that  certain  activities will be started in  one  year  or  two

years' time.  These are price-sensitive information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan made a strong pitch for Government to

regulate  the use of private residential properties as  boarding

houses.   For  the  whole  of 1997, URA received  979  cases  of

unauthorised  use of residential premises as workers'  quarters.

While  I  concede that this may be a low number, but if  Members

know  of  any  abuse  of residential units as  boarding  houses,

please  let  us  know.   URA has taken  enforcement  action  and

cleared 895, or 91%, of the cases we know.  The remaining  cases

are still under active enforcement.  As to the specific areas he

mentioned  (Cambridge  Road, Sing Avenue, Joo  Avenue,  Carlisle

Road),  URA  is  particularly active because  the  MP  has  been

particularly  active in complaining, and that is good  for  him.

The  URA  has sent 26 warning letters to the persons responsible

to  cease  the use.  I think they have ceased.  Six  cases  have

complied, and enforcement notices will be served on the rest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we solve the foreign worker problem? This is

something  that  everybody  must put  their  mind  to,  but,  in

particular, the people who employ foreign workers.   It  is  not

the   Government's  job  to  employ  foreign  workers.   It   is

Government's job to house Singaporeans, and already  we  have  a

headache.  I think we cannot be encumbered with trying to  solve

housing  for foreign workers.  But it is a problem.  So  HDB  is

assisting in whatever way it can.  But it is not HDB's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1600</b></font><br><br>



problem.   HDB is extending its goodwill and trying to  solve  a

problem  that  has infected the whole of Singapore,  because  we

have  too many foreign workers, and Members are complaining that

the foreigner workers levy is too heavy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to solve the problem is to allocate land for

dormitory  housing.  The MP has alluded to that.  JTC will  also

be  able  to buy HDB flats to rent out to foreign workers.   MPs

raised a point that the Planning Act does not specify the number

of  persons that can live in a house.  That is correct.  Because

these are private houses and some of them have large families (3-generation  or  4-generation families).  So  we  cannot  take  a

particular  number.   But some numbers are obviously  irregular.

For  example, if a house has 100 workers, of course, it is  used

as  a  boarding house.  If a house has 30 workers, I think, then

straightaway, we will know that that house is likely to be  used

as  a  boarding  house.  So although there  is  no  number,  the

magnitude  of  the number, a reasonable number, is a  suggestion

that a particular house is used as a boarding house.  So if  the

number is, say, 10 to 15, please let us know.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> 30 to 40.

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Definitely it is used as a boarding house.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have no numbers for a private home owner on how

many  people  he can rent out to, we have some numbers  for  HDB

flats.   For  example, JTC flats which are used to rent  out  to

workers,  it  says that for 3-room flats, we do not  allow  more

than  10 workers in a 3-room flat; in a 4-room flat, we  do  not

allow more than12 workers.  For the dormitory housing scheme, we

have  certain  norms.   In a 1-room, maximum  six  occupiers;  2

rooms,  maximum eight occupiers; 3-room, 10 occupiers; 4  and  5

rooms, maximum 12 occupiers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I urge the Member to be a bit tolerant about the

foreign  worker  housing situation.  Because these  workers  are

here  to contribute to Singapore's economy and they are not like

what  the  MP  said,  prisoners housed in  worse  conditions  in

prisons.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1601</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On old air-conditioning units in high-rise buildings, Mr

Goh Choon Kang has pointed out the problem.  Currently, HDB flat

owners  must obtain HDB's approval before they can install  air-conditioners.   If the air-conditioner has been mounted  on  the

exterior  of  the  flat,  flat owners are  required,  under  the

Building Control Act, to engage a CIDB trained installer.   This

was  done  last  year.   So  we  are  moving  one  step  towards

regulating the installation of air-conditioners.  And  over  the

years,  HDB  has  also  taken measures  to  further  secure  the

installation   of  air-conditioners.   Since   1990,   all   the

supporting brackets for new installation of air-conditioners are

to  be  made  of  stainless steel which  is  more  resistant  to

corrosion  than the former mild steel brackets.   In  1992,  HDB

introduced  the  service balcony for flat owners  to  place  the

condensers  of  split  air-conditioned  units.   In  1995,   HDB

designed  the recess laundry area where a ledge with railing  is

provided  for  flat  owners  to  place  their  condensers.   The

provision of such a ledge further prevents air-conditioners from

falling.  So these are various measures that are in place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all these will come to naught if the flat owners

do   not   take  ownership  and  responsibility  for  the   air-conditioners.  Ultimately, it is the flat owner's responsibility

to check and ensure that the air-conditioners and the supporting

structures are in good condition.  In 1994, HDB sent out letters

to  remind flat owners that they are responsible for checking on

the  air-conditioners and to maintain them in good condition  at

all  times.   So  HDB  has done its job.  We have  reminded  the

owners.   Very often, the owners ignore.  In addition,  HDB  has

advised  flat  owners  how to go about  maintaining  their  air-conditioners.   And HDB will continue to advise flat  owners  to

take immediate action if they spot any air-conditioners that are

not properly maintained during the inspection round.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from the incident highlighted by the Member, the

Building  Control Division of PWD will look into the possibility

of legislating the requirement for window air-conditioning units

installed in high-rise buildings.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1602</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to Dr Teo Ho Pin's comments on construction

dispute resolution.  I want to thank him for the many ideas that

he has given us.  I want to say that the Government supports the

Member's  suggestion and will encourage the use of the mediation

process  to  settle construction-related disputes,  because  the

process  is  less costly, not adversarial, and takes  less  time

than  arbitration.   Moreover, the cordial relationship  between

the  two parties is also retained, so that the construction work

can progress quickly to completion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the CIDB, together with HDB and PWD, is currently

finalising  the  mediation clause to  be  included  into  public

sector  conditions of contract.  But Dr Teo wants us to  go  one

step  further.  He wants us to put this clause in all Government

land  sales.  I think this is not possible.  We do not  want  to

encumber  the prospective buyer with more and more clauses.   If

the developer is enlightened, he will encourage mediation and he

will  look  for a contractor who is pro-mediation.  So  I  think

putting  the  clause in land sale is unwise.  Nonetheless,  CIDB

will  work  with REDAS and the Singapore Institute of Architects

to   have   similar  clauses  for  private  sector  construction

projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised several points in his speech. He wants grants

for  construction- related personnel to understand  the  use  of

mediation.  I ask him to lobby the Minister for Finance and  the

Minster  for Trade and Industry.  He hopes to have more  support

for the SMC.  CIDB will work closely with SMC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo went on to the next topic - landscaping along roads

and  expressways.   I  think,  first,  we  must  settle  a  very

important  issue here.  The National Parks Board does  not  want

the  central dividers there.  The central dividers are there for

a very important reason, and that reason is safety.  The primary

purpose  of  central dividers along expressways and other  major

multi-lane  roads  is to separate opposing streams  of  traffic.

They travel at high speeds.  So if there is a head-on collision,

it  will  be  a serious accident.  The provision of the  central

dividers is necessary to prevent head-on collision



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1603</b></font><br><br>



and  reckless  overtaking.   This  will  ensure  the  safety  of

drivers.  Since the central dividers are there, we might as well

make  good  use  of them.  And that is where the National  Parks

came  in.   The  National Parks Board came in to  green  up  the

central   dividers   for  the  pleasure  of  all   Singaporeans.

Singapore  has  earned the reputation as  being  a  Garden  City

mostly because of its kerb side greenery.  So you will find that

the  idea to remove plants, flowers and trees along the  central

divider will not go down well with most Singaporeans.  The  tree

planting along the central dividers softens the harshness of the

concrete jungle that we live in.  I am sure that many members of

the  public who drive along the ECP and AYE will enjoy the  cool

comfort  provided  by the trees.  But, of course,  the  National

Parks is aware of the points raised by Dr Teo and they are  very

mindful of the safety aspects in maintaining the greenery  along

major roads and expressways.



<br>3.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, National Parks has worked very closely

with  LTA.  It is not just a problem of National Parks.   It  is

also a problem of LTA.  We are working on roads and the National

Parks  is taking the prescribed measures of public safety.   The

National  Parks  will  continue to enhance the  safety  measures

where possible and viable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo raised the point that the fitting of a truck mounted

attenuator (TMA) actually encourages vehicles to crash on to it.

This  is an exaggeration, to put it mildly.  The fitting of  TMA

will  not eradicate the hazard but it does minimise the loss  of

lives when the time comes, hopefully, never.  National Parks has

strict  criteria on when to water the plants along  the  central

divider  and  how  to  water  them.   For  stationary  vehicles,

National Parks staff and contractors are required to comply with

a whole set of provisions, for example, they have to place cones

and  make  sure  that  the yellow arrows  are  lighted.   It  is

necessary  for the watering vehicles to be mobile to  water  the

central divider plants



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>



and we do so during non-peak hours.  So it is unlikely that such

watering routine will cause traffic jams.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo seems to forget that accidents can be caused by both

parties.  So it is also pertinent to remind all of us that  when

we  travel  on  the highways, we should be on the look  out  for

stationary vehicles, especially those with cones behind them and

big  yellow arrows flashing about.  We should also adhere to the

safe  speed limit.  If these conditions are observed by  all  of

us,  I  think there should be very, very few accidents involving

National Parks watering trucks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On deep sea fishing, I think Dr Teo might have scared all

the  Teochews  about eating fish, and I remind  the  House  that

there  are many Teochews in the Cabinet.  Here, I would like  to

reassure  the House that the fears are unfounded.   So  you  can

carry  on eating fish.  Our deep netcage fish farms are designed

based  on  the  Norwegians' 20 years' experience.  He  mentioned

about  the  Canadian experience.  Fortunately, we do  not  model

after  the Canadian.  We knew the problem.  So we went to Norway

and also Greece.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Norwegian fish farming technique is so

advanced.  They have leapfrogged from a minor salmon breeder  to

a  major salmon exporter.  In fact, most of the salmons you find

in  Singapore, in NTUC Fairprice, come from Norway.   And  I  am

sure  that you will enjoy the taste.  There is no problem.   The

experience  of  British  Columbia in  Canada  is  therefore  not

relevant to us and I will explain why later on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, our deep sea netcages are sited off St John's

Island in deep open waters.  The waste built up within the  cage

can  be readily dispersed in the open sea by the currents.   The

water  depth  in  the  area where we put the  deep  sea  netcage

exceeds  10  metres and the currents there exceed 1  knot.   The

netcages   are  spaced  out  quite  evenly  apart   to   prevent

overcrowding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British Columbian problem came about because they put

the aquaculture netcages along the migratory path of the salmon,

especially in the mouth of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1605</b></font><br><br>



rivers  where the salmons return to spawn annually.  So that  is

the  reason, because you disrupted their mating habits and their

migratory  patterns.   And I have been told  that  although  the

British  Columbian  problem  may be real,  in  the  Scandinavian

countries,  they  have  no  such problems.   Intensive  farming,

whether it is fish stock, chickens or pigs, comes with a  higher

risk  of diseases.  However, with good veterinarians in the PPD,

good  disease  control  techniques,  good  management  and  good

vaccines,  I  think  the  problem  can  be  minimised,  if   not

eradicated altogether.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On corporatisation of PWD, the last topic raised in the

series  of cuts by Mr Lew Syn Pau, PWD Corporation is likely  to

be  corporatised or privatised next year.  And I want to  assure

the  Member  that his suggestion will be taken up, namely,  that

PWD Corporation will cooperate with private sector architectural

companies,   engineering   companies   and   quantity   surveyor

companies.   Of course, PWD Corporation must also  compete  with

them  and provide a benchmark for an integrated engineering  and

architectural  services  to  take  on  regional  infrastructural

projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why corporatise? Because the corporatisation of PWD will

allow  a  leaner  and  trimmer  Government  to  concentrate   on

delivering  essential public services, such  as  regulatory  and

planning functions.  So we will keep the regulatory arm  of  PWD

which  is the BCD.  We believe that the PWD Corporation will  be

able  to  set  new  standards of engineering  and  architectural

excellence in Singapore after corporatisation.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, a point of clarification. Mr Lim

said  in his reply that the management corporation's work should

not  be taken over.  I do agree.  But in my examples, they  were

all   public  facilities.   Management  corporations  deal  with

private facilities.  If the Minister is agreeable that upgrading

will  be done, my question is: why not town councils?  I do  not

expect  to persuade the Minister immediately.  But I think  some

thought should be planted.  I would also thank the Minister  for

praising  the good work CASE has done on a peanut  budget.   Now

that he has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1606</b></font><br><br>



passed  the buck back to CASE, perhaps, he would like to move  a

few hundred thousand bucks our way too.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, just a few points of clarification.

One, I am surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary has got the

figure  from his officer about the 60% season parking  in  Bukit

Panjang.  They must have included a lot of new multi-storey  car

parks  where  the  residents have not moved in.   Because  three

months  ago, I went there and noticed that about 90% of the  car

parks  were  all taken up.  But the Parliamentary Secretary  has

not  answered my suggestions concerning the equalisation of  car

park fees and converting the unused land space to car parks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is on bulk materials. What I mean is that

HDB  is doing a good job.  But can the other Ministries also tap

on  HDB's  bulk  purchase of materials, that  is,  MOE  can  buy

concrete  or sand from HDB?  So the contractors can  reduce  the

cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is about the central dividers. I know there

is  a  need for a central divider.  What I am trying to  say  is

that  you may not need to landscape the central divider heavily.

You do not need to maintain those trees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is on deep sea fishing. I know the method

used in Singapore is different.  But if you put 30,000 fishes in

one  cage,  it does not matter whether the current is strong  or

not,  because  the  faeces are still  polluting  the  sea.   The

current  is  not important at all because it will still  pollute

St. John's Island.

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, I thank the Member for giving me a

chance  to clarify some of the points which I forgot to clarify.

He asked whether unused land space in semi-mature estates can be

converted to car park spaces.  I think it is not fair to convert

empty land spaces in semi-mature estates to car parks unless  we

can  establish that there is a real shortage of car parks in the

grouping  system.  The reason is that most people in  the  semi-mature estates do not own cars.  So they enjoy the greenery, the

space  and  the  comfort of the openness.  If  you  block  their

visual comfort, they will come to you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>



and  me  and  say,  "You  block my  fong  shui.   You  block  my

geomancy."  There are cases like that which have come to me.  So

my  immediate  reaction is that we have got to be  very  careful

about  taking away open space and putting a concrete block there

unless there is a real need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether we need to plant so many different kind of plants

along  central  dividers, I do not think we  crowd  the  central

dividers  with  too many hybrids of plants.  For a  very  simple

reason,  if  you over plant, you will find that the plants  will

not  flourish.  We want to plant the optimum number so that  you

will get the most beautiful bloom.  I do not think there is over

planting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of bulk purchase and whether contractors

for  MINDEF or MOL projects can tap into HDB's supplier of  sand

and  granite,  I  have got to ask HDB whether  they  have  spare

capacity or not.  My understanding is that HDB has a very  tight

schedule  in  completing all the HDB flats for so  many  people.

Right  now, we have something like 130,000 people on the waiting

list.  So I think HDB's first priority is to build the flats for

people  in  the queue.  Contractors working on MOL  projects  or

MINDEF  projects  are usually working on smaller  projects  like

building  an  army camp or a small building.  So they  can  take

care  of  the  construction materials  themselves.   As  HDB  is

dealing  with  something like 30,000 flats  a  year,  its  first

priority must be to protect the construction materials  for  its

core contractors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On deep sea fishing, so far, we have not detected any

diseases in the fish that are growing off St John's Island.   In

fact, during the last visit of the GPC, we heartily tucked  into

some  of  these                  (jin mu lu) fish  or  what  the

Australians call barracuda.  Dr Teo and I are still healthy.   I

think the problem is not so serious.  It is not real.  I do  not

think it is a problem here.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister and the

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2), Mr Choo Wee Khiang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code UA 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Sir, Singapore is a small country with a lot

of  people  and  very  little land.   Property  being  a  scarce

commodity tends to be very expensive.  However, because  of  the

recent   regional  financial   turmoil,   property   prices   in

Singapore  have dropped.  Even then, the prices are  still  very

much  on the high side to the people in general.    This is  the

representative view of the majority of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the ordinary citizens of Singapore, owning a piece of

property is one of the most important things in life.  Yet, when

one wants to buy or sell a property, he will have to turn to the

housing  agencies  for  help, as property transactions  are  too

complicated a matter to be handled by the laymen themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the housing agency is good or bad makes a lot of

difference  to  the buyers and  sellers.  In my  meet-the-people

sessions,  I  have  come across complaints against  bad  housing

agencies  who  gave a lot of troubles to their clients,  causing

them  not  only lots of inconvenience but also monetary  losses.

Therefore, I urge  the Government to provide some form of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1609</b></font><br><br>



assistance  and protection to the  general population  in  their

property transactions.   We should consider how to organise  all

the  housing  agencies and put them together in  a  professional

body  or   association,  the objective  of  which  shall  be  to

regulate  and  coordinate  the activities  of  its  professional

members,  so  that  they  would  conduct  their  business   with

professionalism, discipline and efficiency.   This  will  be  of

great benefit to our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Ministry of National Development can play a

greater  role in this regard.  As it is, presently  all  housing

agents have to  pass the CEHA  conducted by the tax authorities.

Only  on  passing  the said examination  can they  apply  for  a

licence  to practise as housing agents.  They can then  register

with   the  HDB  as  authorised  housing  agents  to   deal   in

transactions  of HDB flats.  They enjoy certain  advantages  and

priorities.  Through them, the transactions can be expedited and

completed within  4 weeks.

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this is only one part of the story, ie, an

examination  conducted  by the  tax  authority.   What  is  more

important is the professionalism in the housing agents.   I hope

that  HDB  or  MND  can  help  the  housing  agents  to  form  a

professional body or association.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my meet-the-people sessions, I have some residents

coming  to  me about the inability of  single persons above  the

age of 35 who were denied  the right to buy some 3-room flats in

my  ward.    I  feel  that  we  should  consider  relaxing  this

restriction  on single persons who wish to buy HDB  flats.   For

example, in Whampoa, which is an old housing estate, there are a

lot  of  senior  citizens.  Many of them are hoping  that  their

children could come and stay with  them.  But these children who

are 35 years of age and above want to be independent and they do

not want to stay in the same flat with their parents, but at the

same time, they want to be near to look after their parents.  So

the best way out is to buy a 3-room flat close to their parents'

flat   so  that  they  can  also  look  after  the  old   folks.

Unfortunately,  because of the existing  regulations,  a  single

person



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1610</b></font><br><br>



would  not be allowed to buy a 3-room flat in the city area  and

this  has  caused a lot of inconvenience.  In other  words  they

would  not  be staying near to their aged parents to look  after

them.  If they are working in the city, and you want them to buy

a  flat  in the suburban area, they will have to spend a lot  of

time    travelling  to-and-fro.    It  is  too  troublesome  and

inconvenient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also come across a case where a resident wanted to

sell back the 3-room flat to  HDB in order to buy a bigger flat.

However,  HDB was rather reluctant to buy back the 3-room  flat.

As  a  result, he had trouble getting the 4-room  or 5-room flat

he  wanted  for his family which had expanded.   So  if  we  can

allow  single  persons aged 35 and above to buy   3-room  flats,

then it will take a load off the back of the other resident  who

wanted to sell off his 3-room flat to upgrade to a bigger  flat.

This  is a win-win situation for both.  I really want to  appeal

to the Minister to consider allowing singles, aged 35 and above,

to buy flats in the city area.

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, the Member raised the issue last

year.  Perhaps I can give him an update on the situation today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, there are 501 housing agencies in the scheme. We

started with 27.  These agencies are handling almost half of all

resale  transactions.   When  the  scheme  was  implemented   in

December  1995,  its  aim was to encourage housing  agencies  to

conduct resale transactions in a professional and honest manner.

The minimum criteria set for admission was that at least 50%  of

the   agency's   housing  agents  must  possess   the   relevant

qualifications recognised by the IRAS.  In July 1997 the  scheme

was tightened because of feedback from MPs like Mr Choo who said

that  many agents are unqualified.  They misrepresent the buyers

or  the  sellers.  They are unclear about HDB policies resulting

in  misery  to  both buyers and sellers.  Thus we tightened  the

scheme.   But for those agencies which had already been admitted

before  July  1997 we give them a grace period until  June  this

year to get all their agents qualified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The qualification is to pass an examination set by IRAS,

and we call it the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1611</b></font><br><br>



Common   Examination   for  Housing  Agents.    In   fact,   the

qualification  to  sit  for  this  examination  is  rather   low

actually.   It  requires  3  GCE "O"  levels  to  sit  for  this

examination.  I have made enquiries.   The pass rate so  far  is

rather dismal.  Only 20-30% of candidates passed at their  first

attempt.    But  of  course  those  who  fail  can  re-sit   the

examination whenever IRAS sets the next examination.  The second

attempt pass rate is much higher and more satisfactory, at 60%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has alluded to the fact that HDB flats represent

the  most  important  asset  for  almost  all  Singaporeans  and

therefore  only qualified agents should be allowed  to  transact

HDB  flats.  I fully agree with the Member.  Unfortunately,  the

Auctioneers   Act  is  not  under  the  Ministry   of   National

Development.   It  is under the Ministry of Finance.   Recently,

the Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers also lobbied me

to have some kind of regulation over real estate agents.  I have

passed  the note to the Minister for Finance and I am  sure  his

officials  would be looking into it.  The Act that  governs  the

activity of housing agents is rather old actually, a rather  old

piece  of  legislation,  dating  back  to  1962.   Perhaps  some

modifications  can be made, but that is up to  the  Ministry  of

Finance to decide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But HDB monitors the performance of the Licensed Housing

Agents  Scheme's agents closely.  So far, after this new  scheme

has been in place, the standard of services provided by the LHAS

agencies are generally better because now they have to  sit  for

an  examination, they are more qualified and they know HDB rules

much better.  Nonetheless, HDB will tighten the scheme and, with

feedback  from MPs like Mr Choo, we hope to close  many  of  the

loopholes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third part of his question was whether HDB will relax

the  present rule which prevents singles over 35 from buying HDB

resale flat in the central area, like my area in Tiong Bahru and

his  area in Whampoa.  Under the present ruling, as the  MP  has

pointed out, a single is not qualified to buy.  HDB will look at

this issue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1612</b></font><br><br>



again  to  see whether there is a need to relax.   But,  in  the

meantime, if he feels very strongly about this case or any  case

that  is  deserving, HDB is willing to look at it on a  case-by-case  basis and give a waiver.  So this is an exception.  I hope

the Member is satisfied with the answer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> I beg to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (3), Prof Low.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Sir, I beg to

move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of  Code UF 1500.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the topic I like to talk about is Bird Flu and Bird-related Diseases. Before I start, I would like to declare my

interest.   I am the Advisor to two related organisations.   One

is  the Poultry and Livestock Farmers Association and the  other

is the Poultry Importers and Exporters Association.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recent outbreak of the bird flu - the technical

name  is  "Avian Influenza" - has caused 6 lives in  Hong  Kong.

The  authority there took a very serious view of the matter  and

destroyed  about 1.5 million chickens in order to eliminate  the

source  of  the  flu  virus.  According to  reports,  there  are

different  versions of the reports, the flu virus is transmitted

through  people-to-bird  contact and not  from  people-to-people

contact.   It  is therefore important to note that  so  long  as

there are birds carrying the flu virus and there is contact with

the bird by the people, either in the farm, house, pet shop,  or

even  at  home  in the garden when birds frequent, people  could

catch the flu.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every day we import hundreds of thousands of chicken

and  ducks  for  our  Singapore slaughter  house.   Besides  the

migrant  birds  from different countries, there are  also  about

tens  of  thousands  of  birds shuttling between  Singapore  and

Malaysia  daily.  Sir, under these conditions, I would  like  to

ask the Minister, in what way we could be free from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1613</b></font><br><br>



possible  attack  of  the  bird flu.  If,  unfortunately,  there

should be an outbreak of the bird flu, what would be the plan to

contain the flu?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Hong Kong, 1.5 million birds were destroyed. It

caused  hardship  to the chicken farmers and the  traders.   The

Hong Kong authority compensated them financially to cushion them

through the difficult period but their action was taken  in  the

public  interest.  Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether

the  Government will consider paying compensation if part or the

whole  chicken farm or the whole import of live chicks or  birds

has  to  be destroyed in order to contain the spread of  certain

diseases   like,  for  example,  bird  flu  and  the  Salmonella

enteritidis disease.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San):</b> As said by Prof. Low

just  now,  the  recent outbreak of avian flu in Hong  Kong  was

tragic, with consequences more lethal than before.  I gather for

the first time that avian flu had affected human beings.  In May

last  year, the first human was affected in Hong Kong and  since

then there were 18 confirmed cases with 6 deaths reported.  I am

sure, Sir, many Singaporeans were anxious then whether the  same

could  have  happened in Singapore.  We all know of course  that

Singapore's Primary Production Department is very well known for

its  strict import and control system, and that must have  given

many  Singaporeans comfort.  But, nevertheless, certainly  there

must  have been lessons that could have been drawn from the Hong

Kong avian flu experience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question, Sir, to the Minister, is: what did PPD do

during  the  Hong Kong crisis and what lessons were  drawn  from

that  experience?  Does PPD have any contingency  plan  to  meet

such an eventuality, touch wood?  If yes, such a plan should  be

regularly  tested.  In view of the seriousness of what  happened

to  Hong  Kong,  Sir,  PPD should review  its  existing  control

measures, and if and when necessary, tighten them.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, the topic I would like to

talk about is branding of eggs.  I spoke on the branding of eggs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1614</b></font><br><br>



consecutively  in the past two Budget debates.   I  am  glad  to

note  that some progress was made.  Today, all chicken eggs sold

in Singapore are branded with logos representing either the farm

or the importer.  For some eggs, the name "Singapore" is printed

to indicate the eggs are produced by our local high-tech farms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the branding of eggs, I would like to ask the

following two questions.  First, if the local farm is doing both

the  egg-laying  and  egg-importing  business,  should  the  two

products, local eggs and imported eggs, be branded by  the  same

logo  but the word "Singapore" is added for the local  eggs.   I

ask  this question because this could cause confusion as certain

local farms do not print the word "Singapore" next to their farm

logo.   Second, when we see the word "Singapore" printed on  the

egg,  does it mean that the eggs are genuinely produced  by  our

local farms?  Does the Ministry take sufficient action to ensure

their authenticity?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About a month ago, my CCC Chairman and I went to a

supermarket to purchase two boxes of local eggs, twenty  pieces,

with the word "Singapore" printed on them.  I notice that in one

particular  box,  three  out of the 10 eggs  were  tainted  with

chicken  droppings.   In order to prove that  there  is  nothing

unusual, I went to a supermarket in Queenstown last week.  I was

unable  to  confirm that dirty eggs could be  easily  found.   I

believe that the name "Singapore" means "quality" and how  could

we  feel  comfortable when it is used in association with  dirty

eggs tainted with bird droppings.  I hope the Ministry could set

out  some specifications for the farms if they want to print the

word  "Singapore"  on  their  products.   A  penalty  should  be

considered if anyone should misuse the word "Singapore".



<br>4.15 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, the hon. Member for Chua Chu Kang is

a  good  friend  of mine.  He is an automotive engineer  but  he

seems  to have a fascination for birds and eggs.  He is becoming

an expert on birds.  I would warn him how the Chinese press will

translate that.  But jokes aside, Sir, he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1615</b></font><br><br>



and  Mr  Zainul  Abidin raised a very serious  issue  about  the

possibility  of Avian flu invasion into Singapore.   I  want  to

reassure  him  that  he  should not, like  all  the  economists,

classify  Singapore as among the emerging countries.   Singapore

is  not  Hong  Kong.   We are four to five  hours  flight  away.

Singapore is Singapore, and we are very safe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate. Singapore is free from bird or Avian flu

and  other  bird-related diseases that can cross from  birds  to

humans.   The  risk  of  the  introduction  of  Avian  flu  into

Singapore  is  negligible as the PPD has in place  an  effective

farm  and plant accreditation programme and tight import control

systems to prevent introduction of such diseases.  PPD has an on-going  surveillance programme to check for Avian flu in imported

and domestic poultry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike Hong Kong, Singapore does not allow the slaughter of

poultry at wet markets.  We did this sometime ago. But it is  no

longer  done  today.   Live  poultry in  Singapore  is  assigned

directly  to  the  centralised slaughter  houses  for  slaughter

within  one day.  The public does not get a chance to come  into

contact  with  live poultry and the potential for  infection  is

thus drastically reduced to almost zero.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the poultry in Singapore is confined to seven

farms.   Dr Low is the advisor to some of these farmers  and  he

understands  better  than  I  do,  that  these  farms  are  well

regulated, hygienic, clean and they are well monitored  by  PPD.

It  is,  therefore,  easy  to contain any  outbreak,  like  bird

disease, compared to other countries like Hong Kong.  But Dr Low

and  Mr Zainul Abidin have raised very valid issues.  Is  it  at

all possible for Avian flu virus to invade Singapore?  There are

no  guarantees.  But given the surveillance programme we have in

place,  it is unlikely that any Singaporean will be contaminated

with Avian flu in Singapore from imported poultry.  They may get

it on holiday in Hong Kong, I do not know.  Nonetheless, we will

take note of the lessons learned in Hong Kong.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1616</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul Abidin asked what we were doing when the outbreak

was   at   its   peak  in  Hong  Kong.   Singapore  sent   three

representatives to Hong Kong to study the situation  there  with

the  hope  of  learning  important  lessons  and  preventing  an

outbreak at the same time in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, PPD is looking at the surveillance system

and  coming  out  with an exercise plan that  just  in  case  an

unknown  virus were to come to Singapore, we will know  what  to

do.   Because  it is a multi-agency task, we need to  coordinate

with  Environment  Ministry;  we need  to  coordinate  with  the

Ministry  of Health; we need to coordinate with the  media.   So

the programme is in place.  And I want to assure the two Members

and  all  Singaporeans that if the virus  does  come,  which  is

unlikely, we are ready.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the egg problem, this is Dr Low's cut in three

successive years.  Imitation is the best form of flattery.  So I

think  our chicken farmers must have done something good because

foreign  egg  farmers are now, according to Dr Low, putting  the

Singapore logo onto their eggs.  But this is not prevalent.  Let

me explain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since January 1997, PPD requires both imported and local

eggs  to  be labelled.  So if it is a foreign egg, you label  it

accordingly.  If it is a local egg, or you import it, you  label

it  accordingly.   This is to enable PPD to take  the  necessary

action.   If  eggs  from  any particular consignment  are  found

contaminated with harmful pathogens or residues, we can stop the

eggs if we discover something irregular.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eggs sold in Singapore are inspected and monitored by PPD

very  regularly. We consume something like 3 million eggs a day.

So  it  is  an  important health matter for PPD.  Imported  eggs

especially are checked to ensure that the consignments  of  eggs

are  clean and labelled with a unique farm code and logo of  the

exporting farm.  If a consignment of imported eggs is  found  to

have  mislabelled  eggs,  or  if more  than  5%  of  eggs  in  a

consignment  are  unlabelled, then PPD will take  action.   This

ranges from a warning to a total ban.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1617</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PPD has on its own also received feedback that some

imported  eggs have the word "Singapore" branded on  them.   PPD

will intensify these checks and take corrective action.  But  to

help consumers differentiate local eggs from imported eggs,  the

PPD,  with  the  help of local farmers, will  be  introducing  a

Singapore  Quality  Egg Scheme by June 1998.   The  scheme  will

allow  local  farms  which meet prescribed standards  to  use  a

quality  mark on their eggs.  But at the same time, I  urge  the

Member  to  also  inform his egg farmers that  the  egg  farmers

themselves  must be proactive.  They must market their  eggs  to

local consumers.  So local consumers are aware that this egg  is

imported, not so good maybe; this egg is locally produced, maybe

very good.  So I think the marketing aspect must be done by  the

local  farmers.  And only then will loyalty to local  brands  be

established in the long run.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I thank the Members, Dr Low and Mr Zainul Abidin, for

raising this important issue and I hope the House is reassured.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, can I have a clarification? I

wonder  if  the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that  some  egg

producers claim that their eggs contain low cholesterol.  Let me

tell  you  my experience.  I bought one of these boxes of  eggs,

claiming  to have low cholesterol.  And when the egg  was  half-boiled,  cracked open, I noticed that the yolk of  the  egg  was

very large compared to other eggs.  To my understanding, all the

cholesterol is, in fact, contained in the yolk of the  egg,  and

not  the white of the egg.  So if this egg has got a larger than

normal  size yolk, how can the producers claim that it  has  got

low cholesterol?

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, I have heard similar tales that some

of  the locally produced eggs contain low cholesterol.  I am not

a  veterinarian, I am an agronomist.  But I tend to believe that

there  is  a  possibility, a real likelihood, that  our  locally

produced  eggs  contain low cholesterol because the  cholesterol

content in the chicken and the egg depends on the chicken  feed.

And I am told that Singapore farmers, through advice given by Dr

Low, use good chicken feed.  It is just like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1618</b></font><br><br>



humans.   If  you  take  a  lot of  pork  fat,  teka,  you  have

cholesterol.  But if you take vegetables, fresh fruits, you  may

have  lower cholesterol.  So I am assured that our local chicken

farmers  use good chicken feed.  So do not complain that chicken

egg is slightly more expensive in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I think the Parliamentary

Secretary  missed  the  point.   The  point  is  that  all   the

cholesterol is contained only in the egg yolk.  So  if  the  egg

yolk  is  larger than normal, it would definitely  contain  more

cholesterol than an egg which has got a smaller yolk, unless you

are  saying  that the concentration of the cholesterol  is  very

high.

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> It is not true, because he is saying that

bigger  yolk must correlate with higher cholesterol.   A  skinny

person  can  have  high cholesterol.  A fat  man  may  have  low

cholesterol.  So what appears to be may not be.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think we have to get away from this

chicken  and  egg  question.  Would you  like  to  withdraw  the

amendment and move on?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary

has  not replied to one of the important questions, that is, the

point on compensation.  Because every now and then certain  lots

of  the chickens in the farm have to be destroyed due to certain

reasons.   So  in the case like Hong Kong, 1.5 million  chickens

were  actually destroyed, which was quite a significant  number.

We  do  not  have  such a big farm.  But whichever  way,  if  it

happens  that  those  chickens have to be destroyed,  would  the

Ministry consider some form of compensation?

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, that is a hypothetical question and

I  do not give hypothetical answer.  As I said earlier on, it is

unlikely  that  the  Avian  flu of any  kind  would  contaminate

Singapore chickens.  When it comes, we are ready.  We will  then

talk about the compensation issue when it comes.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, I think the Parliamentary

Secretary  refers to the Avian influenza case.   But  for  other

cases, we did in the past destroy tens of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1619</b></font><br><br>



thousand  of birds, either young chicks or even the chickens  in

the  farm.  It had happened in the past, and I believe  it  will

still  happen  continuously.  So the  question  is  that  if  in

future,  there  is  such  a case, would  the  Ministry  consider

compensation?

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, as I said earlier on, we do not deal

with "ifs", we deal with "whens".

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Low, would you like to withdraw your

amendment?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, the Parliamentary

Secretary  has  given a very good answer  but  it  is  not  very

satisfactory.  But, whichever way, Sir, I beg leave to  withdraw

my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (4), Mr Ang.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U of the Development

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code UI 5100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): So far, about 7,000 units of shops with 99-year lease have been sold since the implementation of the HDB

Shop  Ownership Scheme. In 1997, for the first time,  about  200

shops were sold with 30-year lease.  The response was  very good

and  the  take-up  rate  is as high as  97%.   In  Bukit  Gombak

Constituency, I believe we have 100% take-up rate.  Shop tenants

who  bought these shops are now paying monthly instalments which

are actually lower than the rental they were paying prior to the

purchase.   This  will help them to cut cost in their  business,

and  a  great help to the shopowners.  They are very happy about

it.  I would like to thank the Minister for helping these small-time  businessmen with  this kind of scheme to  help  them  tide

over the difficult times ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the feedback I received, I understand that some

shopowners  who  bought the 99-year lease shops are paying  very

heavy monthly instalments.   I hope



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1620</b></font><br><br>



that  HDB  will  consider allowing them to convert  the  99-year

lease  to   30-year  lease,  so as to  lighten  their  financial

burden, especially at this time when the economy is not so  good

they need help to tide over.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a few questions to ask the Minister:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, how many shopowners have bought shops with a 99-year lease? How many of them have applied to convert the 99-year lease to 30-year lease?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, according to my understanding, the closing date

for  such applications is at the end of this month.  I hope that

the  Minister will consider extending the closing date  or  even

completely  abolish  the  closing date,  so  as  to  give  these

shopowners more time to consider whether or not to apply for the

conversion.  At this time of economic uncertainty, we should  be

more  sympathetic to these small-time businessmen by giving them

more breathing space to pull through these difficult times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is, since the 30-year lease has the

support  of the shopowners, will the Government consider selling

more of the remaining shops, and how many such shops can be sold

per year?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also hope that the Minister will consider selling

some   of   these  30-year  lease  shophouses  to  the  existing

shopowners in Bukit Gombak, in the next round of sales of shops.



<br>4.30 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, I was pleasantly surprised to

learn  from  the Minister just now that two thirds  of  the  HDB

shops have already been sold.  I wonder whether he has forgotten

some of his older customers and lessees in some of the older HDB

shops  in  areas like Queenstown.  In particular, I am referring

to  the  Tanglin Halt precinct area where shops which  are  more

than 30 years are still not sold.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the lessees of these shops are very keen to have

their  shops purchased, at least on a 30-year scheme  or  lease.

They hope that with that they could rejuvenate the area and  the

shops.  I was told that perhaps one of the reasons is that  they

are two-level shops.  So the cost of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1621</b></font><br><br>



land  may  be  higher.  But there have been cases  of  two-level

shops which have been sold by HDB.  Even in that precinct,  many

of  the  shops  are  actually on the ground level  of  high-rise

buildings.  I hope the Ministry can consider this and give these

old and loyal customers of HDB a chance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, first, I would like to give Members

of  this  House an update of the 30-year lease shop sale scheme.

The HDB has received 95 written enquiries on the conversion from

99-year lease to 30-year lease.  Out of these, 52 shopowners are

actively  pursuing their applications.  HDB is processing  these

applications  and will inform them of the buy-back  process  for

the existing leases and the selling prices of the 30-year leases

soon.    These shopowners would then have to decide  whether  to

proceed with the conversion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng asked whether the Ministry will consider

giving  99-year lease shopowners more time to convert their  99-year  lease to 30-year lease.  We have given a four-month window

for  existing  99-year lease shopkeepers to convert  to  30-year

lease.   The announcement was made on 1st December 1997 and  the

closing  date  is 31st March 1998.  Anybody will  consider  this

reasonable.  Nonetheless, since the Member has made  an  appeal,

we  can  consider extending it.  But it is not the intention  of

HDB  to keep this window wide open permanently.  In view of  the

current economic slowdown, an introduction of the 30-year  lease

and also the picture as to whether the conversion of 99-year  or

30-year lease is very welcomed or otherwise, HDB will reduce the

sale of shops programme to two sales a year, that is, about  200

shops  in  each sale.  HDB will review this number  periodically

and respond to the sale of shops accordingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has made a passionate plea to HDB to sell some

of the shops in his area to the shop tenants.  I will ask HDB to

keep in mind his appeal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay has asked whether HDB has forgotten some of the

older estates like Queenstown.  The answer is no.  Because he is

in Tanjong Pagar GRC, I will never



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1622</b></font><br><br>



forget  him.  But HDB sells shops according to various criteria,

ie,  geographical spread, age, need and potential land use.   So

the  sale  of shops programme has not arrived in the  Queenstown

ward.  But I will ask HDB to look at his request again.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng:</b> I would like to thank the Parliamentary

Secretary.  I wish to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (5), Mr Chiam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head U of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code UJ 2600.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be speaking on the subject of Community Improvement

Projects  Committee (CIPC) funds.  Sir, I have  spoken  on  this

subject many times in this House and I shall continue to do  so.

The  reason is that under the present system of disbursing  CIPC

funds,  which  are  public  money,  the  Opposition  Members  of

Parliament  shall never be able to get any CIPC  funds  to  help

them carry out the community projects in their constituencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, if my town council wants to embark on a

community  project, I have to apply for CIPC funds  through  the

Chairman of the CCC, who is presently Mr Andy Gan.  Mr Andy Gan,

as  you  know, was the PAP parliamentary candidate who contested

against  me  in  the  last  two  general  elections,  but  lost.

Recently, it was announced that Mr Gan shall stand against me in

the next GE.  That being the case, I do not expect that he would

advise his Chairman of the CCC to approve applications for  CIPC

funds  from  me, who is his rival.  If the system of  disbursing

CIPC  funds is not changed, I shall never be able to get any  of

such  funds  to  carry out any of my community  projects  in  my

constituency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am asking that the present system of allocation of

CIPC  funds in relation to the Opposition wards be changed.   As

an Opposition Member, I do not have any grassroots organisations

there.  So applications cannot be made through the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1623</b></font><br><br>



grassroots organisations which are not present.  I would suggest

that  at  the  Opposition  wards, the MP  should  be  given  the

authority to recommend applications for CIPC funds and  not  the

Chairman  of the CCC.  Unless we have this change of  disbursing

CIPC   funds,  an  Opposition  Member  cannot  carry   out   any

improvements  in  his  constituency  to  the  extent  that  PAP-controlled constituencies can.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the disbursement of CIPC funds, to-date, I

believe  that  each  of the PAP MPs has benefited  by  about  $1

million  worth  of CIPC funds.  But no Opposition  MP  has  been

successful  in his application for CIPC funds.  This  House  has

recently been told that a sum of $36 million shall be set  aside

for  CIPC funds.  If we divide this amount equally among the  83

MPs,  each would be allocated about $430,000.   My question  is:

will  each  of the Opposition MPs be allocated this  amount  for

their community projects this year?

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, it has been a long day. It is

always interesting to listen to Mr Chiam.  He asked whether  all

elected  Members are entitled to a share of the CIPC funds.   My

answer  is all CCCs, all Singaporeans are entitled to  the  CIPC

funds,  which  is  more important.  All CCCs,  including  Potong

Pasir  CCC, have benefited from the disbursement of CIPC  funds.

It  is  important to work through the channels of CCC.  Mr Chiam

is   very   welcome  to  work  with  some  of   the   grassroots

organisations   like,  for  example,  the   Sennett   Residents'

Association which is, I am sure, apolitical and, being a private

estate  Residents' Association, it is likely to  be  politically

sympathetic to Mr Chiam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not true that all PAP MPs have an easy time getting

CIPC  funds.  I have on many occasions turned down requests from

many  of my colleagues.  Each project is evaluated based on  its

cost benefit analysis.  If it benefits your residents and if the

cost  benefit  ratio works out, then it does not matter  whether

you are a PAP MP or an Opposition MP.  In fact, his Potong Pasir

ward has benefited from the CIPC programme.  So has Mr Low Thia



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1624</b></font><br><br>



Khiang's  ward  which  has benefited enormously  from  the  CIPC

programme.  And this was after the 1991 election.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I do not understand how the

Parliamentary  Secretary can say that  all  MPs  have  benefited

tremendously from these CIPC funds.  As I understand Mr Andy Gan

only managed to get $7,500 ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> $7,750.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Anyway, it is not even $10,000, and not

1%  of  what a PAP MP's CCC would have been awarded on  average.

So he cannot say that it is tremendous.  In any event, the point

is  that we are also doing community projects, like constructing

pebble walk, landscaping, walkways and covered walkways.   These

are  projects in which CIPC funds have been freely disbursed  to

the  PAP  constituencies.  Why are we not allowed  to  get  such

similar  funds?  We have to spend our own funds of  $300,000  to

erect  five linkways.  We have asked for it, but we did not  get

it.  Why?

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> First of all, Mr Chiam, being a longer

Member  in  this House, knows better than I do that CIPC  is  an

extension of the Urban Rural Services Committee which was set up

in   the  early  1960s  to  do  gotong  royong  projects.    The

arrangement then was that the CCCs would work together with  the

grassroots organisations and put up submissions to the  Ministry

to  get funding.  Since the formation of town councils, we  have

stuck  to  this arrangement because his jurisdiction as  a  Town

Council Chairman only extends to the HDB estates' common  areas.

It  does not extend to areas like Sennett Estate, where the  CCC

can  rarely reach out to the non-HDB estates' common areas which

are outside his jurisdiction.  That is the reason why the CCC is

still  the best vehicle for applying for CIPC funds.  If I  were

Mr  Chiam,  I  will  work with the Sennett RA  and  the  various

grassroots  organisations.  The important thing is  to  get  the

disbursement through.  If he jumps on the right vehicle, then he

may get the CIPC fund.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I get one more clarification?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1625</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I want the system changed.

Because  as  long as the present system is in existence,  as  an

elected  MP, I have to apply to an Advisor, who is the  defeated

candidate,  for funds.  How is he going to advise his  Chairman?

Will he say, "Okay, by all means give it to Mr Chiam."  He would

never  do that.  That is against his interest.  He wants  to  be

known  that he is doing the project.  And if he cannot do it,  I

also  cannot  get it.  So it is a dog in the manger  policy.   I

hope  the  PAP  will  not accept such a  policy.   We  want  the

constituency improved and the only way we can really improve  it

to  the  standard of the PAP's is we must have the  CIPC  funds.

Let us play on a level field.

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, I have suggested how he can get the

CIPC   funds   and,  that  is,  to  work  with  the   grassroots

organisations.  Some time last month, he asked me in this  House

whether I have received the submissions for walkways proposed by

his  town  council.  I have not received that.  I  was  thinking

that  even  if he follows the proper channel, goes  through  the

CCC,  CCC approves and it comes to me, I am not sure whether  he

has  the money to do the walkways. Because I said in this  House

last  year that most CIPC-funded projects come with a co-payment

portion.   The CCC may use the town council as the  agent.   For

some  projects like walkways, the co-funding is 10% by the  town

council.  So CIPC  pays 90%.  Walkways are very expensive.   The

per foot run unit cost is something like $1,000-$2,000.



<br>4.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been looking at his balance sheet and income

statement,  and he has been running operating deficits  for  two

years.  For 1995-1996, the operating deficit was $150,000.   For

1996-1997, the operating deficit was $195,000.  I wonder how the

Member  can  run  a  town council.  His accumulated  deficit  is

$114,000.   I told him last year and I will tell him again  that

he  should  not  be asking for projects.  He should  be  cutting

projects.   He  should be finding ways to make his town  council

viable, because he is two years in the red.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I am very sorry that the

Parliamentary Secretary should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1626</b></font><br><br>



bring  this  up, because it is not in our topic of debate.   The

debate  now is about disbursing of CIPC funds.  And out  of  the

blue,  he  wants  to  delve  into Potong  Pasir  Town  Council's

accounts.  But I am telling  him now that we have never run into

a  deficit  except for one year.  Last year, due to a  technical

problem, as an MP, I had to change parties.   Apparently, we had

to take away all the monies that I had in credit balance and put

it  into  some  other funds.  And because of  this  movement  of

funds,  it would appear that we had a deficit. But, in fact,  we

have,  on record now a credit balance of over $300,000.   So  we

had  got no deficits for two years.  This is not true.  I  think

he had better withdraw that statement or verify his facts before

he says that Potong Pasir Town Council has two years of deficit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that the system must be changed. If the

system  is  not  changed, I will never get any  CIPC  funds  for

improvements or projects at Potong Pasir.  That is the  crux  of

the  matter.  The Parliamentary Secretary has asked me to go  to

Sennett   Estate and ask the residents' association  to  do  it.

But  Sennett Estate is a private estate. It is not a HDB estate.

We  are talking about HDB estates.  The private estates can take

care  of  themselves.  The two HDB estates in Potong  Pasir  are

much  larger  than  Sennett Estate.  We should  start  with  the

housing estates in Potong Pasir first before we go on to Sennett

Estate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point is whether I can get a commitment from the

Ministry of National Development that the rules of applying  for

CIPC funds will be changed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, the operating deficits were published

in  the  auditor's statements.  These are published  statements.

If   the   figures  are  wrong,  his  auditors  should  make   a

clarification,  because  these  are  published  statements   and

readily  available  to  the public.  He has  run  two  operating

deficits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will we change the system? The answer is no, because the

system is working.  He has to work with Mr Andy Gan.  He has  to

work with the Sennett Residents' Association.  I think a lot  of

things can be done in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1627</b></font><br><br>



the  Sennett  private  estate.  I have  driven  through  Sennett

Estate and for parts of it things can be done.  He has not  made

an  attempt  to do so.  Has he talked to Mr Andy  Gan?   Mr  Gan

tells  me that if Mr Chiam would talk to him, he might sit  down

with him over a cup of coffee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the answer is no, we will not change the system,

because Mr Chiam has not made an attempt to talk to Mr Andy Gan.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam, would you like to withdraw your

amendment?   We still have one more amendment.  I do  not  think

you are going to get your way.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Actually, I still have not got a

satisfactory  answer from the Parliamentary Secretary.   In  any

case, I shall withdraw the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (6), Mr Zainul Abidin.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U of the Development

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code UL 5200.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after the chicken and egg, shops and constituency

development,  allow  me to clear the air  and  move  to  greener

pastures.  It is about the development of the Singapore  Botanic

Gardens and Fort Canning Park.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After nearly 10 years of development and upliftment, the

Botanic  Gardens  has  come to be recognised  as  an  attractive

landmark not only by Singaporeans but the world over.  It is now

a  major  recreation  and  education  resource  for  locals  and

tourists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry should look into ways as to how to attract

more visitors, especially locals, to allow better utilisation of

this rich green lung in our highly urban environment.  Would the

Minister  consider  increasing its activities  of  mass  appeal,

especially  at  night when it is much cooler  in  this  tropical

climate?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1628</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than the environmentally-friendly approach towards

upgrading the gardens, how about introducing more soul into  it?

More  could  be  done  to have cultural and  musical  activities

staged in the Botanic  Gardens, especially during the weekends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, elements of history should also be injected

into  the  Gardens  to enrich its value.  The early  history  of

Singapore,  particularly those pertaining to that  part  of  the

island,  could  be re-enacted or shown through exhibits  in  the

Gardens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, for the Fort Canning Park. More soul could be

blown  into the Park through cultural and musical events, staged

in open air.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for history, Fort Canning is abound with history, both

modern and ancient.  While the Ministry has done much to capture

the  elements  of  modern history from the  `shrine'  of  Sultan

Iskandar  Shah, the Fort Gate to the Battle Box, there  is  more

that could be done.  One era of some interest and importance  is

that  of  the  pre-Parameswara and prior to the opening  of  the

island by the British.

<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, I thank the Member for moving to

these two very green pastures.  How do we inject life, soul  and

spirit into the Singapore Botanic Gardens (SBG) and Fort Canning

Park?  These are the issues which are focusing the minds of  the

National Parks officials.  They will take up some of his  ideas.

Over the years, they have been doing quite a lot.  The fact that

these  two  places  are tropical parks makes  it  a  little  bit

difficult  compared to, say, temperate parks like Hyde  Park  or

Central Park,  because the weather is against them.  If we mount

a  cultural show or a Shakespearean play in the afternoon,  very

few  people  will go there.  So we are limited  to  narrow  time

windows,  in  the  evenings and public  holidays.  The  Member's

points  are taken and we will see how to make these things  come

alive at Fort Canning, and how to make SBG more exciting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for some of the items that we have done, eg, we have

opened up SBG up to midnight.  I think we can do a lot from  the

evening  to midnight.  Since 1995, performances have  also  been

staged at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1629</b></font><br><br>



Symphony  Stage, located at Symphony Lake.  These, I understand,

have been attracting very appreciative and sizable audiences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School of Horticulture in the Singapore Botanic Gardens

has  been  conducting gardening courses and guided  tours.   All

these help to inject some life and culture into SBG.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fort Canning Park is a different kettle of fish. It is on

a  hill.  It has a lot of historical potential and we will  work

with  Mr  Zainul Abidin to see how we can make it more exciting.

Of  course, now the Battle Box is there, not well used  and  not

well  known but it is there.  Maybe we should encourage  schools

to conduct more visits.  Dr Ong Chit Chung is not here.  Maybe I

will ask him to facilitate, as he is involved in the Battle Box.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, with that refreshing

response, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head J of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having heard chickens, eggs, fishes and other related

issues, we will move to people and people-orientated issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should pay more attention to social and community

development.   I  think this is very important, because  we  can

reduce  the  social divide amongst people.  We need  to  enhance

community building.  Otherwise, there will be abrasions  in  the

community amongst different groups and,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1630</b></font><br><br>



therefore,  it is essentially necessary that we pay  very  close

attention to the area of community building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the social health of Singapore society varies directly

with  the  degree of Singaporeans' civility.  The more civil  we

are,  the  more  caring we are, the more cohesive the  community

will be.  My parliamentary colleagues and I join the Minister to

urge  the  Ministry of Finance to deploy more resources  to  the

Ministry of Community Development, so that they will be able  to

undertake   more  programmes  for  building  a   more   cohesive

community.   I think this is important because there  should  be

more  resources  to  be allocated in the area of  prevention  of

social problems and in helping to build better communities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in terms of the preventive programmes, we should pay

close  attention to this.  There is a need to invest in  people.

I  feel  there is a need for more resources.  We are not  asking

for  handouts  but  it  is important to  invest  in  the  social

infrastructure.   And  this is crucial  because  it  is  in  the

interest of building a better community, a better social  health

of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to the assistance for the retrenched

workers.  In anticipation that more older and unskilled  workers

are likely to be affected by retrenchment, it is helpful for the

Ministry to put in place additional measures and plans to assist

them.   Some  of  these  retrenched older workers,  particularly

those  with less skills, may be less employable.  And I  foresee

that  there will be this group of people who require help.  They

may  face  hardship.  I would like to find out  what  additional

contingency  measures that the Ministry will be taking  to  help

older retrenched workers.

after  one another and is concerned about the well-being of  the

society,  then  we must get our priority right.  In  Singapore's

context,  I  think  a call has been made by my colleague,  Madam

Chiang,  about  the allocation of funds.  I  am  not  trying  to

begrudge  the  Ministry of Home Affairs for its  funds.   But  I

think  MCD  should be given sufficient funds so  that  it  could

carry out its responsibility and duty to the society at large.



<br>5.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have stated in the budget debate that the emphasis

should be on retraining of the workers, but there may be a small

group of workers who may find it difficult to either retrain  or

even  obtain  a  job in the market, Sir.  They  may  be  out  of

employment for some long months and I think we should give  them

some  financial assistance.  The usual assistance that they will

get will be not sufficient.  In doing so, I would like to assure

the  Minister  that I am not suggesting that  we  should  go  on

encouraging handouts, welfarism, but I think it would be  unjust

not to help our fellow Singaporeans, who because of the economic

conditions,  do not have the financial means to look  after  the

family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this particular context, Sir, I am really concerned

about  the  children,  their education and welfare,  should  not

suffer.  I would ask the Minister to urge his colleague, if need

be,  to set up a special fund for this purpose and perhaps at  a

later  date  he could persuade his colleague, the  Minister  for

Finance.   It is of course not helping the economy directly  but

you  are helping your fellow Singaporeans who may later on  help

the  economic life of Singapore.  I would urge the  Minister  to

consider this.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> On the area of care for the aged and dependants,

Sir, this area should receive serious attention although we have

been  discussing about this area for a long time.  It  has  been

attended  to  by  a number of ministries, ie,  the  Ministry  of

Community  Development, the Ministry of Health and the  Ministry

of  Labour  which deals with retired workers.  So  there  are  a

number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1632</b></font><br><br>



ministries involved in this whole issue.  There is a need for  a

more  coordinated effort to examine this whole area of care  for

the  aged in a more comprehensive manner.  Although there  is  a

Committee  which is studying into this whole issue, there  is  a

need  for  one  ministry to orchestrate, manage and  direct  the

whole  plans  for  the  care of the  aged.   And  this  is  very

important  because you require a single agency to set directions

to  deal with a problem, the greying problem of Singapore, in  a

more comprehensive manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the next 10 years, at least 15% of our population

would have aged.  Population ageing will pose an acute challenge

to  our  society.   I  note that in my meet-the-people  sessions

there are increasing numbers of families who are requesting  for

help  for the dependent aged and particularly the aged  who  are

sick  and disabled.  Many members of these families are working.

They  work in different sectors.  It makes it difficult for them

to  render  assistance, ie, the care and support to  their  aged

parents  who  require special care.  With all the  goodwill  and

intention,  Sir, many of these families run into serious  stress

and problems.  It is important that we examine these issues very

closely  and see how this whole problem of the care of dependent

aged  can  receive the kind of service delivery which  would  be

effective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more people are also expected to retire. There is a

large  talent  pool  out there and many of them  can  contribute

further  to  our  society.  There is a case  to  see  how  their

talents  and  expertise could be tapped and redeployed  and  how

they could be helped to be re-engaged in our society to continue

to be useful members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in time to come, we will also witness that there will

be  less carers available because of a declining population.  On

average, the family-size will be less than 2 children.  Many  of

these  children will be left with the problems of the burden  of

care  and we have to see how these dependent family members  can

be  supported through a strengthened support network within  the

community itself.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1633</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the light of this acute greying scenario, the

Ministry   should  take  a  lead  role  to  implement   a   more

comprehensive  plan to meet the challenges posed by  our  ageing

population.  Sir, what comprehensive and coordinated  plans  are

going  to be put in place to deal with the ageing problems  more

effectively?   This is an important issue that we have  to  deal

with  because  there  are more and more families  that  will  be

affected  by this problem out there.  We still require  many  of

these  family members to contribute to the economy.  We need  to

find ways to lessen their burden and there is an urgency to find

a  better coordinated effort to deal with this greying issue  of

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, most people,

including women, need to work for a living.  The care  of  their

dependants and the needs arising from their having to work  then

become  important.  My concern, Sir, is about how much more  can

we further enhance our facilities to benefit our elderly and our

school-going  children.   Although  the  Ministry  of  Community

Development has done very well up till now in these  two  areas,

there  is  a  need  for  an  even more radical  and  accelerated

approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the rapidly increasing population of the elderly

and  the increasing recognition of benefits from supervised care

of  children before and after the school hours, MCD may  perhaps

be  even  more  proactive  and supportive  towards  having  more

Centres  of  Activities for the Retired and Elderly  (CARE)  and

Before-and-After  School Care (BASC) Centres.   Sir,  I  am  not

suggesting  building more expensive structures.  I am suggesting

increased usage of community centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of our community centres are strategically located all

over  Singapore  and they are all within walking distances  from

the housing estates.  This user-friendly element is only one  of

the  plus  points.   The other and perhaps even  more  important

advantages  include  very low capital outlay  and  very  reduced

running  costs.  This is possible, when in fact,  these  centres

are  supported by grassroots organisations like CCMCs, CCCs  and

even RCs.  Self-help within the community is a desirable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1634</b></font><br><br>



feature and better rapport among the residents will be promoted.

Putting  to better use our community centres which are sparingly

used   in   the  day  time  is  also  a  worthwhile  point   for

consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is so in the case of CARE, especially when various

facilities like activity halls, dining halls, karaoke and  games

rooms  are  already present in community centres.  As  for  BASC

centres,  there  are  already  several  of  them  operating   in

community  centres.  One of them is in my Kim Seng  Constituency

at the Bukit Ho Swee Community Centre.  It is rather popular and

is  being  run  effectively  and efficiently  within  the  usual

community  centre  setting.  So much so that I  feel  we  should

accelerate  introducing  the  concept  of  BASC  programmes   at

community  centres.   I notice that one of these  centres  needs

only  30  students  to become self-sufficient.   We  do  need  a

further 60 or so BASC centres in the next few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must say that the support for BASC centres from the

Ministry for Community Development has been most commendable.  I

would like to see the same sense of commitment and urgency given

towards  the  CARE concept.  I am sure the People's  Association

will  be  happy that the various community centres and clubs  be

used in this value-added manner and welcome such arrangements.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, ageing is not just a

problem  of  the poor who are being well taken care  of  by  the

service  of  MCD.  Ageing and how to cope with the  problems  of

ageing and how to care for them is a major issue.  The best care

for  the  aged is to help them to continue working and  to  help

them  to  care  for themselves.  Many senior citizens,  who  are

still  healthy,  want to carry on working.  Employment  services

for  senior citizens are taken care of by the MOL, PA, MCD, SAGE

and  others.  The demand for retirees seeking full-time or part-time  employment  will  increase.   But  currently,  there   are

problems such as employer's attitude towards employing retirees,

the elderly's salary expectation and other demands which are not

realistic.  Sir, there should be job counselling for  older  job

registrants



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1635</b></font><br><br>



but I understand this is lacking.  Providing a second career for

retirees would be a major challenge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, different Government ministries handle different

services  for  the  aged.   MCD looks after  the  aged  and  the

destitute, while MOH looks after health and home nursing  needs.

Volunteer welfare organisations look after senior citizens, day-care centres, befriender networks and meal deliveries. Of course

HDB looks after the housing needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elderly are a very diverse group of people with

different needs.  There is therefore a need to provide  a  total

approach  in  the care of the elderly so that the needs  of  the

various  groups of elderly can be addressed.  Many of  the  aged

find  it  very confusing to have to go to different agencies  to

apply for various forms of assistance.  Care for the aged can be

better  coordinated and improved so as to avoid  duplication  of

resources.  MCD with its wide experience in looking after senior

citizens  could be the lead agency to handle all issues relating

to the elderly.  There should be a one-stop service point set up

in  MCD and all the CDC service centres to explain policies  and

provide  services to senior citizens.  This can be  easily  done

through IT and the different Government computerised networks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our Asian culture, the family is expected to look

after the elderly.  In encouraging families to take care of  the

elderly,  the  Government  and the  community  have  to  provide

options to help such families cope with the elderly and  at  the

same  time  maintain  and strengthen family  links  between  the

generations.   With advance in modern medicine and longer  life-span  we  now  have the old in their 60s looking after  the  yet

older parents in their 80s, and many of these people in the  60s

themselves need care.  Families who have to cope with  work  and

at  the  same  time  take  care of  frail  elderly  parents  can

certainly need information, guidance and training on care giving

as well as different support services to help them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1636</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what services are

available   now  to  address  these  needs.   Are  these   needs

sufficient?   And  what plans are there to meet  the  increasing

demand for such services as our population ages.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I share the sentiments of Dr Ho

with  regard to the problems faced by the aged, but I would like

first to deal with the young dependants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Lily Neo has pointed out the after-care centres. I

think it is important that we look after our young students  and

I  am  glad  that  the community centres -  and  I  applaud  the

community  centres - are doing a good job.  I visited  the  CDAC

self-help  group in which Mr Chan  Soo Sen was then  running  at

Toa  Payoh  and I was very impressed by the way it was  managed.

What I would urge is that the other community clan associations,

which  have  their own premises, which are not used in  the  day

time,  could  consider turning them into after-care centres  and

perhaps  the Minister may consider giving them some grants.   It

is  not  really expensive to run such centres.   I think we  can

solve this problem, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the community centres are doing a wonderful job but I

do  not  think we are going to be fair to them to allow them  to

shoulder  the  responsibility.  I think the community  at  large

must also do something about this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now move to the problems of the aged. The

Government has acknowledged that we are going to have an  ageing

problem in years to come.  Unless we tackle the problem now,  we

would have to face greater problems in years to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President, in the Opening of the 9th Parliament,

has highlighted the issue and in the Addendum to the Ministry of

Community Development this was what was said.  May I quote  with

your permission, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We will encourage Singaporeans to prepare early for

retirement, and to remain socially and physically active as they

become  senior  citizens.   We will promote  positive  attitudes

towards ageing and filial responsibilities.  Respect for  elders

should be an integral value in our gracious society.'

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br>5.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge the Minister to look afresh at a report

which  was actually discussed in this House some years back.   I

am  referring to the Howe Yoon Chong Report.  By courtesy of the

Librarian,  I was given a copy and I studied it.  I  would  urge

the  Ministry officials and the Minister to have a look  at  it.

Many  of the observations and recommendations it had made should

be  relooked.  Unfortunately, because of CPF, we threw the  baby

with the bath water.  We should not make the error again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should encourage our citizens to prepare for

retirement.   I  totally agree.  They should be  prepared,  both

financially  and  mentally.   We  are  living  in  a   healthier

condition  and we are having a longer lifespan.   So  we  should

encourage the habit of saving and investment.  I think  just  to

rely  on  CPF  alone would be very foolish.   It  would  not  be

sufficient.   What  we  ought to do is to  encourage  ourselves,

instead of spending on things which are not essential, to invest

our  savings, and I am glad that the Government is relaxing  the

rules on CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, mentally, we must let the older Singaporeans, our

senior citizens, know that they are not unwanted by society.  We

must  take care of them.  All of us are going to be old one day.

And it is an on-going process, especially for those who are sick

and  infirm.  We must take special care, and health care is very

essential.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area which I think we have not paid enough attention,

Sir, is housing.  Especially on public housing, we have to think

of  how  to  integrate the retiree village, if we are  going  to

build  one.   It should not be isolated somewhere  outside.   It

should be an integral part of the housing scheme, so that  these

people would feel that they are wanted in the community.  It  is

sad  to  say  in  some countries, it is isolated  and  is  never

popular.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best thing is to keep our old at home. But there may

be  situations, Sir, and I agree, that we may have to send  them

elsewhere, ie, home for the aged or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1638</b></font><br><br>



retiree  village.   I would urge the Minister  to  persuade  his

colleague,  the Minister for National Development,  to  look  at

housing  which is very important.  I know we are concerned  with

the  health aspect, but I think housing is an essential part  of

the whole retiring process.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> The topic I would like to talk

about is coordination of the aged programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The call to make preparation for an aged population has

been  very  successful.  At present, senior citizens  programmes

mushroom  in the community where both the Government-led  bodies

and  the non-profit organisations are providing different  types

of  services  and  facilities for the aged population.   In  the

Residents'  Committee level, we build senior citizens'  corners.

We  also have the senior citizens' club in the community centre.

They  organise activities to brighten up the life of our  senior

citizens.   At the MCD level, they run homes for the  aged.   In

the  Ministry  of  Health,  they deal with  the  development  of

medicine  for the aged and other preventive medicine to  prepare

for an aging society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this moment, there is a lack of coordination

between all the said organisations.  This is especially true for

the level of work in the RCs and the community clubs.  There are

organisations at the moment which merely run the centres to keep

the  senior  citizens occupied, but activities  are  limited  to

social  programmes,  like  outings,  shopping,  tea-tasting,  or

karaoke   sessions.   By  right,  they  should  conduct  certain

activities,  like physical exercises, physiotherapy, introducing

preventive medicine, care for friends who recover from  sickness

and counselling, or conducting courses to deal with the problems

of  the  aged  and  retirement.   However,  due  to  a  lack  of

professional knowledge of the leadership of this level of  work,

and  the  present coordinating body is not able to provide  such

professional  support,  they  are  not  able  to  play  a   more

constructive role to benefit the aged members, except  confining

themselves to only social activities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1639</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for all these front-line organisations to play a

more  constructive role, and to cover a wider and  comprehensive

kind  of  activities,  they  should be  supervised,  guided  and

supported  by  a  body which has the resources  or  professional

support  for  the  aged.  At this moment,  there  are  too  many

organisations involved in the aged programme.  They include MOH,

MCD and the PA, and my colleagues just now mentioned that HDB is

involved in providing housing.  We should actually pool all  the

possible  resources  from  the  relevant  departments   of   the

different  interested parties by setting up a  unit  in  MCD  to

gather   views,   provide   better  coordination,   offer   more

professional  support and cater to the shortage of manpower,  as

mentioned by other Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the combined professional expertise from such a

merger,  I believe that we could do a much better job in serving

the aged population.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Bukit Timah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

Singapore is one of the countries where the population ages most

rapidly.   In  1980,  only  7.5% of the population,  or  173,400

persons  were aged 60 and above. The number  rose to 305,300  or

10%  of the population in 1996.  It is estimated that the number

will rise to 900,000 or 20% of the population by the year 2030.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, the problem of an aging population is something we

cannot  neglect.  We should make sure that the  aged  are  cared

for,  and  the young are properly deployed for the good  of  the

society.   In  fact,  our  Government  has  not  forgotten   the

sacrifices  and  contributions made by these old people  towards

our   social   and   economic  development.    Many   Government

departments  and organisations have launched quite a  number  of

programmes for the aged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, economically, our CPF system is providing

Singaporeans  with  financial security after  their  retirement.

Whether  it is health care, housing, family protection or  asset

enhancement, the Government has shown great care and concern  to

provide Singaporeans with all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1640</b></font><br><br>



their  needs  after  retirement.   Recently,   HDB  proposed  to

provide senior citizen apartments for them to apply and to  live

in.   The People's Association and the  grassroots organisations

of   the   various   constituencies   are   conducting   various

recreational, cultural and sports activities on a regular  basis

for  the  senior citizens who are still healthy  and  fit.   The

Ministry  of  Community  Development  has  set  up  a  "National

Families and Aged People's Consultative Committee" to look  into

the   needs  of  the  senior  citizens  in  Singapore.      Some

charitable  organisations have also set up day-care centres  and

community hospitals for the benefit of these old people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board deals with housing and

the  Ministry of Community Development deals with setting up  of

homes  for  the aged while the Health Ministry looks  after  the

healthcare  of  the  aged.   A few  days  ago,  we  debated  the

importance of training for our workforce.  I must say  that  the

problems of an aging population are equally important.   Perhaps

the  Government could set up a "Life Planning Ministry"  or  the

MCD  could set up a special unit to deal with and coordinate all

efforts  by the various quarters to help the old people.   There

should  be  a centralised body to coordinate all the efforts  in

this  respect.  Otherwise, there may be duplication  of  efforts

and  thereby resulting in wastage of resources.  If we have such

a  body,  the  problems of the aged can be  divided  into  food,

clothing,  housing  and  transport.  Most  of  the  aged  people

receive  support  from their children.  If possible,  this  body

should  provide counselling to the aged and train them to  carry

on  working  for  as  long  as possible  so  that  they  can  be

economically independent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the changes in our family pattern, most children

move  out  to form their own families once they get married  and

both  husband  and  wife  go  out to  work  to  make  a  living.

Therefore, looking after the aged is a problem.  Some charitable

organisations  have set up some day-care centres to  look  after

these  aged people.  At night, these aged people can go back  to

their homes.  I think we should not send them to a home for  the

aged.  Although they are provided with food, this is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1641</b></font><br><br>



healthy  and  it  is  very  cruel to  send  them  to  the  home.

Therefore,  it  is  important that we  should  set  up  day-care

centres  and  convalescence centres.  We  should  encourage  the

private sector to set up such centres to look after the aged.  I

appeal  to  the  Government to provide  enough  funds  for  this

purpose, so that more such centres can be set up. With the  help

of the private sector, we can do  better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for housing, although we plan to build senior citizen

apartments for them,  can we ask the PA to plan some activities,

such  as  home nursing to look after those who are sick  and  to

help  them  to take care of  certain basic chores, eg, preparing

tea  or cooking porridge for them?  Through the CDCs, PA and the

MCD  can also arrange for more activities for these aged people,

not only recreational and cultural activities, but some care and

concern for them, particularly those who are handicapped.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter I am concerned with is education and moral

values.   During   the past few months, MCD launched  some  mass

media  programmes.  I have received feedback  from  people  that

these  programmes  are  very good.  They  depicted  episodes  of

disputes  between  the  parents-in-law and daughters-in-law  and

problems  such as the lack of respect for parents.  I hope  that

MCD would do more in this respect. MCD should liaise with TCS to

produce more of such programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that we should psychologically prepare

our  aged people.  Recently, in my constituency, we have  looked

into  the  psychological needs of such aged  people.   The  aged

people  have  slowly  become senile.  Certain  disputes  between

parents-in-law   and   daughters-in-law   are   due   to   their

psychological  make-up.   We do not understand  their  problems.

For  example, in a day-centre in my constituency, there are  one

or  two  older people who are constantly complaining that   they

had  no  food to eat, but the folks there told us that they  had

already  taken  their meals.   Whenever they see a  car  driving

near the centre, they would say they want to go home.  In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1642</b></font><br><br>



circumstances like this, our  young people should be educated on

how  to  look  after  the  older  people.   So  through  certain

grassroots  activities, if we can have the hardware as  well  as

the  software, and if we can set up a special body to coordinate

all  the efforts, I think we can certainly  do better in looking

after the older folks among us.



<br>5.30 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, the hon. Members before me have

pointed  out  that we do have an aging population.   As  I  look

around  this House, I suspect that this House is probably greyer

than  it has been any time in its history.  In any case, I  know

for  a  fact  that  the average age for the 23 freshmen  MPs  is

higher  than it has ever been before.  We therefore clearly  are

aging  as  a nation.  And I agree with Dr Vasoo that  we  should

dedicate  more funds for MCD to deal with the problems faced  by

an  aging community.  What is being done, what will be done,  to

prepare Singaporeans for the day that they too will grow old and

to  position our social structures to cope with that change.   I

would like to ask the Minister to update us on that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further question is: would these plans be affected by the

more  austere  budget  necessitated by  the  regional  financial

crisis?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to move to my next cut.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Carry on.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> I wish to talk of bonds and the breaking

of  bonds.  But before you rule me out of order, I must  quickly

add  that the bonds I am talking about are the social and family

bonds which are the glue that holds our nation together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is trite to say that the family is the building block of

the nation, and that for the family to stay together we need  to

educate our young to respect their elders, to honour them and to

look  at  them  as the repositories of the wisdom which  is  our

nation's resources and treasure.  Too often, however, we pay lip

services to these principles.  Or perhaps we do not know how  to

be practical in teaching our young how to honour their elders.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1643</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most practical and eminent ways in which we can

show we care and respect our elders is to acknowledge their past

contributions.   They have toiled to give us  the  Singapore  we

have  today.   They  did  not, as a rule,  obtain  the  material

benefits  we  gain  today  in doing  the  same  thing.   We  can

acknowledge  their  past contributions  by  praising  them,  but

praise is not tangible and does not impact the young mind on the

seriousness with which we praise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not change the minds of the young, we will be

guilty  of planting the seeds which would cause a break  in  our

social  bonds.  Would it not be possible for the small  kindness

movement,  for  example,  to  extend  to  the  giving  of   more

concessions  to  the  elderly?  First, we  can  extend  the  bus

concessions  we have given them by lifting restrictions  on  the

routes and on the time of use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we can encourage both public and private sectors to

realise  that  concessions  to  the  elderly  are  not  entirely

subsidies  but a show of gratitude and also good business.   The

goodwill  gained, the lessons imparted to the young,  the  extra

money  earned  from  the increased volume of  repeat  visits  or

purchases  by  the  elderly - these are, I submit,  of  greatest

value to us on the whole.  Many places such as the museums,  art

festival  performances, SSO concerts, perhaps the tourist  spots

which  are  currently  languishing, and the  cinemas  which  are

flourishing on the other hand, these can all benefit  from  such

concessions.   There  is  a  ready market  out  there  which  is

currently   being   tapped  only  by  conmen  selling   magnetic

mattresses and spurious investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there can be centres put up at, say, community

centres,  or  some other centres, like what Dr Neo  said,  which

would  take  care  of the elderly.  Perhaps  at  these  centres,

besides giving them activities to do, we could also provide them

with  opportunities  to buy daily necessities  at  concessionary

rates and the marketers who sell such products and services  can

benefit by saving the cost which they pay for overheads, such as

rental, advertising



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1644</b></font><br><br>



and middlemen's commissions.  Government should take the lead by

offering concessions for the elderly in Government-run places of

interest and services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us stop thanking and praising our elders only and start

giving  them  some practical help to alleviate  their  sometimes

precarious financial conditions.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, in the year 2030, Mr

S. Iswaran, the youngest Member of this House, would be 68 years

old  if  he told me the truth about his age.  He will then  join

the  ranks  of the senior citizens, those who are 60  years  and

above.   This  group  which  now constitutes  about  9%  of  the

population  will increase to about 25% in the year 2030.   After

leading  a  successful life as an economist at MTI, a  corporate

executive at Singapore Technologies and as a Parliamentarian, Mr

Iswaran in 2030 would be deemed to be in his twilight years.  At

the  same time, my son would be 35 years old then, at the  prime

of  his life and probably doing things which are different  from

his father.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ratio of working adults to senior citizens would be

3:1, decreasing from the ratio of 10:1.  We have heard all these

statistics   earlier.   With  life  expectancy  increasing   and

marriage  and child births taking place later in life, Singapore

in  2030  is  expected to have three or even  four  generational

families.  What does all this mean for us today?  We have  heard

that  Singapore is a rapidly aging society.  We  are  a  country

which  caters to the young today.  Can we do the same  30  years

from now?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senior citizens of tomorrow, such as Mr Iswaran, Mr

Chan  Soo Sen, Dr Toh See Kiat, myself and many others  in  this

House,  would be mobile, highly skilled and literate and by  all

accounts  will value our personal independence.  The demands  of

this  group and those of my son would be different and  must  be

attended to.  How then do we cater to a group which is seen as a

spent  force and a group which is seen as the engine of  growth?

Are  these descriptions appropriate or even meaningful  in  this

context?  How do we cater to the likes of Mr Iswaran and company

who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1645</b></font><br><br>



spend  their adult life building a Singapore for my son and  his

generation?   There  are many implications to  this  demographic

scenario.  For example, there will be more of the aged including

non-ambulant  cases requiring care.  Whose responsibility  would

it  be  then to take care of the sick aged?  Studies have shown,

for  example, that senior citizens' response time during driving

would be eight times longer than that of a younger person.  Will

we  need  to  obligate senior citizens to retake  their  driving

tests then?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the implications that both Mr Chan and I

are  looking at as part of the Singapore 21 Committee.  I do not

intend  to  elaborate here our findings.   But  there  are  some

concerns that I would like to share.  Many whom we have met have

suggested  that  there is a glaring need for a national  focused

approach to the problem of aging.  Some have even suggested that

a  Ministry of the Old be set up to take care of the aged.  I am

not  sure  whether they envision a young or an old man  to  head

this  Ministry.  I do not think that these are wise suggestions.

But  underlying  these  suggestions is a  concern  that  somehow

society does not seem to care for the old.  An elderly gentleman

in  fact  said  that  it is better to die  than  to  be  old  in

Singapore.  We have to change this view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, that is a problem of perception or "agism", to use

the term coined to describe prejudice and discrimination against

the  elderly.  Do we view the old as a spent force and therefore

not  provide resources for them?  I do not think Mr  Iswaran  at

the age of 68 will be a spent force.  If anything, I am sure  he

will  be  able to contribute as long as he is healthy.  Clearly,

we  should move away from the definition of the aged than ignore

the need for independence among the healthy old.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the greying of Singapore, we will need to address the

needs  of  two  groups,  the independent  healthy  old  and  the

dependent frail old.  We must begin to view both the old and the

young   as   resources,  each  with  their  own  abilities   and

capabilities.  Society needs to provide opportunities for people

of any age group



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1646</b></font><br><br>



to  contribute  economically or to volunteer their  services  as

long  as they are willing to do so.  In fact, studies have shown

that  those who continue to live a healthy and active life  tend

to have less medical problems.  Societal norms will also have to

change  to  reflect this move away from treating the elderly  as

though they were children or senile.  Studies have shown that  a

single elderly who remarries tends to live longer and healthier.

But  second  marriages  will carry other  implications  for  the

family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we cannot ignore the problems of

dependency  among the sick and frail elderly.  Many  today  have

raised  the  concerns  about  this group.   Their  numbers  will

increase  in  future and they will also live longer  in  various

stages of dependency.  What can we do now to help this group  of

persons in the future?  Sir, could the Minister inform the House

of the current thinking in MCD concerning this problem?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Community Development (Mr Abdullah

Tarmugi):   Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to step in  at  this

juncture to answer Members.  I have decided to speak now because

I  think the problem of the aged is a very serious one,  as  has

been  mentioned earlier by many Members.  And I  would  like  to

thank Members for their very generous support by calling on  the

Minister for Finance to give more funds to my Ministry.  I  hope

that  the  Minister will hear these plaintive cries and  do  the

necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of the aged is a very important one.

Several  Members  have  mentioned the  proportion  of  the  aged

increasing between now and the next century and how fast we  are

aging.   In  one  study, it was stated that we are  the  fastest

aging  community in Asia, surpassing even Japan.  In  1997,  the

aged  65 years and above in Singapore was 7% and it was forecast

that  by 2018, the proportion will double to 14%.  It took Japan

about  26 years to achieve the same increase.  But it will  take

us only 21 years.  So that gives a broad idea of the seriousness

of  the  issue of the aged and how we want to handle the  future

when many of us, including Mr Iswaran, will be getting old,  and

how our children will handle their future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1647</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aging, Sir, is an inevitability. So we must prepare for

it.   I  agree with Members that it is indeed a major  challenge

for  our  community  and  everyone, and  I  mean  everyone,  the

Government, the community, the VWOs and corporations, will  have

to put their minds together and look for solutions which will be

best  for  our community.  The issues and challenges are  multi-faceted.  They are very wide-ranging and we have to plan and lay

the  infrastructure  to  meet the needs  and  aspirations  of  a

growing number of better educated aged, as mentioned earlier  by

Dr  Yaacob.   Their needs will be different.  Their  aspirations

will  be  different from the elders now, from  our  fathers  and

indeed from even our own aspirations.  So we will have to  think

of  what we have to do to fulfil these aspirations, concerns and

needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current approach now, Sir, is to draw the expertise of

the  various Ministries in planning and providing facilities and

services  to  the  aged and there are very  close  consultations

among these various Ministries.  My Ministry, for example,  also

works  closely  with HDB, the Ministry of National  Development,

Ministry  of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Labour.   We  have

close consultation at various levels in our Ministries.  So from

policy  conceptualisation to programme implementation, there  is

very  close consultation and this approach has served  us  well.

But  as the number of the aged grows, so will the impact on  the

rest  of the society.  Therefore, we would need to look  at  the

problem  of  the  aged holistically and comprehensively  and  an

integrated approach be taken in our national response to address

the needs, concerns and aspirations of our aged population.



<br>5.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also merit in having one agency, be it a Ministry

or  department,  to  take  a lead role in  coordinating  and  in

putting  things  together to ensure that  there  is  a  seamless

provision of service and a continuum of service being  given  to

the  aged.   The lead agency, among other things, will  have  to

provide  overall  strategic  direction  and  policies  for   the

elderly,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1648</b></font><br><br>



and  ensure  a  very coordinated response across Ministries  and

across  programmes,  and  ensure that  there  is  inter-Ministry

coordination on issues of the aged which do not fall  under  any

Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has been examining ways to further enhance

policy  coordination and policy development, and we are  in  the

process  of re-evaluating our approach in dealing with the  aged

and  exploring the feasibility of my Ministry assuming the  role

of the lead agency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will review our resources. We will review the expertise

that we need, the steps that we have to take before we make  any

recommendations and before we offer ourselves to  take  on  this

lead  role.  But whatever structure we take, whatever we decide,

we  must  continue to help the elderly to lead meaningful  lives

and to contribute to society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two basic philosophies which we hold. One is

that  the  aged  should  be encouraged  to  live  healthily,  be

financially independent, be socially active for as long as  they

can,  and  the Government holds on to this philosophy to  ensure

that   our  aged  are  healthy  and  that  they  will  keep   on

contributing to the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second philosophy is that the aged should preferably

live  within  the  community, integrated in  the  community  and

preferably also with their families.  As far as possible, we try

to avoid putting and shunting our aged in institutions away from

the community.  I think this would answer Mr Rai's concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have to pay attention to the specific difficulties

of  the care givers, the family members' trials and tribulations

to take care of the aged, especially the frail aged and the sick

aged,  and  we  will  have  to  ensure  that  there  are  enough

facilities and community support to help the carers of the  aged

in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now go to Mrs Yu-Foo's suggestions. She has many

good  suggestions which I will ask my officials  to  look  into.

She  also  emphasises  the  need for coordination,  and  I  have

mentioned  earlier  that we also accept that principle,  and  we

will indeed be looking into how we can coordinate our programmes

and our projects better.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1649</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She made one suggestion about more private enterprises

coming into the scene to provide facilities or services for  the

aged,  and  asking for Government support, preferably  financial

support,  for this.  Personally, I am reluctant to  give  direct

financial support, especially to private enterprises,  when  the

motive is profit.  But if the private enterprise or organisation

can  come  out  to  say that they are willing  to  provide  some

welfare  services, we will consider the kind of support that  we

can give them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now go to Dr Lily Neo and her issues and concerns on

the  BASC.  The Ministry would like to thank Dr Lily Neo for her

constant  support of the Ministry's programmes,  especially  for

the  BASC,  and now the new institutions which she  calls  CARE.

The  Member  may wish to know that there are 82 non-profit  BASC

centres  as  at February this year, providing a total  of  5,890

places.  Another 75 centres are run by private operators,  which

are  different  from  non-profit organisations.    The  Ministry

plans  to  build another 74 non-profit BASC centres by the  year

2000,  and this will bring the total number of non-profit  BASCs

to  156 and the number of places to 10,400.   We feel that  this

will be sufficient for our needs until 2000.  If need be and  if

we  find that demand is more than what we have supplied, we will

definitely look into building more BASCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for CARE, as Members are aware, there are two types of

day care programmes for the elderly.  One is the social day care

centres (SDCs) which come under the purview of my Ministry,  and

the other is the day rehabilitation centres which come under the

purview of the Ministry of Health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there are six social day care centres offering a

total  of  207  places with a utilisation  rate  of  about  80%.

Another  10 SDCs are in the pipeline and these can offer another

500 places.  If there is demand, my Ministry will certainly look

into it and, if necessary, we will build more SDCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the rehabilitation centres, there are currently 17

centres  catering  to  the  frail and elderly  sick,  and  three

catering to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1650</b></font><br><br>



those suffering from senile dementia.  Together, they provide  a

total of 700 places.  The average utilisation rate is about 60%.

Another  four  centres with 120 places are in the pipeline,  and

there  are  also  plans  to set up at least  another  eight  new

centres by the year 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are aware that the health of the elderly vacillates

between progress and regress, and they change from one state  to

another.  As such, every effort is made to try to site the  SDCs

near  to day rehabilitation centres, so that the elderly can  be

conveniently  transferred from one facility to  another  with  a

minimum  of  fuss, and with convenience for their families.   We

will also continuously strive to provide a more coordinated  and

integrated  day  care programme to cater to  the  well  elderly,

frail elderly and elderly with disabilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo proposes that BASC centres and Centres of

Activities  for the Retired and Elderly (CARE) to  be  sited  in

community centres.   The Member may be pleased to know that both

the  People's Association and my Ministry support this proposal.

The  PA,  through  the  CDCs, will continue  to  facilitate  the

setting up of such centres at the community centres jointly with

voluntary  welfare organisations in areas where there is  demand

for  such services.  But the Member should understand that these

will also have to take into account the competing demands in the

community  centres.  Nevertheless, we support this proposal  and

we will pursue it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai mentioned the Howe Yoon Chong Report and

how  he  regretted that it was not given the attention  that  it

should  be given.  The Member may wish to know that contrary  to

what   the   Member  believes,  the  Government  indeed   places

importance on the recommendations of the Howe Yoon Chong Report.

For  example,  the major initiative which I can mention  is  the

public  education  efforts to change public  perception  of  the

elderly  and encourage the elderly to be physically healthy  and

socially  and  mentally  active.  That has  become  one  of  our

philosophies on how the elderly should proceed through life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another recommendation of the Howe Yoon Chong Report was

the employment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1651</b></font><br><br>



of  the  aged.  This was reinforced by the Advisory Council  for

the  Aged  in  1988 which led to the legislation to  extend  the

retirement age to 62, and later perhaps to 67.  So the Howe Yoon

Chong Report has been given the due regard that it deserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to retirement planning, I cannot agree more

with  the Member that retirement planning is important.  Indeed,

we  have  been advocating the retirement planning concept  since

1987  when we launched the public education programme on  aging.

The  importance  of  pre-retirement planning is  promoted  among

employers in the workplace, and seminars are organised with  the

companies  and  also with other agencies such as  the  Singapore

National  Employers' Federation.  And  quite apart  from  making

employers  aware of the need for their employees to prepare  for

retirement,  we  also help employees to prepare for  retirement.

This  is  equally  or not more important, that  we  prepare  the

employee  himself or herself for retirement.  My Ministry  works

with  agencies like the People's Association and other VWOs  and

also   SAGE   to  provide  pre-retirees  with  information   for

retirement planning.  In the coming year, my Ministry will  also

be  working with the Ministry of Labour's Back-to-Work programme

to reach out to more people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to support services for the aged, there are

many  services  already  set up for  the  aged.   Let  me  touch

specifically on an important but often neglected aspect, ie, the

social and emotional needs of the elderly.  Quite naturally, the

family  plays an important role in fulfilling the needs  of  the

elderly,  and  they  always benefit from  being  in  the  family

setting.  Our public education efforts encourage the family  and

society  to respect and help the elderly to have a role and  for

the  elderly to use the opportunities around them to  help  them

lead meaningful lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move to Prof. Low Seow Chay's topic. I thank

the  Member  for Chua Chu Kang for his comments on the  services

for the elderly.  There are indeed a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1652</b></font><br><br>



variety  of  services and programmes  -  I have  mentioned  some

just now - provided for the elderly by the different VWOs.   The

very  fact  that there are different VWOs and many of  them  are

providing services should not be construed as a haphazard way of

doing things and unprofessionally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are different categories of elderly persons - the

well  elderly, the frail elderly and non-ambulant elderly.   And

the  needs  of these different categories of elderly people  are

different.   So  we  need different bodies or  organisations  to

provide specifically for their needs.  Some prefer opportunities

for informal and unstructured activities and interaction, whilst

others   prefer   more  formal  and  organized  activities   and

programmes.   There are three specific goals in the delivery  of

services  and  programmes.  One is to help  the  elderly  remain

physically, mentally and socially active; two, to make available

a  continuum in the variety of care and support for the elderly;

and  third, to run services and programmes based on the  concept

of the family as social insurance in the care of the elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take Senior Citizens Corners, for example. They may not

look  much.  All you need are some tables and chairs in a corner

where  senior citizens would drop by, congregate and just  chat,

perhaps  having  a  drink or two.  It may seem  unstructured  or

informal,  but  these are the things which the  senior  citizens

need.  They do not want any structured activities.  They do  not

need anything which is structured or formal.  All they need is a

place  to  come down to every time they feel like  it,  to  meet

their friends, to chat, to exchange gossips, to talk about their

children,  grandchildren,  or whatever.   So  there  are  indeed

various  needs.   Some  senior  citizens  will  need  such  very

informal activities while others will need the more formal  ones

which  are to be held in community centres or organised  by  the

various welfare organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each voluntary welfare organisation has got its own mission

and  expertise.   It is better for us to leave  it  to  them  to

exercise  this  mission and expertise, because they  are  better

placed to provide the services



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1653</b></font><br><br>



which they know best and which they are very committed to.  So I

do  not  think  it  is  wise for us to  organise  all  of  them,

structure  them  so tightly that they have no freedom  to  move,

that  they  do  not  have the initiatives to come  up  with  new

programmes and ideas to serve the elderly.  But I do agree  with

the  Member  that  there is certainly room  for  improvement  in

integrating  the  programmes  and  services  to  ensure  a  more

coordinated  and better approach.  Indeed we would also  try  to

help VWOs where the management is rather weak, so that they  can

operate   better  and  have  better  programmes  to  serve   the

community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to coordination, one step which we have taken

is  the formation of three networks.  I do not know whether  the

Member  has heard about this, but we have formed three  networks

along  regional lines to coordinate services for the elderly  in

the  Western Sector, Central Sector and Eastern Sector.  In this

network system, a lead agency coordinates the activities of  the

other  agencies to promote community and geriatric  care,  which

means there are some professional inputs here and some expertise

being brought into play in the organisation of the activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Community Care Network led by NCSS, with

the participation of MCD and MOH, addresses the issue of service

fragmentation, service gaps and barriers to service utilization.

Then  there  is  geriatric care.  Ministry of  Health  chairs  a

Coordinating Committee involving MCD and NCSS also,  to  monitor

supply  and  demand  for  geriatric  care,  develop  and  review

operational  procedures and promote coordination  among  service

providers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More will be done to form inter-ministry and inter-agency

committees  so  that networks can be formed  to  coordinate  and

monitor the programmes better.  So we will indeed follow up with

the Member's suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come to Dr Toh See Kiat on concessions for the

elderly.  The Member suggested that MCD play a more active



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1654</b></font><br><br>



role in persuading organisations to provide concessions for  the

elderly.   Let me assure the Member that we have been  doing  so

and  we  will  continue  to  do so.   There  are  two  types  of

concessions that the Member may wish to know.  One  is  for  the

general   population  of  elderly  persons.   In  other   words,

eligibility  is  based purely on age.  It applies  to  all  aged

persons.   The  other  pertains to  services  used  by  selected

elderly  such  as those for day-care centres and  rehabilitative

services.   Concessions are given to the elderly,  for  example,

for  admissions  to museums, the Zoo, Sentosa,  Science  Centre,

Bird Park, Night Safari and concessions for public transport and

entry  into  sports facilities managed by the  Singapore  Sports

Council.  So the array of concession facilities is indeed  many,

and we will try to multiply the number in time to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the Member that my Ministry will

pursue the question of increasing the number of concessions, not

only  to  what we have now, but also increasing the  quality  of

concessions.   For example, previously they could only  go  into

one  class but maybe we could ask for concessions for  a  higher

class.  We will continue to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered all the questions.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> The Minister has not responded to my point on

assistance  for retrenched workers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> My apologies. Dr Vasoo and Mr

Shriniwas  Rai asked about it.  At the moment, we  do  not  have

specific  programmes or specific projects to help the retrenched

workers.   In our view, the best and most enduring help  we  can

give  to  retrenched workers is to find them jobs  and  also  to

train  them for jobs so that they can get new jobs if they  want

to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, the NTUC and the Ministry of Labour have put

in  place several measures to help retrenched workers.  This has

been  announced  and Members may wish to know that  my  Ministry

also  has  some  help  for such workers.  We  have  in  fact  an

interest-free  loan  scheme  for  skills  training  and   skills

upgrading for low income workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1655</b></font><br><br>



Although  this  is for low income workers, this  can  be  easily

extended to retrenched workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This loan actually complements the training award schemes

which the various self-help groups now administer.  Workers  who

wish  to undergo skills training but cannot afford the cost  can

be  assisted under these schemes.  Members may wish to know that

application  forms are available in all the service counters  of

the  community  self-help  groups  and  also  at  CDC  counters,

community  clubs and town councils.  For those  who  still  have

difficulty  in  paying  the balance of  the  course  fees  after

receiving  the  skills training, the community self-help  groups

will  submit the names of these people who have problems  direct

to my Ministry for interest-free loans.  In other words, they do

not have to apply.  The self-help groups will automatically send

their names and we will extend the loan facilities to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked whether there is any assistance for

family  members  of  the aged.  There are  in  place,  in  fact,

various financial and non-financial assistance schemes, which my

Ministry  and  other ministries administer, to help  individuals

and  families  who  are in financial difficulty.   Some  of  the

schemes include assistance in job placement through the Ministry

of  Labour and NTUC, if he or she wants to obtain a job.   There

is  also  financial  assistance from funds  administered  by  my

Ministry  for those in genuine hardship to help them  and  their

families tide over the difficult period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also assistance to meet the educational expenses

and other support for school children, for example, school fees,

school  uniforms,  supplementary  fees,  through  MCD  and  also

through the schools.  There is also assistance in linking up the

elderly to service providers and support services such as  meal-help, home-help service and domiciliary nursing or medical  care

service.  So there is already assistance in place and,  if  need

be, we will multiply the number.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Council of Social Service and my Ministry,

Sir, are monitoring the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1656</b></font><br><br>



impact of the economy on the individuals and families.  NCSS has

in  fact  provided NTUC and SNEF with information on the support

services  and  other  relevant information for  distribution  to

human resource personnel and employees.  Through this effort  we

hope the employers will know the kind of support that is in  the

community  and  that  they can be referred  to  the  appropriate

agencies  when needed.  I wish at this juncture, Sir, to  assure

the   House  that  every  individual  and  every  family  facing

financial  hardship  will  be given help  appropriate  to  their

needs.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Clarification, Sir. Can I ask the

Minister  whether he cares to say whether and how the  austerity

measures have affected the plans of the Ministry?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> As I have mentioned just now, Sir,

those  who need help we will somehow find help for them.   As  I

said,  we  have  some  schemes which  are  administered  by  the

Ministry  itself, but we also have other schemes  which  we  can

call  on.  In the community, there are other organisations which

also  provide  assistance.  So if we cannot do it  ourselves  we

will  help  refer that person to the appropriate body or  agency

which can assist.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, on the area of juvenile delinquency,

questions  have  been asked whether juvenile  delinquency  is  a

serious  problem.  There are differing views on this, Sir.   The

youth agencies will say that the problem is a growing one.   The

crime   control  agencies  say  that  the  problems  have   been

contained.  I assess that the problem of juvenile delinquency is

a  multi-faceted one.  It requires a concerted effort to  tackle

the  problems  through  the  levels  such  as  the  family,  the

community and the schools.  We have to take tougher measures and

a  more  concerted  effort at different  levels  to  tackle  the

problem.   The Children and Young Persons Act, particularly  the

section dealing with juvenile offenders, has to be revised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the school level, there have been concerns about

the  disciplinary  problems  of  students.   Many  schools  have

reported  that there are juvenile delinquency problems and  they

have been trying to tackle the problems.  There is a need to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1657</b></font><br><br>



examine whether we should ensure that there is better discipline

at  the  school  level  to deal with these  problems.   What  is

important is also to empower the teachers in the school to  deal

with  the problem because we have to identify some of the  early

problems of students who are vulnerable to juvenile delinquency.

The school can play an important role and it should be empowered

to  deal  with  this disciplinary problem at an early  stage  in

school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask the Minister what steps are being taken to

make the Children and Young Persons Act more effective.  Perhaps

he  may  want  to  explore the possibility of  empowering  those

teachers,  who are playing a policing role in school,  to  refer

students  with  juvenile delinquency problems  to  the  juvenile

court  so  that  the problems faced by schools  can  be  tackled

early.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Directly to court?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Yes.

<br>6.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I share the sentiments of Dr Vasoo.

The  Children and Young Persons Act needs to be amended.  It  is

long overdue and I think the Ministry is looking into it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problem of social juvenile delinquency is actually

not  a  criminal  problem.  We have to go to  the  root  of  the

problem  because if we treat it as a criminal problem,  we  will

send  it  to  the  juvenile courts.  I beg to  differ  from  the

opinion of criminologists and the others.  I think this is  what

we  ought  to do.  And I hope the Minister would give  this  due

consideration.   I could relate to him another issue.   He  will

remember  that  when the Maintenance of Parents Bill  was  first

proposed  in  this  House, there was a  proposal  that  District

Courts  should hear such cases.  I and another lawyer, Mr Joshua

Lim,  were opposed against the whole idea and we both  wrote  to

the newspaper and appeared before the Select Committee.  I think

the problem, Sir, would have been worse if it had gone to court.

I  do not want to flatter ourselves, but when Mr Choo Si Sen was

here, we had taken a different



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1658</b></font><br><br>



attitude.   Similarly, Sir, I would urge the  Minister  to  take

away  the  court,  get a trained lawyer and two social  workers,

form  a  tribunal and let this problem be studied  as  a  social

problem.  It is not a criminal problem, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I totally agree with Dr Vasoo that we should empower the

school,  with  the help of the Police.  I am not agreeable  with

him  as  he proposes teachers.  Let the principals decide.   The

teachers  discipline  them  through  the  principal,   and   the

principal should decide.  Just like we detain criminal  elements

without trial, I will go further and say that these boys  should

be  taken away, send them on holiday for two weeks at the  boys'

home.   They will learn their lessons.  Unfortunately, Sir,  the

boys'  home I visited with Dr Vasoo sometime back is too  harsh.

Discipline is an important aspect of reformation.  But  I  think

too  much emphasis is being paid on the penal aspect of it.   We

should be more reformative and provide counselling.  And this is

something we have to look at.  It is a social problem and not  a

criminal problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Minister and the GPC to help them out,

make a study of the legislation, see how best we can incorporate

this  into  the new era, move away from the right and wrong  and

see how we can go forward and counsel these boys and girls.   We

cannot  console  ourselves that criminal  delinquency  has  been

checked.  No.  It may be tapering off there, but we have  to  go

to  the root of the problem.  I think many parents, many of  us,

are  not in a position to take parental control.  And I remember

meeting  a  very young boy of 13 who was there and  the  parents

said they could not control him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what the parents refuse to do, the society may have to

do.   I urge the Minister to make a study of this problem - take

it  away from the court, set up a tribunal, and give it  a  try.

If you feel it is not working, send it back to the court.  But I

am  quite confident, given the opportunity and the way  we  have

worked out in other agencies, that it would be worthwhile to try

it out.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, according to reports, the number

of juvenile offenders



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1659</b></font><br><br>



has,  in  fact, stabilised over the past two years.  The numbers

peaked to about 2,500 in 1995, before falling to about 2,100  in

1996,  and  to  2,147  in  1997.  This  is  encouraging  and  it

demonstrates   the   effectiveness  of  our   current   juvenile

delinquency policy.  I am sure, and this is where Mr  David  Lim

would  agree, that the ban on the admission of 16-year  olds  to

tea  dances outlets must be in part responsible for this decline

in offenders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the Inter-Ministry Committee on Juvenile

Delinquency is now working with the CDCs to reach out to  school

dropouts.   We  seem,  therefore, to have  the  situation  under

control.   However, Sir, as we have heard from  Mr  Rai  and  Dr

Vasoo,  the  popular  perception is, in fact,  contrary  to  the

picture  presented  by  these  figures.   The  rioting  at   the

Singapore  Boys'  Home  on 17th December 1997  has  raised  some

concerns.  Are the programmes in place at these homes truly able

to  help  the boys turn over a new leaf?  Are the boys at  these

homes  receiving  adequate counselling?   Is  there  a  lack  of

resources at these homes?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These concerns are not only being voiced in relation to the

boys  at  these homes but also in relation to youth  now  living

outside  such  institutions  and,  in  particular,  the   school

dropouts.  If the boys from the homes are not helped,  they  may

negatively  influence others once they are  released  back  into

society.   This  failure to help will ultimately feed  a  never-ending cycle of juvenile delinquency problems in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anecdotal evidence seems also to suggest that more youths

are  bolder  these days.  I was informed that during the  recent

festive seasons, there were several minor clashes between  youth

and Police.  For example, near the Malay Village, several knives

were found stuck to trees and a Police officer was slashed by  a

youth after he resisted arrest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this context, could the Minister enlighten the

House  on what preventive measures have been taken currently  to

help our youths to deal with their time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1660</b></font><br><br>



wisely?   Given what has happened at the Boys' Home,  could  the

Minister  also give us an update on plans by MCD to ensure  that

problems such as rioting do not recur?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, the topic I would like to

talk about is Boys' Home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Boys' Home is a place for the juvenile offenders,

a  place for receiving punishment for their wrongdoing,  yet  at

the  same  time  it is a place for them to continue  with  their

education and rehabilitation.  As a Member of the GPC for MCD, I

have had the opportunity to visit the Boys' Home in Clementi.  I

discovered that some of the residents there are as young  as  13

years  old.  From their look, they do not seem "evil"  as  those

portrayed  in  the western films showing juvenile  offences.   I

feel  that  with proper guidance, counselling and continuing  to

attend  school upon completion of their short stay in the  Home,

normally  about two years, most of them could turn  over  a  new

leaf, just as any youngster now in secondary school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from what I have observed, the Home is more than 100

years old.  There is a lack of facilities and it is overcrowded.

On  the one hand, we could consider the rundown condition of the

premises  as one form of punishment for the residents.   On  the

other  hand,  the  poor  training facilities  could  affect  the

outcomes  of  the rehabilitation programme.  Worse still,  there

are neither proper school premises nor programmes for the normal

school curriculum, except the offering of BEST and WISE classes.

In  my  view,  it  is  not  satisfactory.   We  should  consider

providing  facilities  which are equivalent  to  a  school  with

proper curriculum for the young residents in the Boys' Home  who

are still schooling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of the objectives of the Home is for the purpose of

rehabilitation, the staff or counsellors' contact with residents

is  very  important because they can, through their contact  and

communication with the residents, impart or extend their  values

to the residents and help convert them.  This is part and parcel

of the counselling and rehabilitation programme.  From what I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1661</b></font><br><br>



know, the supervisor to resident ratio of the Home currently  is

1:40 in the day time, and 1:80 at night.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with this ratio, I do not think the Home could

discharge its task of counselling or conversion well.  The staff

to resident ratio must be strengthened to enhance the quality of

counselling  in  converting the residents and  helping  them  to

return  and  contribute to society just like any ordinary  young

person.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I really hope that the Government would look into the

running of the Boys' Home seriously with the injection of  funds

and manpower to provide a proper programme to help the young and

perhaps innocent residents to return to society and start a  new

life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have got another cut. May I continue?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, the next topic I would

like to talk about is child care service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more married women joining the workforce, placing

children in the child care centres has become a norm in a modern

industrialised society.  Despite many child care  centres  being

built  in the young constituencies like mine, there is always  a

shortage of full-time child care places in meeting the needs  of

the  residents.   Sir,  I was told that  all  these  child  care

centres  are  not  only running child care  services,  but  also

conducting  other children's enrichment programme because  these

enrichment programmes are more lucrative than running child care

services.   Certain centres could have put the number of  places

for  child  care to a bare minimum so as to meet the contractual

requirements of MCD.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong for the child care centre to make

more  money.   However,  in my view, they should  only  consider

making  more  money by running enrichment programmes  after  the

local  child care needs are fulfilled.  Some of the  child  care

centres  have  100 children on the waiting list,  and  yet  they

refuse to take in the children because of the enrichment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1662</b></font><br><br>



programmes.   I  believe  this  is going  against  the  original

intention of MCD in setting up child care centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge MCD to look into this and see in what

way  child care centres would place child care services as their

priority  and  help to provide sufficient child care  places  in

meeting the needs of the working mothers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, I would like to propose

this cut on child care with specific emphasis on education.   It

may  appear odd that I am talking about education.  But this  is

not  surprising, considering that education for  pre-primary  is

under MCD, and not under the Ministry of Education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope to be able to persuade the Minister to have a

national child care and pre-primary system, that child care  and

pre-primary services should not be simply left to market forces.

The  Government should go beyond its existing role  of  being  a

facilitator  of  such  services as this  is  an  area  that  has

important economic and social implications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of child care services has been seen as a

vital  part  of  the national effort to encourage higher  labour

participation rate amongst women.  There is always  the  concern

that  our  children are being brought up by foreign maids.   The

foreign  maid  levy reflects this concern as there  are  dangers

caused by over-reliance on foreigners who may bring up Singapore

children  in the light of their own cultures.  There  have  also

been  frequently  expressed concerns on the importance  and  the

need  to  transmit the right values to our young,  in  order  to

maintain and strengthen the social fabric of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I sympathise with the Government's anxiety to

avoid  being suck into what it perceives as a potential  welfare

trap,  I  nevertheless  feel that an arm's  length  approach  to

children has created its own set of problems.  I would  like  to

clarify these:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) It is difficult to find a good child care. There is a

quote  from  the  NUS  Society publication  recently.   It  said

"finding a good child care is like buying 4-D".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1663</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The long waiting list is a common experience amongst

child care providers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Uneven quality of service amongst various child care.

This is  sometimes because of the over-reliance on self-help and

other  social groups who operate child care centres.  Some child

care  centres  have been known to hire foreigners  with  degrees

from  Sri  Lanka and China who are cheaper but do not understand

Singapore's  culture.  But I am particularly very  disturbed  by

the worrying trends towards racial segmentation.  Muslim parents

tend to enrol their children in mosque-run kindergartens and day

care  centres.   Higher  income families  tend  to  enrol  their

children in child care centres that are run by Caucasians  whose

curriculum  and  teachers are vastly different  from  our  local

culture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am extremely concerned as the issue of segregation of

children at such a young age cannot possibly be conducive to the

building  of a more cohesive society.  In fact, I would  caution

that  segregation  at  this level can  bring  about  strong  and

divisive forces in the future.

<br>6.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, urge the Minister to consider the

introduction of a national child care system as it is timely and

appropriate.  The services can be provided by private  companies

but  the  coordination and regulation at various levels  can  be

done  by the Government.  Child care services should be seen  as

part of the essential education of a child and be treated in the

same  way  as other forms of formal education.  Policy on  child

care  should  take  into  account both the  core  and  education

components.  The Government should be more directly involved  in

setting up these centres.  The formulation and implementation of

child  care  policies should be handled by both the Ministry  of

Community  Development  and  Ministry  of  Education.   Attempts

should be made to resolve the space constraint problem.  At  the

moment,  there  is clearly a strong competition  for  void  deck

spaces  by  different social groups.  Space planning  for  child

care should be better coordinated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1664</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While diversity is not necessarily bad nor avoidable,

attempts  should  be made to ensure that all  centres  not  only

provide  a  common minimum standard of service but also  a  core

curriculum  that  imparts our national values  to  our  children

regardless  of  race, language, religion or  income  groups.   A

coordinated  national  child care system  will  also  be  better

positioned  to  address some of the concerns I  raised  earlier,

that is, closer integration of different races, increased access

to  all  families,  especially the lower income  families.   The

latter  is one effective way of giving Singaporeans as equal  as

possible an opportunity to start their lives with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ensure that we maintain minimum standards to get

around  the problem of uneven quality of services.  There should

be,  as  a  first  step,  closer  coordination  amongst  various

institutions  that provide child care education,  including  the

National  Institute  of Education, NTUC and  the  PAP  Community

Foundation and all other agencies that do it on an ad-hoc basis.

Like  teachers in a formal education system, there should  be  a

more  rigorous  system to monitor the professionalism  of  child

care  givers.   Efforts  must be made  to  understand  the  poor

response  to  training facilities offered by child care  givers.

While the recruitment of new teachers is a challenge confronting

all  levels of education, it seems to be particularly severe  at

the child care education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would conclude by saying that as the Republic moves

towards  the  next lap in its development, it should  bring  its

education  system  to  a level befitting  its  status.   A  more

comprehensive  education system starting  with  the  early  pre-school years is one indication of such a progress.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, in last year's debate on

the  President's Address, Mr David Lim, Member for Aljunied GRC,

made  the point that investing in the very young will enable  us

to  further  push the limit of our human resources.  This  point

seems not to have been taken, regrettably, seriously enough  for

the  budget to be increased in relation to child care  generally

in this year's budget.  The estimates for FY98 provide for $3.42

million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1665</b></font><br><br>



out  of  $42.8  million  development expenditure.   For  capital

grants,  they  amount  to  less than $1  million.   We  have  to

recognise  that  this  is  a  very small  amount  of  the  total

development expenditure budget.  Surely child care deserves more

than that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children must be at the heart of any family policy. The

overriding  interest should be the welfare of our children.   We

must  be  more understanding of children's dependency needs  for

stable  and  committed parenting or child  care  for  reasonable

material  provision, for educational and other opportunities  to

enable  their  true potential to emerge.  In other words,  child

care  is not just about building child care centres or licensing

private  operators  to  run  child care  centres.   We  have  to

acknowledge  that there is an acute shortage of  facilities  and

trained-minders  for  the very young,  as  pointed  out  by  the

Nominated MP, Mr Zulkifli.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more positive approach has to be taken. A child policy

requires  coordination  among several agencies  and  Ministries.

First,  may I ask what coordination now exists between  HDB  and

MCD   in   terms  of  the  placement  of  child  care   centres,

particularly  in  new  estates.  Timing  is  also  an  important

element.   I  am sure that many Members in the House would  have

met residents who requested letters of support in an attempt  to

get  their  children  into  the very  few  child  care  centres,

particularly in new estates with a waiting list of more than 200

sometimes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, coordination between MCD and other Ministries, such

as  Manpower,  to provide for skills training for  child-minders

and  pre-primary teachers.  These skills upgrading  or  training

courses  should  also  attract  the  various  tax  rebates   and

exemptions   enjoyed  by  other  workers.   Third,  coordination

between MCD and grassroots organisations to improve feedback  on

the  need  for such facilities in different areas of  Singapore.

Without  such coordination and feedback, MCD's response  appears

to be sluggish and not proactive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the need for a more positive approach to child care

policy is great.  I hope the Minister can respond wholeheartedly

to increasing not just the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1666</b></font><br><br>



building  of child care centres but also the training  of  child

care  minders generally.  Child care at an early age will foster

good  habits and develop minds.  We can and should do  more  for

our children.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, as a nation, we have to wean

ourselves  from an over-dependence on foreign labour, especially

domestic  labour.  We also want our women to contribute  to  the

economic growth of our country by staying in the workforce.  Who

will  then look after our children?  Who will teach and  nurture

them?   I  am one with Mr Zulkifli in asking if we have  to  pay

somebody to teach them and nurture them, would it not be  better

to  rely  on well-trained professionals who have our own  values

and understand our own cultural sensitivities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some things we can learn from the developed

countries in this area where they have large numbers of women in

the  workforce  and  yet only the very very  rich  have  live-in

domestic  help.   One of the ways they do this  is  to  have  an

extensive  system of child care centres, nurseries and  creches.

Many  enlightened  employers  even  run  these  centres  at  the

workplace.   The  advantage  of such arrangements  is  that  the

mother brings the child to the same place she works, leaves  the

child  with professional child carers and goes to her own  work.

At  lunch  time, she can visit her child, play with  her  child,

have  personal quality time to interact and bond with the child.

When  the child is ill, the mother can work with peace  of  mind

because  she can pop in now and then to check on the  child  and

the  company benefits too from this arrangement because she does

not have to apply for urgent leave.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, she does not have to rush off early

from work to battle the traffic jams so that she can pick up her

child  in time.  Instead, she can just pop in to the centre  and

make  arrangements  with the staff there before  going  back  to

work.   Alternatively, she can pick up her child and  bring  the

child  back  to her work desk.  She can then quickly finish  her

work without being worried sick to death that her child will  be

traumatised by the delay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1667</b></font><br><br>



or  that the child care centre will levy a huge penalty  on  her

for not picking up the child punctually.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a simple idea and highly practical. Why do we

not  have  more  of such arrangements?  Perhaps we  should  give

employers  tax  incentives or grants to build and  operate  such

centres.   Or  as Prof. Chin has said, we could perhaps  release

more funds to upgrade the carers' skills and give them pride  of

place  so that people actually would want to work in such places

and  it  would no longer be a lottery to find a good child  care

centre.  More importantly, I think the Government should set the

example  by  setting up centres like these in all the Government

departments.   If  the  Government  employees  do  not  form   a

sufficient  catchment for the service, they could  open  up  the

centres to workers working in the immediate vicinity or  in  the

same  building.  And who says they should limit this service  to

mothers?  I know there are some fathers who would need this type

of  service  too.   I do hope the Minister would  consider  this

suggestion useful.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I want to move away from child

care  to  the problem of child abuse.  On 14th October 1997,  an

unwed father was sentenced to 10 years for causing the death  of

his  three-month old son.  In today's Straits Times,  a  mother,

sentenced  for  child  abuse, had her sentence  doubled  by  the

courts.  She was described as a cruel animal who should not be a

mother.   Winnie Ho's tragic case, perhaps more than  any  other

case recently, has galvanised public awareness of child abuse in

Singapore.  There is enough ground support for the Government to

ensure wider protection of innocent children and to take abusive

parents to task.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While child abuse cases provide dramatic and visual proof

of the need to intervene, punish violent behaviour in the family

setting, they also raise many questions about the causes of such

disturbingly  violent behaviour.  Some recent  reports  seem  to

suggest that child abuse is precipitated by stress.  A report in

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1668</b></font><br><br>



Sunday  Times of 15th March 1998, for example, quoted a  one  Mr

Chong Meng Fat who had been sentenced for inflicting harm to his

8-year  old daughter as saying that his job as a security  guard

was too stressful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many families no doubt are emotional and economically ill-equipped to care for their children. Caring for a child on low

income  combined with the inherent stress of caring  for  highly

dependent young child can be overwhelming.  Many harried parents

feel overwhelmed by the relentless onslaught of responsibilities

with  their jobs, children and themselves.  But child  abuse  is

not an inevitable outcome in stressful environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to look at both ends of the child abuse

problem.  I strongly support any Government move to ensure  that

child  abuses are appropriately punished.  But at the same time,

we  also need to look into ways of preventing child abuse.   The

effects  of  child abuse are long lasting.  Child  abuse  leaves

physical and emotional scars that are likely to be carried  into

adulthood.  Moreover, victims of child abuse are more likely  as

adults  to  be  violent  towards their children.   We  jail  the

abusers  today but they will eventually be released and continue

to be parents.  How do we ensure that abuse does not recur?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good parenting is not an attribute that we can turn on and

off   automatically.   As  parents,  we  too  need  support  and

guidance.   Can  we take some proactive steps  to  help  parents

become  better parents?  Can we not mobilise resources  to  help

the  community  agencies  put  in  place  counselling  and  care

programmes for parents?  Can we not identify new parents at risk

and  provide  them with support and information about  parenting

and community resources?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could the Minister inform the House on any new

provisions to protect our children and, in particular, would  he

tell  us  whether steps are being taken to help parents  develop

healthy and supportive family environment?  What are we doing to

help  abusers move away from rage, neglect and violence in their

parent-child relationship?
