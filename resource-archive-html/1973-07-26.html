<div align="center"><b>URBAN REDEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House will recall that the

President,  at  the  opening of  this  session  of

Parliament last year, indicated in an addendum  to

his  Speech that an Urban Redevelopment  Authority

would  be  established to implement  a  systematic

programme  of  redevelopment of the Central  area.

The objective is to create a new and gracious city

with  better environment for business,  residences

as well as social activities. To achieve this aim,

the   upgrading  of  the  present  Urban   Renewal

Department  to  an independent Urban Redevelopment

Authority with increased planning responsibilities

and  wider  functions is necessary.  Towards  this

end, this Bill is now before the House.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill establishes the Urban Redevelopment

Authority  as  a  body  corporate  with  a  Board,

consisting of a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman and at

least three but not more than seven other members.

The  Authority  is  given the  responsibility  and

power   on   all   matters   relating   to   urban

redevelopment,  including the clearance  of  land,

development  of land and management  of  buildings

therein.  The  Bill  therefore  provides  for  the

transfer  to  the  Authority of  all  such  lands,

buildings   and  other  properties  belonging   to

Government and the Housing and Development  Board,

as  the Minister may think fit. Provision is  also

made  for  the transfer to the Authority of  every

person  employed  by the Housing  and  Development

Board  in its Urban Renewal Department as well  as

such  employees of the Government who are  engaged

in  discharging the functions to be vested in  the

Authority on terms not less favourable than  those

they  enjoyed immediately prior to the coming into

operation of the Act.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other provisions of the Bill are many, but I

will draw the attention of Members to only some of

the  special features. The first of these is  that

the Authority, in addition to its main function of

comprehensive  planning of the  Central  area,  is

empowered  to sell land to the private sector  for

development   and   to  carry  out   any   finance

development on its own or in conjunction with  the

private  sector.  The Authority  will,  therefore,

continue  the series of urban renewal  sales  that

have   been   so   successful  in  promoting   the

participation  of  private  entrepreneurs  in  our

efforts to rebuild the city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Authority with the approval of the

Minister  may  declare  certain  areas  as   urban

redevelopment areas and may acquire  any  land  in

the  designated area within three years  from  the

date  of declaration, or for such extended periods

as  the  Minister  thinks fit,  at  market  values

prevailing  at  the date or dates of  declaration.

This  provision  will in effect  freeze  land  and

property prices and prevent land speculation in an

area  earmarked for urban redevelopment.  It  will

also  give the Authority sufficient time to  carry

out a survey and census of the area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third special feature confers upon the

Authority   the  responsibility  of   controlling,

developing  and  running car park facilities.  The

Authority  will  take  over  the  Chief  Planner's

functions  in  the provision of car parks  in  new

developments,  and will in due  course  also  take

over  the  responsibilities of  the  existing  Car

Parks  Division. The main objective is  to  reduce

over  a  period  of time kerb-side parking,  which

tends  to  obstruct  the  traffic  flow,  so  that

streets  will  be freed for their right  vehicular

use and traffic congestion thereby relieved. It is

intended  to  build  multi-storey  car  parks   at

strategic locations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

welcome  and support the Bill in principle,  which

no doubt will enable many of our urban redevelopment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>



schemes   to   be   more   effectively

implemented. However, there is one aspect  of  the

Bill  which I would like to comment, and that  is,

Part  VIII  of  the  Bill  which  deals  with  the

regulating  and  controlling  functions   of   the

Authority.  Part  VIII of the Bill  requires  that

every  person who wishes to develop any land shall

submit  to  the Authority proposals and plans  for

the  provision of car parks and car parking spaces

before  applying to the competent authority  under

the  provisions of the Planning Act for permission

to  develop such land. I feel that this is putting

the cart before the horse, since the provision  of

car  parking spaces is dependent upon the use  and

intensity of any proposed development which may be

permitted  by  the  Chief Planner.  Besides,  this

regulatory  function  is  not  explicitly   stated

either  in Part IV of the Bill or in the  Schedule

to  the  Bill,  which deals with  the  powers  and

functions of the Authority. I wonder whether  this

is  a deliberate omission, or whether Part VIII of

the  Bill is an afterthought or a subsequent hasty

addition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt the House will agree that there

could be a basic conflict of interest if the Urban

Redevelopment Authority, whose main functions  and

duties are to prepare and execute proposals and to

sell   and  manage  properties,  etc.,   is   also

empowered  to  perform regulatory and  enforcement

functions as well. Although such function is  only

in  respect  of car park provision, it  is  to  be

realised  that  such a provision  is  normally  an

integral part of any land or building development.

Unless  there is a very good reason for  this  new

Authority to discharge such regulatory function, I

would like to see this function continue to be the

function  of a regulatory and enforcement  agency,

such  as  the Planning Department or the  Building

Control Division of the PWD. If the object of this

particular  Part  of the Bill  is  to  enable  the

Authority  to  finance  and  develop  multi-storey

garages  in  the Central area, then I think  there

are  other more appropriate means of achieving the

same  objective. Besides, it should be  recognised

that  car  parking  is  an  important  element  of

comprehensive land



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>



use  and  transportation policy, and it  would  be

unwise   to   consider  car  parking   policy   in

isolation,  particularly at  this  present  moment

when a decision on a mass rapid transit system  is

still  pending  and that the bus services  in  the

Republic is due for reorganisation again soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore wish to suggest, for the

consideration of the Minister and the House,  that

the  Bill  be  referred to a Select Committee  for

consideration,  as I feel that the  implementation

of  this Bill, particularly Part VIII of the Bill,

is more far-reaching than it appears to he.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  may  I  say immediately that I support  this

Bill,  and  I  think it has come  fairly  promptly

considering the fact that the decision  for  urban

renewal to go corporate was taken only last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not require much scrutiny to grasp the

significance  of this Authority  which  is  to  be

established through this Bill. Going through  Part

IV  of  the Bill and recalling the experience  and

achievements  of the Urban Renewal  Department  of

the Housing and Development Board, its approach to

the problem of resettling hawkers notwithstanding,

one   quickly   sees  that  this  Authority   will

determine  the physical and social structuring  of

redevelopment in the urban areas. To the credit of

the  Urban Renewal Department, it may be said that

the  Department  is  already responsible  for  the

impressive  manner in which the city's skyline  is

shaping.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One obvious merit in having such an Authority is

that,  being  an autonomous body and operating  on

its  own commercial viability, it will escape  the

stringency  of  governmental constraints  most  of

which usually emanate from the Treasury and allows

urban  redevelopment to take on some  acceleration

and  quality. In my view the physical planning for

urban  redevelopment should be based upon  an  in-depth and long-range study of our physical, social

and  cultural  needs  as individuals,  as  primary

groups, and as a society. Such a project



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>



study  calls for a coherent vision of the kind  of

urban life we should have and can have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have learnt that in May 1970 the Urban Renewal

Department began a project to prepare and evaluate

a  detailed plan for the Central area based on the

State  and  City Planning Concept Plan  for  1992.

This Sub-Project which is being prepared with  the

assistance of United Nations consultants under the

United   Nations  Development  Programme  is   not

completed.   It  claims  to  entail  problems   of

distribution  of  land uses in the  Central  area,

road   and  traffic  systems,  land  floor   space

intensities,  open  space, car parking  needs  and

other related problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know to what extent the State and City

Planning Concept Plan for 1992, on which the  Sub-Project   is  based,  is  now  or  will  soon   be

irrelevant  or obsolete in the light of subsequent

policy  decisions on the Mass Rapid Transit System

and   other  major  decisions  relating   to   the

physical,  social and cultural patterns  of  urban

living.  I  should  think that  some  obsolescence

already exists. Building construction technologies

are   advancing   rapidly.  New   techniques   are

available  making what were bold  concepts  a  few

years ago a practical proposition today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I wish to make the suggestion

that  the  Urban Redevelopment Authority give  due

consideration  to  the  feasibility  of   creating

extensive  space below ground level. To-date,  the

creation of space underground has been limited  to

making  provision  for the  parking  of  cars  and

basement facilities in that building. I feel there

is   scope   for   a   dynamic  exploitation   and

manipulation  of  space below ground  through  the

construction of passageways, offices, shopping and

social  centres.  The idea of getting  pedestrians

off   the  streets  and  above  the  roads   along

passageways  is  already  accepted  and  has  been

incorporated  into the physical planning  of  some

urban  renewal  projects. We should  now  consider

doing  likewise below the roads. If  we  begin  to

look at the feasibility of the proposition and its

problems at this stage we will have the advantage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>



of  being  able  to co-ordinate the  planning  for

underground  urban  redevelopment  with  the  Mass

Rapid Transit System project (especially if such a

system uses subways in the Central area) and  with

the  siting of future multi-storey buildings,  and

piling  for  which  must  necessarily  sink   some

distance into the ground. In any case, the need to

take urban redevelopment below ground level should

be  increasingly  compelling  as  space  and  land

become more scarce and expensive at ground level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note, Sir, that the Urban Redevelopment

Authority  will  also  undertake  public   housing

schemes  in  the  Central area, and  thus  in  the

totality   of  its  functions  and  duties,   this

Authority  will  be responsible  for  shaping  the

style  of  urban life in our city  in  the  future

years.  People respond according to the extent  of

the liberation of or restriction on themselves  as

determined  by  the  physical  environment.   Such

responses, when sustained, develop into a style of

life  with its particular modes and mores  and  we

get the society which our environment produces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are ample studies to show us that planning

for urban living must take account of one critical

consideration,   and   that   is   provision   for

meaningful  contact between people.  The  physical

planning for urban redevelopment, in my view, must

ensure  what may be called the optimum environment

which  sustains the mechanism for meaningful human

contact  between  persons,  and  persons  in   the

primary   groups,   that  is,  the   family,   the

children's play group and the adult group  through

adequate housing and effective social and cultural

meeting places.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning must provide the opportunities for

people  to establish meaningful contact as persons

and  not meeting each other in their various role-relationships. A fact of urban dwelling is that  a

person  has  numerous contacts with  other  people

every day, but he is still a lonely person at  the

end of the day. These contacts are superficial and

meaningless. In urban life, the manifold needs  of

a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>



person are easily available. He secures all  these

needs  with money. He thus experiences an autonomy

of  his  person.  Stress in  urban  life  and  the

absence of meaningful human contacts force him  to

withdraw. His autonomy allows him to sustain  this

withdrawal  from society and he is soon alienated.

This  is  referred  to as the autonomy  withdrawal

syndrome by the experts. If this process occurs on

a  large  scale, we may soon find ourselves  beset

with   the   huge  problem  of  resolving   social

pathologies  like  delinquency,  drug   addiction,

crime  and  schizophrenia. Such  alienated  people

create for themselves a way of life which has been

determined by their environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fortunate for us that at this stage of our

growth  we  are  able to study the adversities  of

urban  crises in the major cities in various parts

of  the  world,  and to some extent  identify  the

causes of these crises. We should benefit from the

study  and  recognise the miseries experienced  by

urban dwellers in these cities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, any physical planning for urban

redevelopment  should be based  on  a  substantive

long-range study which has identified the kind  of

urban life we should have, co-ordinated with major

projects such as the Mass Rapid Transit System and

incorporate  new  technologies and  techniques  to

construct  the optimum environment for a  healthy,

peaceful and productive urban society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of conclusion, I wish to observe that

clauses 17 and 18 of the Bill, as has been pointed

out  by  the  Minister, indeed  vest  considerable

powers  in  the  Authority. The clauses  concerned

empower  the Authority, with the approval  of  the

Minister, to freeze land for three years  or  more

for  the  purpose of urban redevelopment,  if  the

Authority so decides. While I understand the  need

for such powers, if the Authority is to be able to

plan  ahead and make suitable feasibility  studies

of  various  redevelopment projects, I would  like

nevertheless to make the point that, first,  these

provisions should be utilised



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>



only after reasonable certainty is established  in

the  overall urban redevelopment planning  of  the

need   for   the  land  for  urban  redevelopment.

Secondly,  that the owner or owners of such  lands

be  given  the choice of developing  the  land  in

question  in  the  manner  planned  for   by   the

Authority   for  the  purposes  of  redevelopment.

Finally, I wholeheartedly support the hon.  Member

for his suggestion to commit this Bill to a Select

Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may

just  supplement what I have mentioned earlier.  I

hope  the  Minister would consider the possibility

of  setting up a special committee, as a matter of

urgency,  to  study and formulate a  comprehensive

transportation   policy  and  strategy   for   the

Republic,  in  conjunction with  the  Ministry  of

Communications   and   other  relevant   statutory

bodies, to guide the provision, distribution,  and

management  of  car  parking  facilities  in   the

Central  area. I appreciate his concern  over  the

present  traffic  and  parking  situation  in  the

Central  area  as reflected in Part  VIII  of  the

Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after that long

lecture on urban redevelopment from the Member for

Serangoon Gardens, I do not think I need add  much

further to my speech. At this stage also, I do not

propose to answer any of the criticisms or queries

of   either   Member,  because  I   accept   their

suggestion  to  commit  this  Bill  to  a   Select

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Urban Redevelopment Authority Bill be

committed to a Select Committee consisting  of  Mr

Speaker  as  Chairman,  and  the  following  seven Members:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley)."--[Mr Barker],





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>BOUNDARIES AND SURVEY MAPS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land holdings appearing in maps published under

the  Boundaries and Survey Maps Act are identified

by  reference to Lot numbers and appropriate  Town

Sub-division  or Mukim numbers, The boundaries  of

Town   Subdivisions  or  Mukims   usually   follow

existing roads or other prominent boundary-marks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the accelerated real estate development in

recent years, the existing boundary-marks of  many

Town    Sub-divisions   or   Mukims   have    been

obliterated. It has, therefore, become  necessary,

in some cases, to alter Town Sub-division or Mukim

boundaries. Furthermore, some development projects

are  sited in two different Town Sub-divisions  or

Mukims, and in such cases before any new title can

be  issued the existing Town Sub-division or Mukim

boundaries  have had to be changed.  The  practice

has  been  for  the Chief Surveyor  to  alter  the

boundaries of Town Sub-divisions or Mukims by  the

publication  of  the alteration in the  Government

Gazette  for  public  information.  While  such  a

practice  is  not prohibited by the provisions  of

the  said  Act,  it is nevertheless not  expressly

provided for by the Act. It is desirable that such

alterations   should   be  covered   by   specific

statutory authority. The Bill, therefore, seeks to

amend  the  Act in order to confer upon the  Chief

Surveyor   the  express  authority  to  make   the

alterations of the boundaries of a Mukim or a Town

Sub-division  when the alteration is  required  by

reason of any change, or revision of any boundary-marks   of   the   Mukim  or   Town   Sub-division

boundaries.  In  addition, the Chief  Surveyor  is

also  given  the authority to alter the boundaries

of   a   Mukim  or  Town  Sub-division  when   the

alteration is required by reason of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since 1969 there has been a sharp increase

in   the  number  of  private  investigation   and

security guard agencies. There are at present some

80  such agencies registered in the Registries  of

Business  Names  and Companies.  Their  activities

cover a wide area and include, inter alia: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the provision of guards for buildings,

hotels, warehouses, factories, shopping complexes

and ships;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the provision of body-guards for wealthy

businessmen;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) enquiries in connection with divorce and

other matrimonial proceedings;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) investigation of claims made under insurance

policies;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) investigation of trade-mark infringements;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) assisting firms, banks and business houses in

enquiries  of a commercial nature, e.g, enquiries

relating   to  credit  status  and  character   of

clients; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) assisting finance companies, moneylenders and

chit fund companies to trace debtors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the proliferation of these

agencies  in  recent years reflects an  increasing

demand  for their services. This has been  brought

about by the rapid expansion in the commercial and

industrial sectors of our Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing legal controls over such agencies are

minimal. Any person desirous of opening an  agency

has  merely  to register it with the Registrar  of

Business  Names,  paying a fee  of  $10,  with  no

questions asked. Thereafter he is free to  conduct

his business in whatever way he thinks fit and  he

may  employ  (as an investigator or as a  security

guard) any person he wishes to employ.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst private investigation and security guard

agencies   can  provide  legitimate  and  valuable

services to the public, the lack of proper control

of  such agencies has culminated in an undesirable

state of affairs. Police records show that quite a

number  of individuals who operate these  agencies

are  of  dubious character. They include ex-police

personnel  with  CPIB records and persons  with  a

criminal  background. Employees of some  of  these

agencies are unreliable and quite a number of them

have  criminal records. Further, a number of these

agencies  are  no  better  than  organisations  of

toughs   using   strong-arm   tactics   for   debt

collection.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last two years there have been 11

criminal  cases  involving employees  of  some  of

these  agencies. The seriousness of the  situation

can be gauged from the following examples:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) On 31st March, 1971, 890 lbs of copper wire

valued  at  $2,500 were stolen from an  electrical

firm at Jalan Besi. Police investigations revealed

that  two  security guards employed to  guard  the

firm  were responsible for the theft. Subsequently

one of them was charged in court and sentenced  to

nine months' imprisonment,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) On 13th January, 1972 a Police ambush party

apprehended three security guards in  the  act  of

stealing $225,128 worth of machinery from  a  firm

in  Jurong, at which they were employed. They were

convicted of housebreaking and theft and sentenced

to terms of imprisonment ranging from two to three

years,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) On 26th April, 1972 an off-duty Police

Inspector and his male cousin were assaulted by  a

uniformed  security guard at a  shopping  complex,

following   an  argument  over  the  question   of

collecting a car from the complex's car park which

was  closed.  The  guard used  his  truncheon  and

inflicted physical injury resulting in a  fracture

on   one   of   the  two  complainants.   He   was

subsequently  convicted of causing  grievous  hurt

and  causing  hurt  to  a public  servant  in  the

discharge of his duty, and was sentenced  to  nine

months'    and    three    months'    imprisonment

respectively,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) On 5th November, 1972, two security guards

(house detectives) and a supervisor employed at  a

leading  hotel accosted three dance  hostesses  at

the  hotel, forced them to strip and used criminal

force  on  them.  The  two  security  guards  were

recently  convicted and sentenced  to  one  year's

imprisonment and $500 fine respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a member of the public hires the services of

a  private investigation or security guard agency,

his  relationship with the agency is one of trust.

He expects the agency and its employees



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>



to conscientiously and honestly render the

services he requires. As the matter stands  today,

quite often it is the agency's employees who steal

the  property of the client whom they are supposed

to guard. Hence, the need for control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to regulate and control the

activities of persons who carry on the business of

a  private  investigator or of  a  security  guard

agency and to provide for the licensing thereof.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 stipulates that after the expiry of two

months from the commencement of the Act, no person

shall carry on the business of or act as a private

investigator unless he is the holder of a  private

investigator's  licence  issued  under  the   Act.

Similarly,  clause  6  provides  that,  after  the

expiration of two months from the commencement  of

the Act, no person shall carry on the business  of

a security guard agency unless he is the holder of

a security guard agency's licence issued under the

Act.   The   terms   `private  investigator'   and

`security guard' are defined in clause 2.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 stipulates that members of the Singapore

Police  Force  and of the Singapore Armed  Forces,

officers  or  employees  of  the  Government   and

officers  or  employees of  any  Auxiliary  Police

Force  duly  created under the provisions  of  the

Police Force Act shall not require a licence under

the   Act  for  the  exercise  of  their  official

functions.  It also stipulates that certain  other

categories of persons who carry on work similar to

that  of a private investigator are exempted  from

the   requirement  of  a  private   investigator's

licence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 provides that the Minister may appoint a

public  servant  to be the licensing  officer  who

shall  be  responsible generally for carrying  out

the provisions of the Act. There are provisions in

the  Bill  which deal with the procedure  for  the

application of a licence, the fees to be paid, and

the revocation of a licence. The licensing officer

shall  refuse  to  grant a private  investigator's

licence or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>



a security guard agency's licence for any one of

the grounds listed in clause 7, namely, if: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(a) satisfactory evidence has not been produced

of  the  good name and character of the  applicant

or, if the applicant is a company, of its officers

holding a managerial or an executive position;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) satisfactory evidence has not been produced

to  show  that the applicant is a fit  and  proper

person to hold a licence;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the applicant has been convicted of any

offence involving fraud or moral turpitude or,  if

the  applicant is a company, any of  its  officers

holding a managerial or an executive position  has

been  convicted of any offence involving fraud  or

moral turpitude; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) he [that is, the licensing officer] considers

it in the public interest to refuse a licence.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for control over the

persons who may be employed by a licensee.  Clause

12    prohibits   the   holder   of   a    private

investigator's licence from employing  any  person

who  has  been convicted of any offence  involving

fraud or moral turpitude or who is, in the opinion

of  the  licensing officer, not a fit  and  proper

person to be employed to assist in the work  of  a

private investigator. Clause 13 contains the  same

prohibition  in  respect of  the  employees  of  a

holder  of  a  security  guard  agency's  licence.

Further, clause 14 stipulates that no person is to

be   employed  in  the  business  of   a   private

investigator or of a security guard agency  unless

his   particulars  are  first  submitted  to   the

licensing  officer.  These  employees  are  to  be

issued   with  identification  papers   by   their

respective employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective control over the type of weapons or

equipment  that employees of private investigation

or  security guard agencies may use is provided by

clause  18.  This clause prohibits a  person  from

carrying   in   a  public  place  any   truncheon,

handcuffs or such other weapon or equipment as the

Minister  may  from  time to  time  specify  in  a

Gazette   notification,  unless  he   has   lawful

authority  to  do  so.  The licensing  officer  is

conferred the power to exempt any person or  class

of persons from the provisions of clause 18.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill confers upon the licensing officer and

upon any police officer duly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>



authorised by the licensing officer the powers  to

search  premises, to arrest persons and  to  carry

out investigations into offences under the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is empowered by clause 27 to make

regulations   generally  for  carrying   out   the

provisions  of  the  Act.  There  is  transitional

provision  in the Bill to deal with those  persons

who  are  employed in the business  of  a  private

investigator or of a security guard agency  before

the enactment of the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial year of a number of statutory

boards  under  the  law  is  the  calendar   year.

However, as the Government financial year  is  the

period  1st  April to 31st March in the  following

year, it may be more convenient for the purpose of

control  for  statutory boards to adopt  the  same

period  for  their  financial  year,  particularly

where  they depend on Government funds  for  their

operations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before the House, therefore, seeks

to  amend  the Singapore Telephone Board Act,  the

Nanyang   University   Act,   the   Housing    and

Development Act, the Hindu Endowments Act, and the

Commercial  and  Industrial  Security  Corporation

Act,  so as to enable the statutory bodies created

by  the said Acts to adopt as their financial year

a period of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>



twelve  months ending on the 31st day of March  in

each   year   and   to  prepare   their   accounts

accordingly,  to  bring  them  in  line  with  the

financial  year of the Government from whom  these

statutory bodies draw their funds.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statutory bodies enjoy exemption from a number of

taxes.  However, there is no uniformity in respect

of  these  exemptions. For example, some statutory

bodies  are exempted from stamp duty while  others

are  not.  Moreover, some of the statutory  bodies

have the exemption embodied in their own statutes,

while   other   statutory   bodies   are   granted

exemptions  under the parent legislation  for  the

tax concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main tax concessions embodied in the statutes

of a number of statutory bodies are exemption from

income   tax,   exemption   from   property   tax,

conferment  of "institution of a public character"

status  whereby donations to the institution  from

the  public  may qualify for income tax deduction,

and exemption from stamp duty. This Bill seeks  to

delete   all   such   tax  concession   provisions

contained in the statutes of the various statutory

bodies concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In future, exemptions will be granted only under

the   appropriate  tax  legislation,  namely,  the

Income Tax Act, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>



Property   Tax   Act  and  the  Stamp   Act.   The

centralisation  of  exemption  under  the   parent

legislation  is  logical and convenient  and  will

enable  any  change in the policy on exemption  to

statutory    bodies    to   be    uniformly    and

comprehensively  applied  without  the  tedium  of

amending the Act for every statutory body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exemption from income tax for statutory bodies

will  be  centralised under the First Schedule  to

the  Income  Tax  Act. As for  "institution  of  a

public  character" status, this will be  conferred

by  a Gazette notification issued under section 37

of the Income Tax Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy regarding property tax is not to

exempt statutory bodies from paying property tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding stamp duty, the policy has been for

some time that all statutory bodies should pay the

stamp   duty  to  reflect  their  true   cost   of

operation.  Any  exemption  will  in   future   be

considered  only on the merits of each  case,  for

example,  as  an  economic incentive  towards  the

development of a financial centre.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes amendments to the Property Tax

Act (Chapter 144 of the Revised Edition) which aim

to  protect  revenue, rectify certain shortcomings

in  the  Act, and streamline procedures. The  main

amendments  deal  with objections  to  assessment,

delegation of more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>



power  to  the  Valuation Review Board,  eliciting

information  for  speedier  assessment   and   tax

collection,   recoveries  of   tax   arrears   and

remission of tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 relates to section 7 of the Property Tax

Act  under  the  existing provisions  of  which  a

refund  of  property tax may be  allowed  for  any

unbroken  period of not less than 30  days  during

which  the  building is unoccupied. The  intention

was  to  refund where the building  vacancy  is  a

month  or longer but, as presently worded, section

7  precludes  a refund for the calendar  month  of

February  which  has  only 28  or  29  days.  This

anomaly will be removed by the amendments proposed

in  clause 2 of the Bill which will permit  refund

of property tax on an unoccupied building provided

it  has been unoccupied for any unbroken period of

not  less  than 30 days or a calendar  month.  The

Comptroller of Property Tax will also be given the

discretionary  power to extend the  period  of  14

days within which a written notice of such vacancy

has  to be given to qualify for refund of property

tax paid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 11 will provide for the situation

arising from the increase in recent years  in  the

number of multi-storey commercial projects,  where

parts   of   such  buildings  are   brought   into

occupational use whilst work on upper floors still

remains  uncompleted.  To  avoid  delay   in   the

assessment  and collection of tax on the  occupied

portions,  it  is  proposed to  permit  the  Chief

Assessor to assess separately and include  in  the

Valuation  List each part of a partially completed

building    as   it   is   used   or   let    out.

Consequentially,  it  is also  proposed  that  the

Comptroller  of  Property  Tax  be  empowered   to

recover tax from the date of use of such part of a

building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 relates to the present practice in

regard to an assessment under objection or appeal,

which is to issue a notice of assessment for every

ensuing  year  so  long as the  objection  remains

outstanding.  This creates unnecessary  work  and,

more  often  than  not, confuses taxpayers  as  to

whether  their original objection would cover  the

assessment for the subsequent years. The amendment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>



suggested  in  clause  4  will  obviate  the

necessity of having to issue notices of assessment

for  ensuing years, unless it is intended to  vary

the  original assessment. It is proposed that once

an  objection is determined, the decision  thereof

shall  be  made applicable to each year  from  the

first assessment or reassessment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 5, 10, 12 and 17 deal with the situation

under  the  Act  at present, where owners  of  new

properties do not have to pay tax when they object

to  the assessments of the Chief Assessor until  a

decision is reached by the Valuation Review Board.

Some  owners,  therefore, resort to objections  in

order  to  delay payments. It is now  proposed  to

require  an owner to pay tax on the assessment  of

the  Chief  Assessor  notwithstanding  any  appeal

lodged;  adjustments will be made as soon  as  the

appeal  against  the assessment is  resolved.  For

example,  if  the Chief Assessor  assesses  a  new

property  at  an annual value of $10,000  and  the

owner  claims  it  to be $5,000 the  tax  will  be

collected,   in   the  first  instance,   on   the

assessment  of  $10,000.  Subsequently,   if   the

Valuation  Review Board determines the  assessment

at  (say) $8,000, the overpayment of tax  will  be

refunded   forthwith,  and  the  Board   will   be

empowered to award at its discretion interest at 6

per cent per annum. If in the opinion of the Board

an  appeal is frivolous or vexatious, it may order

an  appellant  to  pay costs  to  the  Board.  The

proposed amendments will discourage objections and

appeals  made  to defer payment of  tax  and  will

relieve valuers from work on such appeals for more

productive work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where arrears of property tax are sought to be

collected  under  section 19 of the  Property  Tax

Act, disputes may arise and such questions are, at

present,  resolved  by  proceedings  initiated  by

either party in the High Court. It is proposed  by

clauses 12, 15, 16 and 17 to empower the Valuation

Review Board to hear and decide on disputed  cases

of  back-collection  of property  tax.  This  will

expedite the resolution of these disputes as  well

as the collection of tax arrears.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 14 of the Act empowers the Chief Assessor

to  elicit information from the owner, lessee  and

occupier   of   any  property  for  preparing   or

correcting  the Valuation List. The  amendment  of

this  section, proposed in clause 7,  will  enable

the  Chief Assessor to obtain such particulars  as

may  be required from other relevant sources, such

as   architects,   developers,   contractors   and

management  corporations. By the  new  section  19

proposed in clause 11, the Comptroller of Property

Tax is given similar powers but for the purpose of

determining  the tax payable. These proposals,  it

is    hoped,   will   expedite   assessment    and

reassessment of properties and collection of tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 16 of the Act, an owner who has not

received a notice calling on him to pay within six

months  from  1st January, 1961,  is  required  to

notify the Chief Assessor within 14 days after the

expiration of that period. The amendment  proposed

in  clause 8 will require the owner to give notice

of  his  charge-ability to  tax,  if  he  has  not

received  a  notice calling on him to pay  tax  in

respect of his property within six months from the

1st day of January of each year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 17 (8) of the Act prescribes that

whenever the rent of any property which is let  is

increased,  the owner of such property shall  give

notice  thereof  to  the Chief Assessor.  However,

some  owners of properties do not report  increase

in  the  rentals on the pretext that the whole  of

the   increase   is  attributable  to   furniture,

fittings,  service  charges or  maintenance  fees,

etc.  In cases where an owner is in receipt  of  a

premium paid by the tenant as a condition for  the

tenancy,  and  where  an  owner  obtains  planning

permission for development or subdivision of land,

there  is  presently no obligation to inform,  the

Chief  Assessor.  Accordingly,  the  amendment  in

clause 9 seeks to impose a clear obligation on the

owners  to inform the Chief Assessor as  and  when

each  such  situation arises so that the Valuation

List may be amended where



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>

appropriate. All these situations invariably  give

rise to an increased assessment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new subsection to section 34 proposed in

clause  19  provides that if any tax is  not  paid

within the prescribed period, the Comptroller  may

in  his discretion add thereto a sum not exceeding

five  per  cent of the amount of the tax  payable.

Clause  20 introduces another section which allows

payments  of the tax by instalments with  interest

which  shall  not exceed ten per cent  per  annum.

Clause  21  of  the Bill seeks by an amendment  to

section  35  to  give  explicit  powers   to   the

Comptroller   to   execute   the   conveyance   on

properties sold pursuant to section 35 of the Act.

It  will not affect the application of section 123

of  the  Land Titles Act in relation to registered

land. Without this amendment, the power to execute

the  conveyance  of properties  sold  pursuant  to

section  35 has to be implied from the application

of  the  provisions of sections 35 and 38  of  the

Act.  The  power under this amendment is  also  to

apply   to   conveyances   executed   before   the

commencement of the Property Tax (Amendment)  Act,

1973,  as  it is necessary to remove any  possible

doubt  whatsoever as to the regularity or validity

of the execution of past conveyances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 amends section 59 of the Act to provide

for maximum penalty for an offence under this Act,

or  any  regulation made thereunder for  which  no

penalty  is  expressly provided, to  be  increased

from  $500 to $1,000. Clause 23 introduces  a  new

section  to  the Act by which the Comptroller  may

compound  any offence under this Act by  accepting

the  payment  of  a sum of money, and  no  further

proceedings shall be taken against the person  for

the offence committed by him. There are at present

no provisions in the Act for remission of property

tax  on the ground of poverty, or where it is just

or equitable to do so. Under the provisions of the

new section 59A, the Minister will be empowered to

remit  wholly  or in part the tax payable  by  any

person  on  the ground of poverty,  or  if  he  is

satisfied that it is just and equitable to do so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments in the Bill are either

consequential   or  are  designed   to   tidy   up

procedural matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I have only one comment to make on the  Bill

to  amend  the Property Tax Act, and that  is,  to

welcome the token of compassion and generosity  by

the Minister in introducing clause 23 of the Bill,

which  proposes a new section 59B to the principal

Act,  whereby the Minister may grant property  tax

remission  on the ground of poverty or  if  he  is

satisfied that it is just and equitable to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first sight I thought it must have been a

drafting  error,  as it seems patently  ridiculous

that   any  owner  of  real  estate  property   in

Singapore  can justifiably apply for tax exemption

or remission on the ground of poverty or any other

equitable  ground. But, on further  consideration,

the  proposed provision turns out to meet  a  very

real need. One situation I have in mind is that of

a  worker  who has exhausted his CPF contributions

by  paying the initial instalment for his flat and

eventually dies without fully paying for his  flat

and  leaving  perhaps a sum of money  against  his

insurance  policy, which sum may just be  able  to

pay off the balance of instalments on the flat. It

is conceivable that in such a situation, the widow

as  owner  of the flat, and if she is not working,

may have to ask for remission of estate duty until

such  time  as  she  can  make  arrangements   for

alternative  accommodation  and  selling  off  the

flat. I do not know if the Minister has some other

situation in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, at the last sitting of this House

on  11th  July, a Question was asked as to whether

the   Minister  could,  in  view  of  the  greatly

inflated   prices  of  real  estate  property   in

Singapore,  grant  exemption  or  remission   from

estate  duty  in  respect of a family  whose  sole

breadwinner  has  died. The  reply  given  by  the

Minister was that it would be difficult to draw  a

distinction between houses



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>



owned and occupied by such a family and a palatial

mansion  owned  and occupied by  the  heirs  of  a

wealthy    deceased.   In   that   respect,    the

introduction of the proposed section 59B into  the

Property  Tax Act is heartening, as  it  seems  to

indicate  that  the Minister has  second  thoughts

about  the  plight of a family of a deceased  wage

earner.  If  the  principle  underlying   such   a

provision can be extended to the payment of estate

duty by the family of a deceased, who was the sole

principal  wage  earner and who  left  no  sizable

assets  other than the house or flat  occupied  by

the family, either by way of an outright remission

of estate duty for so long as the house or flat is

not  sold  by  way of a deferment  of  tax  for  a

stipulated number of years or until such  time  as

the  family  could  sell off  the  house  or  flat

without being desperate, then the proposed section

59B  could  be rightly regarded as an  example  of

equitable legislation.



<br><br>3.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

clause 8 of the Bill requires a property owner  to

notify the Inland Revenue of his liability to  pay

tax if he has not received a notice calling on him

to  pay tax in respect of his property within  six

months  from the 1st January of each year. Failure

to  do  so is an offence and the offender  may  be

punished with a fine not exceeding $1,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the implementation of this particular

provision, I do hope that the department concerned

will  be  flexible and reasonable in dealing  with

noncompliance by rural folks. I have in mind those

people who at present enjoy concessionary rates at

$6 per annum, as their houses are of timber and/or

attap  material. Perhaps on account  of  the  very

small  sum involved, it has not been the  practice

of the department to send out notices to owners of

such  structures. Consequently, I have come across

many  cases where houseowners have not paid  their

taxes for many years, because at each visit to the

department  to inquire they are told to  wait  for

notices to be sent to them. In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>



most  cases, of course, the notices never seem  to

arrive. Sir, these people are mainly working class

people and they have very little time, apart  from

their  own  personal affairs,  to  look  into  the

numerous  items  of taxes, fees, etc, which  they

have  to pay in the course of any one year. It  is

therefore  inevitable that  such  items  could  be

overlooked.  Take  an average farmer  in  a  rural

area. He has the following items to pay:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Temporary Occupation Licence fee to the Land Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Property tax to the Inland Revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Farmer's licence fee to the Primary

Production Department. There are several types  of

licences depending on the scope and nature of  his operations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Radio and TV licence fee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) PUB bills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Motor vehicle licence fee, if he happens to own a truck or a motorcycle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Hawker's licence fee, if he happens to sell his own produce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Telephone bill. Of course, not every one can

afford  a  telephone, but an increasing number  of

people are installing telephones in their  homes

to  avail  themselves  of  such  modern  means  of communication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore as he does not normally have a bank

account,  the payment of each of these  items  can

involve considerable inconvenience and time, which

is precious to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore take this opportunity of

enquiring  from  the  Minister  whether  he  would

consider  setting  up a central collection  agency

which  will be charged with the responsibility  of

collecting  all types of fees and taxes receivable

by Government departments and statutory bodies. If

this  can be introduced, I feel sure that it  will

benefit  not only the rural folks but the majority

of our population.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I do not have very much to

add  to  what  I have said. The Member  for  Telok

Blangah has said that the Minister was compasssionate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>



with regard to property tax but not estate

duty.  I would only like to remind him that  there

is already a limit of $25,000 within which poverty-stricken people would not have to pay estate duty.

But  it  was  for an extension of this  generosity

that  the  suggestion was made.  In  the  case  of

property  tax, it may be that an attap hut  owner,

as the Member for Jalan Kayu says, has to pay $6 a

year  and he may not even be able to pay that.  We

may be concerned with those cases when perhaps the

Minister  can exercise his compassion of which  he

has some supply, if not very much.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu also touched on the

problem of non-compliance with notification to the

Comptroller. If a notice for payment has not  been

received by the owner within six months, and if he

does not report that he is chargeable to tax, that

constitutes  an  offence.  Again,  we  would  have

regard to the circumstances of the case, and if it

is  found  that  there  is deliberate  evasion  of

property  tax,  then  the  full  force   of   this

particular section in the Property Tax Act will be

made  to apply. Otherwise, at least in the initial

stages,  we will view with some consideration  any

non-compliance with the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Hon Sui Sen].

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision for the payment of salaries of the

Chief  Justice and Judges in Singapore is made  in

the  Judges' Remuneration Act (Chapter  7  of  the

Revised Edition). As a consequence of Government's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>



decision to revise the salaries of  Senior

and  Superscale officers from 1st March, 1973, the

salaries of the Chief Justice and Judges have also

been correspondingly increased. The salary of  the

Chief  Justice has been increased from $3,500  per

month to $7,500 per month, that of the most senior

of  the  Puisne Judges from $2,700  per  month  to

$6,000 per month, and the salaries of other Puisne

Judges  from $2,700 per month to $5,500 per month.

These     revisions     have     been     effected

administratively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to give legal effect to the above revisions.

<div align="center"><b>BUSINESS REGISTRATION BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Business Names Act was enacted more

than  30  years ago, in 1940, and is  limited  in

objectives and coverage, imposing only the minimum

of  formalities, fees and sanctions, and requiring

few  returns  to be submitted to the Registrar  of

Businesses.   To   keep  pace   with   Singapore's

development  as a major commercial  and  financial

centre,  it  is  necessary  that  up-to-date   and

accurate information on business firms, which  are

rapidly   increasing   in   number,   be   readily

available. It is also necessary to revise, up-date

and strengthen the law to prevent the perpetration

of fraud. The Bill, therefore, seeks to repeal the

Business  Names  Act and to replace  it  with  the

Business Registration Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the Bill differ from those of the existing Act in several



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>



major    aspects.   Persons   now   exempt    from

registration under the existing law, notably those

carrying  on  business under their own  names  and

those carrying on business in premises, the annual

value of which is less than $360, will have to  be

registered under the new Act. Registration will no

longer  be a onetime affair; instead clause  9  of

the   Bill  proposes  to  make  it  mandatory  for

registration to be renewed annually. The Bill will

also  confer upon the Registrar of Businesses  the

power  to  refuse  to register or  to  cancel  the

registration of a person:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) where such particulars or information as

may be requested by the Registrar are not supplied

to him by the applicant (clause 9);



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) where the name of the business is

identical  to  or  closely resembles  that  of  an

existing  business, or if the name is  undesirable (clause 11);



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) where a person registered under the Act

has ceased to carry on business (clause 13); or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) where the business carried on is unlawful (clause 30).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major change appears in clause 19 which

enables  the  Registrar to appoint inspectors  for

the purpose of ascertaining whether provisions  of

the  Bill  are being complied with. The  Registrar

and  appointed inspectors are given powers at  all

reasonable times to enter premises believed to  be

used   in  the  carrying  on  of  an  unregistered

business. A penal provision to be applied to those

who resist or obstruct the Registrar or inspectors

in   the  performance  of  their  duties  is  also

contained  in  the clause. Clause 22 prohibits  an

undischarged bankrupt, without leave from the High

Court and without notifying the Official Assignee,

from  direct  or  indirect  participation  in  the

management of a business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other provisions in the Bill which differ

from   those   of  the  existing  Act   are   less

fundamental.  Generally,  tougher  penalties  have

been    fixed   for   non-compliance   with    the

requirements of the Act, while notice periods  for

the  submission  of information, applications  and

returns to the Registrar have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>



shortened. Thus, clause 5 requires that persons be

registered before commencement of business. In the

case  of  those already in business prior  to  the

date   of  commencement  of  this  proposed   Act,

application  for registration must be made  within 30 days

of an appointed date. The penalty for non-compliance

will  be  a  $1,000-fine  and/or   six

months'  imprisonment.  The  carrying  on   of   a

business  under an unregistered business  name  is

prohibited   under  clause  10,  and  any   person

convicted  under this clause will be liable  to  a

$5,000-fine. Clause 12 deals with changes,  making

it  mandatory  for  changes in  particulars  of  a

business to be recorded with the Registrar  within

14  days. In clause 13 a person who has ceased  to

carry  on  business  is  required  to  notify  the

Registrar  within  one  month  (instead  of  three

months) of cessation. The provisions in the clause

empower  the  Registrar to cancel the registration

of businesses that have ceased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Register of particulars kept by the Registrar

will   no  longer  be  open  to  the  public   for

inspection.  Instead  copies  of  Certificates  of

Registration and other particulars can be obtained

from the Registrar at a prescribed fee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 lists the following as offences

punishable  by  a $1,000-fine and/or  six  months'

imprisonment:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The carrying on of a business without a

Certificate  of  Registration or after  expiry  or

cancellation of a Certificate of Registration;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Failure to submit changes of particulars

to the Registrar;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Failure to comply with any summonses or

requisitions of the Registrar;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The making of statements which are false

in  any  material particular or by reason  of  the

omission of any material particular;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Failure to exhibit the Certificate of

Registration or a valid copy of the Certificate in

a  conspicuous position in the principal place  of business; and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) Failure to comply with any regulation made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, the Registrar will be given

powers  to compound offences by collecting  a  sum

not  exceeding  $500 from the  offender.  It  also

provides  that  the Registrar and public  officers

may  not  be  sued  in respect of  any  errors  or

inaccuracies  in  the Register maintained.  It  is

envisaged  that  these new provisions  will  bring

about better administration of businesses, and see

a  more  orderly development in this sector.  With

better control, the early detection of fraud would

also be facilitated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  although Singapore  is  a  country

without  any rich natural resources, it is  highly

developed  in  commerce, industry and  trade.  Its

population  of  more  than  two  million   depends

entirely on its activities in commerce, trade  and

industry  for  its survival. Therefore,  the  laws

relating  to  commerce, industry and trade  should

ensure that all activities concerning such matters

are  efficiently carried out. More important, they

should seek to promote further development of such

activities in order that the whole country and all

its people can benefit even more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the introduction of this

amendment  Bill is a step in the right  direction.

It  is  a  progressive piece of  legislation,  and

ensures the proper control of business. This being

the  case, Sir, it is my hope that in implementing

the  provisions  in  this Bill,  there  should  be

simplification  in  the  procedure   as   far   as

possible. For example, there is a provision in the

Bill  that business registration has to be renewed

annually. In this respect, Sir, the procedure  for

renewal  should be simplified as far as  possible.

It   should  be  as  simple  as  the  renewal   of

television and radio licences. This is  to  ensure

that minimum inconvenience is caused in respect of

applications for renewal.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point to which I wish to draw

the    attention   of   the   Minister.   In   the

implementation  of this Bill,  what  will  be  the

position of non-residents and non-citizens?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think

there  is  anything specific for me to answer  the

Member  for  Sembawang. He  has  asked  about  the

position of non-residents and non-citizens. As far

as  the  law  is concerned, they are  required  to

comply  with the Act just like any other  citizens

or   residents.  As  for  simplification  of   the

procedure for the renewal of registration, I  hope

that  it  will  be  as simple as can  possibly  be

devised by my Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Statistics Bill seeks to amend and

consolidate the law relating to statistics and  to

repeal  the  Statistics Act (Chapter  299  of  the

Revised Edition) which was enacted in 1921.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  may recall that  a  Commission  of

Inquiry on Statistical Activities in Singapore was

appointed  ort  23rd  May,  1968,  to  review  and

recommend  improvements to the existing Government

machinery  for  the collection and compilation  of

statistics.  The  Commission of Inquiry  submitted

its  report  in July, 1969, which was accepted  by

the  Government.  The Inquiry Report  recommended,

amongst  other things, the repeal of the  existing

Ordinance and the enactment of a new Act.  Besides

doing away with references and expressions in  the

legislation which have become



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>



obsolete  with the passage of time,  the  new  Act

should   also   reflect  the  operation   of   the

decentralised  statistical  system.  The  National

Statistical  Commission which was set  up  on  7th

January,  1972,  studied the Inquiry  Commission's

recommendations  and  the result  is  the  present

Statistics Bill, 1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has two basic objectives. Firstly, it

will provide the necessary legal authority to  the

decentralised  statistical units  for  collection,

preparation   and   publication   of   statistics.

Secondly,  and  as  recommended  by  the   Inquiry

Commission, the secrecy provisions will be amended

to enable maximum use of compiled statistics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 3 of the Bill, authority is given to

the    Statistics   Department,    Research    and

Statistical  Units of Ministries and the  National

Statistical  Commission to  collect,  prepare  and

publish  statistics relating to a  wide  range  of

subjects   contained   in  the   First   Schedule.

Authority  is delegated to the Chief Statistician,

Directors  of  Research and Statistical  Units  of

Ministries  and  the  Chairman  of  the   National

Statistical  Commission to issue  requisitions  to

any  person  to  furnish  particulars  and  supply

information to them. Such requisitions would be in

writing, and the legislation specifies the  manner

in  which  the requisitions should be served.  The

Schedule  of subjects on which statistics  may  be

collected  has  also  been  greatly  extended   to

embrace subjects important to policy-making.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also seeks, in clause 5, to amend the

provisions on disclosure of information  so  that,

without  prejudice  to the individual's  interest,

sufficiently  detailed  statistics  can  be   made

available for bona fide purposes, such as research

and  planning. The Inquiry Commission was  of  the

view  that  present  secrecy provisions  were  too

restrictive so that available statistics  are  not

put  to  the best possible use. It felt  that  the

production of statistics per se would have  little

beneficial  effect unless maximum  utilisation  is

made  of  such statistical information. Under  the

present    secrecy   provisions,   even    general

information



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>



such  as addresses, products manufactured, or  any

other  information  which may  be  available  from

other   sources   cannot  be  disclosed   by   the

collecting agency without previous consent of  the

affected  individual. More important, it  has  not

been  possible to give as much detail  as  can  be

reasonably expected in published statistics.  This

is because the Chief Statistician has no powers to

publish  data where such data relates to a  single

individual   or   firm,  lest   it   reveals   its

identities.   In  any  developing   economy,   and

typically one like Singapore, where frequently one

company may constitute an industry, this tends  to

impair   the   comprehensiveness  of   statistical

information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interest of the individual will be

safeguarded  in  that in any  compilation  of  any

report,  summary  or  other communication  to  the

public  of  information obtained under this  Bill,

they  shall  be  arranged so as  to  prevent  any

identification  of  individuals  except  with  the

previous  consent  of  those  individual  persons.

Moreover,  the  Bill provides  that  the  Minister

should  avoid  disclosing trade  secrets,  trading

profits  or  any other information, the disclosure

of   which  is  likely  to  prejudice  the  person

furnishing the return. The Minister is also  given

the  power to further impose restrictions  on  the

disclosure  of  information  should  he  think  it

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill departs from the present Act in that

exceptions  arc  provided to the general  rule  on

secrecy.   These   exceptions   include   compiled

statistics  on the operation of an industry  which

may  be  published, irrespective of the number  of

persons  engaged  in  that  industry,  unless  the

industry  is exempted by the Minister  in  charge.

Information of a general nature, such as  products

manufactured,  size  of establishment,  number  of

employees  and addresses and any other information

which  could  be obtained from other  sources  can

also   be  disclosed.  Information  can  also   be

disclosed  where the individual person  cannot  he

identified and an appropriate time has  passed  or

if  it is for the purposes of any proceedings  for

any offence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>



under   this   Bill   or  any  report   of   those

proceedings. These exceptions, as provided in  the

Bill,  are meant to maximise the use of statistics

for  research and analysis without prejudicing the

interests of the individual.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In repealing the Statistics Act, the Statistics

Bill  has also incorporated the necessary  changes

to  the  quantum of penalties to bring it in  line

with  current money values. Provision is also made

for  the  compounding of offences.  Penalties  are

also provided for the impersonation of Statistical

Officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Census Bill seeks to revise the law relating

to taking a census in Singapore from time to time,

and  to repeal the Census Act (Chapter 297 of  the

Revised Edition) which was enacted in 1930.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With rapid economic development, it is necessary

to    have   more   comprehensive   and   accurate

information  not  only of the population,  but  of

housing,  agriculture, trade  industry  and  other

sectors  of  the  economy. The  present  Ordinance

enacted  43 years ago is now out of date, and  the

present Census Bill is meant to revise and  update

the law for census taking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will enable the Minister to direct that

a census be taken on any of the subjects indicated

in  the  Bill  or  any other  matters  as  he  may

consider  necessary or desirable. It may  be,  for

example, necessary to have an agricultural  census

or a census on building and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>



construction to provide better benchmark data  and

to update such data from time to time. The present

Census Act only allows a population census  to  be

taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same basis as the Statistics Bill,

provision  is made in the Census Bill with  regard

to   restrictions  on  the  disclosure  of  census

information. Secrecy will be safeguarded  in  that

in  any report or abstract of information obtained

under  the Act, the information shall be  arranged

so   as   to   prevent   any   identification   of

individuals,  except  with  the  consent  of  that

individual person. In addition, the Bill  provides

that  the  Minister shall avoid  disclosing  trade

secrets, trading profits or any other information,

the disclosure of which is likely to prejudice the

person furnishing the return.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, exceptions are provided to the general

rule on secrecy. These include compiled statistics

on  the  operation  of an industry  which  may  be

published  irrespective of the number  of  persons

engaged  in that industry, unless the industry  is

exempted by the Minister in charge. Information of

a  general  nature  which could be  obtained  from

other   sources   can  also  be   disclosed.   The

exceptions   also   apply  in  cases   where   the

individual  person  cannot be  identified  and  an

appropriate  time has passed, or if disclosure  is

for  the purpose of any proceedings for an offence

under   this   Bill,  or  any  report   of   these

proceedings. The exceptions as provided are  meant

to maximise the use of statistics for research and

analysis without prejudicing the interests of  the

individual.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penalties in regard to offences under the Act

have  also  been  increased in line  with  present

money values and penalties for impersonation of  a

Census Officer are now spelt out in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The repealing of the Census Act by the enactment

of  the  present Census Bill would go a  long  way

towards tidying up the law to enable the taking of

census  and  through this make available  accurate

and  comprehensive information  for  planning  and

policy making.

<div align="center"><b>RUBBER INDUSTRY BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is the result of a change in

policy  by  the Malaysian Government in regard  to

joint  Malaysian and Singapore Government  control

of  the  industry  in rubber and its  packing  and

shipping   for  export  purposes.  The   Malaysian

Parliament  has now passed an Act to  set  up  the

Malaysian  Rubber  Exchange and  Licensing  Board,

which  will  replace the existing  Malayan  Rubber

Export  Registration  Board  (MRERB),  the   joint

Malaysia/Singapore statutory body, and the Malayan

Rubber Exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the imminent dissolution of the MRERB, which

has  been  regulating  and  improving  the  rubber

industry,  it  is necessary that the functions  of

the  MRERB  continue  to  be  performed  here   in

Singapore. In addition to the MRERB, we have since

1967  established  in  Singapore  one  other  body

connected  with  the  rubber trade.  This  is  the

Rubber Association of Singapore (RAS) which  helps

to   control   and  promote  the   rubber   trade,

protecting   the  interests  not   only   of   the

exporters, but also of the producers and consumers

of  natural  rubber.  It would  seem  appropriate,

therefore, that the RAS should be asked to  assume

functions  not  unrelated to what  it  is  already

doing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill which is now before the House

accordingly  seeks to repeal the  Rubber  Shipping

and  Packing  Control  Act which  constituted  the

MRERB and to confer upon the RAS the functions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>



now  carried  out by the MRERB. It also  seeks  to

amend   the   Rubber  Association   of   Singapore

(Incorporation) Act (Chapter 200  of  the  Revised

Edition)  to  enable  the Association  to  perform

these functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the provisions of the Bill, the RAS will

carry out the following functions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Issuing of licences to rubber packers,

shippers    and   manufacturers   of   technically specified rubber;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Ensuring the quality of rubber exported; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Exercising disciplinary control on the natural rubber industry.



<br><br>I shall elaborate a little on these functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an application is made for a licence to pack

or  ship rubber for export, the RAS will grant the

licence  if, after consideration of the  character

and  financial position of the applicant  and  the

interest  of the public, it is satisfied that  the

applicant is a fit and proper person to  hold  the

licence.  The  RAS will prescribe the  rules  that

must be followed before an applicant for a licence

to manufacture technically specified rubber can be

approved.  Such  rules will  include  testing  and

quality  control procedures to be adopted  by  the

manufacturer of technically specified  rubber  and

the  conditions upon which the licence  is  to  be

issued. Any person whose application for a licence

is  rejected  may  appeal to  the  Minister  whose

decision shall be final.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that all rubbers including technically

specified rubbers exported from Singapore  are  of

the  specified quality, the Bill provides the  RAS

with  powers  to  inspect  books,  documents   and

rubbers  and to cancel the licence if  the  holder

has  contravened any of the provisions of the Bill

or  any  of  the rules made thereunder.  A  person

whose  licence  has been cancelled will  have  the

right  to  appeal to the Tribunal of Appeal  which

shall be established under clause 11 of the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The repeal of the Rubber Shipping and Packing

Control   Act   will  not  prevent  the   existing

registered  shippers  and packers  of  rubber  for

export from continuing operation until the date of

expiry  of  their present licence.  Moreover,  any

manufacturer of technically specified rubber  will

be  allowed  to  continue with  his  manufacturing

operation  for two months from the date of  coming

into  force  of  the Rubber Industry  Act,  during

which  time  the manufacturer should apply  for  a

licence under the new Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also provides for the vesting in the

RAS  of  all assets and property belonging to  the

MRERB   and   all  the  rights,  obligations   and

liabilities  of the MRERB will be assumed  by  the

RAS.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great deal of effort has been put in by both

Malaysia and Singapore traders to shift the rubber

market  from  London and New York to this  region.

This  Government can do no less than to  help  our

traders consolidate the position of Singapore as a

reliable  market  for quality rubber  by  enacting

this  Bill. I hope that both the markets in  Kuala

Lumpur and Singapore will continue to work closely

and co-operate for their mutual benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>INCOME TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill

is,  firstly, to seek legislative authority for  a

number  of  tax  concessions, many of  which  have

previously   been  announced  and,  secondly,   to

tighten up certain of the existing provisions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Act,  which,  in  the  light  of

experience  since  the Income  Tax  Act  was  last

amended in 1969, appear to need improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall first deal with those amendments which

represent tax concessions. Clauses 5 and 12 of the

Bill stem directly from the Government's policy of

developing  Singapore  into a  regional  financial

centre. To sustain the rapid and robust growth  of

the Asian Dollar Market, it is considered that, in

addition  to  liberalisation of  foreign  exchange

regulations  and  exemption  from  income  tax  on

interest paid to non-resident depositors of  Asian

Dollars, further concessions from income  tax  are

desirable  to  create profitable outlets  for  the

Asian Dollar Market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill provides exemption from

income tax on the interest payable to non-resident

holders  of Asian Dollar Bonds issued in Singapore

where  such bonds have the prior approval  of  the

Government.  This  exemption should  help  in  the

flotation  of  more international bond  issues  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 of the Bill provides a reduction from

the  income tax rate of 40 per cent to 10 per cent

or  other special rate on offshore income of banks

or other institutions in Singapore making loans to

overseas   borrowers  from  their  Asian  Currency

Units.  Details  of the kind of loans,  and  their

appropriate rates of tax and other conditions will

be   specified  in  regulations  made  under  this clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with our policy of encouraging Singapore

investment  in  Indonesia, profits repatriated  to

Singapore from approved projects in Indonesia have

been   exempted  from  income  tax.  The  tax-free

profits,  however, presently become  taxable  when

received by shareholders in the form of dividends.

Clause 5 (f) seeks to allow such dividends  to  be

distributed tax-free to shareholders. This "carry-through"  provision  will be consistent  with  the

treatment of Singapore pioneer companies' profits.

Dividends declared from these are tax-free in  the

hands of shareholders.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic development of the Republic requires

large  amounts  of  capital  to  be  borrowed  for

investment.  Some  of  these  borrowers  are,  for

example, statutory boards and high skill and  high

technology  industries in the private  sector.  At

present, Singapore borrowers enjoy concessions  in

respect  of  income  tax on  interest  payable  to

overseas lenders under the Economic Incentives Act

and  under Double Taxation Treaties which we  have

signed   with   many   countries.   The   existing

provisions may, however, be inadequate or may  not

be  applicable in certain cases because we do  not

have   Double   Taxation  Treaties  with   certain

countries.  It  is  intended, therefore,  to  make

provision in the Income Tax Act to enable complete

exemption  to  be given from tax on  the  interest

payable to overseas lenders if the loans have  the

prior  approval of the Government. Clause (5)  (d)

provides  that such exemption from income  tax  on

interest  payable  to  overseas  lenders  will  be

considered where such a loan will promote economic

or  technological  development  of  Singapore  (in

respect of the private sector or statutory boards)

and  in  respect  of  all loans  borrowed  by  the

Government.  I may add here that, generally,  only

for   loans  which  are  sizable,  and  where  the

interest  rate  and the repayments are  favourable

and  the  loans  are made by bona  fide  financial

institutions, will the full exemption be  accorded

under the provision of clause 5 (d).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of Government's efforts to modernise and

encourage   the  intensive  form  of  farming   in

"flatted"  farm buildings, clause  7  will  extend

depreciation allowances to such buildings used for

rearing livestock and poultry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 provides for a deduction of $1,000 or

the full-earned income if this is less, in respect

of   earned  income  relief  from  the   year   of

assessment  1st January, 1972; full  deduction  in

respect  of insurance premiums and provident  fund

contributions  up  to  $4,000  by   deleting   the

limitation of 1/6th of assessable income from  the

year  of  assessment  1973;  and  certain  changes

regarding allowances for maintaining children from

the year of assessment 1st January, 1974,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>



which  are  given  in  detail  in  the  new  Fifth

Schedule to the Bill. I need not take the time  of

hon.  Members  by  spelling out these  changes  as

these   have   been   announced   previously    in

Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next category of amendments in the Bill seeks

to cut some benefits which a minority of taxpayers

have   in  each  case  enjoyed.  The  first   such

amendment  concerns  changes in  the  taxation  of

benefits in the form of free housing accommodation

provided  to directors and employees by companies.

The  present  practice is to regard the  value  of

such  benefit  as  equivalent to the  full  annual

value  of  the housing, if this annual value  does

not   exceed   10  per  cent  of  the   taxpayer's

emoluments. This practice needs to be  changed  in

respect  of rent controlled premises. It has  been

found  that though the annual values of such  rent

controlled  premises are already  very  low,  some

directors   and  employees  receive   even   lower

emoluments  than the annual values of the  houses,

and  pay  very little income tax thereon, although

they  may  be occupying very large and prestigious

rent  controlled premises. Clause 3 of  the  Bill,

therefore, seeks to deem the full annual value  of

rent controlled premises provided to directors  or

employers  by companies to be gains or profits  of

employment, and therefore subject to tax, if their

remuneration  is  less than the  annual  value  of

premises provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Income Tax Act was last amended in 1969,

exemption from income tax was accorded for profits

of  Singapore registered ships. This was  done  to

encourage more registration of ships in Singapore.

The intention was to give income tax exemption  to

large  sea-going  ships  only,  but  because   the

provisions  are vague, passenger ferries,  barges,

fishing  trawlers and tongkangs and  miscellaneous

local  harbour craft have also been  applying  for

exemption.  Clause  6  will clearly  restrict  the

exemption to Singapore sea-going ships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Income Tax Act was amended to disallow carry-forward of losses on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>



takeovers where a company with accumulated  losses

was  bought  purely for tax benefits. It  is  also

proposed  to  bring into line with this  amendment

the   carry-forward  of  depreciation  allowances,

which  is also another source of tax manipulation.

Clause  8  accordingly seeks  to  disallow  carry-forward  of  depreciation  allowances  where   the ownership of a company is changed substantially.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charitable organisations and charities in

Singapore,  unlike those in some  countries,  have

hitherto  been subject to very little scrutiny  or

supervision    of    their    activities.    These

organisations    and   charities    enjoy    major

concessions under the Income Tax Act, as they  get

full exemption from income tax on contributions of

donors  and on their own income. It would  not  be

unreasonable,  therefore,  to  require  under  the

Income  Tax  Act  that  these organisations  apply

their  tax  exempt  income solely  for  charitable

purposes,  that  they do not engage  in  trade  or

business  except  in pursuance  of  their  primary

purpose,  and  that  a reasonable  part  of  their

income is distributed every year. Clause 5 of  the

Bill provides that charitable organisations should

distribute  not  less than 80 per  cent  of  their

income,  unless  it  is otherwise  agreed  by  the

Comptroller of Income Tax which he will do if  any

reasonable  grounds  are  presented  why  a  lower

proportion should be spent. To prevent one  common

abuse  of  its tax exemption status, any  expenses

which  do  not fall directly within the  ambit  of

charity  can  be  disallowed  by  the  Income  Tax

department. As the proposed amendments will ensure

that    charitable   organisations   fulfil    the

objectives of their founders, I do not expect them

to be other than generally welcomed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stock Exchange which witnessed a lot of

speculative  activity  last  year,  also  saw  the

emergence  of "share option schemes".  Such  share

option  schemes allow directors and  employees  to

take  an  option to buy shares in the  company  at

often a nominal price. Clause 3 of the Income  Tax

Act will make it clear beyond doubt that gains



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>



or profits from share option schemes are liable to

income tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 clarifies that income tax will be

imposed  on  the profits made by a life  insurance

company  on  the  sale  of  its  investment.  Such

investment  is an integral part of the  day-to-day

business of an insurance company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 will disallow income tax deductions by

individual  taxpayers on life insurance  premiums,

unless  the  insurance  company  concerned  has  a

branch  or office in Singapore. This amendment  is

logical    and   equitable   as   the    Insurance

Commissioner   has  no  authority   over   foreign

insurance companies not operating in Singapore and

such  companies do not pay any tax  in  Singapore.

The  proposed amendment will not, however,  affect

existing  policy  holders  who  pay  premiums   to

insurance companies overseas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present rate of penalty for late payment of

tax  is 5 per cent interest on outstanding arrears

of  income tax payments. This rate is too  low  to

induce  some  taxpayers to  make  early  payments.

Clause  14  provides  that  the  penalty  rate  of

interest of 5 per cent will be increased by 1  per

cent  for every month that the tax remains  unpaid

up  to  a  maximum of 12 per cent. This  amendment

should  prevent delinquent taxpayers from wilfully

delaying their payments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now deal with the last category of

amendments  which  are  intended  to  remove   any

vagueness in the existing provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 seeks to make it clear that interest

paid  by a local borrower to a foreign lender  and

interest  on  a  loan, the funds  from  which  are

brought into or used in Singapore, are taxable  in

Singapore irrespective of where the loan agreement

is made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 5 and 11 seek to remove any doubt that

non-resident directors are liable to a  flat  rate

of  40 per cent tax, irrespective of the period of

their presence in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 seeks to define the residential status

of individual taxpayers and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>



companies  because  of  the  changeover   to   the

preceding year basis of assessing income tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining amendments are consequential and procedural in nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, speaking as

one Member from a rural constituency, I am pleased

to  note  that  for  once tax incentive  is  being

introduced  as a measure to encourage  development

in  the agricultural sector. I have in mind clause

7  which  provides for allowances  for  industrial

buildings and structures to be granted in  respect

of  multi-storey buildings used or intended to  be

used for the purposes of intensive pig and poultry

production.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in considering the practical effect of this

particular  provision, it occurs to  me  that  the

incentive  provided may benefit only a handful  of

big  timers  with substantial financial  resources

behind  them. In so far as the thousands of medium

and   small-sized  farmers  are   concerned,   the

proposed   incentive   is   to   my   mind   quite

meaningless. In the first place, how are they able

to  raise  sufficient funds to purchase lands  for

development,   not   to  mention   the   cost   of

construction  at a time when prices  of  materials

are so high?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Government is genuine in its

intention  to encourage development of agriculture

along  modem lines, and I believe this to  be  the

case,  I  suggest that the Government should  give

serious  consideration to the  provision  of  much

needed  organisational support and long  term  low

interest  loans to interested farmers on  a  group

basis  for  the  development of multi-storey  farm

houses.  Perhaps  a scheme similar  to  the  house

ownership  scheme of the Housing  and  Development

Board (we can call it "Farm Ownership Scheme") but

with   suitable   adjustments  to  the   repayment

programme may be introduced. If the Government  is

prepared  to undertake the task of organising  and

financing  the scheme initially, I feel sure  that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>



Farm Ownership Scheme is likely to succeed. For  a

start,  the Government may wish to consider  areas

where  farmers  are  scheduled  for  resettlement.

Instead  of  the  present system of  compensation,

those  affected and are interested  in  continuing

their  farming business may be resettled in multi-storey  farmhouses. By doing it  on  a  collective

basis, large savings can be made in infrastructure

development which is becoming more costly in  view

of  the  need  to  adopt  extensive  antipollution

measures,  such as construction of  septic  tanks,

drainage system and other sanitary amenities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at a time when a number of countries in the

world arc suffering from a shortage of food, it is

comforting  to  know that our agricultural  sector

continues  to supply us with many essential  items

of   food  at  reasonable  prices.  But  for   the

contribution  of our farmers, I am sure  that  our

cost  of living would have risen to a much  higher

level,  as happened in many other countries  which

depend  heavily on imports of food. With  this  in

mind,   Sir,   I  would  urge  the  Minister,   in

consultation   with  the  Minister  for   National

Development, to give serious consideration  to  my

suggestion  so as to ensure that our  agricultural

sector  will  continue  to  make  this  meaningful

contribution to our national economy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indebted to

the   Member  for  Jalan  Kayu  for  his  valuable

suggestions.  As he has suggested, I  will  confer

with the Minister for National Development to  see

whether  or  not  any  of his suggestions  can  be

considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, however, say that this provision in the

Bill    was   intended   really   to   apply    to

industrialised farming, which the future Singapore

must get into, that is, to run the flatted factory

farm  in the way that an industry is run. I  think

this  requires  more skilled management  than  the

individual   farmer  can  provide,   even   on   a

collective basis. However, I do not think  we  can

deal with the problems



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>



of  agriculture while considering this  particular

Income  Tax  (Amendment) Bill,  and  the  Member's

suggestions  therefore should be referred  to  and

considered in other more appropriate areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 5 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is an amendment standing in

the  name of the Minister for Finance on the Order

Paper   Supplement,  which  is  subject   to   the

Speaker's consent and the general assent  of  hon.

Members  present for dispensation of notice  under

Standing  Order 33. I give my consent, is  it  the

pleasure  of  hon. Members that the  amendment  be

moved?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 6, to leave out lines 31 to 35 inclusive and insert



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"income of a shipping enterprise" means the

income  derived by a shipping enterprise from  the

carriage (other than within the limits of the port

of  Singapore) of passengers, mails, livestock  or

goods  by  sea-going Singapore ships and  includes

the income from the charter of such ships;"".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was the intention of clause 6 of the

Income  Tax (Amendment) Bill to remove  any  doubt

that  under  the existing provision of section  13

(a)  of  the  Income Tax Act, the  exemption  from

income tax to Singapore registered ships does  not

apply to harbour craft, such as passenger ferries,

fishing  boats,  tongkangs,  etc.,  which  operate

within    the    Port   limits    of    Singapore.

Unfortunately, clause 6 of the Bill,  as  drafted,

could  also be construed to exclude any  Singapore

sea-going  ship which does not call at  Singapore.

The purpose of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>



the  exemption  from income tax  is  to  encourage

registration of all sea-going ships registered  in

Singapore,  irrespective of whether they  call  at

Singapore or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is proposed by the present

amendment to reword the definition in clause 6  to

make it clear that there would be no change in the

exemption  from  income tax of seagoing  Singapore

registered  ships,  but not of vessels  which  are

used only within the Port limits of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 7 to 15 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is a note,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 12, line 8, after "Gazette", to insert close inverted commas and a fullstop.



<br><br>This will be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill which is now before the House seeks to

establish the Singapore Institute of Standards and

Industrial  Research  (or SISIR  in  short)  as  a

statutory body. The Institute will take over  from

the   Economic  Development  Board  the   latter's

responsibilities  in regard to  the  promotion  of

standardisation   and   the   operation    of    a

Certification Marking Scheme.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will in addition give SISIR wider powers

to   establish  and  implement  schemes  that  are

necessary  for  the  promotion  of  Singapore-made

products.    Presently,   SISIR    operates    the

Certification  Marking  Scheme  for  products  and

processes which conform to, the relevant Singapore

standard  or  other international standards.  This

gives   intending  purchasers  of  a  product   an

assurance by an independent body that the  product

conforms  to  the highest standards. Manufacturers

join   this  scheme  voluntarily.  However,  where

Singapore's  good  name as a manufacturing  nation

may be affected because some manufacturers produce

shoddy goods, SISIR is empowered, under the  Bill,

to  make  export  inspection of certain  types  of

goods  compulsory.  It  is thus  part  of  SISIR's

function  as  a  statutory body,  to  upgrade  the

technology  in local industry and to  ensure  that

the  Made-in-Singapore label  is  synonymous  with

quality and reliability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SISIR's main functions as provided in the Bill

may, therefore, be summarised as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To promote standardisation in industry and

trade  with  a view to improving not  only  the

quality  of  commodities, but  also  industrial

efficiency and productivity;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) To operate a Certification Marking Scheme and

other related schemes for locally made goods;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) To operate a scheme of quality control of

specified  commodities exported from  Singapore

for the purpose of developing and promoting our

export trade; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) To upgrade local skills and technology

through  the provision of technical consultancy

services   and   through  the  application   of

industrial research.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill contains various provisions relating to

the establishment, constitution and administration

of the Institute. The Institute is to consist of a

Chairman and eight other members, all of whom  are

to be appointed by the Minister.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>



The Bill also contains provisions dealing with the

Institute's   financial   year,   the    financial

procedure to be adopted by the Institute, and  the

preparation of financial statements and  auditor's

report  for presentation to Parliament.  Provision

is  also  made under the Bill for the Minister  to

make grants to the Institute of such sums of money

that may be provided by Parliament for the purpose

of   enabling  the  Institute  to  carry  out  its functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the expanded powers conferred under the

Bill, the Institute will be able to carry out  its

functions with greater efficiency and to  play  an

increasing role in promoting the sustained  growth

of  our  local  industry and of our  export  trade

through its various quality schemes. The Institute

will  also play a crucial role in upgrading  local

skills  and  technology through its technical  and

engineering  services and through  its  industrial

research consultancy services. With autonomy,  the

Institute  will  be given a proper legal  standing

which  will  greatly facilitate the  execution  of

contractual agreements with clients in the private

sector. Ultimately the Institute should form  part

of  the  infrastructure provided by Government  to

stimulate  economic and industrial growth  and  to

enable  us  to take off to the next stage  of  our industrial development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to speak in support of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one looks at the functions and powers of the

Institute,  as  stated in clause  15,  one  easily

notices  that nearly all the functions listed  are

those  which  the  present SISIR already  fulfils.

Indeed   SISIR   has  garnered  extremely   useful

experience  in the course of its operations,  some

of which are well worth listing:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) SISIR has already received and discharged

several  commissions to seek ways  to  overcome

certain  production problems  in  a  number  of

local or locally-based concerns;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) SISIR has been in the forefront of the PQR

movement,  a side-benefit of which  is  SISIR's

modest contribution to better labour/management

relations;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) SISIR has set standards for scores of

industrial  items, not just  for  the  sake  of

devising standards, but related practically  to

quality control. SISIR's certification has also

covered more than 200 products;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) SISIR's work has been so successful that UNIDO (United Nations Industrial Development

Organisation)  has asked Singapore  to  host  a

seminar  to show developing countries what  can

be done in the field of standardisation;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) SISIR has run several courses on quality

control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that our stage of industrialisation has

reached  a more sophisticated level, the  services

of   SISIR  will  be  more  critical,  and  it  is

necessary  for  SISIR  to  be  established  as  an

independent authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, there are two specific

criticisms which I would like to make in  relation

to  this  Bill.  One is that while there  is,  and

rightly so, repeated mention of the need to ensure

the  viability of our export drive through quality

assurance  where our local products are concerned,

there  does not seem to be much concern  over  the

possibility  of shoddy goods being  imported,  now

that our policy is to remove tariffs and quotas in

the  case of several import items. Let me make  it

clear,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, that I  do  not  support

protection   of   weak   and   inefficient   local

industries. The lesson of quality must  be  driven

home in no uncertain way where local industries



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>



are  concerned. But the same standards of  safety,

health requirements and quality which we insist on

our  local  products must be imposed  on  imports.

Otherwise,  our local industries will face  unfair

competition  from  cheap but shoddy  imports,  and

consumers  will  witness the dumping  of  inferior

goods  from abroad. I therefore hope that  amongst

SISIR's  tasks  one will be the  surveillance  for

quality   of  imported  goods,  especially   those

affecting local industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is the useful role that S1SIR can

play   in  helping  to  tackle  the  problems   of

environmental  control. Many factories  are  faced

with  the problem of seeing that adequate measures

are  taken in this direction. I am told that  some

commercial  consultants in this field  may  be  no

more  than  salesmen of equipment. Industries,  in

trying  to  comply with environmental regulations,

may  be  landed  with  equipment  not  necessarily

suitable for local conditions. SISIR has  a  range

of   multi-disciplinary  facilities  that  may  be

usefully  directed towards tackling  environmental

problems. I hope that every encouragement will  be

given  to seeking SISIR's consultancy services  in

this area of environmental control.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I appreciate the

Member  for Katong's general welcome to  the  Bill

and  his  well-deserved praise for SISIR  and  its

activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also welcome his suggestions, which I do not

regard as criticisms, although he may term them as

such.  I will look into the matters which  he  has

commented upon. However, it may well be  that  the

question  of shoddy and cheap imports  is  not  so

much a matter for SISIR as for some other body  or

some  law  governing  imports  and  exports.  But,

nevertheless,  I  think his suggestions  certainly

have merit and deserve consideration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for his suggestion to consult SISIR when

dealing  with  environmental problems,  I  believe

that  SISIR is already doing considerable work  in

this regard, and that the Singapore Manufacturers'

Association  has been accustomed  to  seeking  its

advice. In regard to highly specialised problems -

this may be something on which, like other general

practitioners,  SISIR  may  have  to   call   upon

specialist services elsewhere. But, in  the  first

instance,  I  think the services which  SISIR  can

render would be most helpful to our industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in recent years a number of statutory bodies

have  included  in  their Statutes  provisions  to

exempt  them from income tax. The Statutes of  the

Republic  of  Singapore (Miscellaneous Amendments)

(No.  4) Bill, 1973, just passed, has removed such

provisions from the various Statutes of  statutory

bodies.  The  intention of my resolution  is  that

these  statutory bodies affected will continue  to

be  exempted  from income tax, hut  the  exemption

will  now  be centralised under the First Schedule

to the Income Tax Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is also taken to include five

other  statutory bodies, namely, the Timber Export

Industry  Board,  the  Land Surveyors  Board,  the

Professional  Engineers Board, the Commercial  and

Industrial Security Corporation and the Industrial

Training Board, which have no income tax exemption

provisions   in  their  Statutes  but   which   in

accordance  with the current policy  should  enjoy

equal treatment with the other statutory bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to sub section (1)

of  section  106  of the Income Tax  Act  (Chapter 141), resolves that the First



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>



Schedule  to  the said Act be varied by  inserting
