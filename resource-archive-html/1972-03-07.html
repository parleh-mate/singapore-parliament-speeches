<div align="center"><b>WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ACT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Amending legislation for enhanced compensation)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minster for Labour

if he will introduce legislation to amend the Workmen's

Compensation Act (Chapter 130)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



(i)    to   ensure  that  a  workman  who   suffers

permanently  disabling injury  is  compensated  for

loss  of  earnings, medical costs,  rehabilitation,

pain,  suffering, shock, loss of  standing  in  the

community, humiliation, mortification and all other

forms  of tangible and intangible ill-effects;  and

(ii)  to entitle a permanently disabled workman  to

monetary  compensation exceeding  several-fold  the

rates and sums laid down under the existing law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Labour):</b> (i) Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Workmen's Compensation Act provides  that  the

workman  who  suffers as a result  of  an  accident

arising  out of and in the course of his employment

shall be entitled to compensation. The compensation

is  related to the loss of earning capacity and  is

intended  to be a substitute income contributed  by

the employer. In addition, the employer is required

to  bear  medical costs arising out of a  workman's

hospitalisation and treatment, including artificial

and surgical appliances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Act, the injured worker is

entitled to compensation, regardless of whether  or

not  he  is  responsible for the accident.  Members

will  no  doubt agree that this is a practical  and

realistic approach to the question of compensation.

However, the worker has the option of proceeding to

claim damages in the Civil Courts if he feels  that

the liability for the accident can be attributed to

the employer or a third party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kallang will no doubt agree that

whatever the quantum of compensation, it can  never

fully  compensate the worker who sustains an injury

resulting   in  permanent  disablement.   Moreover,

compensation on the lines suggested by  the  Member

will  present  numerous difficulties  in  practice,

such  as  quantifying the compensation payable  for

such   intangible  ill-effects  like  pain,  shock,

mortification, humiliation and loss of standing  in

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



community.  However, may I assure the  Member  that

practical  suggestions from  him  would  always  be

given due consideration by the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Members will recall that the Workmen's

Compensation  (Amendment)  Act,  1971,  passed   by

Parliament on the 19th October, 1971, had increased

considerably, in fact, threefold in most cases  the

quantum   of  workmen's  compensation  payable   to

workmen  and  their dependants. Under  the  amended

provisions,  a workman above the age  of  18  years

would  be entitled to a sum of $28,800, or  a  lump

sum equivalent to 60 months' earnings, whichever is

the less, for injuries resulting in total permanent

incapacity.  The Act also specifies separate  rates

of compensation payable to workmen below the age of

18  years  and those below the age of 16 years.  In

addition  to  the compensation for total  permanent

incapacity, the Act provides that the workman would

also  receive  an  additional  one-quarter  of  the

computed  sum  where he is unable  to  perform  the

essential  actions  of  life without  the  constant

attention of another person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the very recent amendments providing

for increased quantum of compensation, the time  is

not   opportune  for  further  amendments  to   the

Workmen's Compensation Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of hankering over the quantum of

compensation, may I suggest that it would  be  more

fruitful  for  all  concerned to concentrate  their

time and energy in getting the trade unions and the

workers to play a more active and constructive role

in  the prevention of accidents. This could be done

through  education of the workers and  by  exerting

greater pressures upon the employers to provide for

a  safer and healthier working environment. As many

accidents were due to the irresponsibility  of  the

employers as well as the negligence on the part  of

the  workers and their stubbornness and  resistance

to  using  protective  apparels  and  other  safety

devices,  I  would like to count on the support  of

the Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



for   Kallang   when  Government  prosecutes   such

recalcitrant    employers    and    workers     for

infringements  of the provisions of  the  Factories

Act and the regulations made thereunder.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  have  much to educate the employers  too.

What  I  want  to know is: will the  Government  be

prepared to undertake a claim for damages  for  and

on  behalf of an injured workman if, on the face of

it, there is evidence to show that his employer had

partly  or wholly contributed to the cause  of  the

industrial   accident   which   resulted   in   his

sustaining an injury?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, as I said in my answer

earlier, workmen's compensation does not take  into

consideration  who  is at fault.  However,  if  the

injured  worker  feels that he is not  responsible,

but  that there is a third party involved, or  that

the  employer is responsible, then he can take  the

case up to the Civil Court.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, will the

Government spare an injured workman all the  ordeal

and legal expenses incurred in securing a claim for

damages?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, as provided for, claims can

be  made under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  But

if  the injured workman wants to take other courses

which  are  open to him, then I am afraid  he  will

have  to follow the procedure as laid down  in  the

Courts of Law.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Sir, if I may ask a last

supplementary question. The principles that I  have

laid  down  are found to be practicable in  certain

countries.   Will   the   Government   accept    my

proposition in the final analysis?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, as I have said earlier, I

assure  the  Member that any practical  suggestions

that  he has to make are welcome and will be  given

due  consideration, and will he please put them  up

in writing.

<div align="center"><b>(Construction of second runway)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for

Communications whether his Ministry has come  to  a

final  decision  on the construction  of  a  second

runway for the Singapore Airport; where will it  be

constructed; and when construction is  expected  to

commence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the basis of the present

rate  of  growth  of air traffic in  Singapore,  my

Ministry anticipates that a second runway would  be

needed around 1977 or 1978. The utilisation rate of

the present runway capacity at Paya Lebar is around

40 per cent and is increasing rapidly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, 41,241 commercial aircraft, two

million  passengers,  25.5  million  kilograms   of

freight  and 2.8 million kilograms of mail,  passed

through the Paya Lebar Airport. This represents  an

increase of approximately 20 per cent, 20 per cent,

21  per cent and a drop of 10 per cent respectively

over the 1970 performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the second runway is needed around 1977-78,

construction  will  have to commence  around  1974.

Therefore,  the  Department of  Civil  Aviation  is

proceeding with work to build the second runway  at

the Singapore International Airport at Paya Lebar.

<div align="center"><b>RENEWAL OF CLASS IV DRIVING LICENCES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Imposition of limit in unladen weight)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Communications (a) if he knows to the best  of  his

knowledge that persons who had been granted class 4

licences   under   the  Motor   Vehicles   (Driving

Licences)  Rules,  1948, which  qualified  them  to

drive  heavy  motor cars with no maximum  limit  in

unladen  weight, have on renewal of their  licences

been  granted  a  similar class licence  under  the

Motor  Vehicles  (Driving  Licences)  Rules,  1969,

which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>



automatically disqualified and debarred  them  from

driving   vehicles  exceeding  7  tons  in  unladen

weight;  (b)  if  he  is aware that  it  is  common

occurrence that holders of class 4 heavy motor  car

licences  are  still driving vehicles  exceeding  7

tons in unladen weight with the full knowledge, but

with  no  valid  authority;  of  the  Registrar  of

Vehicles;  and  (c) in view of the fact  that  such

persons  might be committing road traffic  offences

and  might  face serious consequences, if  he  will

take  urgent steps to restore to such persons,  who

held class 4 heavy motor car licences granted under

the  Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences) Rules, 1948,

their  status and qualification in all fairness  to

them  and in the interest of the general public  in

the other respect.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the

Registry  of Vehicles driving licence records  were

being computerised on 1st February, 1969, the  1948

Motor   Vehicles  (Driving  Licences)  Rules   were

replaced  by the 1969 Rules. In order to streamline

the  driving  licence  records  and  to  facilitate

issuance  of  driving licences, the  classification

for  motor  vehicles was at the same  time  reduced

from nine to five classes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that persons issued with Class IV

licences under the old rules were allowed to  drive

heavy  motor-cars  with no  maximum  limit  in  the

unladen  weight, whereas persons issued with  Class

IV licences under the new rules are not licensed to

drive heavy motorcars above seven tons, for which a

Class  V  licence is required. This, however,  does

not  mean  that  under the Motor Vehicles  (Driving

Licences) Rules, 1969, those who had acquired Class

IV  driving licences before 1st February, 1969  are

being automatically disqualified and debarred  from

driving  heavy  motor-cars above  seven  tons.  The

validity of licences issued under the 1948 Rules is

not affected, as the 1969 Rules were not introduced

with retrospective effect. In addition, there is  a

saving  clause  under  Rule 17  (3)  of  the  Motor

Vehicles (Driving Licences)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



Rules,  1969, which provides that the new rules  do

not  alter  the classes of motor vehicles  which  a

holder  of  a  licence has been licensed  to  drive

before  the  date  when the  new  rules  come  into

operation.  Those  issued with  Class  1V  licences

before  1st February, 1969 are, therefore,  legally

entitled  to  drive  heavy motor-cars  above  seven

tons.  The  question of restoring to  these  people

their  status and qualifications to drive  vehicles

above seven tons, therefore, does not arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reducing the classes of vehicles from nine to

five, an unfortunate anomaly was created when those

persons issued with Class IV licences prior to  1st

February,  1969  renewed the old licences  for  new

ones, as the new driving licences contained a  pre-printed  description  of all the  five  classes  of

vehicles  as defined under the new rules.  In  this

description, Class IV vehicles are defined as heavy

motor-cars above 2j tons up to seven tons, although

these  people are legally entitled to  drive  heavy

motor-cars  above seven tons as  they  had  X  been

granted licences prior to 1st February, 1969.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to express my gratitude

and  thanks to the Member for Kallang for being  so

alert and drawing the attention of my Department to

this  anomaly.  The  necessary amending  Rules  re-classifying the classes of motor vehicles under the 1969  Rules  to make driving licences issued  under

the 1948 and 1969 Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences)

Rules   equitable,  have  been  published  in   the

Government  Gazette on 25th February, 1972.  Action

will also be taken by the Registrar of Vehicles  to

change  the  pre-printed description  of  the  five

classes of vehicles as contained in the new driving

licences.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Communications whether the operational  profits  of

the Port of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  Authority  in  1970  would  enable   the

Authority  to pay a bonus for productivity  to  its

monthly-rated employees; and whether the  Authority

is  considering paying such bonus, just as  it  had

paid a bonus to such employees in the past, and  if

the bonus will be paid as soon as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the

Member  for  Anson  has used the term  "operational

profits" of the Port of Singapore Authority for the

year  1970,  may  I state that the  term  `profits'

would  appear  to  be  a  misnomer  and  the   word

`surplus' would perhaps be more appropriate for the

situation.  We  generally talk of  `profits'  of  a

commercial  organisation, which will be distributed

amongst shareholders or the staff. But in regard to

surpluses, if any, of a statutory organisation like

the  P.S.A.,  these will be reinvested for  further

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, may I refer the Member for Anson

to  Supplements  1/72 and 2/72  of  the  Government

Gazette dated 28th January, 1972, where it will  be

noted that whereas the Revenue for P.S.A, for  1972

is  estimated at $144 million with a net surplus of

$51  million, the estimated Capital Expenditure for

the same period will be no less than $63 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming now to bonus, the Minister of State for

Finance  has previously made clear the Government's

stand  with  regard to payment of  bonuses  to  its

employees.  As a statutory board, the  P.S.A, must

conform generally to Government's policy on matters

relating  to remuneration, terms and conditions  of

service.   This  means  that  bonuses  for   P.S.A.

employees  cannot be considered, but any betterment

in  the  remuneration and terms and  conditions  of

service of Government employees might, as far as is

applicable, be extended to P.S.A, employees.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, except for an

occasional  vehicle breakdown which is  inevitable,

regular  direct  collection  of  refuse  has   been

provided to Malabar Street, portion of Bugis Street

between  Victoria Street and Malabar Street,  Malay

Street  and  Purvis Street every  morning.  In  the

event of a vehicle breakdown, the refuse is usually

cleared  in  the afternoon or, at the  latest,  the

next morning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Hylam Street and the portion of Bugis Street

between  Malabar  Street  and  North  Bridge  Road,

refuse  is  collected by handcart as these  streets

are  impassable  to  the refuse  collection  wagon,

owing  to  the location of the overhead  pedestrian

bridge,   hawkers  and  lock-up  stalls  near   the

junction of Bugis Street and North Bridge Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleaning of drains in this area is also being

carried out regularly. However, the streets in this

area are lined on both sides by street hawkers with

heavy  congestion  at  Bugis and  Malabar  Streets,

making  the  cleaning  of  drains  infinitely  more

difficult.  This  is  because  the  hawkers   cause

obstruction to these drains by placing planks  over

them  to serve as additional preparation area. They

are also in the habit of discharging their washings

directly  into  these drains. As a result,  besides

being  swept, the drains have also to  be  flushed.

However, the flushing of drains has been restricted

to about twice a week to conserve water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be a great help in keeping the drains

clean if the Member for Bras Basah would advise the

hawkers  to  cooperate by refraining  from  dumping

left-over   food  and  sullage  waste  from   their

washings into the drains.

such prohibition.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr L. P. Rodrigo) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, parking at any

time  along  the first approximately 30  metres  of

Holloway  Lane  from  its  junction  with  Victoria

Street  is  prohibited by a single white line.  One

side  of  the rest of the lane is for paid  parking

and  the other side is prohibited to parking at any

time by traffic signs. These restrictions have been

imposed because Holloway Lane is only 20 feet  wide

and carries continuous traffic. There are, however,

no  restrictions  to the parking  of  vehicles  for

loading and unloading of goods in Rochore Road. The

prohibition   to  parking  in  Holloway   Lane   is

stipulated by a white line and traffic signs  which

are  promulgated  in Rule 43 of  the  Road  Traffic

Rules,  1950,  and the Traffic Signs (Size,  Colour

and Type) Rules, 1970, respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vehicles may still park in the "No Parking" area

for  the purpose of loading and unloading of  goods

provided no obstruction is caused to traffic  flow.

Drivers  must, therefore, ascertain that  they  are

not  causing any obstruction to traffic flow before

stopping  their vehicles for loading and  unloading

purposes.  The  problem is that some  lorries  park

side  by  side  for  loading or  unloading,  whilst

others  are  parked  in  "No  Parking"  areas   for

purposes  other  than the loading or  unloading  of

application, from time to time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore not true that women in this

category   are  required  to  renew  their   passes

fortnightly    at    the   Immigration    Woodlands

have  not  applied for an Entry Permit or a  Social

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to introduce a Bill  intituled

"An Act to amend the Economic Development Board Act

(Chapter 189 of the Revised Edition)".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill read the First time.

<div align="center"><b>Second Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the financial year of the

Economic  Development Board -under the law  is  the

calendar   year.   In  1969,  however,   when   the

Government  changed  its financial  year  from  the

calendar year to 1st April - 31st March, the  Board

did  likewise  because it is  wholly  dependent  on

Government funds for its operation, and adopting  a

similar  accounting system was both  practical  and

convenient for purposes of control. It is necessary

now  to make provision through clause 3 of the Eco.

nomic Development Board (Amendment) Bill, 1972,  to

enable  the Board to adopt as its financial year  a

period  of  12  months ending on the 31st  day  `of

March  in  each  year and to prepare  its  accounts

accordingly. There is a transitional provision  for

the  Board's financial year in 1969 to be 15 months

commencing  on  the 1st day of January,  1969,  and

ending  on  the 31st day of March, 1970.  Following

the change in the financial year, the submission of

the  Board's Annual Report will have to  he-amended

accordingly,  and  this is being  provided  for  in

clause 4 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is also being taken to

incorporate  a  provision in  clause  2.  -for  the

appointment   of  the  Chairman  of  the   Economic

Development Board to be either full-time  or  part-time, since at -present there is provision only for

a  full-time officer. This will provide for greater

flexibility in appointment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Works Department to take over the functions of  the

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion*

standing in my name on the Order

Paper.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The motion reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act(Chapter 270), approves -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the construction of a dam across the mouth of Sungei Kranji as shown coulured dark brown on the plan

marked 'LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 1/72' which is deposited in hte Land Office, Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the dredging of part of Sungei Kranji bed for the construction of a spillway channel as shown coloured

blue on hte same plan; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the filling up of the sites shown coloured green and mared 'Zone A' and 'Zone B'

on the same plan with the dredged materials.



<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the implementation of the

Kranji/Pandan  Water Scheme, which  will  mobilise

nearly all the water resources in the western part

of  Singapore, the Public Utilities Board proposes

to  construct  a  dam across the mouth  of  Sungei

Kranji  to  form  an impounding reservoir  with  a

storage capacity of 3,300 million gallons. Details

of the scheme are shown on the plan marked

`LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 1/72', a copy of

which  is  displayed in the Library of this  House

for   the  information  of  Members.  The   Pandan

Reservoir and the Jurong Reservoir which form part

of  the  Scheme will provide storage capacity  for

another  1,100  million and  100  million  gallons

respectively.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dam will be about 3,200 feet long with a

width  of  approximately 70 feet  at  its  top  to

provide  for  a future arterial road  linking  the

Kranji  Industrial Estate with Lim Chu Kang  Road.

It  will rise to a maximum height of about 61 feet

from  the river bed and its crest level will  have

an  elevation  of  13 feet above mean  sea  level.

Included in the dam project is a concrete spillway

channel  of  175 feet width for the  discharge  of

floods   occurring  upstream  of  the  dam.   This

spillway  channel  will  be  controlled   by   the

provision of three electrically operated gates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The materials required for the construction of

the  dam will be obtained from the quarries  along

Mandai   Road  and  Bukit  Timah  Road.  Extensive

dredging of part of Sungei Kranji bed and its left

bank near its mouth is, however, necessary for the

construction of the spillway channel. The  dredged

materials  will  be used to fill up  the  mangrove

swamps in the vicinity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole project, which will be partly financed

by  the Asian Development Bank, is expected to  be

completed within three years at an estimated  cost

of   $74.5   million  excluding  costs   of   land

acquisition,    resettlement   and   antipollution

measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act(Chapter 270), approves -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the construction of a dam across the mouth of Sungei Kranji as shown coulured dark brown on the plan

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section

2  of  the Local Treasury Bills Act (Chapter  72)

resolves   that  the  Minister  for  Finance   be

authorised  to  borrow by the issue  of  Treasury

Bills  in Singapore a sum not exceeding Singapore

three thousand million dollars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the 10th July, 1968, Parliament

resolved,  in accordance with section  2  of  the

Local  Treasury Bills Act (Chapter 72), that  the

Minister be authorised to borrow by the issue  of

Treasury  Bills  in  the  Republic  a   sum   not

exceeding $1,000 million in amount.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demand for Treasury Bills has been

increasing rapidly over the last few months,  and

the  present  limit of $1,000 million  is  likely

soon  to  be insufficient. There is apparently  a

large   quantity  of  surplus  funds  which   arc

available for investment for short periods. It is

also  essential  that  in  our  efforts  to  make

Singapore  more  of  an  international  financial

centre,   banks,  as  well  as  other   financial

institutions,   including  Government   statutory

bodies,  should be provided with a secure  short-term  investment  outlet  for  such  funds.   The

authority  of Parliament is, therefore, requested

to  enable the Government to issue Treasury Bills

up to an amount not exceeding $3,000 million



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section

2  of  the Local Treasury Bills Act (Chapter 72),

resolves   that  the  Minister  for  Finance   be

authorised  to  borrow by the issue  of  Treasury

Bills  in Singapore a sum not exceeding Singapore

three thousand million dollars.

authorised   to  increase,  on  behalf   of   the

Government,  the total subscription of  Singapore

to  the  authorised capital stock  of  the  Asian

Development  Bank  to a sum not exceeding  twelve

million  five  hundred  thousand  United   States

dollars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Board of Governors of the Asian

Development  Bank  has adopted  a  resolution  to

increase the capital stock of the Bank by 150 per

cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's subscription to the Bank is at

present  500 shares, equivalent to US$5  million.

Under    the   proposed   increase,   Singapore's

subscription  will be increased by a  maximum  of

750 shares, equivalent to US$7.5 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a large borrower of the Bank and

has  obtained US$73.68 million in loans from  the

Bank   to-date.  The  Republic,  therefore,   has

benefited  from  its  membership  in  the   Asian

Development  Bank  and,  it  is  envisaged,  will

continue  to  borrow from the  Asian  Development

Bank  to  finance its future economic development

plans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament is requested to authorise the

Government to increase the total subscription  of

Singapore to the authorised capital stock of  the

Asian  Development  Bank to a sum  not  exceeding US$12,500,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section

respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of provision approved under the Civil

Household  on  public  utility services,  telephone

rentals, printing, stores and maintenance of Istana

Domain,  and the additional expenditure in  hosting

of functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, necessary to augment the

to $15,000; the provision for "Salaries of Personal

Staff" from $390,000 to $508,620; and the provision

<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of

the  Government for the financial year  1st  April,

1972 to 31st March, 1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, when I presented the Budget for the

financial  year  1971-72, 1  tried  to  assess  the

probability  that the high growth rate  of  15  per

cent for the Singapore economy as measured



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



by  the  Gross Domestic Product (or G.D.P.) in  the

preceding years could be sustained in 1972.  I  was

fairly  confident that the general policies we  had

adopted, including our emphasis on the major growth

sectors   including  export-oriented  manufacturing

industries,  were  basically  correct   for   rapid

economic growth but warned against possible adverse

factors which might upset our carefully laid plans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary figures show that, in the event, with

a  14  per  cent G.D.P, increase, we did not  quite

attain the 15 per cent growth target, although  the

outcome   of  the  last  year's  working  must   be

considered  highly satisfactory. With the  momentum

generated  during the preceding year,  the  economy

initially   moved   forward   rapidly    but    was

subsequently slowed down by the instability  caused

by the international monetary crises which occurred

in the latter part of 1971.



<br><br><i>Survey of International Economic Events</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That year will probably go down in the annals of

economic  and financial history as a turning  point

for  the world monetary system. For the first  time

since  it established its complete dominance  after

the  Second  World War, the strength  of  the  U.S.

Dollar  was  called  seriously  into  question.  At

first, it was suggested that the U.S, should favour

a  policy  of  "benign  neglect"  of  the  dollar's

weakness. This casual attitude soon disappeared. In

May,  the  first  indications of potential  trouble

came  with the free floating upwards of the  German

Mark,  and  the revaluation of the Swiss Franc  and

the  Austrian  Schilling. This was  followed  by  a

period of intense speculation in the Mark, the Yen,

and finally against the U.S. Dollar, which resulted

in  a rapid deterioration of the dollar's position.

Finally, the international monetary system  devised

at  Bretton-Woods,  of internationally  agreed  par

values and strictly maintained exchange margins  of

not more than 2 per cent, collapsed with the "Nixon

shock" in August, announcing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



suspension of the convertibility of the dollar  and

the  imposition of a 10 per cent surcharge  on  all

U.S, imports.  The draconian measures  adopted  to

shore  up  the dollar's crumbling defences  and  to

exact  trade concessions from her trading  partners

(including  restraints  in  textile  exports  under

"voluntary"     agreements)     had      widespread

repercussions  on world economies.  Many  countries

were  obliged  to  float  their  currencies  or  to

restrict dealings in their currency exchanges,  and

the   resultant  uncertainties  on  prices  had   a

depressive effect upon world trade. There was  even

talk  of  retaliatory  restrictions  being  imposed

against  U.S, goods. By the end of the year,  wiser

counsels  prevailed and the crisis began to  recede

with an agreement for the devaluation of the dollar

against  gold  and realignment of all  other  major

currencies on new parities or central rates  either

in  terms  of  the U.S, dollar or gold.  To  ensure

further stability, the limits within which currency

rates were allowed to fluctuate were widened from 1

per  cent to 2� per cent on either side of  parity.

This wider band should, theoretically, give greater

flexibility  to  governments  intending  to  defend

their   central  rates  against  speculation.   The

financial  world has therefore been  given  respite

from  impending  disaster, but the  basic  problems

underlying  the  monetary  crisis  remain   to   be

resolved. The year 1972 may yet see a recrudescence

of  the  old  symptoms  and  a  recurrence  of  the

disease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the general realignment of currencies when the

dollar  was devalued in terms of gold by  8.57  per

cent,  Singapore  followed  the  British  Pound  in

maintaining  its gold parity. In other  words,  the

Pound  Sterling  was revalued upwards  against  the

American Dollar by 8.57 per cent, and the Singapore

Dollar maintained its parity with Sterling and  was

also revalued upwards by 8.57 per cent against  the

U.S.  Dollar.  However,  in  relation  to  all   of

Singapore's  world trading partners  the  effective

net revaluation for the Singapore Dollar has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



calculated to be only 0.53 per cent. Our trade with

Malaysia  will be completely unaffected  as  parity

between  the  Singapore and Malaysian  dollars  has

been maintained, but one consequence of Singapore's

decision   not   to   follow  the-American   Dollar

downwards may be some small increase in the overall

cost  of  imports. However, this increase could  be

reduced  if  trade  and  capital  transactions  are

changed  in  direction  to take  advantage  of  the

altered  currency rates. Thus, unless  prices  also

change,  imports from Japan and Germany  which  are

now relatively more expensive as suppliers, may  be

reduced  while  imports  from  the  United  States,

cheaper   because   of  devaluations,   should   be

increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monetary uncertainty had a deleterious effect

on  trade last year. In a preliminary assessment of

international trade in 1971, the General  Agreement

on   Tariffs   and  Trade  (G.A.T.T.)   Secretariat

indicated that there was a marked slowdown  in  the

rate  of growth of world trade in 1971. The  volume

of trade grew by a mere 5 per cent - well below the

average  annual  growth of the sixties.  In  dollar

values,  the  increase in trade was  close  to  the

average  of  9.3  per -cent for  the  last  decade.

However,  the  value figures are  inflated  by  the

parity  changes during the year and  even  so,  the

rise  remains well below that recorded in 1969  and

1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British Government's decade-long quest to

join  the  European Economic Community (E.E.C.)  on

acceptable terms has finally succeeded. The British

Parliament  endorsed  by  a  sizable  majority   in

October 1971 the principle of Britain's entry  into

the E.E.C. In spite of the narrow majority recently

on  the Second Reading of the legislation to effect

such entry, we must expect that Britain will be  in

the European Common Market in January 1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Britain's move to identify herself more with the

European  community  of  nations  will  have  major

effects on her relationship with other Commonwealth

countries and on the role and status of the Pound



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



Sterling  as  an  international  currency  and  the

monetary  reserve  assets of  other  Sterling  Area

countries.  Singapore  will  now,  therefore,  like

other  members  of  the  Commonwealth  and  of  the

Sterling  Area,  have to consider her  position  in

relation to these two matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in regard to the change in its trading

relationship with Commonwealth countries under  the

present  system  of Commonwealth  preferences,  the

British entry into an outward-looking E.E.C, should

not have too serious effects on Singapore's trading

position. The main dislocation is likely  to  arise

from the application of the common external tariffs

of the E.E.C, which the United Kingdom will have to

implement  in  stages  on imports  from  non-E.E.C.

countries.  The  ultimate  situation  will  be  the

eventual   elimination   of  preferential   tariffs

enjoyed by Commonwealth members in their trade with

Britain  in the past. While our entrepot trade  may

be  affected in volume and our earnings reduced  on

the  export  of entrepot trade commodities  to  the

E.E.C.,  it  is  mainly our domestic  exports  into

Britain  which  will be affected by the  difference

between  the Commonwealth preference rates and  the

E.E.C, common external tariff. Less than one-third

of  Singapore's present exports to Britain  are  of

domestic  origin,  but this is likely  to  increase

considerably in the future. Singapore would benefit

from freer entry into an enlarged E.E.C, market for

its  goods.  It  is  therefore  our  intention,  by

establishing  an  official  representation  to  the

E.E.C, in    Brussels,   to   investigate    the

possibilities  of  negotiating an associate  member

status  or a trade agreement with the E.E.C, which

will  facilitate  such entry. This  could  be  done

bilaterally and also, as has been suggested,  in  a

common  approach  with other ASEAN (Association  of

Southeast Asian Nations) countries, on the 1ineX of

the  South American Andean Common Market talks with

the E.E.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is the question of Singapore's

Sterling reserves. After



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



Britain's entry into the E.E.C., she is.; committed

to  Sterling  playing  a  diminishing  role  as  an

international reserve currency, and consequently, I

assume,  to  the running down of the Sterling  area

reserves   and  its  replacement  by   some   other

international currency in general trading  use,  or

by  funding in some form of created reserve  asset,

such  as  the  I.M.F.  Special Drawing  Rights  (or

S.D.Rs). The latter is the more likely in  view  of

the British Chancellor of the Exchequer's Speech at

the I.M.F./ I.B.R.D. (International Monetary Fund /

International     Bank    for    Reconstruction-and

Development)  meeting in Washing-, ton  last  year

favouring  S.D.Rs or some, new form of  it  as  the

num�raire in the new international monetary system.

In that event, since we do not regard S.D.Rs, as at

present constituted to be a satisfactory substitute

for  the  Pound Sterling,, we may have to  consider

how  we  can, safeguard the value of our  external.

reserves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By an agreement signed between the-British arid

Singapore Governments, not less than 36 per cent of

Singapore's, external  reserves  are  at   present

required, to be held in Sterling. In consideration

of  this  obligation, 90 per cent of such. Sterling

reserves  are  guaranteed  by  Britain  against   a

devaluation of the British Pound by more than 1 per

cent  from  its old parity of US$2.40  to  1.  The

currency realignment after the recent international

monetary  crisis  resulted in.  Sterling  having  a

parity  or  central rate-of US$2.6057 to the  Pound

and a wider margin of 2� per cent on either side of

parity,   which   clearly  renders   the   Sterling

Guarantee  Agreement  inapplicable  without   major

amendment. To meet the new situation, therefore,  I

propose  to  initiate discussions with the  British

Government for the cancellation or amendment of the

Sterling  Guarantee Agreement in  order  that  some

further diversification of our external assets may,

if necessary, be considered.

<br><br><i>Singapore's Economy in 1971</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to discuss in some -detail the

performance   of   our   economy.   I   am    again

distributing,  for the convenience  of  Members,  a

number  of statistical tables (See Appendix, cols. 553-88), upon which I  shall partly base my remarks.





<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1972/19720307/19720307-HA-0310553.pdf"">Appendix to Annual Budget Statement(Cols. 553-588)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have previously mentioned the figure of 14 per

cent in connection with our preliminary figures for

G.D.P, growth  in  1971. The  more  commonly  used

indicator  of  overall growth, the  Gross  National

Product  (G.N.P.)  has  also been  calculated  this

year.  Preliminary estimates of G.N.P, at  current

prices  for  the year show that it rose  by  $860.8

million to reach the level of $7,000.8 million.  In

percentage  terms, this represented an increase  of

some  14.0  per  cent which, though somewhat  lower

than   the   17.2  per  cent  recorded  for   1970,

nevertheless compared favourably with  the  average

growth  rate of around 14.1 per cent per annum  for

the period 1966-70. Estimates of G.N.P, at constant

prices  are  not  yet  available  at  this  moment.

However, since the general price levels except  for

certain  lines of consumer goods have been observed

to show mild increases, it can be expected that the

real growth in G.N.P., discounting price increases,

would  not  deviate significantly from the  current

price  estimation.  Growth was, therefore,  in  the

main non-inflationary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the population growth of nearly 2 per cent

in  1971,  the per capita G.N.P, at current  market

prices  advanced by about 12.1 per cent from $2,960

in  1970 to $3,317 in 1971. At these levels the per

capita  G.N.P, is the second highest in Asia  after

Japan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another interesting indicator is that for Gross

Domestic Expenditure (G.D.E.) representing resource

use.   Preliminary   estimates   of   G.D.E, also

registered a comparable high rate of increase.  The

expenditure  on  all goods and  services  for  1971

amounted to $6,759.3 million, which is about $1,000

million,  or 17.4 per cent higher compared  to  the

1970  estimates. As for G.N.P., the  G.D.E, growth

rate was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



slightly  below the level experienced  in  1970  of

around 21.0 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase was contributed by both components,

namely,  consumption  and  gross  domestic  capital

formation. Capital formation rose substantially  by

$383.6  million, or 27.9 per cent, to reach a  high

level  of $1,759.3 million, which consumption  rose

more moderately hut still at a sizable rate of 14.1

per  cent  to  reach $5,000 million.  The  rise  in

capital  formation, though somewhat less than  that

achieved in 1970 of $421 million, or 44.2 per cent,

was  still  substantial, and it can  be  said  with

confidence that Singapore's political stability and

its  potential for profitable economic  development

continue  to be recognised by investors both  local

and abroad. Economic Development Board estimates of

commitments  for additional foreign  investment  in

new  industries or for expansion of  existing  ones

indicate  that  this will total $930  million,  not

much less than the $1,000 million for 1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gross Domestic Capital Formation, which registered

a  growth rate of 27.0 per cent per annum  for  the

period  1967- 69, rose sharply to a peak  level  of

44.2  per  cent  in  1970 over 1969.  Although  the

growth  for  1971 of 27.9 per cent  was  noticeably

below the rate experienced in 1970, nevertheless it

measures up to the trend of growth for the  earlier

period  1967-69.  The  lower  growth  rate  of  new

investments in 1971 can be explained partly by  the

slowing   down   of  construction   activity,   due

primarily to the shortage of capacity - labour  and

material  resources - in the industry generated  by

the  boom in building activity during the past  two

to  three years. This lack of capacity has also led

to   the  control  of  urban  renewal  development.

Further,  a  relatively  smaller  growth  rate   in

expenditure  on  machinery and equipment  was  also

registered  compared to 1970,  and  this  has  also

contributed to the smaller growth rate in the Gross

Domestic  Capital Formation during the  year.  This

was due to the establishment in 1970 of a number of

large   industries   where  expensive   plant   and

machinery have been set up.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substantial expansion in Gross Domestic

Capital  Formation in 1971 reflected the  increased

pace of development efforts in both the public  and

private   sectors.   Private   sector   investments

increased by 29.3 per cent to $1,304.3 million  and

public sector by 23.9 per cent to $455 million.  As

in  previous years, the private sector's  share  of

capital expenditure was maintained at a high level,

accounting for about 74 per cent in 1970 and  1971,

as  against 26 per cent for the public sector.  The

increase  for  the  private sector  was  mainly  in

respect  of expenditure on transport equipment  and

construction    of    non-residential    buildings,

primarily   of  offices,  shopping  complexes   and

factories,  whereas for the public sector,  it  was

mainly  in  respect of machinery and equipment  and

public housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure on transport equipment by the private

sector  increased  very substantially  from  $108.2

million  to  $271.5 million, giving an increase  of

150.0  per  cent,  and  this comprised  largely  of

purchases of ships and air--craft by Neptune Orient

Lines and Malaysia-Singapore Airlines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of consumption, public sector

expenditure rose much more sharply by 35.1 per cent

than did private consumption expenditure (10.2  per

cent).   The  increase  in  Government  consumption

expenditure, which has been expanding rapidly since

1969,  far  exceeded the rate achieved in  1970  of

25.5  per  cent,  whereas for  private  consumption

expenditure it was below the 1970 level of 13.5 per

cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net result of these changes is that the share

composition of private consumption expenditure fell

from  64.3  per cent in 1970 to 60.4  per  cent  in

1971,   whilst   that  of  Government   consumption

expenditure  and  Gross Domestic Capital  Formation

rose  from 11.8 per cent and 23.9 per cent to  13.6

per  cent  and  26.0 per cent respectively.  It  is

significant   that   the   share   of   consumption

expenditure (both private and public) to total

-expenditure  fell from 93.4 per cent  in  1960  to

74.0 per cent in 1971, whereas



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



for   Gross  Domestic  Capital  Formation  it  rose

markedly  from 6.6 per cent to 26.0  per  cent,  an

increase of nearly four times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest increase in private consumption

expenditure  in 1971 was registered in  expenditure

on  clothing, furniture and durables,  housing  and

transport,  which  was  in  line  with  the   trend

experienced during the past few years. The  outcome

of  this is that the share of expenditure on  basic

necessities, primarily food, has fallen  from  32.3

per  cent in 1960 to 25.4 per cent in 1971,  whilst

the  shares for other items have risen accordingly.

This  is a reflection of the rising economic  well-being  of  the population. With respect  to  public

sector consumption, the sharp increase of 35.1  per

cent  in 1971 as well as for the previous two years

of  over  20  per cent was largely for the  defence

build-up.



<br><br><i>Gross Domestic Product by Industrial Origin</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we turn to review the Republic's

performance  in the various sectors of the  economy

in 1971, it is perhaps in order to mention that the

rapid  growth,  particularly during the  past  five

years,  has  been  accompanied by  some  degree  of

structural  transformation  of  the  economy.   The

manufacturing  and construction sectors  registered

rapid growth particularly during the last five-year

period whereas the trade and other services sectors

had  a  relatively lower rate of  growth.  The  net

result  was  that  the  share  composition  of  the

manufacturing and construction sectors jointly rose

sharply from 11.2 per cent in 1960 to 25.5 per cent

in  1970  and 28.5 per cent in 1971. On  the  other

hand,  the  ratio of the trade and  other  services

sectors  to  the G.D.P, has slipped from  70.7  per

cent in 1960 to only 58.6 per cent in 1970 and 55.5

per cent in 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should now like to review the development of the

major     sectors,     primarily     manufacturing,

construction,   trade,  Government   services   and

utilities,  and  other  services  sectors,  of  the

economy  and their impact on the overall growth  of

the Republic.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>(i)    Manufacturing Sector</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1971, manufacturing industries generated an

income contribution of $1,490.9 million to G.D.P.,

an  increase of 30.3 per cent compared to 27.5 per

cent  in 1970. This was nearly eight times as much

as  in 1960, while G.D.P, grew by three times over

this period. This rapid development has raised the

share  composition of the manufacturing sector  to

total G.D.P, from 9.2 per cent in 1960 to 23.0 per

cent in 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manufacturing industries are becoming

increasingly characterised by orientation  towards

exports  and  by  the  higher  quality  of   their

products.  Overall,  some  40  per  cent  of   our

domestic  manufactures is exported. Among  pioneer

companies, exports account for some two-thirds  of

their  output. Last year, more than  one-third  of

our  domestic exports went to developed countries,

as  compared with less than one-fifth  five  years

ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fastest growth was recorded by the petroleum

refining, manufacture of electrical machinery  and

apparatus,   and  ship  building   and   repairing

industries   where  increases   in   value   added

averaging  around 40.0 per cent were recorded.  In

addition  to  these industries, other  sub-sectors

also  registered favourable growth during 1971  as

compared to 1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the major obstacles in industrial growth

experienced  in  1971 was the  acute  shortage  of

skilled  labour  for specific  industries.  Up  to

1971,   increases  in  output  were   matched   by

increases   in  employment.  The  average   labour

productivity  in  manufacturing  appears  to  have

risen  very little and rapid industrial  expansion

has  been  wholly  dependent on a  growing  labour

input.  However,  this is not likely  to  continue

since  the rapid restructuring of the economy  and

the  raising  of the technological  level  of  the

labour   force   through   retraining   and    the

acquisition  of new skills are now being  actively

promoted, as I shall describe later.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth of the industry will also-have to

depend  on  higher  productivity and  Government's

policy is aimed at achieving this target.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data from the Census of Industrial Production

showed  that the largest industrial sector in  the

economy is petroleum refining which accounted  for

about  33.4-per  cent  of  total  output  for  the

manufacturing sector in 1971. By the end of  1970,

total  refining capacity in Singapore amounted  to

368,000  barrels daily. In 1971 the  capacity  was

increased by a, further 250,000 barrels  per  day.

However,  although petroleum refining is a, major

activity  in  terms of output, in terms  of  value

added  the contribution of this industry to  total

value  added  of manufacturing is  only  20.2  per

cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Associated with the oil industry and. Singapore's

position  as the fourth largest port in the  world

is  ship  building  and ship repairing,  which  is

included  under transport equipment industry.  The

transport equipment industry ranked a close second

with  15.4 per cent of total value added, and this

in  turn  was followed by the electrical machinery

industry, which contributed 14.2 per cent of total

value  added. Of the more traditional  industries,

food,  beverage  and  tobacco  industries  jointly

accounted  for another 9.4 per cent of the  total.

value added.



<br><br><i>(ii)   Construction</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution by the construction industry,

which has been growing rapidly since 1967, rose by

about  16.6 per cent, to $352.5 million  in  1971.

Although  the growth rate was much lower  compared

to  the  previous year of 47.1 per  cent,  it  was

nevertheless among the highest rates-registered by

the  other sectors and was-well above the 14.0 per

cent for the-overall G.D.P. As a result, its share

in  G.D.P, was maintained at about the same  level

as  in the previous years of around S per cent  or

eight  times over 1960. The lower growth rate  for

1971 compared to 1970 can be largely attributed to

the  shortage  of capacity faced by  the  industry

both in terms of labour and contracting skills and

materials which have been developing for some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



time  now. The building boom over the last two  to

three  years has been caused by a combined  demand

from  the  massive public housing  programme;  the

boom  in  hotel and office construction stimulated

by   the  urban  renewal  programme;  as  well  as

construction   associated  with   the   burgeoning

industrial  expansion. This has exerted  excessive

pressure  on  all  resources associated  with  the

construction industry, including labour. Suppliers

of  construction materials were also hard  put  to

meet  demands and temporary shortages on a  number

of occasions in 1971. The situation was aggravated

by speculators moving in to corner the market, and

Government had to step in on a number of occasions

to  authorize  controlled  imports  of  restricted

building materials to meet the shortage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deceleration of the growth in this sector

during  1971  was  primarily in  respect  of  non-residential  buildings in the private  sector  due

largely  to the curtailment of sales of sites  for

urban  renewal  projects.  Construction  of   non-residential  buildings comprising mainly  shopping

and  office  complexes undertaken by  the  private

sector  registered a relatively small increase  of

21.9  per cent compared to 121.6 per cent in 1970.

On  the  other  hand, construction of  residential

buildings  forged ahead with a higher growth  rate

of  32.6  per  cent compared to 28.4 per  cent  in

1970.  The increase has been primarily in  respect

of public housing and, to a lesser extent, private

housing.



<br><br><i>(iii) Trade</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth rate for the entrepot and domestic

trade sector, which formed nearly one-third of the

G.D.P., reflected a slight declining trend  during

the past decade, except for 1968 and 1969 when the

accelerated  growth reflected  the  resumption  of

trade with Indonesia. In line with this trend, the

contribution of this sector increased by only  9.6

per cent or $166.7 million in 1971, representing a

slower rate of growth compared to 12.6 per cent in

1970.  This  lag  could  be attributed  to,  among

others,  the pursuit of a direct trade  policy  by

neighbouring countries, the general



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



decline in produce prices primarily of rubber, the

de-escalation of the war in Vietnam and, last  but

not  least, the-uncertain trading conditions which

prevailed during the recent international monetary

crisis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the total increase in the trade sector,

entrepot  trade  accounted for 3.6  per  cent  and

domestic  trade  for  6.0 per cent.  The  entrepot

trade component, which showed a declining trend in

growth  over the past decade, virtually maintained

the  same low rate of growth of 3.0 per cent.  The

domestic  trade sector increased by 13.8 per  cent

which,  though higher than the entrepot trade  was

below the level recorded in 1970 of 20.2 per cent.

The  increase in domestic trade sector was however

close  to  the overall rate for the  G.D.P.  As  a

result,  the ratio of the entrepot trade to  total

G.D.P, declined further from 12.0 per cent in 1970

to  10.9  per  cent in 1971, whereas for  domestic

trade  the same ratio of around 18 per cent as  in

the previous year was maintained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to note that within the trade

sector  there  has also been a shift  in  emphasis

with  domestic  trade  gaining  in  importance  as

compared to entrepot trade. Entrepot trade,  which

in the earlier sixties formed 18.6 per cent of the

trade  sector, dropped to only 10.9  per  cent  in

1971,  while  domestic trade gained in importance,

particularly  from 1968. In value terms,  entrepot

trade  amounted to $703.6 million in 1971  against

$1,206.0 million for domestic trade, and  this  is

in  sharp  contrast to 1960 where  entrepot  trade

amounted  to $381.1 million and domestic trade  to

$269.0  million, The declining trend  of  entrepot

trade  may  be  largely attributed,  as  mentioned

earlier, to an increasing participation of  direct

foreign  trade by neighbouring countries  and  the

low  level, of produce prices. On the other  hand,

the  rapid growth in the domestic trade sub-sector

has  been propelled by the rising purchasing power

of  the population and increased earnings from the

distribution of domestic export which has shown  a

substantial  growth  during the  past  few  years.

Continued expansion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>



of  this sub-sector can be expected in the next few

years in line with the general economic growth.  On

balance   it   is  envisaged  that  the   declining

importance of the entrepot trade in the years ahead

will  be offset by the growth of the domestic trade

sector  and  the  trade sector as a  whole  can  be

expected  at the minimum to maintain the  trend  of

growth  rate recorded for the period 1970 and  1971

of around 11.1 per cent per annum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total external trade reached a record level

of  about $14,026.3 million in 1971, an increase of

$1,736.7  million or 14.1 per cent as against  11.9

per cent in 1970. Exports rose by 12.9 per cent  to

$5,371.3 million in 1971, while imports advanced at

a faster rate of 14.9 per cent to $8,655.0 million,

compared with the respective rates of 0.3 per  cent

and  20.7 per cent for the previous year. The  most

substantial  increase was observed  in  imports  of

capital  goods and materials to meet the  increased

pace of development in the industrial sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of exports, the increase came

primarily from domestic exports which rose by  29.6

per  cent to the level -of $2,368.2 million as  new

markets are found for the products manufactured  by

local  industries.  The rising  trend  in  domestic

exports  is  expected  to  continue  as  increasing

promotional efforts are being made to establish new

markets  overseas. Re-exports or entrepot  exports,

however,  stagnated  at the 1970  level  of  around

$3,003.1  million  which may be attributed  to  the

general  slump  in  prices of primary  commodities,

primarily of rubber and the increased participation

in  direct  trade by our neighbours. To the  extent

that our neighbours continue to pursue their direct

trade  policies and world prices of primary produce

remain  at low levels, it can be expected that  re-exports  will  decline  in  the  years  ahead   and

accordingly the contribution of the entrepot  trade

sector to the G.D.P, would also decline.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recorded trade deficit in 1971 amounted to

some  $3,283.7 million compared to $2,778.0 million

in   1970.  The  ever-widening  trade  deficit   as

recorded,  particularly in recent years,  has  been

aggravated  by  higher  costs  of  imported  goods.

Unlike other industrial countries such as Japan and

Germany,   which  have  accumulated   large   trade

surpluses,  Singapore has run  a  persistent  trade

deficit  and  this  has been  largely  financed  by

earnings   from  "invisibles"  and  large   capital

inflows  which have gone into meeting the costs  of

substantial imports of machinery and equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst there may be concern at the consequences

of  our  growing  trade deficit in the  balance  of

payments,  I  have explained in the  Budget  Speech

last  year  that  there is basically  no  need  for

alarm.  Our  preliminary estimates  of  balance  of

payments  indicate  that the  balance  of  payments

surplus  would amount to $844.6 million, which  far

exceeds the surplus for 1970 by $383.3 million.  In

the  coming year or two, however, it is  felt  that

unless large capital inflows continue and increase,

the balance of payments position may be strained as

the   Republic  would  be  faced  with  the   total

reduction   of  British  military  expenditure   in

Singapore which would undoubtedly have a big impact

on  Singapore's external financial position.  Also,

payments  for machinery and equipment and materials

for  industrial  development as  well  as  for  the

public   sector   infrastructure  development   are

expected  to  increase in the  next  two  to  three

years.  Thus,  the  pressure  on  the  balance   of

payments may, in certain circumstances, be expected

to  continue till such time when new industries are

fully   operational  and  have  established  export

markets for their products and when the anticipated

larger    earnings   from   tourism    and    other

"invisibles", such as ship-repairing,  materialise.

Thus,  it is of utmost priority that efforts should

be  made  to  increase  our  domestic  exports  and

invisible earnings and Government's policy is aimed

at fostering this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>(iv)   Government Services and Public Utilities</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution by Government services in 1971

to  the  G.D.P, increased by 15.9 per  cent,  which

follows  the  trend of growth for the  past  decade

where an annual average growth rate of about 14 per

cent  was  registered.  The  contribution  of  this

sector to G.D.P, in 1971 was $452 million. At  this

level,  Government services accounted for  about  7

per  cent of the G.D.P. It is interesting  to  note

that  the share composition of this sector  to  the

G.D.P, has been maintained at a steady 7 per  cent

throughout  the  entire period. The main  increases

are in respect of expenditure on defence, education

and health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the case of Government services, public

utilities showed a steady growth i-ate of 13.7  per

cent  for  the year under review and its  share  to

G.D.P, has  been maintained at around 2  per  cent

since  1966.  The contribution of  this  sector  to

G.D.P, stood at $157.3 million in 1971.



<br><br><i>(v) Other Services</i>



<br><br><i>(a) Tourism</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I told you in the last Budget Speech, it is

our  intention to develop the tourist  industry  to

increase the flow of foreign exchange earnings  and

strengthen   the  balance  of  payments   position.

However,  care has to be exercised to  ensure  that

the investment is in those facilities and amenities

which do not tax the already short supply of labour

resources. To this end, the massive hotel  building

programme  of  the last few years  has  had  to  be

slowed   down  to  provide  for  a  more   balanced

development   and  the  reallocation  of   building

construction  and  other  capacity  to  development

projects of higher priority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The encouraging signs of success in our efforts

in  promoting tourism is evidenced by  the  growing

number of visitors who come to Singapore each year.

In  1971, 632,000 tourists visited the Republic, as

against  522,000  in  1970  and  409,000  in  1969.

Although the growth rate for 1971 of 21.0 per  cent

is lower than the 27.6 per cent for 1970,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



which was partly due to the post-Expo `70 influx of

tourists, the growth rate of tourist arrivals is  a

fairly respectable rate by international standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earnings from tourism continued to grow and

reached  $323  million in 1971 compared  to  $275.6

million  in 1970, or an increase of some  17.2  per

cent.  This was ten times higher than 1960, thereby

raising the share composition from 1.5 per cent  in

1960  to 5.0 per cent in 1971. The average stay  of

visitors also rose slightly from about 3.3 days  in

1967 to about 3.9 days in 1970 and 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, despite our past efforts to promote

tourism  there  remains much to  be  done.  A  more

intensive programme is required to attract tourists

to  Singapore especially from those countries whose

nationals  are  now providing the  major  share  of

world  tourists. By these, I mean Japan, Australia,

the   United   States,  and  the  richer   European

countries. The occupancy rate for hotels has fallen

from 73.5 per cent in 1969 to 70.7 per cent in 1970

and 65.4 per cent in 1971. One of the objectives of

tourist  promotion will, therefore, be to  get  the

occupancy rate back to something like the level  of

the  late sixties, and the hotel industry  and  the

Tourist Promotion Board will each have to play  its

part  to  achieve  this end. On the  infrastructure

side  and the provision of amenities and facilities

the  proposed Development Budget for the  financial

year  1972-73 makes provisions for the  development

of  a large number of projects which should go some

way  to  encouraging  tourists  to  increase  their

length of stay in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, with greater promotional efforts, I expect

that   the  tourist  industry  will  increase   its

earnings in the current and ensuing years.



<br><br><i>(b) Foreign Military Expenditure</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary estimates for foreign military

expenditure in 1971 covering both British  military

expenditure    and   expenditure   by    A.N.Z.U.K.

(Australia-New   Zealand-United   Kingdom)   Forces

indicate that there is practically no change in the

level of expenditure from that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



registered  in  1970. The expenditure  remained  at

around  $420  million.  The  phased  reduction   in

British   military  expenditure,  which  was   only

completed   by   the  later  part  of   1971,   was

counterbalanced  by  a  corresponding  increase  in

A.N.Z.U.K. Forces expenditure during the year.  The

full  impact  of the withdrawal has  not  therefore

been  felt in 1971. When the expenditure  for  this

sub-sector is reduced to less than $100 million  in

1972, it is hoped that any dampening effect on  the

economy   particularly  on  domestic   demand   and

employment  can  be counteracted. Since  the  major

growth    sectors    of   the   economy,    namely,

manufacturing, construction, tourism,  banking  and

port  activity,  are expected to forge  ahead  with

sustained efforts at expansion, the delayed effects

of  the complete British military withdrawal in the

current year can be fully mitigated and the economy

should

-continue to grow, though perhaps at a lower  level

than in the past year.



<br><br><i>(c)    Banking and Insurance</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should now like to conclude this sectoral

analysis  with  a reference to that sector  of  the

economy  -  banking and insurance - which  embraces

the   financial  operations  of  the  economy.  The

contribution  of  banking  and  insurance  to   the

G.D.P.,  which  has  consistently  shown  a  rising

trend,  further expanded by 15.0 per cent to $112.6

million  in  1971.  The share in  G.D.P, has  been

maintained  at  around 1.7 per cent throughout  the

past decade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banking continued to grow in 1971 along the lines

of  Government  policy which is to encourage  Swiss

type  banking  procedures as part  of  the  overall

programme  of developing Singapore into a financial

centre for Southeast Asia. By the end of 1971,  the

number   of  banks  totalled  42  with  192  branch

offices. Total deposits rose from $3,194.9  million

in  1970 to $3,745.8 million, giving a growth  rate

of 17.2 per cent. Of total deposits, fixed deposits

comprised 57.9 per cent, indicating that banks have

funds to lend on a long-term basis. During the same

period, bank loans and advances



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



increased from $2,167.7 million to $2,615  million,

an overall growth rate of 20.6 per cent. Banks have

gradually moved into industrial financing though  a

large  proportion of total loans  and  advances  is

still  made to trade and commerce. The latest  data

available  shows that by December 1971,  out  of  a

total of $2,615 million in loans and advances, 31.3

per  cent was made to the commercial sector,  while

31.4 per cent was made to the manufacturing sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another indicator of the growth of banking is

reflected   by  the  increasing  share  of   demand

deposits  to  the total money supply.  On  average,

about  55 per cent of the total money supply, which

is  a significant ratio by international standards,

was raised out of demand deposits. The fact that it

forms  slightly more than half of the  total  money

supply  shows  that  banking facilities  are  being

increasingly made use of by the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asian Dollar Market continued to attract

foreign funds. There are now 19 banks authorised to

deal in Asian Dollars as compared to 16 at the  end

of  1970.  Total liabilities of the Asian  Currency

Units by the end of 1971 aggregated to nearly  US$1

billion as compared to US$400 million at the end of

the  previous  year  -  an increase  of  l�  times.

Interest rates on Asian Dollar deposits have fallen

in  sympathy with world interest rates and are  now

earning   depositors  6.5  per  cent  for  one-year

deposits, 5 per cent to 6 per cent for three to six

months  and  4.75  per  cent  for  one  month.   To

stimulate  its  further expansion,  the  Government

will  encourage the development of an Asian  Dollar

Bond Market. Two bond issues have so far been made,

one  floated by the Private Investment Company  for

Asia  (P.I.C.A.) for $10 million and the  other  by

the  Development Bank of Singapore (D.B.S.)  for  a

similar  sum.  The first loan was  underwritten  by

Singapore   banks  and  constitutes  an   important

development  for  Singapore. The  D.B.S, loan  was

oversubscribed, two-thirds of it being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



allotted  to  principal institutions in  Singapore,

Hong  Kong  and Japan. It is intended to  encourage

further  borrowings in the Asian Dollar  Market  by

reputable  financial institutions of good  standing

in  Singapore,  the  ASEAN region  and  even  other

countries in Asia.



<br><br><i>Future Prospects</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now future prospects: what is the ,outlook for

1972 and beyond?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen from our survey of the international

economic  setting  and  our analysis  of  the  main

economic indicators and their growth rates that the

performance  of the Singapore economy was  affected

last  year  and will depend again this year  partly

upon  the  turn  of international  events.  It  is,

therefore,  of some concern that in spite  of  what

was thought at the time to be a valid settlement of

international  monetary problems, we  should  still

have  continuing uncertainty, with weakness in  the

U.S.  Dollar and volatility in exchange markets  in

all  the  major financial centres. The  ability  of

world  trade  to  expand will  be  reduced  if  the

domestic problems of high unemployment at the  same

time  as inflation persist in many major economies;

or  if the dollar reflow is delayed and the balance

of payments problem continues in the United States;

or  if  the  uncertainty and exchange  restrictions

arising   from   the  currency   crises   and   the

possibility  so  soon  after  the  realignment   of

December  of  yet another revaluation continues  to

affect even the strong economy of Japan; or if  its

slower  growth  rate, which only it  could  call  a

"recession",   results  in   reduced   imports   of

petroleum  products  from  the  Middle  East   (and

Singapore  as  a  refining  centre)  and   of   raw

materials such as iron ore and other minerals  from

Australia. The success of the domestic policies  of

all  these  countries and, in  particular,  of  the

United  States,  in solving their  problems  and  -

stimulating growth would give a powerful uplift  to

other  economies. It is to be hoped therefore that,

notwithstanding  gloomier predictions  since  then,

the  forecast  by most U.S, economists  during  the

beginning -of the year of a 5.5 to 6 per cent real



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



growth to about $1,150 billion or twice as much  as

last  year, with a price rise of some 3.1 -3.4  per

cent only as measured by the G.N.P, deflator, and a

reduction  of unemployment to under 5.5  per  cent,

can  be  realised. Certainly the presently  buoyant

market  in  U.S. Stock Exchanges and the resumption

of   consumer  spending  are  favourable  signs  of

recovery  in  the U.S, economy. It is to  be  hoped

also   that   the   optimistic  estimate   of   the

Organisation    for   Economic   Cooperation    and

Development   (O.E.C.D.),   which   includes   most

developed  countries  including  Japan,   will   be

correct  for a 5 per cent growth rate for  1972  as

against 3 per cent for 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The international trade picture is, however,

obscure. The G.A.T.T, prediction of world trade for

1972  contented itself on 15th February, 1972, with

the statement that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is difficult to forecast developments in 1972

in  terms  of value with any confidence.  It  seems

likely,  however,  that the rise in  export  prices

expressed in U.S, dollars will be greater  in  1972

than in 1971.'



<br><br>In  volume  terms,  however,  it  was  prepared  to

forecast a 5 per cent increase at best against  the

8.5  per cent increase in 1970, and the 5 per  cent

increase in 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the general uncertainty and of the

more restricted trade and economic growth rates  in

other countries, sustained growth for Singapore  in

1972 may, as during the last year, lie largely with

our  manufacturing sector and its ability to export

its products. Our hope is that our vulnerability to

these adverse influences has been avoided, to  some

extent,   by   our  selection  and  promotion,   in

accordance  with our optimum investment policy,  of

multi-national  manufacturing  companies  having  a

scope   for  progressive  growth  in  technological

content in their manufactures, and, consequently, a

greater  capacity for development of modern  skills

at  all  levels.  Unlike  simple  manufacturing  or

assembly-type  industry  depending  upon  low  cost

labour,  these  industries are less  likely  to  be

displaced  by  sudden competition in  their  export

markets from new manufacturers from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



other  countries.  In any case, by  their  nature,

multi-national  companies  have  diversified   and

established markets overseas and can operate also,

when  necessary, largely independently of  foreign

exchange requirements and variable currency rates,

or  are  even  able  to take  advantage  of  them.

Perhaps  partly  for the reasons mentioned  above,

our  leading growth sector, manufacturing, managed

to grow by 30 per cent in 1971, a faster rate than

in  1970,  in  spite  of the rather  more  adverse

international  trading conditions in  1971,  which

according  to  the  Survey  of  Business  Opinions

covering  a  sample of industrial  establishments,

curbed the growth of some manufacturers during the

fourth  quarter.  In short, we shall  do  well  to

press on with the promotion and establishments  of

more, progressively higher, technology and export-oriented industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the achievement of higher levels of

sophistication  in  industry is  correlated  to  a

diligent  and  disciplined  striving  for   higher

productivity.  This requires not  only  management

efficiency  as  well as labour  productivity,  but

also an equitable sharing of the fruits of greater

efficiency  and  upgraded  skills  in  an  orderly

manner. Among other matters, the determination  of

equitable  shares will now be the concern  of  the

National Wages Council which has been set up  with

tripartite  representation from labour,  employers

and   the  Government.  The  Council's  role  will

include  assisting in the formulation  of  general

guidelines on wages policy, recommending necessary

adjustments  in  wage structure, with  a  view  to

developing a coherent wage system consistent  with

long-term  economic  and social  development,  and

advising  on desirable incentive systems  for  the

promotion    of    operational   efficiency    and

productivity in various enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promotion of higher technology and the work

of  the Council both fall within Singapore's long-term  objective or strategy for the  promotion  of

modernisation in all sectors of our economy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



and   its   transformation  into  an  increasingly

outward-looking   cross-roads   of   international

economic  activities. Such a  long-term  objective

would   be   assisted  by  a  plan  for  long-term

development. I have accordingly asked my  Ministry

to  formulate such a plan for the l970s. In  order

that targets for the plan should be set which  are

sufficiently  ambitious and yet perfectly  capable

of realisation, the plan would project a sustained

rapid  economic  growth of 15 per cent  per  annum

with  a doubling of the per capita income by 1975,

on  a  population growth checked by sensible small

families. With full employment, a goal that seemed

unattainable in the 1960s, labour will  become  an

increasingly scarce resource, and the  development

plan will also seek to maximise the income derived

by   the  use  of  labour  through  the  expensive

development of high skills and productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development plan will be supported by a

programme for public sector action, which will not

be  to  a  rigid  framework but will  be  flexible

enough to accommodate contingencies and unforeseen

circumstances. Five basic elements  or  components

to  the  plan  have  been identified  for  special

attention  and  for implementation in  the  public

sector programme. These are manpower, science  and

technology,    infrastructure,    taxation     and

promotion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to manpower, the intention will be

to  build  up  a  large pool of  professional  and

technical  personnel through  upgrading  of  local

talents and skills, and selective immigration. Our

industrial  training  policies  will   be   geared

towards producing the necessary skills, while  our

immigration  policies  will  be  more  liberal  in

selected  categories of skilled workers. We  shall

presently  be  setting up an  Industrial  Training

Board   to   co-ordinate   and   rationalise   all

industrial training. Industrial training would  be

both  institution  based and  industry-based.  The

institution-based industrial training will seek to

improve   technical  teaching   in   primary   and

secondary   schools,  vocational   and   technical

institutions  as  well  as  to  provide  technical

teacher-training. The industry-based



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>



training  programme  will   include

apprenticeship  schemes,  off-the  job  industrial

training,  overseas  training  schemes  and  joint

industry  /  Government  training.  The  Technical

Education    Department   will    be    finalising

arrangements for the apprenticeship schemes to  be

implemented  in  co-operation  with   the   longer

established firms in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to overseas training schemes, some

are  sponsored  by  international  companies  with

operations in Singapore. 412 trainees have already

completed   their   training   and   returned   to

Singapore.  Today,  there are 316  such  trainees,

mostly in Germany and Japan. It is expected  that,

in  the  course  of this year, the companies  will

send a further 400 abroad. Apart from these, which

are  sponsored by the manufacturers, we have  also

emplaced 53 trainees in precision engineering  and

other  metal  trades in apprentice  programmes  in

Europe,  while the Economic Development Board  has

received firm offers for a further 206 to be  sent

this  year. For training at home, under the  joint

industry/Government training programmes, the first

centre  will  be located at the Jurong  Vocational

Institute and is expected to have its first intake

of  50  trainees in a few months' time,  with  the

intake  increasing to 100 a year  from  the  third

year.  Arrangements with three other international

companies  for  similar joint  industry/Government

training centres are also expected to be concluded

within the next three months.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Hon, may I interrupt you at this

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just before the

tea  break,  I  was saying that arrangements  with

three  other  international companies for  similar

joint   industry/Government  training  centres-are

also  expected  to be concluded  within  the  next

three  months.  These  centres, will  be  located

either  within  the premises, of other  vocational

institutes  or adjacent to the plants  themselves.

The  total  annual intake of these  three  centres

will  initially be 268 trainees. Under the-scheme,

the  Government  will contribute 50  per  cent  of

training costs provided the organisation assisted,

trains twice-its requirements and releases 50  per

cent, of the trainees to Government for upgrading

skills. In this way, we hope to produce sufficient

numbers   of   well-trained   persons.   As    for

immigration,   our   procedures   are   undergoing

streamlining  to  ensure  that  persons  who   can

contribute to the economy are not turned, away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards science and technology,, the aim is to

promote practical research and development both at

the  universities-and by international and  multi-national  companies. The Universities of Singapore

and  Nanyang  as well as the Polytechnic-and  Ngee

Ann  Technical  College will, under  our  strategy

have  a  major  part  to  play  in  research   and

development. We will further develop the Singapore

Institute of Standards and Industrial Research. We

are now considering the setting up of a Centre for

Applied  Research  under  the  auspices   of   the

Ministry  of  Science and Technology  whereby  the

best  of  our  scholars from the  institutions  of

higher learning and private industry can be  drawn

upon   to, provide  research   and   consultancy

services,   both  within  and  outside  Singapore.

Through  selective use of taxation, we hope,  too,

to  encourage international companies  to  conduct

their research and development here.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to infrastructure, much has already been

accomplished  in  the  last few  years.  Under  our

development plan, further improvement and expansion

of  infrastructure  for efficient  distribution  of

goods  and  services from Singapore is  vital.  The

transport and communications sector in our  economy

will have to be strengthened. We have already taken

steps  in  this direction. Capital expenditure  for

port  development will amount to  $153  million  in

1972  and  this  will be spent  on  development  of

containerizations  at the East Lagoon,  warehousing

at  Pasir Panjang and the Ocean Terminal at Tanjong

Pagar.  With regard to air communications,  Mercury

Singapore Airlines will be taking over, on payment,

substantial  assets and facilities  from  Malaysia-Singapore Airlines and will continue to expand  and

maintain  their services. We are also looking  into

improvements  and developments of the airports  and

related  services.  As  regards  transportation  on

land, a feasibility study on a Mass Rapid Transport

System  will be undertaken shortly with the  United

Nations   Development  Programme  and  World   Bank

assistance. It is hoped that the study will provide

the guidelines in solving the increasing congestion

on our roads. In the

electronics  and  telecommunications  sector,   an

autonomous  statutory corporation will  be  set  up

this  year  to  take  over  the  functions  of  the

Telecommunications Department, A 10-year  programme

has   been   formulated  to  meet  the   Republic's

telecommunications requirements,  particularly  for

telex  machines  and  telex  services.  Further   -

development  in  the  telephone  services  is  also

envisaged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the development plan, emphasis will be

placed  on  developing tourist infrastructure  with

the  aim of developing Singapore into an "entrepot"

centre for tourism, and as a centre for regional  -

and  international conventions. The development  of

Sentosa  will be the major undertaking  under  this

heading.  Over  the coming 10 years, 31  Government

projects and eight projects by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



the  private sector are planned for the  island.  A

corporation  to be known as the Sentosa Development

Corporation   will   be  established   shortly   to

undertake  the  entire  development  and  to   turn

Sentosa  into  a resort of quality  in  a  tropical

setting.  As for the promotion of conventions,  the

Tourist  Promotion  Board  has  set  up  a  special

conventions unit specifically for this purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our plan to develop as a centre for brain

services   will   require   the   examination   and

modification  of present taxation laws.  This  will

help  the  overall development of  Singapore  as  a

financial  and  monetary  centre.  A  committee  of

taxation experts has already been convened to  look

into  the  possibility  of using  tax  measures  to

attract cram service industries and industries with

very  high-level  technology  and  to  promote  the

growth of a regional money market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present promotion programme of the Economic

Development  Board  is geared to  attracting  high-level   technology   industries.   This   will   be

indemnified.  Besides this,  we  are  promoting  a!

types  of  brain services in Singapore -engineering

and  consultancy, marketing, physical planning  and

development,  international  sales  and  servicing,

education,  medicine  and especially,  banking  and

financing  services. Under the programme, Singapore

wilt  develop  into  an international  banking  and

financial   centre.  Hence,  measures   are   being

introduced to stimulate our banking sector and  the

capital  and  money markets. To bring international

participation  in  our financial  centre,  we  have

approved  a number of licence for foreign banks  to

operate  in Singapore and will be liberalising  our

exchange controls further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These elements comprise our development plan for

the  l970s. In broad terms the goal is to transform

Singapore   within  ten  years,  at   an   economic

development growth rate of 15 per cent  per  annum,

into a regional centre for brain services and brain

service  industries. Success will depend  upon  the

quality of our people, their capacity to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



improve themselves through education, training and

experience. This is an expensive process which can

only  be carried out if population growth is  kept

down to almost Zero Population Growth. Then we can

the   better  afford  to  attract  expertise   and

technology from outside.



<br><br><i>Budget Estimates 1972-73</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the main business of the

Budget proposals for the financial year 1972-73.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detailed estimates are contained in two

documents*(*Papers Cmd. 3 and 4 of 1972.)  -  the  "Estimates  of  Revenue   and

Expenditure"  and the "Development Estimates".  As

in  past  years, a Treasury Memorandum+(+Paper Misc. 1 of 1972.)

on each  of the  Estimates with detailed

explanatory notes  on the  various

Heads of Expenditure has  also  been

circulated to Members. It is unnecessary therefore

for  me  to do more than make general observations

on   those  areas  of  expenditure  which  involve

changes  in  policy and comment  on  broad  policy

measures  for greater efficiency and effectiveness

in government administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changing needs of the economy in the 1970s

will  require  the Government to reappraise,  from

time  to  time,  the policies and  priorities  for

allocation of funds as well as manpower  resources

to  the various sectors. Further, there is a  need

also   to   review  our  administrative  machinery

including   the   present  system  of   Government

budgeting  and financial control. The emphasis  in

the  present  system  has  hitherto  been  on  the

balancing of the budget and the diversion of  more

of our resources towards economic development and,

latterly,  also towards defence. This  system  has

served  us  well in the 1960s during  the  initial

phases  of our economic development. In the l970s,

however,  with rising labour costs in a  situation

of full employment, the budget should be used also

to effect mechanisation and introduce other labour-saving  methods,  and generally to  modernise  and

improve Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



administration.  Set  up  originally  to   provide

minimal  services  at  least  cost,  many  of  the

departments  are  not equipped  for  developmental

activities or for active interventionist  policies

and  are  unable  to cope with the increasing  new

demands  for  their services. During  the  current

financial    year,   therefore,   a   number    of

organisational  and structural changes  have  been

introduced in several Ministries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the following statutory authorities

have been or are in the process of being set up by

legislation -the National Sports Promotion  Board,

the  National  Stadium Corporation,  the  National

Statistical  Commission, the Post  Office  Savings

Bank  Board,  the Telecommunication  Authority  of

Singapore   and  the  Commercial  and   Industrial

Security Corporation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various measures have also been introduced for

the   general   improvement  of  the   terms   and

conditions  of  service in the  Civil  Service.  A

systematic reappraisal has been made of the  terms

and  conditions  of  service of various  services,

notably  the  Technical  Services,  the  Education

Service and the Police Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has also been a general reorganisation of

the Administrative Service under which, in future,

all  recruits will be appointed as Cadet  Trainees

for  a period of two years during which time  they

will be given specific postings covering different

spheres    of   Government   administration    and

operations. A scheme for the training  of  Medical

Officers  in the various medical specialities  has

also  been  introduced.  Provisions  for  overseas

scholarships, training and study awards have  also

been  substantially increased in the new financial

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these measures are designed to bring about

not  only  an improvement in the quality of  Civil

Service  personnel, but also to ensure a permanent

Service  with  a  lower  turnover  of  experienced

staff.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in an expanding economy and with a

manufacturing  sector,  particularly,  growing  in

size and complexity, managerial talent is in short

supply. Handsome inducements are often offered  to

attract the best. Consequently, what appear to  be

fresher and greener pastures often tempt some  men

of  experience and promise from the Civil  Service

to  the private sector. Whilst some mobility  must

be   expected,  the  public  service  is   already

suffering  from  an acute shortage of  experienced

administrators  and professional cadres,  and  the

continuing loss of trained men must be checked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is aware that one difficulty in

retaining them is due to the widening gap  in  pay

between the private and public sector for  men  of

comparable  grades. Our public service  is  widely

recognised, and rightly so, as second to  none  in

this part of the world. If our economic growth has

been sustained in recent years at an unprecedented

high  level,  if our economy today is buoyant  and

full  employment  is a reality, a  major  part  of

these  achievements  can  be  attributed  to   our

efficient public service. If we do not wish to see

a  collapse  of  this service, an  improvement  in

terms  and conditions of employment must be  made.

At  the very least, therefore, we must do what  we

can  to prevent the gap in pay from widening.  The

payment  of  a  non-pensionable  annual  allowance

which the Prime Minister has already announced two

days ago is the first step towards this end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this allowance, it is intended

that   the   process   of   rationalisation    and

restructuring of the salary scales  of  the  Civil

Service  will  continue. Some of the disparity  in

wages  between daily-rated skilled workers in  the

private  sector and in Government has  been  under

examination for some time by a Review Committee on

Daily-Rated Employment. We shall effect  necessary

adjustments  in wages, taking into account  the  -

annual allowances - already -announced. The Public

Service  Commission  will, moreover,  continue  to

conduct



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>



regular and frequent promotion exercises in  order

to  ensure  that the brightest and most  promising

officers will receive accelerated promotion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the day-to-day operations of Government.

The Government intends to gradually introduce more

modern  and  efficient  systems  and  methods   of

operation.  Greater emphasis  will  be  placed  on

mechanisation.  Budgetary support has  been  given

for the increased use of office machines and other

mechanical  aids  in  the  day-to-day  operations.

Increases  in  personnel have  been  kept  to  the

minimum. Consideration has also been given to  the

computerisation   of  operations   of   Government

Departments. A Management Services Unit  has  been

formed  in  the Treasury which will systematically

study  Government Ministries and  Departments  and

will  suggest  improvements  in  organisation  and

methods. It will do this in co-ordination with the

Electronic Data Processing Unit in the Ministry of

Finance    which   has   been   reorganised    and

reconstituted as the Computer Services  Department

to   cope   with   the  increasing   demands   for

computerisation   from   all   Ministries.   Where

necessary,  existing computer facilities  will  be

further augmented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present overall system of budgeting is also

being  reviewed.  Some  of  the  more  useful  and

desirable  features  of  what  is  known  as   the

Planning,  Programming  Budgeting  System  may  be

introduced.   The   P.P.B.S, provides   a   more

systematic  means  of assessing  requirements  and

evaluating  performance in terms of  effectiveness

and  costs. A feasibility study has been made. The

service  of a U.N. Technical Assistance Expert  is

being   sought   to  work  out  a   programme   of

implementation in stages.



<br><br><i>Ordinary Estimates of Expenditure</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall Budget provision for Recurrent

Expenditure for 1972-73 is $1,448.69 million which

is  $141.88 million or 10 per cent more  than  the

provision for 1971-72. In comparison with  the

estimated  revised expenditure  for  1971-72,  the

provision is only 6.1 per cent higher.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the total provision, 38.9 per cent is for

Defence  and Internal Security, 26.6 per cent  for

Social  Services,  15.1  per  cent  for  Statutory

Expenditure   and  7.8  per  cent   for   Economic

Services. The allocation for Defence has increased

by  16.5  per  cent compared to the provision  for

1971-72   while  that  for  Social  Services   has

increased by 12 per cent. The total allocation for

Economic  Services does not show  any  significant

change.  The  somewhat  lower  figure  of  $113.14

million as compared to $131.42 million for 1971-72

for Economic Services is due to the deletion of

the   provision   of   $19.4   million   for   the

Telecommunications Department which is to become a

statutory  authority early in  the  new  financial

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main Heads of Expenditure which have been

allotted  sizable increases in funds are:  Defence

($72.8 million), Education ($18.7 million), Health

($16.2  million), Home Affairs ($7.1 million)  and

National  Development ($3.3  million).  There  has

been  an  increase of $12.9 million for  Statutory

Expenditure   and   the   Contribution   to    the

Development  Fund has also been increased  by  $20

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, I would like to mention some of

the  significant changes in the allocation to  the

major  Ministries resulting from increases in  the

level of activity.



<br><br><i>Ministry of Labour</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A proper assessment of our man-power needs and

resources and the formulation of an effective plan

for  the  optimum utilisation of available  labour

will  need  to be made by the Labour  Ministry.  A

general revision of its scope and functions is now

in  progress.  For  the  coming  year,  additional

provisions have been entered for the setting up of

regional  offices  in Alexandra,  Toa  Payoh,  St.

Michael's Estate and Jurong Industrial Estate. The

Factory Inspectorate will also be expanded and its

staff augmented for more effective supervision  of

the   factories  and  establishments   to   ensure

compliance with industrial safety regulations. The

Industrial Health Unit at present shown



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



under  the  Ministry  of  Health  would  also   be

transferred  in  the  new financial  year  to  the

Ministry of Labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study has been made by the newly appointed

Labour  Adviser to the Ministry of the  scope  and

functions   of   the  Labour  Exchange   and   his

recommendations that the Labour Exchange should be

expanded  to  play a more effective  role  in  the

deployment and utilisation of labour force as well

as  in  the provision of labour market information

and  vocational  guidance have  been  accepted  in

principle  and  will  be  implemented  during  the

course of the coming year.



<br><br><i>Ministry of Communications</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main Departments under the Ministry of

Communications where significant changes have been

made  are  the Postal Department, the Registry  of

Vehicles and the Telecommunications Department.  A

general  review  of  the overall  working  of  the

Postal  Department  has been undertaken  with  the

assistance of the National Productivity Centre and

a  series  of  studies on the  reorganisation  and

modernisation  of  the Postal  Services  has  been

completed.  The  recommendations  of  the  initial

reports  for  the  mechanisation of  the  delivery

services, and the use of mechanised means for  the

handling  of  mail  and parcels  as  well  as  the

resiting  of the mail handling sections have  been

partly   implemented  in  1971-72  and   will   be

completed in 1972-73.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Registry of Vehicles, the work of

computerisation  of  drivers'  licences  has  been

completed  and  plans for the  computerisation  of

motor  vehicles' records have been  finalised  and

will  be  implemented in the new  financial  year.

Although   the   cost   of   computerisation   and

conversion  of records is estimated  at  $206,650,

this  will  result in some saving of manpower  and

the  provision of a more efficient service to  the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Telecommunications Department has been

reorganised and will be converted into a statutory

authority on 1st April, 1972.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Ministry of National Development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main changes in the allocation for the

Ministry  of  National Development have  been  the

result  of the expansion in the functions  of  the

Primary Production Department and the increase  in

area   of  responsibility  of  the  Public   Works

Department. The Primary Production Department  has

embarked  on  a  scheme  for  farm  licensing  and

control  of farm structures as part of its overall

programme    for   more   intensive   agricultural

development and as a means of farm sanitation  and

pollution control in the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Works Department has now taken over

the  responsibility  for the  maintenance  of  the

Jurong  Industrial Water Treatment Works  and  the

three aerodromes at Changi, Seletar and Tengah. As

a  result  of the takeover of the areas previously

occupied  by the British Armed Forces,  there  has

been  a substantial increase in the work of upkeep

and  maintenance of grounds and buildings  and  in

maintenance   costs.  The  Sewerage   Branch   has

commissioned  three new sewerage pumping  stations

and has expanded the treatment works at Serangoon.

The  Parks and Trees Branch will also be expanding

its  area of activity with the opening up  of  new

parks and wooded areas.



<br><br><i>Ministry of Education</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for the Ministry of Education has

increased  from  $191.03 million  for  1971-72  to

$209.7  million  for  the coming  year.  The  main

changes  of significance are the restructuring  of

the Education Service, the continued expansion  of

the technical stream of education and the proposed

separation  of  the  functions of  vocational  and

industrial  training  from  that  of  the  general

stream of school education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to provide an efficient and co-ordinated

programme  of training of technical personnel  for

the  industries, it is proposed to set up ,in  the

new financial year the Industrial Training



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



Board,  with  the responsibility for  all  matters

relating   to   industrial   training   and    the

administration of industrial training institutions

including  the  vocational  institutes   and   the

industrial training centres. Greater emphasis will

be  placed  on  the  upgrading of  skills  through

apprenticeship   schemes  and   joint   industrial

training   programmes  particularly   for   skills

relating to precision industries.



<br><br><i>Ministry of Health</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Ministry of Health, a total provision

of  $114.4  million has been made as  compared  to

$98.2 million in 1971-72. Of the increase of $16.2

million,  $7.6  million has been allotted  to  the

Hospitals Division and $3.6 million to the  Public

Health Division.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major increases in the Hospitals Division are

associated  with the implementation of  the  first

phase  of  fostering  medical  specialities,   the

general  improvement  of Medical  Services  and  a

gradual expansion in the services provided by  the

Alexandra  Hospital  and  the  Sembawang  Hospital

which  were  recently taken over from the  British

Services. The training of Medical Officers in  the

various specialities has also been stepped up  and

an  annual  complement of about  50  doctors  will

undergo    a   two-year   training   in   selected

specialities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Public Health Division, the general

emphasis   is   on  the  provisions  of   improved

environmental health services and the extension of

the  coverage of such services to all parts of the

Republic including areas formerly occupied by  the

British  Services.  The Public Health  Engineering

Branch   will   also   undergo  some   fundamental

reorganisation and the scope of its work  will  be

extended    to   cover   additional    areas    of

environmental   control.  The   Public   Cleansing

Service has been provided with additional funds so

as  to  extend its coverage to the former  British

Armed Forces areas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Home Affairs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Home Affairs is now responsible

for  the  additional Departments of  the  Singapore

Citizenship  Registry,  the  National  Registration

Office and the Registry of Births and Deaths  which

were  formerly  under the Ministry of  Labour.  The

Prisons Department will also be transferred to  the

Ministry  of Home Affairs in the new year. Further,

a reorganisation of the Police Force, after the Lee

Soo  Ann  Report,  has been undertaken.  This  will

improve  the  quality of the rank and file  of  the

Police  Force.  There will also  be  a  substantial

increase   in   the  use  of  modern  methods   and

techniques  for combating crime and  an  increasing

use of vehicles, radio and electronic equipment for

the routine patrol system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vigilante Corps has also been expanded to

provide  for  the establishment of a Civil  Defence

Organisation   and  the  Auxiliary  Fire   Fighting

Service  and to undertake the training of  National

Servicemen in these disciplines.



<br><br><i>Defence</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Ministry of Defence, the increase in the

block  provision for Armed Forces is based  on  the

need  to  continue  the build-up of  the  Services,

particularity that of the Air Force and the Navy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A general review is being undertaken of the

administration  of  the Ministry.  The  aim  is  to

provide  a  permanent corps of  Administrative  and

Executive   Officers   to  replace   the   military

personnel now engaged in administrative duties  and

who could be better used in military functions.



<br><br><i>Development Estimates</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the Development Expenditure for 1972-73. A total amount of $750.77 million is provided

as  compared to $635.96 million and $442.59 million

provided for 1971-72 and 1970-71 respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major portion of the provision for 1972-73

goes  to  the economic sector amounting to  $342.23

million  or  45.6 per cent of the total  provision.

Out of this,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>



35.4  per  cent  or $121.13 million is  for  direct

expenditure   by   the   various   Ministries    on

development   projects.  The   remainder   is   for

extending   loans  to  the  statutory  bodies   and

companies wholly or partly owned by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the financial year 1972-73, the provision for

direct  expenditure on development projects in  the

economic sector is distributed as follows:-



<pre>

                                       $ milllion

Tourist Infrastructure Development        10.26

Transport and Communications              44.32

Land Development                          64.90

Primary Production                         1.90

                                         ------

                                      $  121.13

                                         ======

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work at Sentosa on the Golf Course,. Swimming

Lagoon  and  Gun Museum are now well underway.  The

next financial year will see the development of the

Coral  and Shell Museum, the Open Air Theatre,  the

Cable  Car  Landing Plaza and other  amenities.  An

amount of $10.26 million is provided to finance the

development of Sentosa.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In transport and communications, a major

development  project  is  the  expansion   of   the

Singapore Airport. Since its inception in 1955, the

Singapore  Airport  has seen  tremendous  increases

both in number of passengers and volume of freight.

To  cater  for  the  rapidly increasing  number  of

passengers and volume of freight the Airport has to

handle, a development plan has been formulated. The

immediate   phase   involves  the   extension   and

renovation  of  the  existing  passenger   terminal

building.  It  has  now  been  completed.  In   the

intermediate  phase,  a new passenger  terminal,  a

freight terminal, a Boeing hangar, the extension of

the   runway,   new  parking  aprons  and   various

navigational  and  landing aids will  be  provided.

This phase is scheduled to be completed by 1976. It

will  require  a  sum  of $105  million.  An  Asian

Development  Bank Loan of $60 million  has  already

been obtained.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increasing volume of vehicular traffic is a

never-ending  problem, not -only of  traffic  flow,

but   also   of   availability  of  parking   space

particularly   in   the  city.  This   necessitates

improvements to existing roads and construction  of

new  roads  and  car  parks.  Thus,  a  substantial

provision  is  made for the vote on  Transport  and

Communications for 1972-73.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land development constitutes a sizable part of

direct expenditure by Government Ministries in the

economic-sector. With limited land  resources,  it

is  imperative that we should put them  to  utmost

use. Part of the provision for land development is

for the acquisition of land required in connection

with  various  public  development  projects.  Our

major reclamation scheme, the East Coast Foreshore

Reclamation Scheme, is now in its third  phase  of

development.  We seek to build what  we  have  not

been endowed with by Nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loans to statutory boards falling under the

economic sector amount to $221.10 million for 1972-73. These comprise mainly loans to the Jurong Town

Corporation,  the  Public  Utilities  Board,   the

Singapore  Telephone Board and to  industrial  and

commercial enterprises wholly or partly  owned  by

the Government. The provision in respect of this

-for  1971-72  was  $248.55  million.  Loans   for

industrial  and  commercial enterprises,  however,

show  a reduction amounting to $96.10 million  for

1972-73 as compared to $198.55 million for 1971-72.  This is attributable to the fact that as more

of these enterprises become well established, they

are  better able to draw upon their own  resources

and   require  less  external  finance  for  their

development programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total sum of $263.33 million is provided for

the social sector as compared with $161.74 million

provided for 1971-72. Of this provision of $263.33

million for 1972-73, $77.33 million is for  direct

expenditure  on development projects  and  $186.00

million is for loans to statutory boards



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



in the social sector, including $180.00 million

for the Housing and Development Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distribution of $77.33 million for direct

expenditure by Government Ministries is as follows:-



<pre>

                              $ million



Education                        23.95

Health                           12.71

Sewerage                         20.05

Community & Welfare Services     20.62

                              --------

                              $  77.33

                              ========

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the provision for Education has dropped

slightly from $27.14 million for 1971-72 to $23.95

million  for  1972-73, emphasis  continues  to  be

placed  on  expanding the level of  technical  and

vocational   education  in  order  to   meet   the

increasing  demand  for  skilled,  technical   and

professional  manpower. The past  few  years  have

seen  the  restructuring  of  secondary  education

towards  technical and vocational education.  This

emphasis  will  be  extended to education  at  the

tertiary  level.  Thus  a great  portion  of  this

year's  provision is for development  of  the  new

University  of Singapore campus at Kent  Ridge  in

Pasir  Panjang, development of the new campus  for

the  Polytechnic,  and expansion  at  the  Nanyang

University and the Ngee Ann Technical College.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for Health projects has increased

by  more than two-fold from $5.57 million in 1971-72  to  $12.71 million for 1972-73. The relatively

low  level  of expenditure for Health  development

projects  in the past few years has reflected  the

emphasis  on  industrialisation and  defence.  The

1972-73    provision   will   cater    for    more

sophisticated health services as well as  improved

environmental health services. The Government  has

decided    to   provide   highly-skilled   medical

specialists with the necessary facilities to  make

Singapore  into a medical specialities  centre  in

this part of the world. The first phase



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



of  this  programme  is the implementation  of  the

interim  development  of four  medical  specialised

units,  Nephrology,  Neurosurgery,  Cardio-Thoracic

Surgery,  and  Plastic and Reconstructive  Surgery.

Work on them will be completed in two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funds are also provided under Public Health for a

pilot project for mechanisation of street cleansing

operations and for additional vehicles required  to

provide  efficient  refuse collection  services.  A

considerable sum is also being provided to  develop

hawker   -centres  and  markets   to   resite   the

unhygienic stalls and markets now proliferating  in

various places in the city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of sewerage facilities in 1972-73

accounts for $20.05 million. Modern sanitation  and

better-sewerage facilities are necessary for better

environmental   health  to  check   pollution   and

increase  our water resources. The system  will  be

extended throughout Singapore as soon as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has, under the Garden `City Campaign

for the past two years, developed a great number of

open  spaces into beautiful parks and spots.  Trees

and  shrubs  have  been  planted  .along  the  main

thoroughfares. Government is continuing its efforts

in  its  Garden City Campaign for which  a  sum  of

$6.30  million  is  earmarked  for  1972-73.   This

includes  the  park developments  at  Mount  Faber,

Central Park and East Coast Park.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for urban and rural-services has

increased  to $3.25 million this year, as  compared

with  $2.48  million for 1971-72.  More  funds  are

required in 1972-73 so as to provide kampong roads,

street  lighting, drainage and extension of  public

utilities supply in the rural areas. An interesting

project  of  immense  educational  value   is   the

construction  of  the proposed  Science  Centre  at

Jurong. This Centre



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>



will  be  opened  throughout the  year  and  should

stimulate  and educate our students in the  science

and technical streams.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greater portion of the loans to the statutory

boards in the social sector goes to the Housing and

Development  Board. The Board has embarked  on  its

Five-Year  Building Programme with  the  target  of

building  100,000 units of flats  during  the  plan

period.  For  1972-73, a total  of  20,000  housing

units  is  expected to be built.  To  achieve  this

target,  an  amount of $180 million  has  been  set

aside as a loan to the Board in 1972-73.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for defence and public

administration amounts to $145.21 million, of which

$11.23  million  is  for public administration.  We

must defend what we have built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main share of the provision for public

administration  goes  to  the  development  of  the

Subordinate  Courts New Building at Havelock  Road,

and improvements to other Government buildings.



<br><br><i>Estimates of Revenue</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the Estimates of Revenue. Without

additional  taxation, or changes in present  rates,

the   estimated  revenue  for  the  financial  year

1972-73  is  $1,449.1 million. This  represents  an

overall increase of $142.1 million or 10.9 per cent

over the estimated revenue of $1,307.2 million  for

1971-72.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated revenue yield from direct taxes is

$537.7  million  which  is an  increase  of  $106.7

million or 22.5 per cent over the estimated revenue

for  197 1-72. The main items in this category  are

income  tax and property tax. The yield from income

tax  is expected to increase by about $70.0 million

and  from  property  tax  by  $31.7  million.  This

represents  an increase of about 25 per  cent  over

the  estimated revenue for 1971-72, and is  largely

the  result of the satisfactory growth rate of  the

economy by about 14 per cent in 1971.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue earnings from indirect taxes and other

taxes  on  outlay  are  expected  to  bring  in  an

additional  yield of $26.0 million. The main  items

included under this category are customs and excise

duties    and   revenues   from   motor   vehicles'

registration  and  licensing  fees.  Revenue   from

customs  duties is expected to yield an  additional

amount  of  $18 million or an increase of  6.4  per

cent  over  the estimated figure for  1971-72.  The

growth  in  earnings from this group  of  items  is

dependent  on the overall growth in consumption  of

petroleum,  liquor  and  cigarettes,  and  reflects

largely  normal  growth  rates.  Protective  import

duties which accounted for part of the increases in

previous years have declined in importance  due  to

the  revision of duties and the removal of  tariffs

on many items.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other main sources of revenue include sales

of  goods  and  services by Government Departments,

sales  of  land  and  land  premium,  income   from

property  and  from investments, and earnings  from

currency  surplus. This group of items is  expected

to  bring  in some incises in revenue  in  the  new

financial  year. The changes in yields  from  these

intern, however, vary significantly from  item  to

item   and   are  dependent  on  actual  plans   of

operations  rather than on normal growth  patterns.

The  main  chances affecting the yield from  "Other

Sources"  are  due to variations in  the  group  of

items  covered.  The  main  items  that  have  been

excluded  from  this  category  are  receipts  from

Telecommunications  Services and  Japanese  Special

Aid,  both  of which accounted for the  substantial

amount  of  $54 million in revenue last  year.  The

decline  in  revenue due to this  has  been  partly

compensated by an increase in revenue from interest

on  investments  and  currency surplus  which  will

jointly yield an additional revenue of about  $33.1

million in 1972-73.



<br><br><i>Tax Changes</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we have to consider the question of what

additional taxation should be imposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, our tax policy has been very simply

the  stimulation of rapid economic growth to lay  a

wider   tax  base  which  would  provide  increased

revenue  sufficiently to meet new requirements  for

Government  expenditures.  This  has  been   almost

completely successful. Since independence, we  have

had  need, in our direct taxation, only in 1966  to

increase the maximum rate of personal tax  from  50

per cent to 55 per cent for incomes above $100,000.

In  indirect taxation, only four minor  taxes  were

introduced  and three existing ones  were  revised,

these  being  duties on tobacco,  beer,  stout  and

samsu.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next financial year also, I propose to

continue  this policy. No new taxes are, therefore,

being  introduced. There will, however, be a number

of  changes which will assist Government's economic

and  social  policies. They  will  be  tax  reliefs

relating to the following:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) stamp duty on certain negotiable

certificates  of  deposits  transacted   through

financial institutions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) income tax allowance for earned income for

low income salary earners;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) income tax on the imputed income of owner-occupied houses, other than toe largest homes;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) income tax deduction of expenditure on

maintenance of gardens;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) estate duty on small estates;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) income tax depreciation allowance on

expenditure   by  industries  on   antipollution

devices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details of the tax reliefs are as follows: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>(1) Abolition of Stamp Duty on Negotiable Certificates of Deposits and Bills of Exchange</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Government's intention, as-part of the

plan  for  assisting the development  of  Singapore

into  a  regional financial centre,  to  promote  a

short-term  money market. This is at  present  non-existent  because  the  stamp  duty  on  Bills   of

Exchange and Negotiable Certificates of Deposit  is

inordinately  high.  In  the leading  international

financial  centres, either there is no stamp  duty,

or  the  rates are nominal. I propose therefore  to

remove   the  stamp  duty  on  Bills  of  Exchange,

Negotiable Certificates



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



of  Deposit and allied forms of promissory

notes  which are transacted from or through  banks.

The expected reduction in revenue from such removal

is  estimated at $2.5 million per year, but  it  is

hoped  that  it  will  be  offset  by  returns   in

increased  economic activities and in  earnings  of

the financial institutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>(2) Earned income Relief up to $1,000 under the Income Tax Act</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, in addition to personal allowances,

the Income Tax Act allow a taxpayer a deduction for

earned  income which is defined as including income

from   salaries,  partnerships  and  other  sources

except income from capital such as rents, dividends

and  interest. This relief is, however, limited  to

20  per cent of the earned income, and subject also

to  a  maximum deduction of $1,000. For  the  small

taxpayer  earning  less  than  $5,000  per   annum,

however,  the maximum deduction is determined  only

by  the  first limit of 20 per cent of  the  earned

income. I propose to remove this 20 per cent  limit

so that the deduction will be of full earned income

subject  only to the maximum deduction  of  $1,000.

This  will  benefit  about  33,000  taxpayers.  The

proposal  will  be  effective  from  this  year  of

assessment.



<br><br><i> (3) Increase  in the exemption from $6,000 to $12,000 in the Net Annual Value of owner-occupied residence for Income Tax purposes</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid progress of the economy has resulted in

an   escalation  in  prices  of  landed   property,

particularly in the last two to three years, which,

in  turn,  has brought about a general increase  in

rentals  of  houses. Following these  increases  in

rentals,  the revaluation of the annual  values  of

properties has been undertaken by the Property  Tax

Department,  but  has  been  the  cause   of   much

complaint  by  owner-occupiers, some of  whom  have

claimed  that  it may soon become too expensive  to

live  in  their  own  houses! The  reason  is  that

although  no additional Property Tax is payable  by

owner-occupiers, some of them have become liable to

income tax



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



on the imputed income taken as the net annual value

of  the  house in excess of $6,000. (The net annual

value of the house is derived by deducting property

tax,  maintenance  cost  and  interest  charged  on

mortgage loans from the annual value of the house.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is the policy of the Government to

encourage  greater home-ownership in the  Republic,

it  is proposed that the existing exemption of  net

annual value be increased from $6,000 o $12,000 for

the  purposes  of income tax. Such  exemption  will

give  avoidance  from payment of additional  income

tax  to  the large majority of owners who  live  in

their  own houses. Even the small minority who  own

and  live  in  very large residences will  enjoy  a

reduction in income tax which they can well  afford

to pay.



<br><br><i> (4) Increase in the remission of income tax  on cost of maintaining of garden</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1970, the Government decided to remit income

tax on expenditure up to $100 incurred by taxpayers

for  maintaining well kept gardens as part  of  the

national  campaign to make Singapore  a  clean  and

green   city.   This  remission  is   confined   to

individuals;    companies   can    already    treat

expenditure  incurred  on gardens  like  any  other

expense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government spends considerable sums of money

in  planting trees, flowers and bushes along  roads

and  in public places. The public has responded  to

the  campaign and Government's example by improving

their  gardens  through planting  flowers,  bushes,

hedges  and  creepers. As the garden city  campaign

must  be  further  encouraged I  propose,  for  the

purpose  of  giving a remission of income  tax,  to

increase  the maximum from $100 to $300  per  annum

for   the   expenditure  on  gardens.  Whilst   the

conditions  of  eligibility  for  remission   would

remain  the same, I am prepared to consider  easing

the procedure for making such claims.



<br><br><i> (5) Remission  from  Estate  Duty  on  Estates between $10,000 and $25,000</i>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first $10,000, there is now no duty on

the estate of a deceased person. As duty is payable

on the market value of the assets, the appreciation

in  recent  years has made even terrace houses  and

Housing  and  Development Board flats  often  worth

more  than $10,000 and, therefore, liable to estate

duty.   I  propose  to  restore  the  position   by

remitting  the  estate  duty  between  $10,000  and

$25,000.  This  will ensure that poor beneficiaries

inheriting small estates do not suffer  by  having

to  sell  or  mortgage their modest  dwellings  and

possessions on the death of the bread-winner. Based

on  1970  statistics,  this  remission  would  have

benefited  about 293 families out of 732  who  paid

estate  duty. There will be no change  for  persons

inheriting  an  estate  worth  more  than   $25,000

because it remains Government policy to narrow  the

income gap between the poor -and the wealthy.



<br><br><i> (6) Accelerated  Depreciation  for  industrial Anti-Pollution Devices</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In promoting industrial growth, the Government

has  to keep in mind also the wider interest of the

community. Though we want more industries  and  the

job  opportunities they bring, we do not  want  the

pollution   which   is  sometimes   a   by-product.

Legislation for

-control  of  various kinds of pollution  has  been

enacted  and  the  Government is  now  intensifying

enforcement of its provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the onus lies with the owners of

industries to control pollution, the Government  is

prepared  to  assist  them by allowing  accelerated

depreciation over three years on capital investment

in   approved  anti-pollution  devices.  With   the

introduction   of  this  incentive,  industrialists

should  also  accelerate  their  plans  to  install

pollution control equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above measures are expected to cost the

Government a total loss of revenue of approximately

$3.5 million, but would bring compensatory benefits

to Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I, in concluding this

"painless budget" Statement, pay a tribute to those

who  made it possible the workers of all ranks  and

occupations  who so spiritedly and undauntedly  met

the  challenges of the years since independence and

by   their  constancy  and  adaptability   to   new

circumstances,   changed   the   difficulties   and

uncertainties  caused by the loss  of  neighbouring

markets upon separation from Malaysia and the  loss

of employment and foreign exchange upon the British

military   rundown  into  economic   opportunities,

opportunities which have now produced  our  present

healthy  financial situation. I  am  sure  that  in

taking  some of the fruits of our economic  success

for  present consumption, they will all want to -do

so  with an eye for future consumption and with  an

appreciation  of the need of investment  for  long-term returns.

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to introduce a number

of  amendments  to  the Adoption of  Children  Act,

1970.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing provisions under section 3 of the Act

are  considered to be too restrictive in that  they

do  not  allow the making of an adoption  order  in

certain   cases   where   there   are   exceptional

circumstances meriting a legal adoption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the first and second provisos to

subsection  (1) of section 3 of the  principal  Act

and the addition of a third proviso is to enable an

applicant  under 25 years of age or  less  than  21

years  older than the infant (or both) to adopt  an

infant  who  is  within the prohibited  degrees  of

consanguinity    and    in    other     exceptional

circumstances.  Under the existing  law,  a  parent

under  25 years of age cannot adopt his or her  own

child,  particularly where the infant concerned  is

an  illegitimate issue, and the parent subsequently

marries and desires to adopt the child jointly with

his  or  her  spouse.  The  same  restriction  also

applies to the adoption of an orphan by an uncle or

an  aunt  who  is less than 25 years  of  age.  The

proposed  amendment to remove the above restriction

will not only apply to cases involving illegitimate

children  but  will also apply to  cases  involving

legitimate  children, for example,  a  young  widow

under the age of 25 years remarries and desires her

child by the deceased husband to be recognised  not

only  as  her  own but also as that of her  present

spouse,  through the process of legal adoption.  In

all  these  instances, it is felt  that  a  waiting

period  may cause humiliation and embarrassment  to

the   parties  concerned,  particularly  where  the

infant is an illegitimate issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed new proviso to subsection (I) of

section  3 will enable the Court to allow a person,

who  is  not  within  the  prohibited  degrees   of

consanguinity and less than 21 years older than the

infant,  to  adopt  such an infant  if  exceptional

circumstances merit such an adoption,  particularly

in  cases  where  the infant is a female,  and  the

person debarred from adopting the infant in a joint

petition is the female petitioner.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment to subsection (3) of

section  3 spells out in detail the various grounds

for   the  dispensation  of  the  natural  parents'

consent in the interest and welfare of the child to

be   adopted.  The  existing  provision  does   not

elaborate sufficiently the circumstances where  the

Court  may dispense with the consent of the natural

parents. The present provision has sometimes  given

rise to difficulties in interpretation, and because

of  the generality of this proviso, the Courts have

on  occasions been reluctant to dispense  with  the

consent even when the circumstances warranted it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, there is at present no provision for

dispensation   of  consent  when   a   parent   has

persistently ill-treated the infant, or has  failed

to  exercise normal parental duties, or has  placed

the  infant  in  the  care of  the  Social  Welfare

Department  and has shown little or no interest  in

the  welfare  of the infant except perhaps  a  rare

visit once in a long while. Dispensation of consent

under such circumstances is considered justifiable -

and  in  the  interest of such children,  who-would

otherwise be deprived of a chance to be adopted  by

suitable  families who can offer them  good  homes.

Many  children presently under the care  of  social

welfare  homes  and  other  voluntary  institutions

could have been adopted and brought up in a happier

and more secure home atmosphere, if not for the non-availability  or  wilful  withholding  of  parental

consent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citizenship status of the adopted infant is

not  spelt  out in the Act. Because of  this,  many

people are under the impression that legal adoption

automatically  awards citizenship of  the  adoptive

parents to the adopted infant. Amendment to section

6  of  the  principal  Act  seeks  to  clarify  the

position   that  adoption  does  not   affect   the

nationality  or citizenship of the adopted  infant.

This amendment will bring the Act in line with  the

local  citizenship law under which even  a  natural

child  of a Singapore citizen parent, born  outside

the  Republic, does  not automatically  assume-the

citizenship of his parents.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present practice of issuing an extract from

the  Register of Adopted Children for  all  adopted

infants  is  unsatisfactory  and  has  caused  much

embarrassment and unhappiness to both the  adoptive

parents  and  the adopted children.  Many  adoptive

parents have found it most difficult to explain  to

the  adopted  child why his "birth certificate"  is

different  from  his  other siblings.  The  adopted

child himself has also suffered countless ridicules

from  his  fellow school-mates on  account  of  his

being  known as an adopted child, having no natural

parents.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, if you will  recollect,

this has been the -common subject of complaints  of

many  adopted parents, made in writing to both  the

Government and the local press. Since section 6  of

the  Adoption  of  Children Act  has  accorded  the

status of a natural child to the adopted child,  it

seems,  therefore,  a logical  step  to  amend  the

present legislation to provide for registration  of

adoption  and  the  issue  of  an  ordinary   birth

certificate to the adopted child, thus enabling his

complete integration into the adoptive family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause S of the Bill repeals section 11 of the

principal  Act  and re-enacts a new  section  which

deals  fully with the whole process of registration

of legal adoption to enable all adopted children to

have  a  birth certificate which is similar in  all

respects  to  that  of a child  who  has  not  been

adopted. It also ensures that all adoption  records

maintained  by the Registrar of Births  and  Deaths

are treated as confidential matters, and access  to

them  is only possible under a court order.  Unless

reference is made to these records, it will not  be

possible  to  know  from  the  new  form  of  birth

certificate whether or not its holder is an adopted

child.    The    amendment   also   provides    for

retrospective issue of such certificates to adopted

children  upon  application made  by  the  adoptive

parents when the legislation becomes operative.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new section 11 relating to the issue of a new

birth certificate is modelled on similar

legislation which was first introduced in New

Zealand in 1915. It is confirmed that, besides New

Zealand, the following countries also have similar

provisions in regard to registration of adoption

and the issue of a new birth certificate to adopted

children: Canada, France, Switzerland, Argentina,

Bolivia, Denmark, U.S.S.R., and U.S.A.

issued after the birth has been registered under

this section:".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reasons for this amendment are as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) It is desirable to have a special

provision  to  protect a single  adopter  from  any

possible embarrassment which may be caused  by  the

issue  of a birth certificate to the adopted  child

showing only one parent's name when the new form of

birth  certificate  comes into  use.  Otherwise,  a

child  adopted by a single adopter (particularly  a

female person) may appear to be illegitimate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Originally it was intended to give, on the

request  of  the single adopter, a letter  showing

some  essential details of the adoption.  However,

on  further  consideration, it was  felt  that  it

would   be  more  expedient  to  make  a   special

provision in the Bill.

<div align="center"><b>TOURIST PROMOTION BOARD (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Tourist Promotion Board which was

set  up  in 1964 is now well on its way  to  being

firmly  established as the major organisation  for

promoting  Singapore internationally as a  tourist

centre.  To  finance  its opera-lions,  the  Board

collects a three per cent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>



cess on hotel charges and on the sale of food  and

drinks  in  the  Republic's higher  class  tourist

establishments. The annual income of the Board  is

about $5 million, of which $3 million has been set

aside  for  overseas promotion during the  current

fiscal  year. This is some $1.7 million more  than

the sum budgeted for promotional work for the last

fiscal   year,  and  it  is  aimed  not  only   at

intensifying  the  international  advertising  and

promotion  programme but also at  setting  up  new

overseas representations, one in Frankfurt and one

in New York possibly, to supplement the efforts of

existing ones in Tokyo, Sydney and San Francisco.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the Board is successfully promoting

Singapore  as  a  tourist centre  internationally,

there  is a great need to co-ordinate the  efforts

of  the various promotional agencies in Singapore,

so  that  Singapore can be promoted as  a  tourist

centre  in  the most effective manner possible  by

both    Government   and   the   private   sector.

Furthermore, there is a pressing need  to  develop

within  Singapore those touristy facilities  which

would  result in tourists extending their stay  in

the  Republic  by an additional day  or  two  with

consequential benefits to hotel occupancy rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring together in one co-ordinated effort the

promotional   efforts  of  the   various   private

organisations engaged in the tourist business with

those  of Government, the Tourist Promotion  Board

Act is being amended to enable any person, who  is

carrying  on the business of a tourist enterprise,

to  become  an  Associate Member  of  the  Board's

organisation.  Two  Associate  Members   will   he

appointed to the Tourist Promotion Board to advise

on policy matters as well as on operations. Whilst

Associate membership will give certain advantages,

as all Associate Members will stand to gain by way

of publicity and business, it will alto entail the

responsibility of the member for maintaining  high

standards at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>



all  times  in  the  conduct of his  business  and

adherence  to  any regulations made by  the  Board

governing touristy operations. In anticipation  of

the coming into effect of this scheme of Associate

membership  to  the Tourist Promotion  Board,  the

Singapore Tourist Association has dissolved itself

so  that  its members, comprising various  tourist

establishments from the private sector,  can  join

the   organisation   of  the   Singapore   Tourist

Promotion Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with the objective of making the stay

of  a  tourist here a comfortable and a satisfying

one, the Tourist Promotion Board Act is also being

amended to regulate and control tourist and travel

business in Singapore. These amendments prohibit a

person  from describing his business or activities

as  a  tourist or travel agency, without the prior

approval  of  the  Tourist  Promotion  Board.  The

amendments also restrict a person from  using  the

words  "tourist" or "travel" except with the prior

permission of the Board. The purpose of this is to

prevent  those  persons  operating  social  escort

agencies  from  describing  their  activities   as

tourist  services.  Further, to  keep  the  travel

business  in Singapore in a healthy state,  travel

agencies  will  in  future be licensed.  AU  these

measures are designed to protect the tourist  from

exploitation and to ensure that during his stay in

Singapore  he  will only be exposed to  bona  fide

travel agencies or tour operators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment to the Tourist Promotion Board

Act  enables  the Board to acquire shares  in  any

company  or  to invest in any business which  will

promote  the  tourist  trade  in  Singapore.  Such

direct  financial participation by the Board  will

accelerate   the  development  of  the   necessary

touristy   facilities  in  Singapore   which   are

necessary  to  support  the  overseas  promotional

programme.  This  will  not  only  encourage  more

tourists to come to Singapore but also to  prolong

their stay here.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other amendments, as proposed, seek to prevent

the  indiscriminate  use of the  Board's  official

symbol, the Merlion, and to protect funds credited

to  any  superannuation scheme or  provident  fund

established  by  the Board for its employees  from

being  utilised for the payment of  an  employee's

debts should he be made a bankrupt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b>Mr Speaker,

Sir,  is  the Minister of State for Finance  aware

that  some  social escorts are also  called  "girl

guides",  and  that the service  they  provide  is

called  "girl  guide service"?  Furthermore,  will

this  law  prohibit  the use  of  the  term  "girl

guides"?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Are they called girl' guides?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Yes. Some social escorts

in Singapore call themselves girl guides.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, I think this matter is

well  out of my province. Perhaps the Member could

address it to the Girl Guides Association.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Sir, if the Minister of

State   for   Finance   had   been   reading   the

advertisement columns in the newspapers, he  would

have come across that term.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, the Board's jurisdiction

is  confined to tourist promotion and, of  course,

within that sphere it will do its best to see that

tourists  who come to Singapore have an  enjoyable

holiday and that their stay here is as comfortable

as  possible.  If  it  comes to  our  notice  that

certain organisations are, in fact, using the term

"girl guides" or whatever -description to hoodwink

the  tourists,  then, of course, my Ministry  will

see to it that they do not do so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  would just like to -draw the attention  of  the

Minister of State for Finance to the provisions of

the new sections 15D and l9C. Sir, you will notice

that  the  penalty imposed on any business,  which

describes itself as a tourist service without  the

permission of the Board, carries a higher  penalty

than  a business which makes use of the symbol  of

the  Board.  However, I believe  that  the  latter

offence is more serious. And in this respect,  the

penalty is only a fine, and there is no additional

provision  of a term of imprisonment  as  provided

for  under  the  new  section  l5D.  May  I  -seek

clarification  from  the  Minister  of  State  for

Finance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, the provisions of the

Bill  have  been carefully considered, and  it  is

thought  that a fine would be a sufficient penalty

for  the contravention of the provision on the use

of  the  Board's  symbol of the  Merlion, and  no

imprisonment  is necessary. However,  if  we  find

that such penalty is inadequate, an amendment  can

always be made to the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

<div align="center"><b>TOURIST PROMOTION (CESS COLLECTION) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Tourist Promotion Board commenced

collection  of  cess horn hotels in January  1964,

and   from   tourist  public   houses   and   food

establishments  in  March  1970,   following   the

necessary  amendments  to  the  Tourist  Promotion

Board  Act.  The collection of cess  is  currently

being undertaken by the Department of Customs  and

Excise on behalf of the Board, in accordance  with

the  Regulations established under the  Act.  With

the  passing of time, it has been found  necessary

to  introduce  various amendments to  the  Act  to

prevent tax evasion and unauthorised collection of

cess,  as  well as to enable the process  of  cess

collection to be undertaken more effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, it is proposed to incorporate

within a single Bill all legislation pertaining to

the  imposition and collection of cess which  will

also repeal the existing provisions on cess in the

Tourist Promotion Board Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no change in the rate of cess

levied.  This will remain at 3 per cent.  However,

instead  of imposing the cess only on the sale  of

food  and  drinks  in  tourist establishments,  as

provided in the Tourist Promotion Board Act,  this

Bill seeks to widen the scope of the cess so as to

cover sales and charges levied or collected by all

tourist food establishments and by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



tourist public houses. This is thought to be  fair

and    reasonable   because    many    of    these

establishments  benefit  from  tourists   visiting

Singapore  but are not contributing to the  upkeep

of  the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board and  its

promotional efforts. This amendment would bring in

additional  income to the Tourist Promotion  Board

to  supplement its promotional efforts, and it  is

also    expected   to   facilitate   the   present

administration of the tax itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also provisions in the Bill to enable

tourist  establishments required to  pay  cess  to

recover  from  their customers the  cess  payable.

Customers are, however, protected under  the  Bill

from    payment    of    cess   to    unauthorised

establishments. Other new provisions in  the  Bill

enable the Tourist Promotion Board to recover cess

due  to it on the basis of an estimate made by the

Board, and to sue for cess outstanding by way of a

specially  endorsed writ of summons.  Where  legal

proceedings  are instituted by the  Board,  it  is

entitled  to all costs allowed by law against  the

person liable. Cess owing to the Board shall  rank

first  in  priority  to all  other  debts  in  any

bankruptcy  proceedings or in the distribution  of

the  property  of a person dying insolvent.  Also,

persons  who attempt to evade cess are  liable  on

conviction to heavy fines and/or imprisonment. The

Bill  also  provides  for the prosecution  of  any

offence  under the Act to be conducted by officers

of  the  Board or the Government with the sanction

of  the Public Prosecutor. These new provisions in

the  Bill  are considered necessary to enable  the

Board to collect cess more effectively.

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Society of Accountants Ordinance,

1963, now called the Accountants Act (Chapter  212

of  the  1970  Revised Edition of  the  Laws)  was

enacted  to  register accountants and to  regulate

the  practice  of  accountancy in Singapore.  This

legislation, which was passed nine years ago, gave

recognition  to  locally-trained  accountants  and

accorded  them professional standing in line  with

the other professions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 8 of the Accountants Act provides that

the  Society of Accountants may, with the approval

of  the  Minister for Finance, make rules for  the

administration of the Act. This is cumbersome  and

unsatisfactory  as, in effect, it means  that  all

such  rules  have to be considered and deliberated

on by the general body of the Society at a general

meeting. In most other professional Acts  as,  for

example,  the Legal Profession Act, the  authority

for  the making of such rules lies with the  Board

of  Legal  Education. It is therefore proposed  to

amend section 8 of the Act



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



to  provide for the Council of the Society  to  be

vested  with  this function. This  amendment  will

bring  it in line with a similar provision in  the

Legal Profession Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 9 of the Act provides for the University

of Singapore to be represented on the Council, but

there   is   no  similar  provision  for   Nanyang

University.    Both    the   Universities    award

Accountancy  degrees which are recognised  by  the

Singapore  Society of Accountants. It is therefore

logical  that  Nanyang University should  also  be

represented  on  the Council. Accordingly,  it  is
