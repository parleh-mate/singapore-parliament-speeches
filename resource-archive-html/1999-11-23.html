<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>BILATERAL TIES WITH INDONESIA</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan</b> asked the Prime Minister, in

view   of   Indonesia's  present  political   stability   and

international  confidence, whether there are  specific  plans

for  Singapore  to  strengthen  bilateral  ties  and  play  a

catalyst    role  to  assist  Indonesia's  economic  recovery

through significant investments in Indonesia.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, before I

ask my question, I would like to declare my interest, if any,

that  I  work for a group of companies that has interests  in

Indonesia.  Question No. 1, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar)</b>

<b>(for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I am not

mistaken,  the  Member  had filed  the  Question  before  the

official visit of the Indonesian President



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



but  since then the Prime Minister Mr Goh Chok Tong  has  set

out  Singapore's  views  on  the  subject  quite  fully  when

President  Abdurrahman  Wahid  made  his  official  visit  to

Singapore on 6thNovember 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia is one of our closest neighbours and a major

trading  partner.   We  would like to see  a  prosperous  and

stable  Indonesia.  We are ready to work  with  Indonesia  to

assist  in  its  economic recovery.   Singapore  is  a  small

country  and  our contribution can only be modest.   However,

Singapore can play a catalytic role to help restore  investor

confidence through practical measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our existing cooperation platforms can be leveraged to

help   Indonesia  achieve  early  results  in  bringing  back

investor confidence. In particular, we can focus on the  Riau

cooperation  projects,  which  are  symbols  of   the   close

bilateral cooperation between Indonesia and Singapore.  These

projects  have  withstood  the  regional  crisis.  But  their

potential  has not been fully realised.  We can  explore  how

the  Riau  cooperation projects can be  further  expanded  to

bring  in  more foreign investments into the Riau  islands  - Batam,  Bintan  and Karimun. This would have a  demonstrative

effect  on international investor confidence for the rest  of

Indonesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Abdurrahman Wahid disclosed in Singapore that

Indonesia  was thinking of turning Batam into  a  Free  Trade

Zone (FTZ).   We believe this is a good idea. Batam will then

be  on  par with Singapore because Singapore is also  a  free

trade  zone.  This  will increase Batam's attractiveness  for

foreign  investments and create more employment opportunities

for Indonesians.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore can also work with Indonesia to intensify

tourism   cooperation.  Indonesia's  tourism   potential   is

enormous  and we are prepared to work with Indonesia  to  re-launch the Indonesia-Singapore Tourism Cooperation programme.

Apart  from  bringing in foreign exchange and creating  jobs,

there  will also be positive spin-offs for the other  sectors

and industries in Indonesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the coming months, we will have close consultations

with the Indonesian



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



government on these ideas.  Prime Minister Goh has  announced

that he will lead a business delegation to Indonesia sometime

early  next  year.   To  lay  the groundwork  for  the  Prime

Minister's  visit, Mr Philip Yeo, Chairman EDB, will  lead  a

delegation of senior officials to Jakarta at the end of  this

month to hold discussions with the Indonesian authorities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, I would like to find out whether

there  is  a  possibility of setting up a Singapore-Indonesia

Business  Council,  as  we have done for  bilateral  business

relationships with other countries.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I would not like at this stage to

anticipate too much and try to predict the various  outcomes.

Let us wait for the mission to be led by Mr Philip Yeo to  go

and  assess the situation.  This was the first meeting at the

Heads  of Government level with the new President.  The  key,

as  we  have  said in many statements issued, is  really  the

restoration of investor confidence, stability and to  restore

the linkages between the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of what kind of mechanism, whether Business

Council  or otherwise, of course can be explored if and  when

this  question arises later.  But at the moment I  think  the

area  that we have pinpointed, such as restoring of stability

and  investor  confidence, is the  key.   The  form  and  the

instrument may be looked at later.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, would the

Minister   update   the   House  on  the  Singapore-Indonesia

Bilateral  Trade Finance Guarantee (BTFG) scheme proposed  by

Singapore  in 1998 to help restore established trade  between

Singapore and Indonesia?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I think the Member would have

read  that  this  proposal has not  been  acceptable  to  the

Indonesians  because the conditions and safeguards  which  we

have  proposed were, in their view, not agreeable.   So  this

proposal has not been taken up.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in this

regard,  does  the Minister see that there  is  a  window  of

opportunity   for   better  relations  and   that   in   this

relationship improvements can be made in terms of  governance

and rule of law to attract more investors?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I am not sure if I understood the

thrust of his question.  But if his question is that this  is

a  good  window of opportunity during which to work with  the

Indonesian  government  to  improve  bilateral  and  economic

relations,  the answer is, as we have said, yes  because  the

new government is, in our view, the best possible team in the

circumstances.  They have both legitimacy and moral authority

and during the discussions that took place here as well as in

the  press  conference, President Abdurrahman Wahid  made  it

clear that he is intent on restoring investor confidence  and

bringing about stability in Indonesia.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> May I

ask  the Minister, digressing a little from the economic ties

and  cooperation, whether there are any lessons for Singapore

to  be  learned from the political transition that has  taken

place in Indonesia?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> The lesson to all is that Singapore's

policies,  both  economic and political, and  the  policy  of

social  cohesion  and integration which this  Government  has

pursued since independence have worked for Singapore and  all

of  us, both the Government and the people of Singapore, must

ensure  rigorously  that  these policies  are  supported  and

continue to work in Singapore.  This has kept Singapore going

despite  enormous  obstacles, including the financial  crisis

and  the lesson to be learned from what is happening  in  the

rest  of  the region is that when we have a good formula  and

recipe  for Singapore's success, let us all work together  to

make sure that it is not in any way undermined.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, does the Government appreciate that

Indonesia  has  opened up a host of freedoms for  the  people

which  may  lead  to  Indonesia becoming a  democracy?   Does

Singapore intend to follow in that lead or not?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I humoured him by

giving an answer to a question which was really off the point

in my view, but his further question would be a repetition of

what  I  believe he is going to raise in his motion which  is

tabled for consideration in this House later.

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL LIMIT ORDER BOOK (CLOB) SAGA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Update)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Thomas Thomas</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister if

he  will (a) update the House on the latest position  on  the

Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) saga and whether there  is  a

solution in sight; and (b) clarify the role of the Securities

Investors Association (Singapore) and whether the Association

is in a position to handle the issue satisfactorily.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I last updated Parliament on the CLOB issue  in

August.   The Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) had submitted

a  proposal to the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) on  5th

July  of  this year, suggesting a staggered release  of  CLOB

securities   over  12  months.   The  proposal  was   without

prejudice to SES' rights under the CDP-SCANS agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The KLSE subsequently sought clarification on SES'

proposal.   In  particular, it asked for assurance  that  the

staggered  crediting of CLOB shares would not be  detrimental

to  the Malaysian stock market.  KLSE wrote to SES twice,  on

15th  July and 5th August.  SES responded with relevant  data

and  calculations  demonstrating that  the  resulting  impact

should  be  minimal.  SES replied to KLSE's first  letter  on

23rd July, and KLSE's latest queries by 3rd September.  There

has  been no further response from the KLSE since then.   SES

sent a reminder to KLSE on 15th November 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that SES' proposal is reasonable and

addresses  Malaysia's concern of volatility on  the  KLSE  if

CLOB  shares were to be released all at once.  The Securities

Investors Association of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  (SIAS)  has also indicated  its  support  for  the

proposal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members would have read in the papers about several

private  sector  offers.  The offerors have been  in  contact

with  the  SES, and also with the Registrar of Companies  and

Businesses.   The  Central Depository (CDP) as  bare  trustee

will  carry  out its obligation to inform CLOB  investors  of

these  offers when requisite regulatory approvals  have  been

obtained.   RCB will register prospectuses that are submitted

if they comply with the Companies Act's requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RCB has stated that it will take into account all

factors,  including the views of SIAS, when deciding  whether

it is in the public interest to register the offer documents.

Some  of the private offerors have been in communication with

SIAS.   But  so  far  none  of  the  proposals  have  reached

fruition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SIAS has played a useful and independent role,

representing   the   interests  of  CLOB   investors.    That

interested and public spirited Singaporeans have come forward

to  volunteer their services to tackle this problem  is  very

heartening,  and  bodes  well for the  development  of  civil

society in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SIAS has recently formed a financial advisory group

comprising   experienced  practitioners  in  the   securities

industry,  which  will help SIAS to evaluate  private  sector

offers  independently  and  objectively,  before  making  its

recommendations to CLOB investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent articles in the Malaysian press have suggested

that  resolution of the CLOB issue would be  a  priority  for

Malaysia  after the general elections.  Singapore hopes  that

this  will  be  the  case, as it is in the  interest  of  all

parties to resolve the issue fairly and expeditiously.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, can I ask the

Deputy  Prime Minister to clarify the legal position  of  the

CDP as well as the 172,000 CLOB investors?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the CDP has now

obtained  comprehensive  legal  advice,  including  that   of

Malaysian lawyers and a few Queen's Counsels.  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



legal advisers are unanimous in their view that CDP and  CLOB

investors have a strong position in law and their rights over

CLOB shares are indisputable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDP had complied with Malaysian law. Specifically,

the  CDP-SCANS agreement which contains precise  arrangements

for   CLOB  securities  to  be  transferred  into  individual

accounts with the Malaysian Central Depository for trading on

the  KLSE  is legally binding and is specifically enforceable

in Malaysian courts.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, can I ask the Deputy Prime

Minister  to  clarify what would be the status of  the  CDP's

authorised nominee status after 31st December 1999?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the lawyers have

also  advised  on  what would happen if the CDP's  authorised

nominee  status is not extended beyond the end of  the  year.

Some CLOB investors are concerned that MCD will transfer  the

CLOB  securities to the Malaysian Minister of  Finance  after

31st December for subsequent disposal by him.  QC has advised

that  there  is  no basis in law for such a transfer  to  the

Malaysian  Minister  of  Finance.   Indeed,  the  MCD  has  a

statutory  duty  to  transfer the CLOB  securities  into  the

beneficial  owners'  individual  securities  accounts   under

Malaysian laws.  The SES wrote to MCD on 26th October to  ask

if  it  is  their intention to maintain the status quo  after

31st  December by extending CDP's authorised nominee  status.

The SES is still waiting for MCD's response.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, can I ask the Deputy Prime

Minister  whether  the  Singapore Government  has  considered

taking action at the World Trade Organisation?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore

Government  has taken advice on possible proceedings  at  the

World  Trade  Organisation forum from leading  legal  counsel

that specialises in WTO issues.  The counsel has advised that

the CLOB issue is within WTO's jurisdiction and Singapore has

valid grounds for seeking redress at WTO on the matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



Malaysia's  actions  are inconsistent  with  its  obligations

under  the  WTO's  General Agreement on  Trade  and  Services

(GATS).   Under  the GATS agreement, of which Malaysia  is  a

signatory,  countries  are entitled to accept  most  favoured

nation obligations that are mutually binding.  The obligation

is  to accord all financial services and service suppliers of

other  WTO members treatment that is no less favourable  than

that  given to similar service and service suppliers of other

countries.    There   must  not  be  discrimination   between

countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, scrip-based trading of Malaysian securities

continues freely on two foreign exchanges within the European

Community   -   the London Stock Exchange and the  Copenhagen

Stock  Exchange.   The  Malaysian Securities  Commission  has

issued a statement specifically recognising both of these  as

exempt markets, and yet Malaysian legislation has forced  the

discontinuance   of  CLOB  International   and   caused   the

securities traded on it to be frozen.  And this is  a  denial

of  most  favoured  nation  (MFN) status  that  Singapore  is

entitled to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the

Deputy  Prime Minister give the House some indication  as  to

when  the  matter will be settled after next week, ie,  after

the  Malaysian  general  elections?  Secondly,  what  is  the

timeframe  in  which this matter will be taken  up  with  the

World Trade Organisation?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not able to

say when the matter will be settled.  It very much depends on

the  Malaysian authorities.  We are raising the  matter  with

them and we will continue to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we would raise the matter in the WTO, that

depends on what progress we make in our bilateral discussions

with the Malaysians.  I think it is an issue to be considered

carefully.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, can I ask the Minister whether

the  Government  has  a view on Mr Akbar  Khan's  irrevocable

request and authority scheme (IRAS)?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Akbar Khan, in

his press statement on 18th November, proposed an irrevocable

request  and  authority scheme.  This is in addition  to  his

closed-end  fund  offer for which he has  submitted  proposed

offer  documents to the Registrar of Companies and Businesses

(RCB).   The  RCB is reviewing the documents and  has  stated

that  it  will  take  into account all information  including

SIAS' views in determining if it is in the public interest to

register  the  documents.  SIAS has been in contact  with  Mr

Khan and has said that it is waiting for relevant information

from him that will enable it to come to a responsible view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Khan's IRAS offer does not require RCB's approval.

However,  the  SES  will require clear  and  legally  binding

understanding with KLSE on any migration schedule.  The  KLSE

has  yet to indicate its position on either the SES' proposal

for a 12-month migration of CLOB shares or Mr Khan's proposal

for  a  15-month migration of shares after a further 12-month

lock-up  period.  The lock-up period is 7 months for warrants

and  derived instruments, but 12 months for shares.  The  CDP

will  not  be able to put the migration proposal to investors

without an unequivocal and binding commitment from the  KLSE.

As  and when the offers have been given official approval and

accompanied by clear commitments from the KLSE, the CDP  will

be  able to put them to CLOB investors.  CLOB investors  will

have  to study them carefully and calmly before deciding  for

themselves whether to take them up.  They should consider all

relevant  factors, including their legal rights as owners  of

the CLOB shares.

<div align="center"><b>SAFETY MEASURES AT CONSTRUCTION SITES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

what   additional  safety  measures  will  be  in  place   in

construction  sites  to  ensure that accidents  such  as  the

toppling  of  a  crane  at  a North  East  Line  MRT  station

worksite, do not recur.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Haron Eusofe (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Encik Othman Bin Haron Eusofe) (for the Minister for Manpower):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in September 1998,

my  Ministry introduced new regulations to enhance the safety

of crane operations in Singapore.  Under the new regulations,

only  operators registered with the Ministry are  allowed  to

operate  mobile  cranes  and  tower  cranes.   The  Factories

(Operation of Cranes) Regulations prescribe safety rules that

these  operators  must follow.  Their registration  would  be

suspended or cancelled if they are found not to have complied

with  these  rules.  The Regulations also  require  that  all

lifting operations using mobile or tower cranes be supervised

by  competent lifting supervisors who must have  completed  a

course of training on lifting supervision.  Other than these,

the   Regulations   also   specify  that   installation   and

dismantling  of  a  mobile or a tower crane,  or  any  repair

affecting  the structural integrity of such crane be  carried

out  only  by  approved  contractors.   Crane  operators  who

conscientiously follow the regulations will be able to  avoid

accidents involving their operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the case mentioned by the Member for Kreta Ayer-Tanglin GRC, where a crane had toppled and fell onto a moving

vehicle, investigation is still underway.  My Ministry viewed

this case seriously as such an accident could take disastrous

proportions.  Contractors involved in the construction of the

North-East  MRT  lines  are reminded that  because  of  their

proximity  to  public thoroughfare, they need to  take  extra

precautions when conducting lifting operations.  This is also

generally  true  for those contractors with  projects  nearby

public places.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry officials have worked with LTA on the

measures  that  could be taken to prevent recurrence.   These

include the tightening of the system of checks to ensure that

all  lifting operations are conducted safely.  A standardised

permit-to-lift  system  is currently being  studied  and,  if

found  feasible,  will  be introduced to  these  contractors.

Under  the system, all lifting operations can only be carried

out after a written permit for the lift has been endorsed  by

the  lifting  supervisor.  Before endorsing such permit,  the

supervisor is expected to check thoroughly the suitability of

the crane for the lift, the ground



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



and   environmental  conditions,  the  qualification  of  the

operator,  the rigging of the load and so on.   These  checks

are to be done with the help of suitably qualified persons on

site,  such  as the site engineer.  Only after  these  checks

have been made can the lifting operation commence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to ensure compliance with the safety requirements

in  lifting operations, the Ministry will continue to conduct

special enforcement exercises targeted at premises which  use

cranes.   Occupiers found flouting these safety  requirements

would  face  the issue of stop work orders and be charged  in

court.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, even today, there is a report in

the  Straits  Times about another accident at a  construction

site.   I  would  like to ask the Minister of  State  whether

there  is  an  increasing trend of accidents at  construction

sites this year as compared to past years.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, accidents of this

nature  are  quite rare.  In fact, for this year, there  were

very  few cases.  I do not have the details now, but  if  the

Member needs the information, I will let him have it.

insufficient  funds  in their CPF Ordinary  Account  to  meet

housing  loan  repayments and had to  draw  down  from  their

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (for the Minister for</b>

<b>Manpower):</b> Sir, as at 31st October 1999, 62,469 members had

used CPF savings from their Special Account for their housing

loan  repayments  under  the scheme to  assist  such  members

following   the   10%  point  reduction  in  employer's   CPF

contribution rate.  From December 1998 to October  1999,  HDB

had

also  assisted  a  total of 14,877 mortgagors  to  reschedule

their  mortgage  loan instalments or convert their  loans  to

as  joint-owners to help to settle arrears.  Another 261  HDB

mortgagors  were allowed to settle their mortgage arrears  by

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the percentage of CPF members who has insufficient

funds  in their CPF Ordinary Accounts to meet monthly housing

instalment payments in 1999 is slightly higher than  that  in

1998.  From January 1999 when the CPF cut came into effect to

October  1999, about 5% of CPF members who pay their mortgage

repayments with CPF savings has insufficient funds  in  their

Ordinary Accounts to meet monthly housing loan repayments for

their  HDB and private property, as compared with the average

of  3.6%  in  1998.   However, the 5%  includes  cases  where

members  may  have used their CPF savings for other  purposes

such as insurance and investment.

<div align="center"><b>(Publicity of rationale for policy decisions)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok</b> asked the Minister for

Communications    and   Information   Technology    if    the

Telecommunication Authority of Singapore will make public its

rationale  for  its  policy decisions so as  to  improve  the

development of the communications industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Communications and Information

Technology  (Mr  Yeo  Cheow  Tong):  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,   the

Telecommunication  Authority of  Singapore  (TAS)  has  taken

various  steps  to  publicise the rationale  for  its  policy

decisions.   For example, it has publicly explained  its  key

policy  decisions through press releases.  Policy papers  are

also posted regularly on the TAS web-site.  In addition,  TAS

has  disseminated  such  information  through  its  quarterly

magazine VISTAS, which is freely distributed and is  also  on

the TAS web-site.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAS recognises that the telecommunications industry is

driven  by  rapid  technological  advances  and  changes   in

business   environment.   Industry   consultation   is   thus

important.   In line with this, TAS has recently  launched  a

quarterly info-communications industry forum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such forums enable TAS to obtain views and feedback on

key  evolving  issues  before  policies  are  finalised.   In

addition,   TAS  has  sent  draft  policy  proposals,   where

appropriate,  to key industry players to seek feedback  prior

to   implementation.   This  approach  will  lead   to   more

appropriate  and robust policies, and help the  industry  and

the  public  to  better understand the  basis  and  rationale

behind the policy decisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, in the continuing liberalisation of the

telecommunications  industry, it  is  inevitable  that  tough

decisions  will  have to be made from time  to  time.   These

decisions  may not always be favourable to all the operators.

What  is  important for TAS is to ensure fair and sustainable

competition  within  the  industry,  as  well  as   safeguard

consumer interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, as fair and market-driven competition

develops in the telecommunications industry, TAS will be able

to  regulate  with a lighter touch.   This  will  allow  more

freedom  for  telecommunications operators  to  innovate  and

compete in a liberalised environment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the Minister say

that he is satisfied with the performance of TAS despite  the

comments made by the chiefs of Singapore Telecoms and Pacific

Internet?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, as I have mentioned just now,

tough  decisions  have to be made and inevitably  when  tough

decisions  have to be made, those who benefit  will  be  very

happy,  but  quietly  happy.   While  those  who  have   been

adversely  impacted  will,  of course,  have  to  make  their

objections heard very loudly.  This is what we are seeing.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE MRT LTD AND TRANS-ISLAND BUS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SERVICES LTD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Failure to complete merger)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok</b> asked the Minister for

Communications and Information Technology if he will  explain

the  rationale for the proposed merger between the  Singapore

MRT Ltd and Trans-Island Bus Services Ltd and the reasons for

its failure to complete.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Communications and Information

Technology  (Dr  John Chen Seow Phun) (for the  Minister  for

Communications and Information Technology):  Sir, in the 1996

White  Paper  on  World  Class  Land  Transport  System,  the

Government   had  envisaged  an  excellent,  integrated   and

seamless  public  transport  as a  cornerstone  of  our  land

transport policy. It anticipated the need to expand the rapid

transit system (RTS) and to integrate the network of rail and

bus systems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integration of rail and bus services requires public

transport  operators  to plan for multi-modal  operations  so

that  they provide services for the entire journey,  and  not

just  individual legs of a journey on single modes.   Through

integration  of  rail and bus, multi-modal  public  transport

operators will be able to not only improve their services  to

the commuters, but also optimise resources and reap economies

of  scale  and  synergies in operating across  the  different

transport modes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our view is that the size of our public transport market

will  have  room  for two or more multi-modal  operators  for

better competitive services. The benchmarking and competition

between  two or more multi-modal operators will result  in  a

more efficient public transport industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merger discussions between Singapore MRT Ltd and

Trans-Island Bus Services Ltd to form a multi-modal  operator

were  based  strictly on commercial considerations.  The  two

companies  have announced that they were unable  to  conclude

the  discussions successfully. SMRT has explained that it has

decided  to seek a listing on the Stock Exchange of Singapore

to enable it to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>



establish  the  market  value of its  shares,  and  give  the

company  greater  flexibility  in  future  discussions   with

possible merger partners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On MCIT's part, our policy on promoting multi-modal

transport operations remains unchanged. As both SMRT and TIBS

have  said  that  they will consider all options,  we  should

await their proposals.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, will the Minister clarify the

position?   There seems to be a public perception  that  this

proposed  merger  between  SMRT and  TIBS  is  a  Government-sponsored matter.  As a result of that, there was a run up in

prices and shareholders who bought the shares at $4 have  now

lost  money.   Should the Government not have responded  much

earlier and made the position very clear that this is  not  a

Government-sponsored matter?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, the Government sets the

policy direction and the policy direction for the industry is

that  we  want to promote multi-modal players.  But how  they

form  a multi-modal company is up to the individual companies

to  decide.  So if they had decided not to proceed but to  do

other  things  first,  it  is  purely  based  on  their   own

consideration.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Is the Minister of State saying that

the  Government  has  got nothing to do  with  this  proposed

merger between SMRT and Trans-Island Bus Services Ltd?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> What I am saying is that the

Government  had made known its policy of wanting  to  promote

multi-modal  operations.  It was stated in the  White  Paper,

and  with  the  award of the North-East line to  SBS,  it  is

another indication that this is something we want to do.  But

whether  private and publicly listed companies  can  come  to

terms is beyond our control.

Transport Authority will be implementing a system of  signage

that  will  apply  consistently for the  different  modes  of

public  transport, as part of the move towards the  provision

of integrated multi-modal services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system will use both pictograms and words to denote

the different transport modes. For example, a pictogram of  a

train  and  the words "MRT" will be used at all MRT stations,

regardless of who operates it.

<div align="center"><b>CERTIFICATE OF ENTITLEMENT FOR SMALL CARS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Inderjit Singh</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  and Information Technology  whether  he  will

consider  introducing  Certificate of Entitlement  (COE)  for

small  cars  with  engine capacity of less than  1,000  cubic

centimetres  instead of grouping such cars with  the  COE  of

bigger cars and in this way making small cars more affordable

for those with lower income.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (for the Minister for</b>

<b>Communications and Information Technology):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  COE  categories  for small and medium  sized  cars  were

merged  into  one category, Category A, in April  this  year,

after  a review of the Vehicle Quota System by the Government

Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for Communications, led by  the

GPC  Chairman, Mr Chay Wai Chuen.  The GPC had noted that the

COE quota for the small cars was becoming too small, and that

a  separate  COE  quota for small cars  did  not  necessarily

result in lower COE premiums for small cars compared to other

COE categories. In fact, Category 1



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>



premiums had at times been similar to or more than Category 2

premiums.   It therefore recommended the merger of  the  COEs

for  small  and medium sized cars to form a larger  quota  to

bring  about  more stable COE prices. At the same  time,  car

buyers  will  have greater flexibility in deciding  on  their

choice  of  car models if the COE category covers  a  broader

range of cars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GPC is correct. Merging Category 1 and Category 2

into  Category  A  would  result in a more  efficient  market

without necessarily raising the COE premiums for small  cars.

A  car buyer with a Category A COE will have a greater choice

of  car models to choose from. He may decide to buy a smaller

car  or  a  bigger one, according to his budget. To  cite  an

example,  in  1998  during the economic  downturn,  many  car

buyers,  having an Open Category COE, decided to buy a  small

or  medium  sized  car - 41% used the Open  COE  to  register

Category  1 and Category 2 cars, instead of large and  luxury

cars.  This is the advantage of collapsing COE categories, as

car buyers benefit from having a wider choice over how to use

their COEs to purchase cars according to their affordability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fundamentally, COE premiums are dependent on the demand

for  cars.  This in turn depends on the state of the  economy

and  expectations of future growth. The economic recovery and

lower  financing costs have helped to increase the purchasing

power  of consumers, and this has led to a higher demand  for

cars. This has resulted in a rise in COE prices, despite  the

58%  increase  in the number of COEs from last year  to  this

year.  With the recent economic recovery, COE for this  month

has  bunched  around $43,000 and $44,000 for the Category  A,

Category  B  and the Open Category, despite the existence  of

the different categories.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> By the Minister's argument, there seems

to  be a compelling case to collapse both categories of  cars

from A and B to even one single category.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, there is no plan at the

moment to do that, but if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>



the  Member  feels  that we should do it,  let  him  write  a

proposal to the Ministry and we will consider it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact, I mentioned

during the Budget discussion that I support a single category

for all cars.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> All right, we will take that

into  consideration the next time when we review the  Vehicle

Quota System.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Would the Minister

elaborate,  since  the  introduction  of  Category  A,   what

proportion of the COE entitlements have been used for cars of

1,000  cc  or  less?   And  how does that  compare  with  the

allocation under Category 1 previously?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> The Member has asked for some

figures.   As  far  as  I  know, the  number  of  small  cars

registered  has dropped.  This was because of the competition

between the small car dealers and the big car dealers.   That

is  why the new policy is correct.  Under the old policy, the

small  car dealers were in a way protected.  With this change

in  policy,  I  have  received feedback from  the  small  car

dealers  that  they now have to compete with  the  big  cars,

because the big cars are not necessarily more expensive  than

small  cars.  In fact, data have shown that some of  the  big

cars  are  cheaper than the small cars.  Because  of  greater

competition,  I think the motorists benefit.  To  answer  the

Member's  question,  there is, in fact, a  reduction  in  the

registration  of  small cars but that is due  to  the  keener

competition between the dealers.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Given the

collapsing  of the categories into Category A and  that  more

people now buy bigger cars, would it not be true to say  that

it   would   not  really  be  consistent  with   the   energy

conservation policy in Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> As I said, it depends on

competition.  So if the small car suppliers and manufacturers

can  come  out with better and cheaper cars, I  am  sure  the

buyer will take a close look.  As for energy conservation,  I

do not think that is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



a  problem because nowadays cars are very efficient  and  the

difference is not much between the small cars and those above

1,000 cc.

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> If I understand the Minister correctly, he

is  saying  that  the  number of small  cars  registered  has

declined because of the inability of the small car dealers to

compete  but, on average, if competition is on the  basis  of

price, then one would argue that that should not be the case.

Could  the  Minister elaborate what in practice,  other  than

price,  have  affected the ability of small  car  dealers  to

compete in the sale of cars in the market?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Of course, price is definitely a

factor, besides the value that they perceive that they  would

get.   What I am saying is that the buyers now have a greater

choice.   In  the past, when he was eyeing for a  Category  2

car, and if he could not get the COE, either he brings up his

premium  or if he does not want to bring up his premium,  but

he  still  wants to own a car, he would be forced  to  go  to

Category 1 to bid for the COE and buy a small car.  With  the

merger, this restriction is no longer there.  It is up to the

individual.  He can still buy a small car if he wants to.  Or

if  he  feels that he can pay a few more dollars  and  buy  a

bigger car, and he feels that gives him greater value, so  be

it.   So  my point is that the merger removes this artificial

restriction  and allows the market to decide what  cars  they

want  to  buy.   From experience, as far as COE premiums  are

concerned, we do not think that because of the merger,  small

cars  will  have  to  pay  a  significantly  higher  premium.

Basically, if I want to buy a small car, I could bid for  the

COE  and buy a small car without much increase in price.   So

that is the position.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Would the Minister of

State  consider tax rebates for small car owners who bid  for

the COEs, to ameliorate some of their problems?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Why do we give rebates to them?

We  had  already restructured the vehicle tax last year.   We

had rationalised it, put in a very rational basis for all the

tax  structure including progressivity.  Smaller  cars  today

pay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>



lower road tax compared to bigger cars.  So we think that the

balance is about right.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, given that the

premiums  have risen quite a lot since the economy  improves,

would  the Minister consider a recomputation of the  premiums

payable on 1,000 cc cars, so that those who cannot afford  to

buy  a new car, be it big or small, pay the lower rate so  as

to keep their old cars?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> If the Member is talking about

re-validation  of their COEs after 10 years, the  formula  is

that  they  would  have to pay the prevailing  quota  premium

which  is computed by averaging the last three months of  COE

premiums.  As I said, between the old and new system,  we  do

not  think  that  there is much difference  between  the  COE

premium for small cars if we had not merged.  So there is  no

reason  why  they should have special treatment, because  the

idea  of the PQP is that one should pay the prevailing  quota

premium;  in  other  words, the quota premium  that  new  car

buyers  are  prepared  to pay.  That  is  the  objective  and

principle.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> The economic

consideration is obviously true.  But does it mean  that  the

people,  who  are  poorer and who can only afford  the  small

cars, do not deserve to have a say in buying a car?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, the whole idea of the COE

system  is  to  put in place a rational system  where  people

would be prepared to pay what the market decides.  Therefore,

under  the  system, there will always be people who  are  not

able  to  obtain a COE, because the number of COEs is  fixed.

The people who cannot afford it, in the end, cannot obtain  a

COE and they will have to try harder the next time.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> May I ask the Minister,

as   a  result  of  merger  of  those  categories,  how  much

additional  revenue  the  Government has  collected,  because

small cars are no longer being registered?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are a

lot of factors that are changing, economic factors being one.

But  let  me  give him a theoretical answer.   Assuming  that

nothing  changes, everything remains the same,  I  would  say

that the Government actually collects less because our system

is  a  Dutch  system where the Government only  collects  the

lowest successful bid from all successful bidders.  So  if  I

were to split one category into two categories, you will find

that  Government  actually collects more, because  successful

bidders  in the higher category are paying more than if  they

were merged into one category.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> In other words, the Minister is

saying  that  if we merge all the categories  into  one,  the

Government would collect less revenue, as I understand it.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> That is why Mr Chng Hee Kok

supported the merger into one category.  But let me say  that

the  primary  objective of the COE system is not  to  collect

revenue.  There is a transport management objective to ensure

that  there  is  ownership  restraint.   That  is  the  basic

objective.  We then let the market decide what price they are

prepared  to  pay,  and  at  the same  time  we  fulfill  our

objective  of  controlling the number of cars,  so  that  our

roads would not be clogged up.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It is heartening to hear the Minister of

State  say  that  the  Certificate  of  Entitlement  was  not

introduced for the purpose of collecting revenue.  May I  ask

him  whether all this that has been in operation,  I  do  not

know  how many years, has succeeded in any significant  level

in reducing the cars on the roads?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, I do not know what

question is that.  Cars cannot go on the road if they do  not

have the COE, and the COE number is fixed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Your objective is less cars on the

roads.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Of course.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> By how much have you succeeded?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> No. The objective of the COE

system  is not to reduce the number of cars on the road.   It

is  to control the growth.  That is right.  We have fixed the

growth of vehicles at 3% per year, and because the number  of

COE  is fixed according to that growth figure, therefore  the

control is precise.

<div align="center"><b>INSURANCE COMPANIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Competition)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Dr Ker Sin Tze</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether  insurance companies should be encouraged to  compete

with each other in terms of lower premiums and better service

instead  of  allowing banks and finance  companies  to  force

their  mortgagors to take insurance coverage from  their  own

related insurance companies.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this will be a

short answer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect their interests as lenders, banks and finance

companies require that properties financed by their loans  be

properly  insured.   Some banks and finance  companies  which

have related insurance companies package their mortgage loans

with  a  built-in fire insurance component provided by  these

related  insurers.  As a marketing incentive, these  packages

often  include free insurance coverage for the first  one  or

two  years of the loan period.  The banks find that using the

same  related insurance company is a convenient way for  them

to  monitor  the  adequacy and continuity  of  the  insurance

coverage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market for mortgage loans is a competitive one, with

many  participants.   Consumers  can  choose  which  bank  or

finance company to borrow from, based on the overall terms of

the  mortgage loans on offer, and the quality of the service.

If they are not satisfied with the insurance coverage bundled

with  the  loan, they can instead borrow from other  lenders,

including those with no related insurance companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is desirable for consumers to have the flexibility to

choose an alternative insurer when they contract a loan,  and

forgo the benefits offered had they chosen a bank's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



related insurer.  They should also be able to switch insurers

for  subsequent  renewals  of  their  policies.   Most  banks

require customers to seek their approval for this, to  ensure

that  the  terms and standing of the alternative insurer  are

satisfactory.   However,  approvals are  not  always  granted

readily,  and the terms and conditions under which  consumers

can switch insurers are often not clear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS will therefore ask the relevant industry bodies,

namely,  the  Association of Banks in Singapore, the  Finance

Houses  Association of Singapore, and the  General  Insurance

Association of Singapore, to review the present arrangements,

and  if  necessary,  develop practice  guidelines.   The  aim

should  be to preserve consumers' freedom to choose insurers,

and  set out fair and transparent terms under which consumers

can  switch to alternative insurers.  At the same  time,  the

guidelines  should  enable  banks  to  cross-sell   insurance

products  efficiently, and ensure that their  mortgage  loans

have adequate insurance coverage.

<div align="center"><b>STORED-VALUE CARDS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Expiry date and refund of monies)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister (a) whether it is proper practice for the issuers of

stored-value  cards to claim administrative difficulty  as  a

reason  why their cards must expire after a certain time  and

all  the  money remaining therein unusable by the  cardholder

from that expiry date; (b) whether he will introduce measures

or  legislation (i) allowing the cardholder to claim a refund

of  the  monies; and (ii) obliging the card issuer to forward

monies  remaining  in  the  card,  of  which  the  owner   is

untraceable,  and  the interest earned, to the  state  rather

than keep it for the card issuer's own use.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, currently a host

of  proprietary stored value cards are in use.   These  cards

can  be  broadly categorised as single purpose  stored  value

cards  or  multi-purpose stored value  cards.   There  is  no

uniform practice with regard to the validity period of  these

cards or the treatment of unused



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



balances.  The decision to impose an expiry life on cards  is

based  entirely  on commercial and practical  considerations,

for  example  the  physical wear and tear or obsolescence  of

these  cards.  For security reasons, stored value cards  such

as  those  embedded  with smart chips are typically  designed

with  a  definite  life  span.  This  is  because  access  to

"electronic   purses"  on  these  cards  is   controlled   by

cryptographic  keys  which, through  time  and  technological

advancement, may be duplicated, compromising the security  of

the  smart  card.   Limiting the duration  of  a  card's  use

reduces  the  possibility  of a security  breach.   In  these

respects, stored value cards are similar to prepaid  vouchers

with validity periods.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current legislative framework, MAS has

responsibility  over  the  issuance of  multi-purpose  stored

value cards (for example, the popular CashCards), but not for

single purpose stored value cards.  MAS views monetary values

in  these  pre-paid stored value cards or any unused balances

on  these  cards  no  different from deposits.   MAS  expects

issuers  to make every effort to identify and repay  deposits

of  the  card  or account holder.  Although expiry  of  these

CashCards  effectively  means that they  will  no  longer  be

accepted  at  points-of-sale,  in  other  words,  cardholders

cannot   effect  purchases  using  the  stored  value  cards,

cardholders can nevertheless redeem unused balances on  their

expired CashCards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the treatment of single-purpose

stored value cards such as TransitLink farecards is based  on

commercial considerations and differs among the various  card

issuers.   The  Ministry  of Communications  and  Information

Technology is aware that consumers have raised various issues

concerning TransitLink farecards, and is looking into them.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, my question

is  not  so much on the validity of the card because of  wear

and tear, but this question arises because of statements made

by a certain issuer recently about the card's validity.  They

said that it expires



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



after  a certain number of years, and whatever money is  left

inside is no longer traceable because the database is not  on

line, and therefore they do not know who owns the money,  and

therefore they cannot give back the money.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> If the Member will tell us which

card issuer he is referring to, we will look into the matter.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, the card issuer is

TransitLink,  and they have said that after three  years  the

money  is untraceable and therefore they cannot give it  back

to  you.  If that is the case, if it is untraceable, then  it

is a bone of contention, meaning it is property of the State,

and  it should go to the State, and not enrich the issuer who

cannot trace the money.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I have no doubt they can improve

their  tracing capabilities and MCIT would discuss with  them

to see how this can be done.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Information and the Arts (Mr Lee Yock</b>

completion  of cable rollout recently, the overall  rate  has

increased  to 21% (or 196,000 households) as at 31st  October

<div align="center"><b>MANAGING THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, exactly, one year

ago,  I  informed  the House of the Government's  package  of

economic  measures to counter the regional crisis.  The  mood

was  heavy.  The region was in turmoil, and global  financial

markets  were  nervous.  Retrenchments were  rising,  and  we

braced ourselves for severe turbulence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $10.5 billion package was a decisive move to reduce

business costs, build confidence, and help companies to  tide

over the very difficult period.  It included significant wage

and CPF cuts, and enjoyed the full support of the Government,

workers   and  employers.   Our  response  demonstrated   our

determination to ride out the storm, and bolstered confidence

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, a year later, the mood has totally changed. Things

have  turned  out  much better than we  feared.   Except  for

Indonesia's problems with Aceh, the worst of the Asian crisis

is  behind  us.   Throughout the region exchange  rates  have

firmed, interest rates have come



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



down,  confidence has returned, and growth is resuming.   Our

own  economy  has  picked up sharply, boosted  by  our  cost-cutting measures and the regional recovery.  We expect  about

5% growth this year, and between 4.5% and 6.5% next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our challenge now is to manage the recovery, to restore

the economy to full health without mishap.  Growth has become

broader  based  and unemployment is down.   But  the  economy

still  has some weak patches.  We must be especially  careful

with the manufacturing sector, as several industries continue

to  face  severe  cost pressure, including  disk  drives  and

petroleum  refining.   At  the same  time,  restructuring  is

continuing,  and is causing a steady stream of retrenchments.

We  must  redouble  efforts to help these retrenched  workers

find new jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of these developments, the Government has

reviewed  its economic stance, and particularly the  measures

in  last  year's  cost reduction package.  In  general,  last

year's  package  will  continue as committed.   However,  the

tightening  labour  market has made  it  necessary  to  bring

forward  the restoration of employer CPF contribution  rates.

The improved economic outlook also justifies a higher quantum

of  year-end  bonus for civil servants, and a restoration  of

the  wage cuts imposed on civil servants.  We need to  adjust

the  Skills Development Levy, as skills upgrading is critical

to  keeping  workers employable.  In key  areas  of  business

costs,  namely, industrial land rentals and port and  airport

dues, we will extend the rebates for an additional year.



<br><br><i>CPF</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first take the CPF. The Government has explained

the need to bring forward the restoration of CPF contribution

rates  to  next year, instead of 2001 as originally  planned.

The  labour market is tightening.  And unless we do this, the

CPF  reduction  will  simply  be  converted  to  higher  wage

settlements.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



And this will make it harder to restore the CPF contributions

later on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employer's CPF contribution rate will therefore be

increased  by 2% points to 12%, with effect from April  2000.

This  2%  point restoration will be allocated  fully  to  the

Special Account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's intention is to restore employer's CPF

contributions  fully to 20%, the rate which prevailed  before

the cut.  The reduction to 10% last year was a temporary move

to  deal  with  an immediate crisis.  It did not  affect  the

desired  long-term contribution rate of 20% plus  20%,  which

had  been  calculated to provide enough savings for  workers'

health care and old age needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restoration of the CPF rate will be done as soon as

possible at a pace which the economy can bear.  If conditions

are  favourable, we should be able to restore it fully within

about  five  years.  Our priority will be  to  build  up  the

Special  Account first, as this is the absolute minimum  nest

egg which all Singaporeans should have when they retire.



<br><br><i>Civil Service NWC Award</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the civil service. With the recovery in the

economy,  the Government has decided to increase the  quantum

of year-end bonus to civil servants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, civil servants received a total of 3/4 month

of AVC (Annual Variable Component): 1/2 month in July and 1/4

month in December.  And this was 1 1/4 month less than the two-month worth of AVC which they had been paid in 1997, the year

before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the Government has already paid 1/2 month of

AVC  in  July.   In December, the Government will  pay  civil

servants another 1/2 month of AVC.  This makes a total of one

month  of  AVC for the year as a whole, 1/4 month  more  than

last  year.  The Government will, as usual, also pay the  one

month of Annual Wage Supplement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, because the economic outlook has improved

significantly since the NWC recommendations were published



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



in  May,  the  Government will pay civil servants  a  one-off

Special Bonus of 1/4 month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the AVC and Special Bonus together, civil

servants will receive 11/4 months this year, still less  than

the  two  months of AVC which they were receiving before  the

crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the longer term, the civil service is studying ways

to  link  pay  more closely to performance.  If  the  economy

remains strong next year, and there is an NWC award for civil

servants, I stress "if", the Government will use part or  all

of this to begin to build up a performance-based annual bonus

for  all  civil servants.  Concurrently, the Government  also

intends  to  continue to build up the AVC  in  future  years,

whenever  economic performance justifies it.  The  Government

will  discuss  the implementation of these changes  with  the

unions in due course.



<br><br><i>Restoration of Cuts/Freeze in Civil Service Salaries</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of last year's package, the Government took the

lead  in  implementing  wage  cuts  for  civil  servants  and

political  appointments.  Monthly salaries  of  Staff  Grade,

Superscale, Division I and Division II officers were  cut  by

5%, 3%, 2% and 1% points respectively on 1st January 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will fully restore these wage cuts with

effect from 1st January 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the wage cuts, the salaries of Ministers and

senior  civil servants, which are normally pegged to  private

sector earnings, were frozen in 1998 and 1999.  However,  the

private sector benchmark increased by 13% in 1998 and 29%  in

1999, based on private sector earnings two years earlier,  in

other  words,  earnings in 1996 and 1997  respectively.   The

figures  for next year's benchmark are not yet complete,  but

IRAS  estimates that it has increased further,  because  some

partnerships  and  companies continued to do  well  in  1998,

despite the economic crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the economy is recovering, we must restore the

proper relativity between



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



private  and public sector salaries.  This is crucial  if  we

are  to  retain  and  attract talent, and maintain  the  high

quality of our public service and Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Service Division is currently reviewing the

salary  formula for Ministers and senior civil  servants  set

out  in  the  1994 White Paper on "Competitive  Salaries  for

Competent and Honest Government".  The White Paper had called

for such a review after five years.  PSD's conclusion is that

the  basic  framework  is sound, and  the  salary  benchmarks

selected  are  appropriate.   However,  we  can  refine   the

methodology  for calculating the benchmarks and  shorten  the

delay  in  applying the benchmarks to the public sector.   We

also  need to review the structure of civil service  salaries

to  create  more  flexibility, and  increase  the  weight  of

performance bonuses in the total salary package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSD is still working out the details. The review should

be  completed  and the changes announced and  implemented  by

early next year.



<br><br><i>Private Sector Salaries</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's approach to civil service salaries and

bonuses is consistent with the NWC recommendations.  In  May,

the  NWC  had  recommended continued  wage  restraint,  while

providing companies that perform well greater flexibility  to

reward  their  workers.   The NWC set  guidelines  for  these

companies   to  reward  workers  through  bonuses   or   wage

increases,  preferably  in the form  of  a  monthly  variable

component.  Because of the economic recovery, more  companies

will  now  fall into this category (ie, companies  which  are

doing well) but the NWC guidelines for how they should reward

workers remain valid.



<br><br><i>Skills Development Levy</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training and retraining is vital to keep our workers

employable,  and  to  enable us  to  compete  globally  as  a

knowledge  economy.   Singaporeans must  continually  upgrade

their skills and embrace life-long learning.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Skills Development Fund (SDF) has been effective in

encouraging employers to invest in worker training and skills

upgrading.    Set  up  in  1979,  the  SDF  is  funded   from

collections in the Skills Development Levy (SDL) on employers

for workers below a monthly salary of $1,000.  Today, the SDF

supports  over 560,000 training places per year, the majority

taken up by workers with 'A' levels or below.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While training commitments from the SDF have grown

substantially over the years, collections from the  SDL  have

fallen.  In FY98, the SDF committed more than $88 million  in

training grants but the levy collection was only $20 million.

This  is because as wages rise, the number of workers earning

less  than $1,000 shrinks.  The base of the SDL has thus been

declining  -  from  about 800,000 workers in  1980  to  about

350,000  workers currently.  This is even though the size  of

the  overall  workforce  has doubled  and  more  higher  paid

workers need training.  This is not sustainable or equitable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the SDF to continue to play its role in worker

training  and  skills  upgrading, the  SDF  levy  has  to  be

adjusted.   This  can be done either by increasing  the  levy

rate, or by raising the salary cut-off below which the SDL is

collected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has decided to keep the levy rate

unchanged  at  1%,  but  to progressively  raise  the  salary

ceiling  for  SDL  contributions from the current  $1,000  to

$2,000  over the next five years to 2004.  The first increase

from  $1,000  to  $1,500 will take effect on 1st  July  2000.

This  will  expand the base of the SDL collection  to  around

670,000  workers,  in other words, almost double  the  number

paying  today, and increase the SDL collection by $28 million

a year, to $48 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SDL salary ceiling will subsequently be raised to

$1,800  in  2002  and to $2,000 in 2004.   Beyond  2004,  the

Government  will revise the ceiling regularly to keep  it  in

line with wage levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies should not treat higher SDL contributions as

an additional cost



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>



burden,  as  they can redeem these contributions by  training

their workers.  They should instead look upon them as part of

their essential investment in human capital.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wage and CPF reduction for local workers last year

was  complemented by a reduction in the foreign worker  levy.

This was to assist companies, especially manufacturers, which

depend  heavily  on foreign workers.  Hence,  the  Government

reduced the monthly levy for skilled foreign workers  by  $70

for  all sectors in January this year. The levy for unskilled

foreign workers in the manufacturing and services sector  was

also cut by $90.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign worker levy reduction has helped to lower

overall  business  costs  in  Singapore.   Despite  the  levy

reduction,  there has been no surge in the number of  foreign

workers,  while the number of Singaporeans in  the  workforce

has  gone  up.  The Government will therefore  leave  foreign

worker levy rates unchanged for another year.



<br><br><i>Industrial land - JTC and HDB rentals</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year, as part of the cost-cutting

package,  JTC reduced its posted rentals for industrial  land

and  flatted and standard factories back to the levels of the

early 1990s. This translated to a 20-40% rental reduction for

lessees  and  tenants who are paying above the posted  rates.

Those  on  the 4% or 5.5% rental escalation scheme were  also

granted a 2-year freeze on their rental escalation to the end

of  December  2000.  JTC lessees paying below  their  revised

posted  rates were granted an extension of rental rebates  up

to the end of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognising the need to continue to be careful over

costs  for  the  manufacturing sector, JTC  will  extend  the

current  industrial  rental  rebates  for  another  year   to

December 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will similarly extend their rental rebates for

lessees  of  industrial land and tenants  of  commercial  and

industrial  properties for another year until December  2000.

Tenants  of HDB commercial and industrial properties who  are

paying above posted rates will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



continue  to receive rent rebates, but subject to  a  cap  of

10%, instead of the previous 20%.



<br><br><i>Transport - MPA and CAAS fees</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sea and air transportation are important complements to

the manufacturing sector and have a significant impact on our

export  competitiveness.  Hence, the Government  will  extend

cost rebates and concessions in these two sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) will extend the

20%  port  dues  concession for container ships  and  harbour

craft  for another year until December 2000.  PSA Corporation

will  extend  the 10% rebate on lift-on/lift-off charges  and

wharf  handling, as well as the 10% rebate on  warehouse  and

office  rentals,  for  another  year  until  December   2000.

Similarly,  the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore  (CAAS)

will extend the 10% rebate on landing fees for aircraft until

December 2000. CAAS will also extend the rebate on warehouse,

office and retail shop rentals until December 2000.



<br><br><i>Financial impact</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two percentage point restoration of the employer's

CPF  contribution rate will cost employers $741  million  per

year,  while the increase in the SDL ceiling from  $1,000  to

$1,500  will cost $28 million per year. These will be  offset

by  industrial  land  and  transport rebates  totalling  $237

million  per  year.   However,  employers  will  still  enjoy

substantial  cost  savings,  compared  to  before  the   cost

reduction package, because we are only restoring 2% points of

the  10%  point reduction in the employer's CPF  contribution

rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government remains mindful of the need to maintain

cost  competitiveness even as the economy picks up.  However,

we  cannot freeze all charges and fees indefinitely,  without

accumulating distortions that will harm our economy.  Charges

and  fees  have  to be revised from time to time  to  reflect

rising costs.  But the Government will exercise moderation in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



doing so and it will ensure that the cumulative burden on the

economy and on households is not excessive.



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last two years have been a major challenge for

Singapore.  It is still too early to declare victory, but  so

far  we  have come through without major mishap. We benefited

from   the  strong  foundation  of  sound  policies   pursued

consistently over many years, as well as our prompt, rational

and cohesive response to a very grave situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restoration of the CPF contribution rate, the civil

service  bonus award and salary restoration, the increase  in

the  SDL,  and the continuation of the rebates on  industrial

rentals  and  sea and air transport will help to position  us

for  this phase of recovery.  While we are confident  of  the

future, we must never become complacent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-crisis, we do not expect to resume high growth

effortlessly.   While  Asia  has  been  busy  with  immediate

problems,  globalisation  and technology  have  continued  to

progress  apace.   We  must keep up with  these  trends,  and

continually   adjust   our   policies   to   meet    changing

circumstances.   Only thus can we stay  ahead  of  the  game,

strengthen  our  competitiveness  and  secure  our  long-term

growth and prosperity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a summary (Cols. 505-6) of the

measures which I will ask the Clerk to distribute to Members.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome the

Government's  move.   I would like to ask  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister whether we are now on track to achieving a long-term

economic growth of 4-6%.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> Sir, the labour movement

has  supported  the cost-cutting measures.  We  believe  that

such  collective efforts help to save jobs for  our  workers.

As  DPM  has just mentioned, it is too early now  for  us  to

declare victory and, in fact, we know that the recovery is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



uneven.   Some of our sectors will still have a wage  freeze,

for  instance, the cement industry and so on. May I  ask  the

Minister:  is  it the right time to have such  a  big  salary

adjustment, that is, the 13% and 29% increase for  top  civil

servants and political appointees?

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, last year when the

Government introduced the economic stimulus measures, it  was

felt  that  some of them, particularly the lumpy pump-priming

type  of  measures, would take effect over a two-year period.

I  would  like  to ask the Deputy Prime Minister,  since  the

recovery  at this point appears to be driven more by external

demand,  whether  we envisage greater cost pressures  in  the

year   ahead   from  the  follow-through   effects   of   the

Government's stimulus measures.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, may I ask whether it is true or not

that  the  unemployment  figures  have  gone  up  over  June.

Secondly, as I understand from the Deputy Prime Minister,  we

are not completely out of the wood but we are well on the way

perhaps.   Echoing  the question that was  asked  by  another

Member, why is

the  Government in a hurry to reward the top civil  servants,

and  I  take it that Ministers are also going to be rewarded,

when the economy has not fully recovered?

Thirdly, does the Government appreciate the message that  all

these  increases may be sending to the workers in the private

sector?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central):</b> Sir, the Government

has kept faith with workers by restoring the CPF contribution

rate  and  an  increase  in bonus for  civil  servants.   Our

workers  supported  the cost-cutting  measures  to  help  the

economy  to turn around.  From the DPM's statement,  I  guess

that the Ministers and top civil servants will receive a  big

pay rise.  Could DPM enlighten us on this?

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in the past

package,  many  of  the  costs that were  to  be  saved  were

potential. Do we have an assessment of how much was  actually

saved in the period that the measures have been in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



force?  Secondly,  in  announcing  the  earlier  package   of

measures,  there was a lot of consideration of  the  external

cost  factors  and competitiveness. Do we have an  indication

now  whether other countries' costs have also risen and  that

it  is  safe for us now to increase our costs?  Thirdly,  the

Deputy  Prime  Minister has mentioned  that  certain  sectors

remain weak and there are restructuring and retrenchments  in

some.   However,  the  measures he proposes  are  across  the

board.   Will there be any undue effects on the sectors  that

remain weak and are experiencing retrenchments?

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I am sure that the

workers  are  very happy that the Government has  decided  to

restore the CPF contribution of the employers one year  ahead

of time. While the five-year timeframe for restoration of the

CPF   contribution  is  an  achievable  target,   would   the

Government plan to shorten the restoration period should  the

economy perform better than expected?

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, I just like to touch on the CPF

restoration.   Will the full restoration be done  within  the

five  years or is there a possibility of reducing  the  total

40% to any lower level?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may take all

the questions together.  Mr Chng Hee Kok asked whether we are

on  track to make 4-6% growth.  The answer is yes. The  storm

is  not  over yet because we still have to see how the region

recovers,  particularly Indonesia, where there are  political

complications which may take sometime to work out.  Also, our

own  internal  restructuring is  continuing.   While  we  are

making  the growth, there is restructuring, people are  being

retrenched,   industries  are  being  phased  out   and   new

industries are coming in.  So we have to continue to make the

effort,  to  be  able to manage this turnover  and  make  the

growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do well and continue to make 4-6% growth year

after  year, then as I have said, we should be able to  fully

restore the CPF contribution rate in about five years to 40%.

Of  course, once I have said that, MPs have asked whether  we

cannot do it even faster.  Let us not count



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



our  chickens because the eggs have not hatched yet.  If  all

goes well and we can do about 2% restoration a year, then  in

five  years,  we will get back to 40%.  But  if  there  is  a

setback, we may be unable to restore.  We may have to restore

1%  or  1/2%.   On  the  other hand, if we  do  exceptionally

strongly,  we  might be able to get away with 3%  in  a  good

year.  Let us put that as something to prepare our minds  but

not  a  hard target that we definitely will hit.  You  cannot

tell.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran asked about cost pressures from the stimuli.

Most  of  the  stimuli  are  in  terms  of  spending  by  the

Government in infrastructure, meaning schools, MRT,  airport,

roads  and  so  on.   As  Members will know,  right  now  the

construction  sector  is  still  in  recession.   Volume   is

considerably smaller than last year. Building programmes have

come  down, and there is a slack capacity.  It is a good time

for us to invest in infrastructure, including reclamation.  I

do  not  believe that it will cause prices to go up or  cause

any tightness in the construction industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked a series of questions. Firstly,

potential  versus actual savings.  Most of our  package  were

actual savings because it was statutory like the CPF cuts and

Government  charges.  The only one which  was  potential  was

adjustment  to  bonuses  in  the  private  sector  which   we

projected  would  have  accounted  for  about  half  of   the

reduction of 15% in wage cost last year.  My guess is that it

probably accounted for somewhat less than that because as the

economy  recovered, the pressure on companies to cut back  on

bonuses and for workers to settle for less diminished.  I  do

not  have the number but my feeling is probably we might have

made  3% or 4%, rather than 7% or 8%, as we were hoping  for.

But the CPF cuts, the Government rebates, the rental rebates,

all those are actual.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for external comparison with other countries, if you

look   at  the  nominal  exchange  rates  of  Thailand,  even

Indonesia  and Korea, they have strengthened.  In so  far  as

the  nominal  exchange rates reflect the cost  to  exporters,

because they are exporting in US$ but their costs are in  Won

or in Baht,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



then  this means that their costs would not have gone up very

sharply  but would have firmed.  Their internal costs  within

their countries, I believe, have been stable. Their inflation

has   been   stable  because  they  are  in  the  throes   of

restructuring  and unemployment is still quite  high.   So  I

would not say that their costs have gone up sharply, which is

why  we  have  to  watch our costs too.  In  a  tight  labour

market,  wages will settle for higher than last year but,  at

the  same  time,  we  have to try and ensure  that  the  wage

settlements  are  justified by productivity improvements,  so

that  while we pay people more, they are also producing  more

and,  overall,  the  companies are  able  to  maintain  their

competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards weak sectors versus across-the-board

measures,  although the CPF adjustment is across  the  board,

the  focus  of  our  continuing rebates on  industrial  land,

flatted  and  standard factories, as well as the  rebates  on

port  and airport dues, is more on the manufacturing  sector.

The  reason is because many of the weak industries are in the

manufacturing  sector,  either weak  because  of  costs  like

petrochemicals and petroleum, or weak because they are in the

process  of  restructuring,  like  disk  drives  or  computer

manufacturing.  So we have tried to make an effort  to  focus

on the manufacturing sector.  Beyond that, it is not possible

and  I  do  not think it is desirable for us specifically  to

direct   rebates  or  Government  assistance  to   particular

industries, because it is really for the market to  sort  out

which  industries do well in Singapore and which do not.   We

will  make  sure  that  there is a  manufacturing  sector  in

Singapore,  but  which particular industry, that  depends  on

supply and demand and on our cost structure.  What we can  do

is  to  help  the  industries which are  in  the  process  of

restructuring  to make the transition and help  the  workers,

who  are  being phased out by one industry, find new jobs  in

another industry, and that we will continue to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the questions by Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Mr Ong Ah

Heng  and Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam on wage freeze and salaries  for

the  public  sector.  I gave Members numbers just  now  which

showed that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



private sector benchmark which the Government is supposed  to

follow  went  up 13% in 1998 and 29% in 1999.  And  this  was

based  on  private sector earnings two years before,  because

there are lags in the way we calculate.  Actually, this meant

that  private sector earnings went up 13% in 1996, calculated

in  1997,  and  applied in 1998.  It went  up  29%  in  1997,

calculated in 1998 and to be applied in 1999.  And  1996  and

1997  were not bad years for the economy.  If we had followed

the  formula, we should have just applied this to  the  civil

servants,  as we applied the earlier reductions in 1997  when

the private sector went down 7% and we followed them down 7%.

So if you go down, you go up again.  But because we could see

difficulty coming up over the horizon, so in 1998  and  1999,

we froze the adjustment and let the private sector go its own

way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the economy is recovering. For the year 2000, the

adjustment  for next year  - we do not have the data  yet   - we  think that the figure has gone up compared to last  year.

And  the reason is that even though the economy, as a  whole,

was  not  doing well, there were companies which  were  doing

well.   Many foreign banks were doing all right.  Many multi-nationals  had  chief  executives who had  stock  options   - these are stock options of MNCs on the American market  -  so

they  were  worth  something and benefited the  CEOs.   Other

professions  like the lawyers or the accountants,  which  are

not  salary-based  but are fee-based  -  they  get  a  profit

share  from their business  -  their services were in  demand

and  so  their  earnings went up.  And so  our  benchmark  is

likely to go up again next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is what do we do? If we were to apply the

formula rigidly, we would simply multiply and apply.  I think

that  would be the wrong thing to do, because it is  quite  a

significant  adjustment, and we should take this  opportunity

to free up our public sector salaries further.  Presently, we

rely  too  much  on fixed salaries without  enough  room  for

adjustment within a grade, and also without enough weight  on

the performance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



element of the overall salary package.  We have built up  the

performance  element over the years.  It is  now  up  to  six

months  out of the 20-month total package for the  year,  but

that  is  quite  small compared to what you can  get  in  the

private  sector.  Because in the private sector,  in  a  good

year,  you  can go to 12 months, sometimes even 18 months  in

some  industries.  And then next year, if it is no good,  you

come  down  again.   Or  next year your responsibilities  are

lighter,   you  come  down  again.   We  do  not  have   that

flexibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, in the private sector, you do not have a person at

a  single grade at a single point.  You have a person in  the

rank and his pay can vary from X to Y, and he might get a pay

adjustment without getting a rank upgrade promotion.  And  it

gives  you some flexibility to reward individuals  in  a  way

which  fits the organisation and which fits what he deserves.

Whereas in the civil service, you cannot.  If I want  to  pay

somebody more, I have to promote him, and similarly with  the

Ministers  or the Parliamentary Secretaries, and  this  is  a

rigidity.  So we have got to find some way to make this  more

flexible  and to build up the performance bonus for the  top,

just  as  we  are intending to introduce a performance  bonus

across  the  board,  even  for all  civil  servants.   It  is

something which we are studying and which we hope to work out

by the beginning of next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have said that we will no longer be freezing the

civil  service  salaries.  How we make the  adjustment,  what

form  we  will  evolve to and how quickly we  get  there  are

things  which we have to consider.  We may take  one  or  two

years  to get there, but I think it would be the wrong  thing

for us to say we do not do anything and we freeze it, because

we  are  going to lose good officers.  It has happened before

and  we  are  already beginning to notice  this  because  the

opportunities  are  in  the private  sector.   You  can  say,

"Tighten  your belts."  He says, "I will go the other  side."

So  we have to be realistic.  We have had a system which  has

worked  and  which has got us through quite  a  major  crisis

without  an accident.  I think we had better look to  improve

and strengthen the system.  We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



will  work  out  the  schemes and  the  sums,  and  a  proper

statement will be made in due course.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Deputy Prime

Minister  a  few questions.  First, with these  changes,  how

much  inflation  is likely to be generated?  Second,  whether

the Government charges and fees would be revised in the light

of  all  these changes that are being planned?   Third,  what

concrete plans would be undertaken by the Government to  help

older workers who are less skilled and untrained?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Deputy

Prime  Minister to answer the questions that I asked earlier?

One  of them was:  is it or is it not true that  unemployment

has  risen over the last two months?  Secondly  -  I made  it

as  a  passing reference  -  are Ministers going to  be  paid

this  bonus  and  annual wage supplement, besides  top  civil

servants and Members of this House?  And I asked why  are  we

in  such a  hurry, and will it not send the wrong message  to

those in the private sector?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first respond

to   Mr   J  B  Jeyaretnam's  question  which  I  overlooked.

Unemployment is now 4%, slightly higher than what it  was  in

June, but lower than 4.4% in December 1998.  I do not believe

this  rise is significant, from all the accounts.  The labour

market is tightening.  If you ask me what it could mean,  one

possibility  is  that it is some indication of  a  structural

problem we have to address and which we are addressing, which

Dr   Vasoo  raised,  of  older  workers  who  may  be  having

difficulties  finding new jobs and for whom we must  make  an

exceptional effort to help to find new jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo asked what efforts are we making. We have the

Manpower  21 programme.  We are introducing training schemes.

We  are  linking  up  with the ITEs,  polytechnics  and   the

training institutes to work out programmes which are tailored

to the older workers, and to present them in a way which will

fit  them.  And also to break them up into small modules,  so

that you can do it one piece at a time, master



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



that,  collect a boys' scout badge, go on, get another badge,

and  finally you become a President's scout, or you get a new

job.  I think that is a practical approach.  There is no easy

way to do this, because for somebody who is in his 40s or 50s

with    teenage    or    grown-up   children    and    family

responsibilities, to go back to school, learn, sit down, take

notes, study, take examinations  -  you know you did it  many

years  ago  but now, when you sit down to try and do  it,  it

does not come so quickly any more.  But it is an effort which

has to be made and we will help them to make it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo also asked about the effect of this package on

inflation, I do not think there will be, because inflation is

generally  low.   We have been watching it.   This  year,  it

should be about 1%, I think.  Next year, maybe about 2%,  but

we  keep a very close eye on inflation in Singapore.  We  are

helped  because world-wide inflationary pressures  are  down.

So  imported inflation would not be significant, and domestic

inflation, as long as we manage our economy carefully and  do

not allow it to overheat, will be controlled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On charges and fees, there were a series of charges and

fees  which  had  rebates in the package last year  including

medical  charges, public transport, service and  conservancy,

and  GST  rebates  which were extended for two  years.   Some

expire  at the end of this year and some will expire  at  the

end  of  next year.  We will let them run their course.   The

economy  is  recovering.   I  expect  to  see  wages   rising

gradually  over  the  next  few months.   They  have  already

started  to rise, and I do not see workers losing their  jobs

in   very  large  numbers  and  being  unable  to  find   new

employment.   There will be retrenchments but at  this  time,

the  retrenched workers really have the best chance  possible

to  find new jobs.  So I think that we should let the rebates

and  fee  concessions to run their course.  And,  as  I  have

said,  beyond that, we have to make some adjustments, but  we

will  be careful and mindful to be moderate and to make  sure

that  the overall impact will be something which people  will

be able to bear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam asked what signal are we

sending to the private



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



sector.  The answer is we are sending them the signal that we

are still lagging them.  We have a benchmark.  We should have

followed  the  benchmark.  Because of the  circumstances,  we

have  not done so.  We will make a partial restoration.  How?

We  will settle later on.  But at the end of it all, it  will

still take us some time to catch up, and we have always  said

that  we  will lag the private sector, and we are not leading

it.   But we have to keep in step and we  must not be too far

behind.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, last year, when we announced the

cost  cutting  measures, there was a  5%  rebate  for  public

transport  which will also expire at the end  of  this  year.

Could  the  Deputy Prime Minister enlighten us  whether  this

will also be extended?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, despite the fact that the economy

is growing, as a result of the restructuring, retrenchment is

likely  to continue.  Will the Deputy Prime Minister indicate

his forecast what the retrenchment numbers are likely for  at

least the next one year?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the public

transport rebates will run out at the end of this year.  They

will not be extended.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok asked about retrenchment. I do not have

an  accurate figure but we think it will be more than  15,000

workers this year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, I am afraid the Deputy Prime

Minister does not understand the import of my question.  I am

not  concerned  so much with those employees in  the  private

sector  against  whose salaries the benchmark for  Ministers'

salaries  is fixed.  I am concerned with those in  the  lower

ranks  in the private sector.  What message is the Government

sending to them when you are in a hurry to pay Ministers  and

everyone increased bonuses, including top civil servants?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, today is not a

debate on Ministers'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



salaries.  We have had several debates on Ministers' salaries

in  this House.  The Non-Constituency Member has participated

in many of them.  The matter has been deliberated, discussed.

White   Papers  have  been  tabled.   The  policy   is   well

established.    The   message  which  we  have   consistently

presented to Singaporeans is that we are looking for  quality

leadership in the public sector, in the political leadership.

If  you want good people, you have to be realistic.  The more

you  are able to recognise what people are worth and pay them

what they are worth, the better the quality of government  we

are  going  to  have.  So I do not think there has  been  any

change.   It  is a system which we will have to  continue  to

argue, discuss and defend

repeatedly because Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam and others  will often

ask why this is so and it is quite understandable because  it

is not an intuitive solution.  Many countries do not do this.

But many countries envy us that we are able to do this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in America recently and one person I met, who is

head of Brookings, said to me, "We envy your system.  We  are

unable  to  do  it.   We have to squeeze  our  public  sector

salaries.  So we have two or three different grades all  paid

exactly the same pay because there is not enough room to make

a  differentiation between them.  And we will still get  some

people  coming in because in the public service, there  is  a

strong tradition in America, you come in for one term and you

go  out,  and  you  have  made your reputation.   But  it  is

starting  to tell, and we are beginning to see a shortage  of

qualified,  high-calibre people in their public sector."   So

these  are  issues  which confront every  country.   We  have

chosen  the approach of coming out, discussing it openly  and

defending what we do rather than making believe, and I  think

that is a right approach.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> May I ask DPM why a 5% rebate for

public transport is not considered?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have to manage

the recovery and move on.  When we run into a crisis, we have

to  introduce measures to buffer the crisis.  When we  emerge

from the crisis,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



and  put  it behind us, we must gradually wean ourselves  off

the  measures  so  that the next time we run  into  a  crisis

again, we can apply them again.  It is like the CPF.  When we

run  into a crisis, we make a 10% cut.  As soon as the crisis

is  over, we have to begin to restore it. If we bring it down

and  we hold it down, and say, no, it is too comfortable, let

us  leave  it  there,  we  will never  come  back  up  again.

Similarly, with rebates on transport, on health and on  other

items.   If we bring it in and leave it there, then the  next

time what do we do?  The next time we must have a 10% rebate,

and  a 20% rebate.  Eventually, we will have to give free bus

rides, or pay people to ride buses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, these are adjustments which have to be made.

They are not going to disappear overnight because some of the

rebates last till next year, some of them run out this  year.

It  is  something which is not pleasant to do  but  which  we

cannot avoid.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Rather than looking forward to future

downturns in the economy, are we going to use CPF as  a  tool

to  reduce cost or will there be other tools as far as  wages

and salaries of workers are concerned?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> CPF should only be an absolute last

resort.   If  you  are  in  a very  desperate  spot  and  the

situation  looks very grave, then it is a card which  we  can

play, which nobody else can play.  No other country has  this

possibility.   We can do it but only if it is really  a  very

serious  situation and only if we make an exceptional  effort

to explain and justify and get people to understand why it is

necessary.  But it is not something which you want to use  as

a  standard macro economic policy tool.  What we really  want

to do is to build in flexibility into the wage system so that

if  there  are ups and downs, it can be buffered by the  wage

system.   After the 1985 recession, we built in the  variable

bonus and the flexible wages over the next 12 years.  So this

time  when we had the recession, we were able to use that  to

absorb part of the reduction in cost and could make a smaller

reduction in the employer's CPF contribution.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion we have drawn from this experience

operating  the flexi-wage system is that it is very  good  to

have  the  variable  component.  But  there  is  a  draw-back

because  the variable component works on an annual basis  and

most of it are annual bonuses.  So by the time you adjust and

cut,  it  may be eight or ten months later, and by that  time

either  you may have hoped for the situation to have  changed

or   the  company  may  already  have  run  into  cash   flow

difficulties  and  gone under.  So we really  would  like  to

develop a monthly variable component of the salary which will

be  adjustable more quickly and flexibly. This  is  what  the

Government  was able to do because we have this monthly  non-pensionable  variable component, which we could  bring  down,

and now we can bring up again.  The NWC has endorsed it.  How

to  do  it is something which we have to study.  There is  an

issue because if you do not do it properly, then although you

call it a monthly variable component, it will be monthly  but

it  may  not  be  variable.  So you  need  to  have  a  clear

understanding of how it will operate, what the  formula  will

be,  either based on the economy as a whole or based  on  the

company and its performance, so that when it is necessary  to

revise it up or down, it is easy to do.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, on SDL, how would the Government

try   to  encourage  more  SMEs  to  retrain  their  workers,

especially the older ones, whom we really want to  help,  and

especially also for companies whose workers may not  be  able

to   enjoy   the   training  facilities  under   the   Skills

Redevelopment Programme?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> It is a difficulty, because the big

companies are better organised to take advantage of the  SDF.

So  companies like SIA or DBS, which are very well  organised

and pay a lot of attention to training their people, are able

to  take  full advantage of SDF.  In fact, I believe many  of

them  collect more from SDF than they put in the  SDF.   They

are  not wrong to do so, but I think it means other companies

are  not  using  the SDL enough.   We have to  encourage  the

small  companies  to do this.  We need to  design  programmes

which will fit the small



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



companies.   At  the  same  time, maybe  we  should  consider

whether there should not be some cap on how much you can take

out  of  the SDF in comparison to how much you put  into  the

SDF.   There must be some relationship.  It need  not  be  at

most  one to one, but some reasonable relationship.  Then  we

would  be  able  to free up some money and  use  it  for  the

smaller companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand from the Ministry of Manpower that in fact

last  year the withdrawals for small companies from  the  SDF

actually went up by 6%.  So while we are concerned, there  is

improvement.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> Would DPM enlighten us whether

Government  will  still  be  advocating  the  wage  restraint

measures, as the measures introduced last year were meant  to

retain  our competitiveness?  If we were to restore the  wage

cut so quickly, then our competitiveness will still be eroded

vis-a-vis our neighbouring countries.  Besides, some  sectors

of  our  economy  have  yet  to  recover  from  the  economic

downturn.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I referred in the statement to what

the   NWC   had   recommended  this  year.    Their   overall

recommendation was wage restraint but they also made specific

provisions  for  companies not doing  well,  companies  doing

well,  companies  doing  very well, and  depending  on  which

category you fell into, there were different guidelines.   If

you  are  doing  well,  then you should reward  your  workers

through  bonuses or wage increases, preferably in the monthly

form,  and if you are doing very well, then you should do  it

and  put  most of the money into the monthly variable  bonus.

That  was at the time when the economy was forecast  to  grow

between  zero to 2% for the year.  Since then we have revised

our forecast.  Now we think the economy will grow by about 5%

for the year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that overall the recommendations are still valid

because they have built into them flexibility to allow for  a

range of performances of companies and next year



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



in  May  the NWC will meet and discuss again.  I would expect

that,  from the company's point of view, what really  matters

is  your  company's performance.  If your  company  is  doing

well,  and more companies fall into that category, then  more

companies will be able to pay bonuses, increases and  monthly

variable components.  But if you are not doing well, and  you

say,  "Now, I wish to treat myself more generously because  I

do not feel quite as pessimistic as before" then I would say,

"Have a care."

<div align="center"><b>INFO-COMMUNICATIONS DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>OF SINGAPORE BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Communications and Information

Technology  (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong): Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  beg  to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government first announced, in March this year,

its  intention to merge the National Computer Board, or  NCB,

with  the Telecommunications Authority of Singapore, or  TAS.

The  Bill seeks to effect that merger to form a new statutory

board,  the  Info-communications  Development  Authority   of

Singapore, or IDA for short.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me explain the reasons for the merger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information and communications technology, or ICT, will

be  of  increasing relevance to Singapore as we move  into  a

knowledge-based global economy.  ICT-related industries  will

constitute  a  key  growth  sector  in  this  knowledge-based

economy.  ICT will also be the enabling platform for building

competitive  strengths  in  other  economic  and   industrial

sectors of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the merger, the promotion, development and

regulation  of  the  ICT  sector were undertaken  by  various

Ministries  and  statutory boards. The NCB, which  was  under

MTI,  was responsible for the development of the IT industry.

The  Singapore  Broadcasting Authority, or SBA,  under  MITA,

took charge of the broadcasting industry while TAS, under the

then MINCOM, handled the regulation of the telecommunications

industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this arrangement has worked well in the past, the

circumstances  and  imperatives  have  changed.    Technology

changes  and business trends are leading to a convergence  of

the   telecommunications,   IT  and   broadcasting   sectors.

Transmission    technologies   have    become    increasingly

substitutable.   Consequently, the traditional industry-based

regulatory  boundaries are breaking down.  Just a  few  years

ago,  telecommunications were related to telephones, telexes,

fax



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



machines,  radio  and  handphones,  while  IT  was  basically

computers   used   for  scientific  calculations,   financial

operations and word processing.  And broadcasting was related

to radio and television.  Today, all three sectors are inter-related.   You can send a fax through the computer,  talk  to

friends  overseas  through  internet-telephony  or  watch   a

television  programme on the computer through  the  Singapore

ONE  broadband  multimedia network.  Equally importantly,  we

are  finding  that  promotion and development  of  the  info-communications  sector  can take place  effectively  only  if

there  is  an  integrated perspective, one that includes  the

issue of regulation.  It is therefore necessary to review the

existing  organisational structures  to  improve  policy  co-ordination   and  implementation  in  the   face   of   rapid

technological developments.  This will enable  us  to  foster

the   integrated  development  and  application  of  ICT   in

Singapore.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  Government   has

transformed  MINCOM  into the Ministry of Communications  and

Information Technology, and decided to merge TAS and NCB into

the Info-communications Development Authority of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may ask why not go one step further, and merge

the  SBA with IDA.  After all, convergence also involves  the

broadcasting sector.  We have, in fact, considered this.   Up

till now, the SBA has been responsible for content regulation

across  the various mediums, including both broadcasting  and

the  Internet.  This responsibility remains separate from the

other  aspects  of  ICT industry development,  promotion  and

regulation.    Traditional  broadcasting  can  be   regulated

independently.   Therefore, the Government decided  that  the

principal   responsibility  for  broadcasting   and   content

regulation  will  remain  with the SBA.   However,  the  non-content aspects of broadcasting, which are convergent with IT

and   telecommunications,   such  as   interconnection,   the

technical  standards  for cable infrastructure  and  the  re-broadcast  infrastructure in tunnels  and  within  buildings,

will  be transferred to IDA.  Both the IDA and SBA will  work

closely on such issues.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry will be taking a two-stage approach in

establishing   the  regulatory  framework   for   the   info-communications industry.  The merger of NCB and  TAS  is  the

first phase.  Instead of two specific regulators, NCB and TAS

will   be  merged  into  an  integrated  agency,  the   Info-communications   Development  Authority,   to   oversee   the

development   and   regulation  of  the  ICT   industry   and

infrastructure.  The IDA Bill constitutes the  new  statutory

board  and  lists  its  broad  functions  and  duties.    The

Telecommunications  and  Postal Services  Bills  provide  the

detailed  regulatory powers of IDA in the  telecommunications

and  postal  sectors respectively.  The regulatory provisions

are  generally  taken from the existing TAS  Act,  with  some

revisions and enhancements.  These will be discussed  in  the

second reading speeches for the respective Bills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second phase will be the introduction of separate

legislation  to  deal  with the legal and  regulatory  issues

arising  from  the convergence of the telecommunications,  IT

and   broadcasting  industries.   As  convergence  is  a  new

phenomenon, we are studying the issues involved, as  well  as

learning  from  the  experience  and  legislation  of   other

countries.   I am targeting to finalise this new  legislation

next year after IDA has sorted out all the technical issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall now touch briefly on the main

provisions in the IDA Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill provides for the formation of the IDA as

a  statutory  board, with the transfer of staff,  properties,

rights and liabilities from NCB and TAS to the IDA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6 and 7, together with the Second Schedule, of

the  Bill  spell  out the functions and duties  of  the  IDA.

Broadly, the IDA will perform three key functions.  First, it

will promote and facilitate the growth and development of  an

efficient  and  internationally  competitive  ICT  sector  in

Singapore.    Second,  it  will  carry  out   licensing   and

regulatory functions, and help maintain effective competition

in the ICT sector.  Third, it will promote an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>



Information  Society in which ICT is readily  accessible  and

available to all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 provides for the transfer of properties,

assets and liabilities of TAS and NCB to the new IDA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 provides for the transfer of employees of TAS

and NCB to the service of IDA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the technological advances and market developments

in  the ICT industry are driving the digital revolution.  The

merger  of  the NCB and the TAS to form IDA is  an  important

step   to   better   manage  the  convergence   of   IT   and

telecommunications technologies in Singapore.  It will  allow

us  to  have an integrated and focused Statutory Board  which

can  then work towards leveraging on the opportunities of the

digital  revolution.  It will help develop Singapore  into  a

progressive Information Society and position us as a  dynamic

and vibrant knowledge-based economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to  speak  in support of the Bill in the  name  of  the

Minister for Communications and Information Technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to merge the National Computer Board

with  the  TAS  to  form  this new  IDA  (Info-communications

Development  Authority of Singapore).  One of the  duties  of

this  IDA  is  to  promote the efficiency  and  international

competitiveness   of   the  information  and   communications

industry  in Singapore, as stipulated in clause  6(1)(a).   I

just  want  to  seek a clarification from the Minister.   The

term   "communications"   here,   I   suppose,   refers    to

telecommunications  and not just communications,  because  in

his  Ministry, communications may also involve sea, land  and

air transport.  Or does the Bill actually seek to cover these

areas?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to ask is whether the notion of

efficiency and international competitiveness mentioned in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



clause  6(1)(a)  refers to our information and communications

industry  in  Singapore  in providing efficient  services  in

Singapore or for them to go overseas and compete in  the  big

league  internationally.  I am not  sure  whether  the  first

meaning   to   provide   efficient  services   in   Singapore

necessarily  implies the other.  So perhaps  a  clarification

from  the  Minister as to what extent the aim of  this  Info-communications Development Authority extends well beyond  the

shores  of  Singapore overseas, and, if  such  is  the  case,

whether  such policies that we apply home will  also  be  the

best  kind  of  policies that will enable  some  of  our  own

companies to go overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we would like our own service providers to give

the  best  services  and charge the lowest  price  for  these

services,  does the Info-communications Development Authority

necessarily see this issue of service providing as  the  sole

issue  for  efficiency?  Size, for example,  is  a  very  big

competitive  advantage in this sector.  So  to  develop  that

kind  of  size  for  our  own local  enterprise,  Singaporean

enterprise,  is it the same set of policies that is  required

for  us  to  develop if we are only interested  in  providing

efficient  services  at home?  Strategic investment  that  is

provided  over  a  long  term,  for  example,  will  not   be

undertaken by local service providers, because it may not  be

profitable over a given time frame.  And if we do not do that

in  Singapore, then we may not have the experience, the know-how  and  the  knowledge base to proceed overseas.   So  such

investments that have to be made locally may be of  strategic

advantage to our country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it leads me to the question of whether IDA will be

able  to  achieve its objective of promoting and  maintaining

fair  and efficient market conduct and effective competition.

Will  the  IDA  not  have  its own favourite  son?   This  is

particularly  so  because  in  clause  6(1)(m),  the  IDA  is

supposed  "to encourage, promote, facilitate, invest  in  and

otherwise  assist  in  the  establishment,  development   and

expansion  of the information and communications industry  in

Singapore".  I hope the Minister can clarify.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  has  said that IDA is an important step  to  better

manage  the convergence of IT and communications.   I  agree,

Sir.   Indeed, one of the concerns when I entered this  House

in  1997 was how we should perhaps restructure our Government

and Ministries to cater to this problem.  And it was reported

in  Hansard,  19th November 1997, in columns 1893  and  1894,

when  I asked the Prime Minister a question whether he  would

form  a  Ministry of Information Technology.  Then the answer

was  simply  no,  that we had a National IT Committee  to  do

that.   I  followed up on 12th March 1998 with a question  in

the Committee of Supply which was reported in column 1054  of

Hansard dated 12th March 1998.  The then Second Minister  for

Trade  and  Industry replied in column 1096,  and  again  the

answer  was  no,  that  it was unrealistic  to  have  such  a

Ministry.  I followed up again, 12th March 1999, reported  in

column  708, asking for this again.  And I am very heartened,

Sir,  that today we see the culmination of efforts like that.

We  have now not only an IDA (Info-communications Development

Authority   of  Singapore)  but  also  a  new   Ministry   of

Communications  and Information Technology.    It  does  show

that if we do try, in small persistent pushes, it can indeed,

perhaps with faith too, move mountains.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very happy that we have this new Ministry and

this  new authority to better manage the convergence  of  IT.

It  is, you might say, the new "darling" of Singapore, and we

hope   that  it  would  be  able  to  live  up  to  the  high

expectations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The convergence of broadcast technology, computer

technology and telecommunications technology, in fact, should

lead  us  to that further consideration of merging  even  the

SBA,  as  the  Minister has mentioned  in  his  speech,  with

perhaps   IDA.    The  Minister's  answer  is  that   content

regulation should be separate and it is still all right  that

traditional broadcasting can be regulated that way, and  that

the technical side of broadcasting will be brought under IDA.

Half  a loaf is better than nothing, Sir.  But I would  still

say that we should actively consider merging even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>



SBA  with  IDA  because  out in the industry,  it  is  rather

confusing for a broadcaster to say where this goes to  -  SBA

or  IDA.   If  we  are concerned about separately  regulating

content,  we  can indeed have a separate agency  to  regulate

content.   Then, again, in this case, it will be  across  the

board  dealing with content not only on radio, TV,  computers

and  Internet, but print media too.  So I would  indeed  urge

the Government to continue considering that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, moving on to the technicalities, I look at clause 2

which states the definition of "TAS".  I believe there  is  a

little  inelegance of drafting here.  We  are  told  that  in

clause  2, TAS is defined as "the Telecommunication Authority

of   Singapore   reconstituted  under  the  Telecommunication

Authority  of Singapore Act".  This Act, we will know  today,

will  be  repealed.  It is strange to me to see words telling

me  that  an  Authority would be reconstituted under  an  Act

which  will be repealed.  I do believe that perhaps what  the

drafters  intended  to  do  was  to  mention  that  this  new

Authority, IDA, is an authority that will replace  TAS  which

was  formerly reconstituted under the TAS Act, which  is  now

repealed.   Perhaps  some additional words  would  make  that

clear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to clause 6(1)(e), there are certain powers

mentioned which are given to the new IDA, ie, new powers, new

functions  and  new  roles.  I am very  supportive  of  those

roles.  Perhaps clause 6(1)(e) could be further expanded, not

just   to  deal  with  the  IDA  representing  Singapore   in

international  fora,  but also to  be  given  the  powers  to

separately  and independently, if necessary,  to  forge  this

convergence  of  laws.  Because as IT and  telecommunications

converge,  the  laws of the world will need to  converge  and

harmonise.  I hope that the power will be given to the IDA to

work  with international bodies, whether Government  or  non-government,  whether  public  or  private,  in   efforts   to

harmonise ICT law and policy and to create transnational and,

if necessary, supranational solutions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to clause 6(1)(j), Sir. I would say that,

prior  to this, it is indeed heartening also to see that  the

Authority  would be given the power to encourage,  facilitate

and  promote  the greatest practicable use of industry  self-regulation by the information and communications industry  in

Singapore.  I would like to know if the Minister would, in  a

policy  statement perhaps, soon announce how  this  would  be

done and whether there will be any budget to do this.  It  is

important  for  industry  to self-regulate  but  it  is  also

important to give them the right incentives so that they will

do it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> First, let me thank the two MPs who

have  spoken  in support of the Bill.  Let me deal  with  the

points  brought up by Mr Chay.  Sir, he has asked, since  the

term  "communications" can be interpreted to  cover  a  broad

area  which  includes  sea, land and air  transport  sectors,

whether  the  Info-communications Development Authority  will

also  be  charged  with  the  responsibility  for  the  three

transport sectors.  Sir, if you were to refer to clause 2  of

the  Interpretation  section,  it  defines  "information  and

communications technology" or ICT as "any technology employed

in  collecting, storing, using or sending out information and

includes  that  involving  the  use  of  computers   or   any

telecommunication system".  Sir, this is  in  fact  a  widely

used    term    in    the    information    technology    and

telecommunications  industry and is a  result  of  the  rapid

convergence  of these two technologies.  As such,  the  Info-communications Development Authority will only be responsible

for   the  IT  and  electronic  communications  industry   in

Singapore and not the sea, land and air transport sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has also asked, when we talk about promoting

competitiveness in Singapore, whether we mean to let the  ICT

industry to be competitive in Singapore only or do we  intend

to  let them also compete abroad and, as he says, join in the

big  league overseas.  Sir, the ICT industry is an  extremely

large sector.  It includes the development and management  of

computer hardware and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



software, the telecommunications sector, the development  and

hosting of Internet content, the provision of  data services,

and  so  on.   As  most of these services  and  products  are

largely sold on the global market, the industry players  must

necessarily  be  competitive,  not  just  locally  but,  more

importantly, internationally.  For example, HP's computer and

computer peripheral business in Singapore sells the products,

such  as  computers and printers, not just in the region  but

all over the world.  Similarly, with Compaq, Seagate and many

other  companies.  In the software sector, there are  already

companies  in Singapore which are subsidiaries of MNCs,  even

local  companies,  whose  software  are  products  which  are

developed  in  Singapore  and are  now  being  used  or  sold

worldwide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the same time, the cost of local

telecommunication services can be a significant  cost  factor

for   companies  and  it  can  adversely  impact   on   their

international competitiveness.  Therefore, we  also  need  to

ensure   that   the  local  telecommunication  services   are

competitive and competitively priced.  As a result  of  this,

we  are  now seeing good results.  For example, Singapore  is

one  of  Citibank's global data centre.  Citibank has located

this   very  important  multi-million  dollar  facility  here

because  we  have  the necessary IT expertise,  an  excellent

supporting  infrastructure and competitive telecommunications

rates.   The  centre links up with the Citibank  branches  in

over  55  countries worldwide.  So IDA must therefore  ensure

that  its policies lead to a more vibrant and internationally

competitive local telecommunications sector to the benefit of

the whole economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay asked, since size is important, would the same

set  of policies be valid across the whole range of companies

and,  more  importantly, in cases where strategic investments

are  required,  especially  such investments  are  marginally

viable,  how  can we promote those investments.   How  do  we

ensure  that those investments are being made for  the  long-term good of the economy?  Sir, IDA's focus is to ensure that

our  telecommunications industry can respond to the needs  of

the economy in the range and quality of innovative



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



services  offered and also to ensure that these services  are

competitively priced and give good value for money.   At  the

same time, competitive pricing may not necessarily imply  the

lowest  price  levels.  I think this is what he is  concerned

about.   If this really implies the lowest pricing,  then  in

the  same  policy we apply across the board.  So the  aim  is

really to ensure that we give good value for money.  One  way

to  do  that is to ensure that eventually when we move  to  a

situation where market forces force the service providers  to

do  so, ie, innovate, price their services competitively and,

even  though they are not the cheapest in the region  because

of  the overall quality of service, their services are  still

very attractive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to investments that have a strategic

national value but which are only marginally viable, we  have

mechanism   to  address  this.   For  example,  TAS   has   a

development  grant  scheme and NCB has a cluster  development

fund  which  can  be  used to promote and  co-fund  strategic

investment  projects.  I will give Members an  example.   TAS

and  NCB, together with other Government agencies, had worked

with industry and co-funded SingaporeOne which is the world's

first  nation-wide  broadband infrastructure  for  multimedia

applications and services.  So in that way, IDA will continue

to  work  with the industry to ensure that there is continued

upgrading and enhancement of our infrastructure and  network.

And we will also co-fund strategic investments when needed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay also talked about the danger of having a

favourite  son  because of the duty of  IDA  to  promote  the

development of this sector.  Sir, like TAS and NCB before it,

IDA  will  be a fair and impartial regulator and promoter  of

the  industry.  Mr Chay need not fear that IDA  will  have  a

favourite son because we will continue to treat all  industry

players as valued and favourite sons.  So it is not just one,

we  will  treat  all of them as our favourite  sons.   As  we

further liberalise the telecommunications sector and  as  ICT

sector  continues to develop, we expect to see  more  players

locating  in Singapore.  They will serve not just  our  local

market but also the region and globally.  The only way for us

to attract



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



them  in  is  to ensure that our playing field is  level  and

equally  important  is  that the new  and  potential  players

perceive  our playing field as being level.  So he  need  not

fear about IDA developing a favourite son.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh See Kiat has brought up a few points. First,

I  want  to  commend him on his persistence in  raising  this

issue  of  centralising the responsibility for IT.   Sir,  it

shows  that the Government does listen to the suggestions  of

MPs and we do take their suggestions into consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked why not merge SBA and IDA eventually because

the  industry  players  may  have difficulty  differentiating

between  what is under SBA and what is under IDA.   Sir,  the

content  element is very straightforward.  The dividing  line

is  very clear and the industry players know who to go to for

which function.  The SBA content also spans a large area.  It

is  not just content on Internet, radio and TV, but also,  as

Prof.  Toh  has  mentioned,  also  covers  the  print  media.

Therefore,  it  best resides within SBA and  IDA  as  it  now

stands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked about the definition of TAS. Sir, I had

asked  about  this earlier and I am told that the formulation

of  words  here is correct.  But since I am no legal  drafter

and  in  view  of the point brought up by Prof. Toh,  I  will

indeed seek another opinion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh also asked whether IDA can, under clause

6(1)(e),  in  fact  broaden  its function  to  include  being

charged with working with international bodies on harmonising

ICT  law and policy.  Sir, indeed, this is what we intend  to

do.   It  may  not  be under that particular section  but  we

intend  that in view of the fact that this is such a  rapidly

evolving  section,  and  in  fact many  countries  are  still

groping as to what to do, we need to share our experiences as

well  as  learn  from the experiences of other countries  and

where international standards are needed to be formulated, we

want   to  be  there  right  upfront,  taking  part  in   the

formulation of those standards because they would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



impact on us as well.  Sir, I can assure Prof. Toh that  this

indeed is what we intend to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh also talked about clause 6(1)(j) which deals

with  the intent of IDA to promote self-regulation.   I  will

touch  on that in my Second Reading speech for the next  Bill

which deals with the telecommunications issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as to whether a budget is needed, I would think

that  industry players would in fact be very happy to pay  us

to  allow  them  to  self-regulate because  this  gives  them

greater  freedom.   Sir, I do not think  a  budget  would  be

needed for IDA to promote self-regulation.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, a point of

clarification.  The Minister has said the industry's  players

would  do  it.  Indeed, if the players feel that they  should

self-regulate, they would come together.  But  because  there

are  so many players out there, sometimes it is important  to

have  an organisation that gets them all together to do these

things  as a whole and I declare my interest here.  I am  the

Chairman of CommerceNet Singapore which is trying to do that,

but  being a non-profit organisation, it may not be easy  for

us  to persuade people to donate money. They would want us to

do  the  work  for  them and we would  be  very  grateful  if

Government  could consider some sort of assistance  where  we

can do this work.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I would encourage him to

contact my staff on his concerns.  But I would think that  if

he  is providing a useful service, surely useful services are

saleable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

<div align="center"><b>TELECOMMUNICATIONS BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Communications and Information

Technology (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):  Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  beg  to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill provides the detailed regulatory powers

of the Info-communications Development Authority of Singapore

(IDA)  in the telecommunications sector.  It repeals and  re-enacts   substantively   the  provisions   of   the   present

Telecommunications Authority of Singapore (TAS) Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I had pointed out in my Second Reading speech for the

IDA  Bill, information and communications technology, or ICT,

will  be  of increasing relevance and importance to Singapore

as  we move into a knowledge-based global economy. We need to

not  only  promote and nurture the growth of  ICT,  but  also

transform Singapore into a vibrant and global ICT hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One feature of the knowledge-based economy will be the

widespread   use  of  the  Internet  and  Internet   Protocol

applications.   We  will therefore need to actively  work  to

become  a  regional  and  global  hub  for  Internet  content

development,   hosting  and  delivery.   To   realise   this,

Singapore  will need to become an even more competitive  node

for  global  telecommunications.  We  must  ensure  that  our

telecommunications  infrastructure is  well  developed,  well

connected  regionally and internationally, and  competitively

priced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore important to increase and broaden our

connectivity   to   key  regional  and   global   information

infrastructures.  From less than an aggregate of 10  megabits

per  second in 1998, Singapore's Internet bandwidth into  the

Asian region will grow ten-fold to more than 100 megabits per

second by the year 2000. Singapore's Internet bandwidth  into

the  region  is expected to grow exponentially into  gigabits

per second by the year 2005.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



The locations and bandwidth of such connections would be both

market and demand-driven.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the telecommunications sector has become extremely

complex   and   competitive  internationally,  with   service

providers innovating furiously, and new value-added  services

and   products   being   introduced  in   rapid   succession.

Development in such a dynamic environment cannot be regulator-driven, nor can the market place be restricted if it is to be

vibrant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises this. We have therefore

progressively liberalised the paging, Internet Access Service

Provider  (IASP) and mobile telecommunications  sectors.   By

1st  April 2000, the public basic telecommunications  service

sector  will  also  see  the entry of  our  second  operator,

StarHub.   The  entry of new players, as we liberalise,  will

often  involve technical and contractual issues  between  the

new and existing players, particularly where interconnections

and interconnectivity are involved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IDA must therefore fairly, transparently and

expeditiously  manage  the  implementation  issues,  such  as

interconnection arrangements, between the incumbent  and  the

new  telecommunications operators.   We  recognise  that  the

regulatory  approach and framework must also  evolve  as  the

industry  develops and matures.  The entry  of  more  service

providers will enhance competition, thereby allowing  IDA  to

exercise a lighter regulatory hand.  The Government can  then

let the market self-regulate more, intervening only when anti-competitive practices appear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now explain the main provisions

of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our regulatory approach in the telecommunications sector

is structured to allow the IDA to regulate its licensees in a

fair  and  transparent manner.  The IDA will rely on  licence

conditions,  directions, codes of practice and  standards  of

performance to safeguard national and consumer interests  and

ensure  the quality of telecommunications services.  This  is

provided for in clauses 5, 26 and 27 of the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also enable IDA to address issues that are

critical  to the development and liberalisation  of  the  ICT

industry, such as preventing anti-competitive practices.   To

protect  consumer  welfare and public  interest,  apart  from

suspending  or cancelling a licence, a financial penalty  may

be   imposed   on  licensees  that  breach  these  regulatory

requirements.   The  limit  for  the  financial  penalty   is

generally based on the potential public consequences and  the

economic  benefits a licensee can deliberately reap from  the

breach,  or non-compliance.  A breakdown in telecommunication

service   arising  from  a  breach  can  cause  serious   and

widespread    disruption    to    business    and    personal

communications.  In clause 8 of the Bill, we  have  thus  set

the   maximum  financial  penalty  for  a  telecommunications

licensee  at  $1 million.  This should be adequate  deterrent

against errant and irresponsible actions by licensees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 69 contains explicit provisions allowing

aggrieved  licensees to appeal to the Minister.   The  appeal

can be against any decision of the IDA in the exercise of any

discretion  vested in it, such as an order for suspension  or

cancelling  of  a licence, or the issuance of directions,  or

anything  contained  in  a code of practice  or  standard  of

performance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, as I mentioned earlier, we recognise the

need to regulate with a lighter touch as the industry matures

and  moves  to  a more competitive market-driven environment.

In  such  an  environment, industry self-regulation  will  be

promoted where possible.  Clause 28 of the Bill empowers  IDA

to  issue  advisory guidelines.  This will allow the  IDA  to

step  back in appropriate circumstances and let the licensees

work out mutually agreeable solutions among themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, given the growing importance of the

telecommunications network, we must ensure that due care  and

diligence is taken by contractors doing work in the  vicinity

of  telecommunication cables, to prevent cable  cuts  to  the

telecommunications  network.   This  will  be  addressed   by

requiring  detection works to be undertaken prior  to  actual

commencement of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



earthworks, and by properly trained and licensed workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 29 and 30 of the Bill provide for IDA to license

telecommunications cable detection workers.   The  provisions

will   make   it  mandatory  for  contractors  who  undertake

earthworks  to  engage  qualified  telecommunications   cable

detection workers to locate the cables in the vicinity before

commencing with earthworks.  Contractors will be required  to

take  due  care and diligence to prevent cable  cuts  to  the

network.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 29 also stipulates that contractors who fail to

do  so  shall  be  liable, upon conviction,  to  a  fine  not

exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment of up to 3 years or  to

both.   In addition, clause 30 of the Bill states that  cable

detection  workers who are unlicensed shall be  liable,  upon

conviction, to a fine of up to $10,000 or to imprisonment for

a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Telecommunications Bill sets out the regulatory

framework for the  efficient and effective operation  of  the

IDA in a liberalising environment in the short term, and in a

fully  liberalised environment in the long term.  It  is  the

aim  of  the  IDA  to  ensure  that  fair  and  market-driven

competition can be introduced as early as possible,  so  that

it will be able to regulate the industry with a lighter touch

while protecting the interests of consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill covers a

wide  area,  as  has  been  mentioned  by  the  Minister,  in

telecommunication  services and setting  out  the  rules  and

regulations for the provision of such services, the codes  of

practice,  the offences and penalties, enforcement powers  as

well  as the international obligations and areas of strategic

interest.    It  vests  the  Authority  with  the   exclusive

privilege    of    operations   and    the    provision    of

telecommunication   systems  and   services   in   Singapore,

including  the  power  to grant licences  for  operations  in

specific areas of services.  This power to license also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



includes  the power to require licensees to share systems  or

inter-connection access to systems with other licensees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of transparency and global competitiveness is

quite  definitive  in  this field of  telecommunications.   I

wonder  how  will  the licensees, who have certain  competing

strengths  built  up  over years of market  expertise,  human

skills or strategic investments in anticipating the market or

building   synergies  in  their  own  businesses,  view   the

directions  from  the  Telecommunication  Authority,  or  IDA

subsequently,  to share their resources or competencies  with

other  licensees  on  this sacred altar of  transparency  and

inter-connection access.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, there is a question of national strategic

interest,   either  in  having  some  critical  or  important

telecommunication systems or features reside in or belong  to

Singapore.   It  is  a typical free-rider  problem  that  one

encounters  often  in  businesses  and  organisations.    The

infrastructure  is  built up by the pioneer.   The  newcomers

come  to  ride on the infrastructure support built  up.   How

does  one  price  it?   By fixing benchmark  market  cost  in

equivalent features globally, or in a market asset  price  of

the  stockholding  company?   The  danger  is  always  there.

Because of our local market limitations we may end up  giving

up a lot for very little.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does the Telecommunication Authority, or IDA

subsequently,   make   out   fair   compensation   to    such

infrastructural cost and rewards for risk involved?  If  such

compensating  criteria  are not well defined  in  advance  or

certain  businesses  are  unduly  or  unfairly  penalised  by

unwitting extraction of its business advantages to some other

licensees,  there  may  be  reduced incentive  for  strategic

investments  and for long-term dynamic growth and development

of the industry, which may therefore be affected.  I hope the

Minister can clarify.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The requirement in clauses 53 and 54 stipulating

Government's   overriding  international   rights   is   also

important and very reassuring.  Singapore has made its  stand

to   fulfil  its  role  as  a  responsible  member   of   the

international  community,  its  intention  to  override   all

licensees' conduct



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>



of    business    at   variance   with   such   international

responsibilities to which the Government is a signatory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention to stipulate better telecommunication

cable  detection work by contractors is also most welcome  in

clauses   29  to  32.   We  all  know  that  any  damage   to

telecommunication cabling network costs a lot  of  money  for

the  businesses affected.  And the latest regulatory role  of

the  Bill  allows for this detection work by contractors  and

penalty  fines for them are the least we can do  to  continue

protecting our cable network.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support  this Bill.  The first thing I would like to  say  is

that  the  Bill is timely and we have debated  on  the  Info-communications Development Authority of Singapore  Bill,  and

we realise why we have to do this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point that I raised earlier on in the debate

on the Info-communications Development Authority of Singapore

Bill, and now under this Bill, is that in clause 2, there  is

a  definition  of "TAS".  Here, my argument is even  stronger

than  earlier.   It says,  ""TAS" means the Telecommunication

Authority  of  Singapore reconstituted by the repealed  Act;"

My  question earlier on and my question now is:  how  can  an

Authority  be reconstituted under a repealed Act?  I  believe

the  words  should have been better put as, ""TAS" means  the

Telecommunication    Authority    of    Singapore    formerly

reconstituted under the repealed Act."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My other more substantial point relates to clause 4.

Under  clause  4,  the  monopoly given  to  the  licensee  is

excepted  in  that  if  "a  person runs  a  telecommunication

service solely for his own use or solely for the purposes  of

his  business   .   on  a single set of  premises  in  single

occupation;"   Those are the words in the Bill.   This  would

mean  that the exception to the monopoly privilege  will  not

cover,  it  seems to me, a world-wide or even  a  nation-wide

corporate intranet.  It is within one company, but  it  seems

to fall outside this and therefore there is an infringement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other possibility is that if we have a private

network in an intelligent building,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>



it  could  be one premise, if you see it that way, but  there

are  many occupiers and therefore even though they should not

be  regulated by the Act, it appears that they  will  be.   I

wonder if this is intended.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, moving on to clause 33 of the Bill, this is the

beginning  of the offences and penalties (Part  VI),  and   I

believe clause 33 can be read too widely.  The clause, as  it

stands,   would  seem  to  require  operators  of  e-commerce

businesses  which  would happen to be riding  on  an  ISP,  a

licensed  ISP at that, to be licensed too.  And I  hope  this

would  not  happen because otherwise, as could  be  possible,

portals like Yahoo and e-mails like Yahoo.com or hotmail.com,

or  the  chat rooms that are set up under e-commerce shopping

malls, or perhaps on-line stock trading services - these  may

all  come  within the licensing provisions of the  Bill.   If

there is no licence, then it would be illegal, and this would

hamper a lot of e-commerce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, I do believe that we need to clarify whether

technologies used by companies like MediaRing and Net2  Phone

would be similarly telecommunication systems that need to  be

licensed, because they breach the monopoly privilege  of  the

licensee.  So we do hope that the Minister would clarify this

and,  if  necessary,  this could be done in  the  regulations

under the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to clause 35 again, I have a clarification.

Clause  35  is  an offence clause which penalises  those  who

operate a radio communication system or service, and  if  you

do not have a licence, it could well give you penalties under

this  clause.   My  question  is:  would  an  Internet  radio

service, which could eventually also be wireless, be  covered

under this clause?  If so, then it should be excluded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, my point is on clause 41 and perhaps the clauses

after that, clauses 42 to 48 which deal with the interception

of  telecommunication  services and such  offences.   Looking

specifically at clause 41, I regret that this is perhaps  not

wide  enough to cover and protect against electronic snooping

which does not touch,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



tamper, remove or damage any installation or plant under this

clause.  Certainly, if you were to use current technology  to

intercept  mobile  phone messages, it  would  really  not  be

touching, tampering, damaging or removing any installation or

plant  under  the Telecommunications Bill.  Consequently,  it

could  be  read  as a lacuna in the law because  we  prohibit

people from intercepting messages only if it touches the line

or  the  plant  or  the installation of the Telecommunication

Authority  but  not if they are clever enough  to  avoid  all

these.   Sir,  I would like the Minister to clarify  on  this

point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than that, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, I have not intended to speak

on  the  Bill  which  I  generally support.   I  would  like,

however,   to   raise   three  points  for   the   Minister's

clarification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two relate to the Minister's comments on the

need   for   transparency  to  ensure  that  anti-competitive

measures  are  struck down and that the  new  authority  will

regulate with a lighter touch.  In this regard, my first  two

points  relate to the right of appeal and to the question  of

transparency.  It seems to me that the rights of  appeal  are

limited  to  the Minister.  Then, obviously, the reasons  for

the  Minister's decision and the hearings will not be public,

and  this  may  not be best practice as regards transparency.

Public hearings might be better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second relates to clause 28(3)(b). Clause 28(3)(b)

allows in respect of advisory guideline wherein the authority

simply  must "publish each advisory guideline in the  way  it

thinks  fit".   Again,  if  we  are  to  take  best  practice

transparency seriously, surely public publication  either  in

the Gazette, as with all other laws or regulations, should be

the bare minimum and not "in the way it thinks fit".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point relates to a different issue, and this of

course  is the relation of international rights to the  right

of  the  licensees.  Sir, this Bill is taking part in a  very

dynamic  situation in which international negotiations  under

the  umbrella of WTO are opening up and other sectors.  There

will be an effect on licences.  It could



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



be  a  question of vested rights, a licence already given  is

then  in  some way compromised.  I would like the  Minister's

assurance  that  consultations will be  held  with  licensees

prior  to these international negotiations that might  affect

them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, let me thank

the three Members who have spoken up in support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will take the points brought up by the speakers

one by one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me deal with Mr Chay's comments. The first

point he raised was about requiring the existing licensees to

share  their facilities and he asked how would the  licensees

view  the  directions from the regulator for  them  to  share

their  resources.   Sir,  as I pointed  out  earlier  in  the

session on Questions for Oral Answer, tough decisions have to

be  made  and it is very difficult to make all the  licensees

happy.   Of  course,  those who have been adversely  impacted

will  not  be  very happy.  But the key thing is  for  us  to

ensure that the regulatory framework is one which is fair and

transparent,  so  that  no  one feels  that  they  are  being

discriminated  against or they are being taken advantage  of.

We  have to ensure that there is no free rider.  That is  one

of  his main concerns - that new companies will come and free

ride  on what has been put in by the existing companies.   So

there will be no free riders.  All the services will have  to

be  negotiated.  All the interconnections will be  negotiated

at a price agreed upon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me stress that the regulation and

liberalisation of the telecommunications sector is not unique

to  Singapore.  Because the telecommunications sector  is  so

vital to the efficient operation of the entire economy,  many

countries  have, in fact, actively proceeded even before  us,

to  open up their telecommunications sector.  Therefore, many

of  the  interconnect practices and requirements have already

been fairly well established.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we need to have the interconnect facilities? In

a   multi-operator  environment,  we  need  to  ensure   that

consumers are able to enjoy seamless and transparent services

and that the service



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



providers  are able to share scarce infrastructural resources

on commercially agreed upon terms.  For example, it would not

make  economic sense nor will it be in our national  interest

if  SingTel subscribers are not able to phone subscribers  of

M1 handphones and vice versa.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interconnection and access therefore is vital in a

competitive multi-operator environment, so that the customers

can   have  a  choice  of  service  providers  and  they  can

seamlessly  and  transparently contact and  communicate  with

anyone they want.  In the area of infrastructure sharing,  we

will  only  direct sharing where there is a  real  bottleneck

situation.   For  example, all the mobile phones  and  paging

operators are required to share the infrastructure to provide

radio  coverage  in the MRT and our city tunnels,  given  the

sheer  lack of space and the operation constraints  in  these

tunnels.   The  IDA will only issue directions after  careful

assessment of the circumstances requiring sharing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On interconnection and access, IDA's requirements for

the  operators to have interconnection and access obligations

are  very  similar  to what other countries  are  practising,

because we have taken the opportunity to learn from them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay also raised his concern whether we will actually

be  giving up a lot for very little.  In actual fact, we  are

giving   out  very  little  to  gain  a  lot.   Because   the

telecommunications  infrastructure  is  a  very   fundamental

infrastructure for the entire economy.  By making  sure  that

we  are  able  to  liberalise and introduce competition,  our

rates have been steadily declining.  And as a result, I think

it  has been a boost to many parts of the economy, especially

companies  that  are  engaged  in  international  trade   and

companies  which have very heavy data flow between  Singapore

and their offices in the region and elsewhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay also asked whether by having the interconnection

requirements,   we  will  reduce  incentives  for   strategic

investments.   As  I  pointed out  just  now,  if  there  are

strategic  investments that are required but which  are  only

marginally viable, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



will  be  very  happy  to  take  a  look  and  co-fund  those

investments,  if they are in the national interest.   On  the

other  hand,  by  making sure that we are able  to  introduce

competition, I think this forces the companies to innovate to

provide  more  value-added services  and  therefore  increase

their own viability.  I think as a result of that, we have in

the  last  18  months or so been seeing the  introduction  of

numerous new services, all of which add to the bottomline  of

the operators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has also agreed with our requirements for

contractors  to employ licensed cable detection  workers.   I

thank him for his support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Prof. Toh's point on the definition of

"TAS",  in  clause 2, I have asked and I was  told  that  the

formulation  of  the words is correct.  But,  again,  as  was

pointed  out earlier on, I will also seek further  advice  on

this from the AG's Chambers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 only applies to equipment which is on a single

set  of premises in single occupation.  He asks whether  this

is deliberate, because it seems to rule out quite a few other

situations,  for  example,  companies  with  multi  locations

within  Singapore  which seek to set up  their  own  national

Intranet as well as bigger buildings where there are multiple

occupants.   Sir, the scope of the definition  is  indeed  an

intended  one.  For the case of one user, many premises,  the

national Intranet situation that he talked about is that  the

company should take telecommunication services from a  public

basic telecommunication service provider who then has certain

rights  to  either  enter the land for  installation  and  to

repair  and also to be able to extend the network beyond  the

boundaries  of  one  particular property  owner.   So  it  is

intended not to apply to such situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of one premise, many users or occupiers, the

smart  building that Prof. Toh was talking about, this  would

be  the  provision  of telecommunication  services  to  third

parties, as the users and occupiers are not related but  just

happened to be in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



the  same  building.   And therefore such  potential  service

providers should actually obtain a licence from IDA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he touched on clause 33 and asked whether this

requires e-commerce operators riding on licensed ISPs  to  be

licensed,  and he mentioned companies like Yahoo,  Chat  Room

facilities, Media Ring and Net2Phone.  In fact, clause 33  is

not  a  new  provision.  It is an existing provision  in  the

current TAS Act.  TAS to-date, in fact, does not license  any

content or Internet service provider.  So portals like Yahoo,

free  mails given by them, and Microsoft, and Media Ring  and

Net2Phone  are, in fact, already not required to be licensed.

The other thing is that Media Ring and Net2Phone actually  do

provide  a  service.  They provide software or  equipment  to

Internet   subscribers,  and  being  not  service   providers

themselves, they do not require to be licensed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked about clause 35 - whether service providers

who are providing radio service through the Internet need  to

be licensed.  Sir, the answer is yes.  Any equipment intended

for  wireless transmission, regardless of the content  to  be

transmitted,  needs to be licensed by IDA.   The  reason  for

this is very simple.  This is to ensure that the operation of

such  equipment  does  not cause interference  to  any  other

wireless services or equipment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh commented that clause 41 is not wide enough to

cover  against, for example, electronic snooping.  Clause  41

has  a  very  clear intention.  The intent is to protect  the

telecommunication's  installation  of  plant  or  the  public

telecommunication  licensee from damage  if  someone  in  the

course  of trying to intercept messages or to commit mischief

damages or tampers with the installation or plant.  It is not

meant  to cover or to protect against electronic snooping  or

unlawful interception.  I believe that one of the reasons  is

that  now mobile telephony being encrypted is quite difficult

to  snoop  into versus the old analogue system where actually

it  is like a radio station where you can just tune in.   The

new GSM and CDMA systems are encrypted and each generation of

new phones involves even stronger



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



encryption  and  therefore it is  now  proving  to  be  quite

difficult for people to just snoop into such transmissions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay commented that while we are talking about

transparency  and  the  need to act against  anti-competitive

practices,  the  rights of appeal are quite limited  and  the

rights of appeal have to be made to the Minister.  The reason

for this is that in many cases, the information contained  in

those appeals are highly sensitive commercially and therefore

it  is  not appropriate for those appeals to be heard  openly

because   it  will  mean  divulging  commercially   sensitive

information.   In  any  case,  if  such  information  is  not

commercially sensitive, if need be, we will be very happy  to

let  the companies publicise the decisions.  In any case, the

appellants  are  normally  heard by  the  Ministry  as  well.

Whilst  the case may not be heard in the open, they have  the

ability to make their case heard very clearly by the Ministry

and Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned about clause 28(3)(b) where the Authority

must  publish  each advisory guideline in the way  it  thinks

fit.  Mr Simon Tay feels that it should be gazetted.  Sir, to

be   published  "in  the  way  it  thinks  fit"  leaves   the

flexibility   to  the  Authority  to  publish  the   advisory

guidelines.   Today,  there  are many,  many  channels.   For

example,  TAS now posts many of the requirements and policies

on  the  Internet.  So rather than restrict it  to  only  one

medium, it is better that we leave the flexibility to the IDA

to  publish  those guidelines.  The key thing is  that  those

guidelines  would  be published.  But  let  us  give  it  the

flexibility to choose the medium or better still the media in

which to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, his last point was on the WTO

negotiations  and  discussions and if those  negotiations  do

impact on the existing licensees, we should hold consultation

with  the  licensees.  Sir, indeed this has been the practice

and we will continue with it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

just  clarify  one point which the Minister touched  on  just

now.   In  talking about the issue of interconnection  access

and the free rider problem, I said just now that we might end

up giving up a lot but getting very little.  What I meant was

actually  when people, particularly international  companies,

come into Singapore and operating as licensees, riding on the

interconnection  access which is built  up  internally  here,

there  is an issue here.  How does one price it?  Of  course,

you  can say that by opening up the market, naturally  prices

are  becoming cheaper and cheaper.  But if you just  look  at

this kind of benchmark, international prices of operator,  it

might not mean a thing.  The value of the business is resided

in  the asset value of the company.  So the value is actually

there  - in the control of the operations, in the headquarter

company,  in the stockholding company which is overseas.   So

the  danger  is  really there.  If you just  use  the  normal

standard  day-to-day  routine measure and  say,  "Bottomline.

That's it.  So many cents per call, or whatever."  I hope the

Minister can dwell into what I mean when I said "giving up  a

lot for very little".

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I wish to ask the

Minister to clarify.  Does he not see the anomaly that arises

when  he  says  that  clause  41 is  not  intended  to  cover

electronic  snooping?  If you get a person who  taps  into  a

telephone line, that is illegal but if he taps into an  aired

message  through  a  mobile phone  system,  then  it  is  not

illegal.  I do agree that there are encryption systems.   But

as  a  matter  of practice, most mobile phone  messages  will

remain  unencrypted for a long term and also perhaps  because

it  is  more expensive.  And it does indeed say much  of  our

move into the IT age that we do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



have  laws preventing private communications from unwittingly

becoming non-private.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> I would like to thank the Minister for

his  clarifications.  I would seek further  clarification  on

only one point.  It is regarding the release of decisions  to

the  public.   I  agree with the Minister that  where  it  is

commercially  sensitive, it should be withheld.   But  can  I

take  it that the Minister is reassuring us that where it  is

not  commercially  sensitive and where there  are  principles

that  apply to other companies or the public, these  will  be

released because there have been controversies before.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Mr Chay sought to clarify what he is

talking  about.  Sir, I do take his point.  This is  why  TAS

has  put  in  place a charging framework for  interconnection

which  should  be  applicable for  only  three  years.   This

charging  framework  establishes,  among  other  things,   an

economic cost model for calculating the interconnect  charges

and  infrastructure sharing.  This cost model is based on the

current  replacement  cost  principles  to  ensure  that  the

infrastructure    owner    is    fairly    compensated    for

interconnection and for the use of his infrastructure.   This

framework is generally an attempt to redress the asymmetry in

the  bargaining  position of the new entrant,  vis-a-vis  the

incumbent,  and it gives the right signals and incentives  to

both  the  new and old players.  The new operator can  decide

whether  to  buy  or  to build his own facilities  while  the

incumbent operator has the incentive to continue to invest in

the  infrastructure  because it is getting  a  good  economic

return  on whatever he is investing.  After three years,  the

operators will then proceed to commercially re-negotiate  the

prices.   And  it  is  only when they  cannot  agree  on  the

pricing,  will IDA then intervene again.  What we would  like

to  do  is to leave it to them to establish their own pricing

mechanism.   If  there are enough players, the  new  entrants

will have enough choices to negotiate with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh mentioned about clause 41 again. Sir, the

intent, as I said, is to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



prevent  damage  to the existing facilities,  including  line

installation,  and all that.  If someone is snooping  and  is

using our line systems, then we can take action against  him.

But, as I said, the one which we are unable to cover against,

at  the moment, is snooping into the wireless media, and  the

most  common  one will be the handphone conversation.   As  I

said, at the present moment, encryption is already strong for

the  GSM  and  CDMA  and  I think the  future  generation  of

handphones  will have even stronger encryption  capabilities.

If  there  is  a  need for us to guard against  that  in  the

future,   we  will  be  very  happy  to  enact  the  required

legislation.  But at the present moment, there is no evidence

that this is needed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding Mr Simon Tay's question, yes, where the

decisions  and  the  facts of the case are  not  commercially

sensitive, there is no reason why we should not divulge them.

But our experience so far has been that many of the cases  do

involve sensitive information. As we have seen in the  recent

complaints in the newspapers and our replies, they do involve

highly commercially sensitive information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>POSTAL SERVICES BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Communications and Information

Technology  (Mr Lim Swee Say):  Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I  beg  to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill before this House provides for the

regulation of the postal services sector in Singapore.   Like

the Telecommunications Bill 1999 that was debated earlier  in

this  House,  the Postal Services Bill repeals and  re-enacts

substantively   the   provisions  of  the  Telecommunications

Authority  of  Singapore  (TAS)  Act  on  the  licensing  and

regulatory powers in postal services.  Clause 3 of  the  Bill

provides for the appointment by the Minister of any person to

be  a Postal Authority.  The intention is to appoint the  new

Info-communications Development Authority of Singapore  (IDA)

as the Postal Authority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the postal services sector comprises two broad

categories  -  the  basic delivery of  ordinary  letters  and

postcards,  and the delivery of express letters.  The  latter

is  a  premium  service.  To meet the needs of  the  business

consumers  for secure and fast delivery service, the  express

letter market has been liberalised since February 1995.  This

provides consumers with a wider



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



choice  of competitive carriers for their time-sensitive  and

more secured express mails.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the delivery of ordinary letters and postcards,

Singapore Post has the monopoly rights until 31st March 2007.

Members  of  this  House may ask why not  bring  forward  the

liberalisation  of  this  market  so  that  the  benefits  of

competition,  such as competitive pricing and higher  service

levels, can be enjoyed earlier.  After all, this was what  we

did for the telecommunications sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must weigh the possible benefits of

liberalisation  against the cost of advancing  liberalisation

with its concomitant compensation and decide what is the best

approach.   In the postal industry, the key growth areas  are

the  delivery  of  express  letters  and  direct  mails  from

businesses   to   households,  such   as   printed   matters,

advertising  materials and publications. These  growth  areas

have all been liberalised.  SingPost's monopoly is restricted

to  a low-growth market of ordinary mails and postcards.   In

1998,  the  volume  of  ordinary letters  and  postcards  has

decreased  by 4.5% and is expected to decrease by  a  further

2.2%  in  1999.   Looking  ahead,  this  declining  trend  is

expected  to  continue  over the next  few  years,  with  the

increasing use of mail substitutes such as e-mails and faxes.

This    is    clearly    unlike   the    rapidly    expanding

telecommunications  sector, where the potential  benefits  of

advancing  liberalisation are obvious.  The  postal  industry

relies  on  the high volume of mails to achieve economies  of

scale.   This  has  allowed the postage  for  ordinary  local

letters  to  be  kept  at an affordable  rate  of  22  cents.

Without the benefits of the economies of scale, postage rates

may have to go up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, TAS sets the minimum standards for the

quality of service that SingPost should provide to the public

for  the  delivery of ordinary letters and  postcards.   This

includes targets for delivery speeds of local, registered and

international mail, and queuing time at postal outlets.   For

local ordinary mail posted before 7 pm within the CBD or 5 pm

outside the CBD, TAS requires SingPost to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



deliver by the next day at least 98% of all mails within  the

CBD  and  95%  of  mails outside the  CBD.   There  are  both

internal and independent external audit checks to ensure that

these  standards  are  met.  It is also necessary  to  review

these standards regularly to continuously improve the overall

postal  service  enjoyed by Singaporeans.   In  this  regard,

IDA,  in its capacity as the Postal Authority, aims to  raise

the  minimum  standards for quality of service for  next  day

delivery  of local ordinary mails that are delivered  outside

the  CBD  from  95%  today to 98%, and  for  those  that  are

delivered  within  the CBD from 98% to  99%.   This  will  be

implemented progressively over the next few years and will be

completed by 2004.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, TAS has also put in place a price control

regulatory  framework, which benchmarks the tariffs  for  our

basic  postal  services against countries with  similar  cost

structures.   For  the  delivery  of  ordinary  letters   and

postcards,  TAS requires SingPost's charges to be  below  the

average of these countries.  SingPost also needs to seek TAS'

approval  on any tariff changes for its basic services.   The

price  control  framework ensures that the  tariffs  for  our

basic postal services are internationally competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, for SingPost's delivery of ordinary letters and

postcards, there are sufficient safeguards on service  levels

and prices to protect the interests of the general public. We

will therefore not advance the liberalisation of the ordinary

letter market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we will do is to ensure that the regulatory

framework  is  fair  and  transparent.   In  the  Bill,   the

provisions  outlining the regulatory approach mirror  closely

those  in the Telecommunications Bill 1999.  The IDA, in  its

role  as the Postal Authority, will similarly rely on licence

conditions,  directions, codes of practice and  standards  of

performance.  This is provided for in clauses 6, 24 and 25 of

the  Bill.   Likewise,  clause 26  provides  for  the  Postal

Authority to issue advisory guidelines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the cancellation or suspension of a licence,

clause 9 also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



provides  for  a  financial penalty to be imposed  on  postal

licensees   that   do  not  comply  with   these   regulatory

requirements.  Compared to the telecommunications and  public

utilities sectors, the potential public impact of a breach of

regulatory requirements is less serious in the postal sector.

The  maximum amount of the financial penalty is thus  set  at

$10,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, clause 56 contains explicit provisions

allowing  licensees the recourse to appeal  to  the  Minister

against  any decision of the Postal Authority in the exercise

of  any  discretion  vested in it  by  the  Act  or  anything

contained in a code of practice of standard of performance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Postal Services Bill 1999 sets out the

regulatory    framework    for    the    postal     industry.

Notwithstanding  the  monopoly in the  delivery  of  ordinary

letters and postcards, we do enjoy high quality of service at

internationally  competitive  prices.   To  ensure  that   we

continue  to do so, we will review the minimum standards  for

the  quality  of  service  and the  price  control  framework

regularly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, let me mention that under clause 2 of the

Postal  Services Bill, there is a definition of "letter".   I

would  like  to  clarify if such a definition  would  include

services  that  the  Singapore Post is  currently  promoting,

which is the V-post and perhaps even e-mail services, because

if this is not within the definition of "letter" in clause 2,

there are certain other implications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on clause 2, at the risk of sounding like a

broken  record, I would like to put on record for the Hansard

because this would aid in future interpretation of this  Act,

this  question of the definition of "TAS".  I  just  need  to

clarify  that after this Bill is passed today, there will  be

no new TAS that will be "reconstituted".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, clause 4 deals with the monopoly, that is, the

exclusive privilege



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



that  the  postal licensee would have.  On first  reading  of

this  clause, I initially was disappointed because  my  first

reaction  was  -  what has happened to the liberalisation  of

postal  services that we have been promoting and  advocating,

because  if  postal services are liberalised, sometimes  this

would be more business-responsive.  And indeed, the growth of

the courier business has shown that to be so.  I am therefore

glad that the Minister of State has actually clarified in his

speech  that there are certain residual areas of  the  postal

service which would be unattractive to the commercial  sector

to  carry and yet they need to be carried because people need

to  correspond, and economies of scale are needed so that  it

would be affordable enough at 22 cents.  I thank the Minister

for  that. At 22 cents, it is a bargain deal and, on  top  of

that,  there  is quality of service standard requirements  by

the  current  TAS  and, later on, IDA.    I  would  therefore

support  this  and urge for constant review of this  need  to

liberalise postal services even more. Ultimately,  if  postal

services are not relevant, we should look into making it more

responsive to the times and the technologies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 deals with letters or postcards which accompany

goods.   I  believe the intention really is  that  there  are

certain  correspondences that do not  really  relate  to  the

ordinary  letter that we are talking about. This is something

that  goes along with the delivery of goods and the provision

in   clause  5  says  that  if  this  is  accompanied  by   a

"Consignee's  letter"  then  this  is  not  covered  by   the

exclusive  privilege.  My question, Sir, is  that,  sometimes

some  of  these cards or covering letters might  accompany  a

delivery of goods, but it is not a trade practice or industry

practice to call this letter a "Consignee's letter".  And  if

that  is  so,  then  the deliverer of these  goods  would  be

breaching  the Act if he were to deliver the goods with  that

letter.   It  is particularly so when we talk  about  the  e-commerce  purchase. The transaction is entered  into  on  the

Net.   Somebody  must physically deliver and perhaps  with  a

covering letter.  I hope these delivery services are not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



covered  by  the exclusive privilege or the monopoly  of  the

licensee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move on to clause 15. Clause 15 raises a concern.

It says that, "The addressee of any postal article containing

any  dutiable goods shall be presumed until the  contrary  is

proved  to  have  imported  the  same".   Sir,  this  is   an

evidential  presumption  which  gives  the  State   ease   in

prosecuting illegal imports and so on.  But I would  be  very

concerned  that this does not get seen as a kind of  indirect

import tax on e-commerce because an e-commerce transaction is

entered  on the Net and something is delivered, and it  could

be  delivered from Amazon.com in America.  We do not want  to

see  any  indirect import taxes imposed on transactions  like

that because then e-commerce would be hampered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, clause 19. Clause 19 describes essentially what a

postage stamp is and what are the protections that are needed

to  make  sure  that  postage stamps,  especially  philatelic

stamps, are valuable and continue to be valuable.  The  words

"postage stamp" are defined again in clause 2, but reading it

together with clause 19, I get the impression that it may not

cover  the  development of e-postage stamps on the  Internet.

There  are  many, many proposals for this now  and  the  idea

essentially is that on the Internet, you could order a  stamp

that  you  can then fix onto your e-mail or to your  physical

mail  and  deliver.   Such  stamps  would  not  have  artwork

probably.  There will definitely not be any printing  proofs,

no  dyes  or artifacts will be created and they may not  even

have adhesive or be printed or stamped directly on the postal

article itself. This whole section seems to describe, if  you

might  say,  Sir,  obsolete  technology.   I  hope  that  the

Minister could look into this and clarify that this does  not

stop any development in the e-postage stamp category.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 28. Clause 28 of the Bill deals with

the  damage to the installation or plants used for posts  and

it  covers essentially what the old section 77 of the TAS Act

deals   with,   and  that  is,  you  cannot   intercept   the

transmission or delivery of a postal article if you  were  to

touch, tamper, remove or damage the installation or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



plant of the postal services and the postal licensee.  I have

mentioned  this  during the debate on the  Telecommunications

Bill  and I want to mention the same point here that  in  the

era  of  e-commerce, we have to increasingly assure consumers

and  businessmen that when they go to e-commerce, it does not

mean  that  they  will  lose all  their  privacy  and  it  is

important that we look at making sure our laws do cover  this

unauthorised  interception  of  messages  and   letters   and

telecommunications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this clause, I think that it is not wide enough to

cover  a situation where if the postman has delivered into  a

private mailbox.  It is no longer a plant of SingPost  -  and

that private mailbox is opened and somebody reads the letter,

seals  it  and puts it back again.  And that is  not  illegal

because   under  this  current  definition,   no   plant   or

installation  of SingPost has been touched.  I  would  prefer

that  to be not so, because we must protect private mail  all

the  way  until  it  is received and read  by  the  addressee

himself.   If  you were to look at it harder, I am  concerned

that  it  may not cover a situation where currently SingPost,

for  example, uses part-timers.  Many of them are  housewives

and  they  help to deliver the mail.  And sometimes they  may

actually be using paper bags or shopping bags that may not be

SingPost's  plant  or  equipment.  I am concerned  that  this

would  then escape the penalty provisions of clause 28 and  I

do  hope that the clause is not meant to be taken so absurdly

and narrowly.  If the Minister could clarify that, I would be

most obliged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, I would like to thank Prof. Toh

See Kiat for his constructive comments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, on the point about V-post and e-mail services,

I  would like to clarify that this Bill basically deals  with

the  physical delivery of letters and postcards.  For e-mails

and  so on, it does not come under this Bill.  E-mails  would

be covered under the Telecommunications Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on Prof. Toh's point about the "reconstituted"

TAS,  as  my  Minister has mentioned earlier, we would  check

with the Attorney-General again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh also spoke on clause 4 regarding exclusive

privilege.   I  want to assure the Member that the  exclusive

privilege  here refers to the privilege given to  the  Postal

Authority,  in this particular case, the IDA.   The  IDA  can

issue  licences  for  sectors that  are  deregulated.   As  I

mentioned  earlier,  for  the  high-growth  sector,  we  have

already  deregulated the market.  In fact,  at  this  moment,

there  are  110  companies competing  with  SingPost  in  the

deregulated segment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 5, Dr Toh asked what happens if the letter

does  not  have  the "Consignee's letter" stamp  on  it.   My

understanding is that, as long as the letters or postcards in

question  concern  solely  any  goods  or  property   to   be

delivered,  and do not serve other purposes,  these  will  be

exempted under the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh mentioned the presumption on imposition of an

indirect  import tax in clause 15.  I would like  to  clarify

that  what this Bill does is to make clear that the addressee

is  presumed under the law to be the importer of  the  goods.

Whether  he  has  to pay duties directly or indirectly,  that

will  be  covered under the Customs and Excise Act,  and  not

under this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh mentioned clause 19 regarding e-postage stamp.

Again,  this  Bill  covers  only  the  physical  delivery  of

letters.  So e-mails and e-postage come under a separate Act,

which is the Telecommunications Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 28 regarding the unlawful interception of

letters,  basically,  this clause covers  the  protection  of

installation  and  plant.  If a person  were  to  retain  any

letters illegally and unlawfully, this would be covered under

clause  36.   If an employee were to do something wrong  with

the  letters, whether he is a part-timer or full-timer,  this

will be covered under clause 34.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I believe I have addressed the concerns

expressed  by  Prof. Toh.  Once again, I thank  him  for  his

support.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister  of  State a question on clauses 34 and  36.   These

clauses relate to retention.   But my scenario is one where a

person  opens up a letter, reads whatever he needs  to  read,

and  then  seals it and puts it back into the mailbox.   Then

there is no offence and I think this is an anomaly, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, clause 36 says, "Any person who

. wilfully retains or secretes or makes away with or keeps or

detains ..".  My understanding is that even if a person  were

to  retain the letter for a short time, that could, in a way,

be  covered  under this clause.  But I am not a legal  expert

and I think we will leave it to the court of law to interpret

this particular sentence.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, in other words, the

Minister of State says that it is the intention of Parliament

that  even those few seconds of retention is sufficient under

the Bill to constitute an offence.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, as I have mentioned, the Bill

states  quite clearly that  "any person who wilfully  retains

.".   So  for  a  few  seconds, I think it  would  constitute

retention.   As I said, I am not a legal expert and  I  think

the  court of law would do the interpretation.  If  it  turns

out  to  be different from the intention of the Act, then  we

have to clarify and amend the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill.  -  [Mr Lim Swee Say].

<div align="center"><b>BUSINESS REGISTRATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br>4.35 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to amend the Business Registration

Act  to  update the Act, streamline registration  procedures,

enhance  certain  penalties,  harmonize  the  Act  with   the

Companies  Act  and enhance the computerisation  of  services

offered by the Registry of Companies and Businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Business Registration Act provides the basic

framework   of  governance  for  unincorporated   businesses,

focusing  primarily on registration, restrictions,  offences,

and   penalties.   Apart  from  two  previous   consequential

amendments, this Bill is the first proposed amendment to  the

Act since its enactment in 1973.  The crux of the Bill is  to

update   our   legislation   and   fine-tune   administrative

housekeeping matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now go on to highlight the main amendments

proposed in the Bill.



<br><br><i>Extension   of   the  validity  period  of  Certificates   of Registration</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill proposes the amendment of section 9

to extend the validity period of certificates of registration

from  1  year  to 3 years.  This means that a certificate  of

registration issued upon registration shall be  valid  for  a

period  of  3 years and shall thereafter be renewable  for  a

period  of 3 years in respect of each renewal.  Figures  from

the  Registry of Companies and Businesses show  that  92%  of

businesses  are still in operation after 1 year  and  require

renewals,  whereas  only  59%  of  businesses  are  still  in

operation  after 3 years.  Presently, much time and resources

are  spent  following up on annual cases  of  non-renewal  of

certificates.  Adopting a 3-year renewal policy will  relieve

the  business  community  of  the unnecessary  administrative

burden of yearly renewal, and reduce business costs.



<br><br><i>Empowering the Registrar to accept cashless modes of payment or renewal of businesses</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 amends section 9 to allow the Registrar to make

cashless  modes  of  payment (eg, GIRO and  other  electronic

means) a condition for renewals, if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



deemed  necessary.  The same amendment grants  the  Registrar

the  discretion  to accept cash in exceptional circumstances.

The  amendment is in line with the national effort to promote

electronic  mode of payment, which will help  to  reduce  the

administrative cost to both the public and the Government.



<br><br><i>Granting  the  Registrar  the  power  to  refuse  or   cancel registration</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 introduces new sections 31A and 31B that

empower the Registrar to refuse or cancel the registration of

businesses  in instances where it is shown that  registration

would  be  for  unlawful  purposes, purposes  prejudicial  to

public peace, welfare or good order in Singapore or where  it

is  contrary  to national security or the national  interest.

This  will bring the Act in line with amendments made to  the

Companies Act in 1984.



<br><br><i>Shifting  the  burden  of proof from  the  Registrar  to  the defendant in  cases  where the defendant is alleged to be  carrying  on business under the name displayed at his premises</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate prosecution, clause 14 introduces new

section  23A  that  shifts  the  burden  of  proof  from  the

Registrar  to  the defendant in cases where the defendant  is

alleged  to be carrying on business under the name  displayed

at  his  premises.  In such instances, the defendant will  be

required to disprove that he is "carrying on business", based

on  evidence  such  as  having a sign  outside  the  business

premises, rather than the Registrar having to prove that  the

defendant  is  doing  business.  Similar  provisions  on  the

reversal  of the burden of proof are found in the  Misuse  of

Drugs Act and the Immigration Act.



<br><br><i>Fixed time frame for appeals</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 introduces new sections 31B(3) and 31C such

that  any person wishing to appeal to the Minister against  a

decision   of   the  Registrar  to  refuse  or   cancel   the

registration of a business must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



appeal within 30 days.  This will bring the Act in line  with

the  Companies Act relating to the time-frame for appeals  to

Minister.



<br><br><i>Other amendments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the penalties in the Act have not been increased

since  1974, opportunity is being taken to revise  them  now.

In addition to these changes, other administrative amendments

are  proposed to update the Act and provide for  the  filing,

making  of  payment and other transactions through electronic

means.  The rest of the amendments are of a drafting nature.



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before tabling this Bill, we had sought the views of

lawyers,  accountants  and interested  parties  such  as  the

Institute   of  Certified  Public  Accountants  of  Singapore

(ICPAS),  the  Association of Small  and  Medium  Enterprises

(ASME) and the Law Society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In proposing these changes, we have taken into

consideration  the  impact these changes would  have  on  the

public.   The  amendments  will help reduce  business  costs,

streamline the business registration procedures and allow for

electronic modes of payment.  We hope that these changes will

provide a more efficient way of registering businesses and  a

more conducive regulatory environment for businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  start  by  commending the Minister  for  this  effort  to

constantly review the business registration processes to keep

up  with  the  times,  and I am pleased especially  with  the

effort  to  make  it  friendly  for  electronic  filing   and

electronic  payment purposes.  Electronic filing, of  course,

eventually  we  hope, will be one of the  ways  that  we  can

actually  file our company reports, annual accounts  and  all

that.  But that is another matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to just refer to three points very

quickly.   First, on clause 2.  Clause 2 is an  amendment  to

section 2 of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



the  Business  Registration Act.   Here,  in  section  2,  we

essentially have a section that deals with who is registrable

and  who  is  not  registrable.  I would  like  to  seek  the

Minister's  clarification about certain types  of  businesses

that are now operating from home like tutors.  Under the T 21

plan  that  we  have, we are allowing homes to  be  used  for

businesses.  In the old days, under the First Schedule of the

Business  Registration Act, there were a  lot  of  businesses

that were exempted from registration because they happened to

be  home-run  businesses.  And I do hope  that  the  Minister

would  clarify  whether  the home  operations  now  that  are

allowed under the T 21 plan would be operations that need  to

be registered under this Business Registration Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point relates to clause 3. A clarification

needed  is  whether  this  amendment  would  cover  companies

incorporated  under the Companies Act (Cap. 50)  and  whether

these companies can use acronyms and short form names without

registering   these   acronyms  and  names.    For   example,

"International  Business Machines Pte  Ltd"  could  trade  as

"IBM"  without  any  registration.  Or  whether  "X  Malaysia

Rubber  Traders  Pte Ltd" could trade as "XX Rubber"  without

further  registration.  This assumes,  of  course,  that  the

earlier  incorporation is all validly done.   And  how  about

words  that  are added on to a company's name?  For  example,

the  registered company name is "ABC International Tours  Pte

Ltd" and they trade as "ABC International Tourists Centre".

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.44 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third point would really relate to the whole

process  of  business registration in Singapore, and  I  just

like to urge the Minister to continue reviewing this process.

The  Ministry  of Finance has done well and the  Registry  of

Companies  and  Businesses  has done  well  to  shorten,  for

example,  some  of the processing time for registration,  the

red  tape and all that goes along with registering a business

in Singapore.  Despite its responsiveness in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



recent  years,  I  do know and I am told  that  it  is  still

nonetheless not competitive, in the sense that if I  register

a  company  or  a  business  right  now  in  Silicon  Valley,

California   -  and indeed I am told that this is being  done

-  at the same time that I register the company in Singapore,

my  Silicon Valley company would be formed first, and I think

this is something which we must correct.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, we also need to look at further rules that

sometimes  are accretions to the Act, meaning that  they  are

added  on  to the Act without really much thought.  And  this

would  be  certain  requirement, for  example,  for  a  local

resident manager in an Internet world where the people  could

be  operating a business from across the world.  It would  be

very  difficult  for them to find a local  resident  manager.

Invariably, they may actually appoint a local who has nothing

to  do with the business to represent them in Singapore.  And

I think these rules have to be constantly reviewed to make us

responsive in a knowledge-based economy.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I thank Prof. Toh See Kiat for

his  general support of the amendments.  He has three  points

which I will respond to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, he wants clarification as to whether people

operating  from home offices or who are doing home tuitioning

would   be  exempted  like  those  operations  in  the  First

Schedule.   I  have to tell him that they are  not  exempted.

Those  who are exempted under the present First Schedule  are

people like taxi-drivers, craftsmen or farmers of low-skilled

activity.   And the home office is a provision  which  is  to

allow people to operate from home where normally they operate

from  the  office  and  generally of a  higher  skill  level.

Therefore,  such people who operate from the home still  have

to apply for registration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, it will apply for home tutors. They are also

not  exempted,  although we believe a number of  home  tutors

have not registered on the assumption that they are exempted.

They are indeed not exempted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh also wants to know, under clause 3, whether

companies  can use acronyms or other short forms for  trading

under the Act.  I would like to clarify that the amendment in

question  is  simply  a  drafting  change  to  get   rid   of

superfluous  words such as "without any addition".   Removing

these  words will not change the intent of the Act.   So  the

meaning of the provision in section 4 remains unchanged.   If

companies  want to operate under a different  name,  it  will

still  be required to register.  For example, IBM, a  foreign

company,  which operates under its own corporate name  wishes

to  use  an  acronym for some other purpose, then under  that

name, they will have to apply for registration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he compares the speed of business registration

at  Silicon Valley to Singapore.  I would like to assure  him

that   we   will  do  everything  possible  to  shorten   the

registration period.  But even under the existing rules,  for

business  firms, the turnaround time is usually no more  than

24  hours,  except for a few cases where the questions  arise

whether the directors involved have records which need to  be

tracked.   For  corporations, it normally  takes  about  five

working  days for the company name to be approved and another

five days for the company to be incorporated.  This is longer

than  in the Silicon Valley where we understand that it could

take  three to five days to register a company, although some

businesses have been turned around within 24 to 48 hours.   I

think our record is not bad.  Although the periods are longer

than  Silicon  Valley,  they are quite acceptable  in  normal

circumstances.  But we will try our best to improve it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the  Bill  be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br><i>Background</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) was set up in

October  1984 as a specialised agency within the Ministry  of

Finance  to  investigate  and  enforce  serious  and  complex

commercial fraud cases.  In March 1989, Parliament  conferred

certain  police  powers on the Director  CAD  and  Commercial

Affairs  Officers  (CAOs)  appointed  by  the  Minister   for

Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, depending on the classification of the

offences,  most  major  commercial  crimes  are  investigated

either by the CAD or the Criminal Investigations Department's

Commercial Crime Division (CCD).  The CAD is responsible  for

investigating  and  prosecuting  complex  commercial  crimes,

including  offences under the Securities  Industry  Act,  the

Companies  Act,  the Corruption, Drug Trafficking  and  Other

Serious  Crimes  (Confiscation of  Benefits)  Acts,  and  the

Futures   Trading  Act.   CID's  Commercial  Crime   Division

investigates  fraud offences punishable, for  example,  under

the  Penal  Code, and the Multi-Level Marketing  and  Pyramid

Selling (Prohibition) Act.  Over the years, CAD has built  up

its  strength  in  combating complex fraud, syndicated  white

collar  crimes, securities offences, such as insider  trading

and market rigging, and serious corporate offences, while CCD

has  had  considerable successes against cheats, credit  card

fraudsters  and  syndicates behind scams that  promise  quick

profits.   Both Departments have distinguished themselves  in

their own right.  But changes are needed to position them  to

tackle   the  changes  and  new  threats  in  the   operating

environment.



<br><br><i>Why Merge - Anticipating Commercial Crime in the Future</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have a specialised agency to investigate "serious or

complex"  commercial fraud remains relevant not  only  today,

but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



more  so  in  the future.  As Singapore opens up its  finance

sector and further develops as a regional financial hub,  the

development  of  our  capital market, banking  and  financial

industries  and  electronic commerce  is  likely  to  attract

increasingly    sophisticated   commercial   crime    frauds.

Commercial  crimes in the coming years are likely  to  become

more complex and the perpetrators may be involved in a mix of

company  and  penal code offences - expertise  to  deal  with

these  should therefore be merged.  An effective  enforcement

regime  is critical to protect the integrity of our financial

markets and business environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This increasing sophistication and complexity of

commercial   crimes  necessitates  the  pooling   of   scarce

resources,  the enforcement and intelligence capabilities  in

CAD and CCD, into a single unit.  So early next year, the CAD

and  CCD  will  merge.  The CAD will be  reconstituted  as  a

separate  department in the Singapore Police Force  with  the

same standing as the CID.  The combined department will still

be known as CAD to retain its reputation as the premier anti-commercial crime agency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new CAD will investigate a wide spectrum of major

commercial   crimes.   Other  commercial  crimes,   such   as

cheating, will still be handled by the Police land divisions.

By  merging the CCD with the CAD, investigative resources and

intelligence  capabilities will be pooled, thereby  resulting

in  synergies  and  even greater effectiveness  in  combating

commercial  crimes.  The CAD will be working in collaboration

with  the  Financial and Securities Offences sub-division  of

the  Criminal  Justice  Division  in  the  Attorney-General's

Chambers,  a dedicated specialist unit formed in August  this

year.   A  mechanism will be put in place to ensure that  the

transfer  of CAD to the Police Force will not result  in  CAD

losing  touch  with  MAS and the Finance Ministry  on  policy

development issues relating to the financial sector.



<br><br><i>Proposed Amendments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Commercial Affairs Officers appointed by

the  Minister  for  Finance already  have  police  powers  to

investigate offences under the Companies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



Act,  the Securities Industry Act and other seizable offences

under   any   written  law  disclosed  in   the   course   of

investigations  under the Companies Act  and  the  Securities

Industry  Act as provided under section 409B of the Companies

Act.   In  order to ensure that the new CAD has the necessary

legal powers to carry out their functions effectively, clause

2 of the Bill seeks to introduce a new section 58A to empower

the  Minister for Home Affairs to appoint Commercial  Affairs

Officers  to  investigate  any suspected  offence  under  any

written  law.  The new section also confers on CAOs, for  the

purposes of investigation, all the powers of investigation of

police  officers  under the Criminal Procedure  Code  or  any

other  written  law  as  the Minister for  Home  Affairs  may

prescribe  by  notification in the Gazette.   The  Commercial

Affairs  Officers are also given the immunities  relating  to

acts  done in obedience to a warrant under section 37 of  the

Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to repeal section 409B of the

Companies  Act  as  CAD  will  now  be  reconstituted  as   a

department under the Singapore Police Force.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this combination of two elite departments marks a

new milestone in our efforts to gear up for the challenges of

the  new millennium.  The reconstituted CAD will go beyond  a

mere  transfer of the current functions of CAD to the  Police

Force  and the AGC.  We will expand the capabilities  of  the

new  CAD  to match the increasingly sophisticated  nature  of

commercial  crime.  The new CAD will strive  to  be  a  world

class   investigative/enforcement  agency,   in   line   with

Singapore's growing status as a financial hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

support the Bill and the reasons given by the Minister as  to

why the CAD will be merged with the CCD.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have only two clarifications to ask of the Minister.

Clause  2  inserts a new section 58A which provides  for  the

appointment of Commercial Affairs Officers.  By integrating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



these  officers into the Force, they are given the  power  to

investigate  any  suspected offence  under  written  law.   I

should  like  to  ask the Minister whether  this  means  that

officers  will  all be retrained to perform a wider  role  in

investigation.    By  empowering  them  to  investigate   any

suspected offence, is it the intention that they be  regarded

as regular Police Officers who may be expected to investigate

all manner of crimes?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, these officers are to be invested with the

powers of investigation with the rank of not below inspector.

In  fact, the Commissioner of Police may confer the powers of

an ASP (Assistant Superintendent of Police) on such officers.

Yet  the  general provisions of the Police Force Act  do  not

apply  to  them  other  than  section  37  which  is  already

mentioned  by the Minister.  That section exempts  them  from

liability  if they perform an act that was done in accordance

with  the  warrant.  Can the Minister clarify  whether  these

officers  are  to  be subject to the same discipline  as  the

other members of the police force?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have a query

for the Minister under subclause (2) of this new clause.   As

it  now  stands, it reads "A Commercial Affairs  Officer  may

investigate  any suspected offence which appears  to  him  to

have  been  committed under any written law."  I  am  puzzled

that  the  legislation proposes to give powers  to  a  police

officer  to "investigate any suspected offence which  appears

to  him  .".   Under the Criminal Procedure Code, police  can

only  investigate  where  there  is  a  report  or  complaint

received  at  a police station and reduced into  writing,  or

where an offence is committed by any member of the public  in

the  view  of a police officer.  What exactly is contemplated

by the word "appears"?  Is this Commercial Affairs Officer to

be  given power to investigate where there is no complaint or

no information received, but where he thinks there might have

been an offence committed under a written law?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been mentioned by the Minister himself, this

officer is now not only confined to offences which previously

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>



Commercial  Affairs Department was confined  to  investigate,

but  now a whole box of offences has been open to him because

it  is  any offence under any written law.  Should  not  some

restraint  be  imposed  before a Commercial  Affairs  Officer

begins  to  investigate?  Or is he going  to  be  allowed  to

investigate  anything just because he suddenly gets  it  into

his  head  that somebody may have committed some  offence  or

some  companies have committed some offence?   It  opens  the

door  to abuse.  I think there must be some restraint, as  is

the  case with police officers in the investigation of crimes

and other offences.  Even the CPIB will have to have a report

or   complaint   received   before   they   embark   on   any

investigation.  So would the Minister explain what exactly is

meant by the phrase "appears to him"?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, let me deal with Prof. Chin's

question first.  Would the officers be retrained to perform a

wider  role?  These Commercial Affairs Officers have  already

been  on  the job for a long time.  They have been  conferred

with   police  powers  since  1989  to  investigate  seizable

offences  under the Companies Act and the Securities Industry

Act,  or any other seizable offences disclosed in the  course

of  such investigation.  So they already know how to exercise

such  police powers.  In the reconstituted CAD, they will  be

given  powers to investigate offences disclosed  under  other

Acts, for example, the Penal Code, Futures Trading Act and  a

list of other Acts.  So they are not fresh or totally new  to

the  way  the police conducts its investigation and therefore

they  are not unfamiliar with the procedures.  What they need

to  do of course is to be familiar with the Acts as well.   I

can  assure the Member that proper training will be given  to

them.   They  are  not police officers.  They are  Commercial

Affairs  Officers,  civilian  officers  who  have  powers  to

investigate   certain  offences,  just  like  the   CPIB   or

Immigration officers who are civilians and who have powers to

investigate the offences committed under the Acts under their

charge.  So this is not something new that we are doing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police Force Act does not apply to them, but

certainly the civil service rules,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



the  disciplinary procedures and the IMs do  apply  to  them.

They  are  fully aware of what they have to do  in  order  to

maintain the reputation that they have acquired over the last

15  years.   There  has not been any incident  that  I  could

recall  that  these  officers have  abused  the  powers  when

exercising the powers which they have under those Acts  which

have been prescribed.  So I do not worry that, by giving them

more  powers to investigate offences under other  Acts,  they

will abuse their powers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam raised this drafting point in clause 2.

That  is  the way the law has been drafted by the  AG  and  I

depend  on the AG for legal advice on the way the law  should

be  drafted.  I have no reason to doubt that that  will  open

itself to abuse.  What we know in Singapore is that the  laws

are  clear enough.  There are rules and guidelines and  there

is  recourse for people who feel that their rights have  been

transgressed  to take the matter to the proper channels.   So

if  an  officer abuses his powers for whatever  reason,  just

because  he does not like a certain person and he  starts  to

investigate that person, that would be an abuse of power.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think there is anyone here more concerned about

abuse of police powers than I am for the reason that our  law

enforcement  agencies  have acquired a  reputation  which  is

quite high.  Anybody who tries to abuse his powers and  as  a

result undermines public confidence in the organisation  will

be  disciplined and, if necessary, charged in the courts.  So

there  will  be  safeguards  and there  will  be  checks  and

balances.   For  the  CAO  who  investigates  and  eventually

recommends a prosecution, the decision does not lie with  the

CAD, nor does it lie with the Commissioner of Police.  Unlike

now,  the  decision to prosecute in the great part  is  being

decided  by  the CAD Director in consultation  with  the  AG.

Under  the new arrangement, the CAD officers will investigate

and send their investigation papers to the Attorney-General's

Chambers  which has a specialist team to study and eventually

decide on prosecution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that any investigation can be conducted

without a complaint or a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



report.   So  if  Mr  Jeyaretnam  thinks  that  just  because

somebody does not like another person's face an investigation

can  be launched, then let me assure him that that would  not

be the case.  If he does know of any case, please let me know

and I will certainly look into it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister by way of

clarification?   Instead of saying that if  the  officers  do

abuse  their powers, there are methods of finding out, is  it

not  better to confine their investigating powers?  And would

the  Minister, I am quite serious about this, refer this back

to   the  Attorney-General  to  consider  whether  the   word

"appears"  should  be  taken out and something  else  put  in

place?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, if the Commercial Affairs

Officer  decides that that is a matter to be pursued  and  he

conducts  an investigation but actually there is no basis  to

do  so  and  therefore abuses his power, the matter  will  be

found  out.   There will be internal checks.  There  will  be

meetings.   There will be proper follow-up.   There  will  be

operating  procedures  to ensure that  whatever  the  officer

investigates  is  proper, and there is a basis  for  such  an

investigation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his question on clause 2, I do not think that this

is  the  only piece of legislation that has the words  "which

appears  to him".  I am sure there are also other  pieces  of

legislation  that have the word "appears" and I  am  sure  Mr

Jeyaretnam,  as a lawyer, should know.  And,  as  I  said,  I

depend  on the Attorney-General for his advice whom I  deeply

trust.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a
