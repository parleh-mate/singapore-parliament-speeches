  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on Question [10th November, 1993],
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House endorses the principles and approaches set out in Paper Cmd 16 of 1993 on "Affordable Health Care" as the basis for Government policies to contain health care costs and to keep good basic health care affordable to all Singaporeans.". -[Minister for Trade and Industry].
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while I was speaking yesterday I was interrupted by the call to order to adjourn Parliament. Anyway, I have only a final point to make. I note that there was no report in the White Paper on the recruitment and training of nurses. I observe that, in Appendix B, our hospitals have a low number of beds to population ratio as compared to the other countries listed in that Appendix. I would just cite the best ratio and the lowest amongst the other countries that have been listed in Appendix B. West Germany has one bed to 93 persons. In the USA, the ratio is 1:210 whereas in Singapore, there is one
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> bed to 327 persons. This obviously shows that the number of beds in Singapore is low proportionately compared to the countries listed in Appendix B. Is this due to the fact that we do not have enough nurses to look after the number of intakes of patients in our hospitals? If that is the reason, then there is a weakness in our hospital system which we need to quickly rectify.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, the Government should increase its nurse training programme and also to look into their working conditions and the reasons why Singaporeans are reluctant to become nurses with a view to encouraging more Singaporeans to take up nursing. After all, nursing is a noble profession.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin (Nominated Member):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to speak. I would like to declare my interest as a surgeon in private practice.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore enjoys high standards of health care. We are a centre of medical excellence in this region. We should aim to build on our past and present achievements by providing even better health for our citizens and better service for patients. We have to ensure that the quality of health, the standard of health care, and the response to emergencies remain among the best in the world, and able to fulfil our aspirations and needs and match our resources.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper on Affordable Health Care is a well written document with some good and innovative concepts but is weighted towards the subject of affordability as the title suggests. The focus on health has to be addressed not only on affordability but also on equity and quality.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us first look at national health expenditure and see the trends for the past 10 years so that we can predict the future direction of health care costs to the nation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1982 to 1984, national health expenditure accounted for 2.5% of the GDP each year. In 1985, it was 2.9% and then 3.4% in 1986, after which it came
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> down to 3% in 1989 and it was 3.1% in 1992. Thus, for the last 10 years, the figure has stayed static at around 3%. Hence, there is nothing in the pattern of our past and present history to suggest that we are going to have an explosion of health care expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1980 and 1990, the average yearly increase in health expenditure for both public and private sectors was 11.2%. However, part of this increase in health spending occurred by virtue of the larger population size. If there is an adjustment made for this population increase, then the average yearly increase comes down to 10%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When inflation is factored into the analysis, the average yearly increase is reduced much more. Thus, the average rise in yearly increase in health spending is also modest and will remain so as our health system is not based mainly on taxation or insurance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Singapore's economic growth, as captured by the per capita GDP or PPP, is something that we can be proud of and even boast about. The per capita GDP for Singapore is US$17,000 while for Japan it is US$18,000. Japan spends about 6% of its GDP on health and this figure has remained relatively constant in spite of social insurance and universal coverage since 1961.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the US, the figure has increased alarmingly. It was 11% in 1989 and 14% in 1992. Drastic surgery is needed to mend America's health care system because it is the biggest public policy mess of the past two decades. There is no valid comparison at all with Singapore's generally well conceived health care system and we should stop this practice of comparing two entirely different entities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With health expenditure of only 3% of GDP, Singapore is getting first world standards of health care at less than half the cost that is incurred in some first world countries. Thus, there is no great burden on the nation as a whole where national health expenditure is concerned.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1084</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us look at the burden of health expenditure on the Government. In 1964, Government health spending was high and accounted for 20% of its main expenditure. It then began declining steadily to 7% in 1970 and in the 90s, the amount spent on health is only about 5-6% of the total Government expenditure. The comparable figure for education is 17% and a whopping 24% for defence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the Government's budget for health is a very prudent figure of 5-6% of the total expenditure. Not only has this figure come down but the Government subsidy of national health expenditure has also been coming down.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the main report of the Review Committee on National Health Policies, and I quote from it:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As a share of Government health expenditure, the subsidy has been falling steadily from 88% in 1965 to 75% in 1985, after which the percentages of subsidies dropped to 57% in 1990."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a percentage of total private consumption expenditure, private health expenditure was only 5.4% of the total compared with 18.6% of the total for education. Thus, we cannot refute the fact that both public and private expenditure on health in Singapore has remained steady and constitutes a very reasonable and manageable proportion of the total national expenditure. Of course, the absolute amount spent on health has increased but so has the absolute amount spent on education, housing, defence, etc. What is important is that we do not spend an increasing percentage of the GDP each year on health so that the other sectors of national life are affected adversely and, so far, there is no evidence to suggest this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I feel that the Ministerial Committee's fears that health costs will escalate much beyond 3% of GDP and we will get into the predicament of the US where the country's competitiveness has become blunted because of the high health component cost are not justified on present evidence. Our experience with health care expenditure has been a positive and heartening one and we should be congratulating ourselves and the Government for a job well done. In fact, many countries can learn from our
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1085</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> experience. Instead, we have adopted an unnecessarily dismal and fearful attitude that our health care costs will escalate beyond control and this has coloured our whole outlook and philosophy towards health care so that affordability has become the key word and excellence seems to be taking a back seat. I think we do ourselves an injustice by thinking along these lines. We can continue to be prudent about health expenditure but excellence will be compromised if there is an over-riding emphasis on cost control.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we have to recognise that since we have become an affluent society with higher expectations and since we are also aging, we can afford to think about changing our mindset to allow national health expenditure to rise gradually, judiciously and equitably without developing a crisis mentality. In fact, the aged of tomorrow will be better off than the aged of today as the former will have better Medisave accounts and more personal financial resources than the aged of today and, therefore, again the picture is not going to be so bleak.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of viewing basic health as a commodity, and I am talking of basic health, we have to some extent adopt the human capital or investment approach which holds that a certain amount of Government subsidies on health care is justified because the social costs and benefits of good health outweigh its private costs and benefits, not least in improving the productivity of the labour force. A worker is only as good as his health.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to refer to the health care philosophy propounded by the Government in the White Paper and make some suggestions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To nurse a healthy nation by promoting good health. The primary health care budget has remained at about 11-13% of the Ministry's recurrent expenditure over the last few years although the absolute amount has gone up. The Health Review Committee recommends that "the Government should substantially increase its budget for health promotion and health education to improve the quality of life for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1086</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Singaporeans." This recommendation has to be pursued with political will and commitment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To promote personal responsibility for one's health and avoid over-reliance on state welfare or medical insurance. We have to recognise that health is determined by a whole range of influences from genetic inheritance, through personal behaviour, family and social circumstances to the physical and social environment - so opportunities and responsibilities for action are widely spread from individuals to Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you one ordinary but pertinent example. Let us look at a household spending less than $1,000 per month. According to the Household Expenditure Survey, this includes 40% of the households in the 1987-88 Household Expenditure Survey.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such households spent proportionately more on food, especially cooked food. Of the main income earners in these households, 47% were production workers and 68% had primary or no education. 72% lived in 3-room or smaller flats. With a female labour force participation rate of just over 50%, many of these households would have both parents in the workforce. This family would have to rely more on hawker food for their daily needs. How can we expect these households to exert personal responsibility for their own health because:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the parents lack the education to understand and be motivated by the healthy lifestyle knowledge disseminated by the Ministry of Health and thus, inadvertently, there are long-term ill effects on the helpless and innocent children;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the parents do not have the time or energy to cook meals at home;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the parents cannot do anything much about the type of oils and other unhealthy ingredients used by the hawkers in their food.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, responsibility for one's health has to be shared by the people, the Government and other relevant personnel and organisations. Where there are
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1087</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> threats to the individual's health from the external world, over which people have little or no control, it is the responsibility of the Government and others to take effective action on behalf of the community as a whole.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another instance of people being unable to take personal responsibility for their own health is when they are born with congenital deformities and inherited medical conditions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to touch on some aspects of Medisave and health financing. The Cost Review Committee concluded that with Medisave, the average Singaporean should be able to meet the cost of hospitalisation comfortably, especially if he or she chooses a ward class according to his or her means. This does not always happen because, in 1992, 18% of patients in Class A wards who used Medisave to pay for their hospitalisation had household incomes of less than $1,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help patients use their Medisave prudently, I would like to offer the following scheme. The withdrawal of Medisave for daily ward charges should be pitched at only B2 and C Classes and not at A Class which is the situation at present. The present system allows a daily withdrawal of $300 for ward charges and, therefore, patients dare to opt for A Class. However, if for Class B, there is a co-payment component of, let us say, 20% for ward charges by the patient himself or herself, and for A Class, a co-payment component of 50%, then the Medisave holder will be deterred from opting for a ward class outside his or her means as ready cash will be needed to pay for A and B1 wards. I am sure the Ministry of Health could change the co-payment figure to one that is more reasonable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme suggested whereby employers can make voluntary contributions into the Medisave accounts of their employees in lieu of part of their traditional medical benefits in kind, up to a limit of 2% of salary, I think this is a regressive scheme as the lower income workers will get less Medisave contributions than the higher income workers
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1088</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> (I am aware of the cut-off level at $7,000). We will have the inverse law operating - "those that need it most, get it least". If a company buys an insurance scheme for all its employees, then the lower income workers are equally covered by the insurance medical benefits as the higher income workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that the new Medisave scheme should not replace the current medical benefits scheme provided by employers. The fear that if we allow tax free employer-provided medical benefits, it will aggravate the problem of over-use of medical services and inflate health costs as in the US is unfounded because, in the US, there is no tax cap, while in Singapore, there is a tax cap at 2% of the payroll.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it is important to retain employer-provided medical insurance to benefit all employees equally because there is, in Singapore, a rising curve of chronic morbidity, especially from diabetes and hypertension. Diabetes affects about 12% of the population above the age of 35 and there is a similar trend for hypertension.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another suggestion I have is for old age. We can think of another form of financing for health care. We could take 1% of the employee's salary from either the Ordinary or Special Account and sequestrate this into an account called "Old Age Medisave" which should only be used by the account holder after the age of 55 years. This scheme will allow self-reliance in old age for medical needs when there may not be much left in the ordinary Medisave account.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, to provide good and affordable basic medical services to all Singaporeans. Conceptually, this appears sound but there are difficulties in practice. There is a lack of national consensus on what is basic medical care (I am talking of treatment as well, not just the conditions) and what is the treatment for many common medical conditions. Let me give you an example. In some subvented hospitals, patients with gallstones are treated conservatively, while in other subvented hospitals, the gallstones are quickly whipped out using
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1089</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> video laparoscopy. Similarly, for osteo-arthritis of the knees, the treatment can vary from conservative treatment to surgery consisting of total knee replacement. Therefore, we need to have a national consensus on the scope and extent of basic medical care for both patients and medical personnel. Guidelines and protocol systems for common medical conditions have to be worked out.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, to rely on competition and market forces to improve services and raise efficiency. The public sector currently provides 75% to 80% of hospital care and 25% of primary health care. This sector employs just over 50% of the doctors in Singapore. Because of the public sector's large share of the medical services, the Government's rate setting influences that of the private sector and cannot, therefore, be considered competitive or market-determined.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another step that will help to improve services and raise efficiency is to integrate our rather fragmented medical health system. Too many admissions into the subvented hospitals occur through the Accident and Emergency Unit and are, therefore, unplanned. There can be better coordination between the referring physician and the speciality in the hospital to which the patient needs admission.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area that needs looking into is the payment to subvented hospitals for subsidised patients on the basis of adjusted patient days. This encourages keeping subsidised patients longer in hospital to maximise the subsidy and discourages ambulatory care. The private and public sectors should be able to learn from each other, to support each other and to provide services for each other. Anyone needing treatment can only benefit from such a development. People who choose to buy health care outside the subvented hospitals and polyclinics benefit the community by taking pressure off the public sector and add to the diversity of provision and choice.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to achieve our health objectives require a shared commitment from all those with responsibilities for health - from Government, medical
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1090</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> personnel and from each individual. What we want is a system whose main objective is quality, the efficient pursuit of health and the equitable distribution of health care resources.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to express my dismay and disappointment with the Finance Minister's statement that female civil servants will continue to be discriminated where medical benefits are concerned. It is very disheartening to the female half of the population that when it suits the policy-makers, they choose not to apply the principle of meritocracy. By announcing this new discriminatory medical financing scheme for civil servants, two basic principles are not being respected. One, the principle of equal pay for equal work that has been adopted by the civil service and, two, the Women's Charter which states that the husband and wife have equal rights and responsibilities in the running of the home and care of the children. I would implore the Finance Minister to reconsider the position if he wants Singapore women to give their full support towards nation building.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Umar Abdul Hamid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Umar Abdul Hamid (Ang Mo Kio GRC)</b>(
  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion. The findings made by the Committee in its mission to identify and resolve the problems of health care costs are welcomed. I agree with the stand that Singaporeans must play the principal role in this matter. All of us must bear the duty of being health-conscious. Staying healthy is a personal responsibility and the incentives provided by the Government should not become an excuse to take health for granted. Moreover, being too dependent on Government handouts and guarantees is not an attitude to be encouraged. We should take advantage of Government subsidies only as a last resort, when we fall sick despite having taken good care of our health. They should not be an incentive to neglect our health.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we maintain good health not through exercise alone, although that is one of the most effective ways. Controlling our diet is equally important. Cutting down on cholesterol intake helps
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1091</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> us avoid heart problem and other diseases. Singaporeans should be more careful about their diet, and this message goes especially for the Malays.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malay food tends to have high cholesterol levels, which is a cause of heart problem. According to 1991 statistics, out of 1,850 deaths among Malays, 845 were due to heart disease. That is 45% of deaths in the Malay community. The percentage is even higher viewed in comparison with other communities. The percentage of all Singaporeans who died of heart disease in 1991 was only 36%. I would like to urge community organisations, which are in closer touch with the masses, to enhance awareness of this issue by conducting dialogues and exhibitions and by distributing pamphlets, especially for the benefit of the Malay community. The Government can also play a role by promoting health-consciousness among Singaporeans while they are still in school. Our school curriculum should include subjects which emphasise the importance of health care and how one can stay healthy. A 'healthy body, healthy mind' campaign should be launched in our schools as a foundation on which we can develop greater health awareness.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to touch on the issue of additional Medisave contributions by employers. This proposal is a good one as more workers, faced with unforeseen circumstances, can thereby find a way out. The existing system only benefits those who fall sick frequently and need prolonged treatment, but provides no incentive for those who have been taking care of their health. The proposed system, where employers have to channel up to 2% of payroll to Medisave, as an incentive, favours those who stay healthy. This is because when an employee stays healthy, the balance in his Medisave will accumulate and the money can then be used to buy insurance to protect him against high medical bills should he fall sick later. This is a better form of assurance, especially for younger workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is concern among some older workers who will be changing jobs
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1092</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> after 1st January 1994. They fear losing out because of this scheme. They fear that the money contributed into their Medisave account will not be sufficient to pay their medical expenses or to buy insurance coverage against prolonged treatment. I hope the Government will provide guidelines for employers so that this group of employees will not be adversely affected by the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to support the proposal to use Medisave for purchase of insurance under MediShield II or for purchase of private insurance. This is a wise idea as it enables the buyer to ensure his ability to pay hospital bills and, at the same time, encourage him to save. In the Malay community, insurance schemes like life and family insurance are still not well-accepted. Maybe as a start, this health insurance would convince some quarters that the benefits might one day save their lives and alleviate their families' burden.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health insurance is rather different in objectives and functions from other insurance schemes. Health insurance is like a tree that provides us shelter. The money saved through the scheme is like the seeds we sow that will grow and flourish and one day yield the benefits for us to reap.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can anticipate illness or misfortune. The existing Medisave might not be sufficient when needed. The flexibility given to CPF members in the use of their Medisave, which is protected by Government, is an opportunity not to be missed. I hope the Government will not impose too many conditions like in the case of CPF endowment policy. The scheme to allow purchase of health insurance through Medisave should be simplified so that many will be able to afford and take advantage of it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Committee members for their contributions to the standards and control of the cost of health in the country. I support the motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Aline K. Wong (Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for Health (Dr Aline K. Wong):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to join in this debate.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1093</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was listening to various Members of the House over the last two days, I heard several of them, including Mr Lau Ping Sum, Dr Wan Soon Bee and Mr Sinnakaruppan, and this afternoon, Dr Kanwaljit Soin as well as Mr Umar Abdul Hamid, mention the importance of preventive health care and health promotion in our overall strategy to combat rises in health care costs. Let me stress that I cannot agree with them more.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, one of the fundamental objectives of the Government's health care philosophy, which is stated very clearly in the White Paper, is that we aim to nurture a healthy nation by promoting good health. The most cost effective way to achieve good health and contain the rise in health care cost is through health promotion and disease prevention.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should look at health promotion and disease prevention not simply from the point of view of the services provided by the Ministry of Health itself. We should include the environmental public health services provided by the Ministry of the Environment. The clean air we enjoy, the clean water that we drink, the excellent sewerage system, even the garbage collection system, all the things that pertain to environmental public health have added to and contributed towards the improvement in our nation's health.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the Ministries of Health and the Environment, we also have to consider the work done by the Ministry of Labour in occupational health services. When we talk about the emphasis on preventive health care and health promotion, particularly in terms of the proportion of the budget spent by MOH itself, I think we have to take this broader perspective of other Ministries being involved in the work concerned. We cannot deny that all these efforts have been sustained over the last two and a half decades and have resulted in improvements in the health status of our nation. And we must keep up with these efforts. There are no two-ways about it. In fact, the principle of emphasising preventive health care and health promotion was given the most prominence, the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1094</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> greatest priority in the Report of the Review Committee on National Health Policies which Dr Kanwaljit Soin also quoted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen the offshoots of our emphasis. In future years, we are going to sustain the Healthy Lifestyle programme which includes various major thrusts to educate Singaporeans and encourage them to lead a healthy lifestyle, including having a healthy diet, regular exercise, control obesity, avoid smoking, etc.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A healthy diet, nutrition. We have in this programme put a great deal of emphasis on educating the Singapore public to eat a healthy diet - less fat, low cholesterol, low calories - and this will help to reduce the risk factors associated with lifestyle diseases.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Kanwaljit Soin mentioned the low income families and perhaps generally families where the wives are working, that they have no time, they have no choice, they have to eat at hawker stalls. I question her hypothesis that people have no choice. I think if they are educated enough, they will know how to choose. There is a great variety of food in the hawker centres. In fact, the health promotion effort of the MOH does not say, "Thou shalt not eat in hawker centres." We just say that you should plan your diet in a more balanced manner. You can have a good meal combining vegetables with, say, fish, tahu and other food which is good in nutritional value. You can do that.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the school canteens, we have been promoting healthy food. We have been educating the teachers who have been educating the food vendors about providing a more balanced and more healthy diet. Some schools and workplace canteens have adopted green labelling of foods - green labelling not in terms of environmental friendliness, but in terms of healthy nutrition, healthy diet, which will promote our health.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think education is a very important part of our health promotion effort and we must continue to pump the message. We must continue to encourage Singaporeans and provide a conducive environment for them to sustain this healthy lifestyle.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1095</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must take responsibility for maintaining their good health. You have to make some effort to learn about these things because it is good for you. If you keep fit and healthy, you do not need to see doctors. You do not need to be hospitalised. You do not need to draw from your Medisave.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, some Members mentioned that we should offer incentives for people to keep fit and stay healthy. While we are all out for innovative ideas, lucky draws, incentives, rewards and prizes for doing exercise regularly would not be the things to do. In Medisave there is already an in-built incentive for people to stay healthy. If you do not need hospitalisation, Medisave is your money, you keep it. And then the rewards also come from your enjoying a much better quality of life, apart from the nation having a more productive workforce.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper reiterates the Government's commitment to providing good and affordable basic medical services to all Singaporeans. I think good primary health care services are part and parcel of good basic medical services. By all accounts, we have a good primary health care system, and services are at affordable prices. When we talk about the proportion of the health budget spent on primary care and how this proportion has not increased over the years, we must look at the quality of the service that we have already got. We must look at the outcome of all the efforts that we have made, in terms of the health and improvements in Singaporeans' quality of life. Do you mean to say that you must spend an increasing percentage of the budget before you say there have been improvements in the status of people's health? I do not think so. Do you mean to say that absolute amounts do not matter? I do not think so. You build a clinic. It costs so many millions of dollars. The absolute amount matters. It is not just a matter of percentage. And we have done very well by all accounts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also note that the bulk of primary health care is delivered by the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> general practitioners in the private sector. We must not always just say that the Government must do this and must do that. We must work together. The private sector and the public sector must complement each other. In this case, in primary health care, we have always had the private GPs who have delivered very good primary care to the greatest majority, three-quarters of the population. The Government's role is to concentrate its resources on the lower income groups who need the subsidies most.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polyclinics offer services with about 50% subsidy. Over the years, and I think Dr Kanwaljit Soin once quoted the number, not on this occasion but previously, the attendances in polyclinics have declined from 3.9 million in 1980 to 2.7 million in 1991, and 2.9 million in 1992. This is mainly due to two reasons. Firstly, there are now more GPs and their clinics are conveniently located near to the patients' homes. Secondly, Singaporeans are generally better off. They can afford the more personalised services of the GPs. And the GPs' charges are affordable. So the Government's role is to complement the role of the private sector, concentrate resources on the lower income groups and indeed among our patients, we have been seeing more lower income patients. Also, we have been seeing more patients with chronic illnesses. With the Government's subsidy, patients with chronic illnesses pay much less as compared to when they see a GP. So patients, especially elderly patients, with chronic illnesses are benefiting from the subsidised services of the Government polyclinics.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GPs, being the main provider of primary health care, have a very important role to play. And I hope to see them playing a greater role in future in patient education, in teaching the patients how to adopt healthy lifestyles, to prevent the onset of disease and also to teach them how to take care of themselves in managing their illnesses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For certain chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes which Dr Kanwaljit Soin mentioned, as well as Mr Lau Ping Sum yesterday, they are two
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> very good examples of illnesses where management by GPs and self-care by patients can help to control the illness as well as prevent further complications. In my view, the GPs in the private sector have a very important role to play. They must, as Dr Wan Soon Bee said, not just cure disease, but they must also be teachers. They must have a caring heart and the compassion for the patients' suffering to educate them on how to manage their illness and take care of themselves.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to see GPs work more closely with the polyclinics. For example, they can utilise more of the services provided, such as diabetic eye screening that we have introduced in our polyclinics, the laboratory services, the X-ray services, which the GPs may not have on their premises. They can also work more closely with the specialists in Government hospitals when the patients need to be referred for specialist care. In fact, some of the hospitals are already taking the initiative to reach out to the GPs in their catchment zones, such as offering continuous medical education courses and holding monthly focal discussions on how the specialists in the public sector can work more closely with the private sector GPs in order to better take care of their patients. So we are working with providers of health care in the various sectors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many countries with huge national expenditures are coming to realise the importance of primary health care doctors acting as gatekeepers to the expensive specialist care. The most effective way that the GPs can serve as gatekeepers is through the practice of family medicine. I think one of our goals in the immediate future is to encourage the population to stick to the family doctor. Do not hop among doctors. Allow doctors to know your medical history and that of your family members, so that they can follow your progress closely and become the gatekeepers for your health. When you need specialist care they can refer you to a specialist with the particular expertise.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we giving up on excellence when we say that we cap the rate of increase in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1098</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the number of specialists? Are we back tracking on excellence? I do not think so. Excellence is already a social ethos among Singaporeans. We should continue to nurture the idea of excellence. We reach for excellence in many fields. But we must also realise that our resources are limited. We must concentrate resources in areas where we are likely to do well, where there is a bulk of patient load and where there is a concentration of expertise. So we, each and everyone, must not go for excellence in all kinds of areas. This is the strategy that we adopt in developing excellence in certain medical services.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the national centres such as the Eye Centre, the Skin Centre, and we are going to have a Heart Centre and a Cancer Centre. Tan Tock Seng Hospital is going to develop a neuroscience institute. All these will allow people to develop medical excellence in these areas. It does not necessarily mean that we would adopt the most recent high-tech and most expensive equipment. I think excellence should also be interpreted in terms of excellence in rendering basic medical care which will cure you and which will allow for a better quality of life. I do not see back tracking. In fact, we should interpret excellence in terms of our limited resources and how we strategise to achieve the most cost-effective and the best results for us.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to touch on the very important issue of the care of the elderly. Some Members of the House, including Mr Chin Harn Tong and Mrs Yu-Foo, have mentioned this yesterday. As the proportion of the elderly increases rapidly in the coming two decades, we are making preparations to provide a whole range of health care services for them. But let me emphasise that the care of the elderly is not and should not be confined to the provision of geriatric beds in hospitals. These should be used mainly for acute illness. Hospitalisation is for acute illness. Very often, the elderly patients do not require hospitalisation for their chronic illnesses. Hence, we are developing a whole range of services, including community hospitals, day hospitals, rehabilitative services and community-based care, such as nursing homes, home
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1099</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> nursing and home support services as well as hospice care. These are cost-effective methods of providing care for the elderly which will reduce the financial burden of medical care for them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we have announced the formation of regional networks of services for the elderly. Based on the present catchment zones of the acute hospitals, there will be three regions. In the western region will be the Geriatric Department at Alexandra Hospital; in the central region, the Geriatric Department at Tan Tock Seng Hospital; and in the east, the Geriatric Department at Changi Hospital and the future general hospital in Simei. Each of these Geriatric Departments will act to coordinate its own regional network of services, such as community-based services, community hospitals and so on, in order to provide for the appropriate level of care for the elderly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we are working closely with the private sector. We are working closely with both the specialists and the GPs, and with the voluntary organisations, in order to provide Singaporeans with a very good and well integrated network of services. The Ministry of Health will work very closely with all the care providers. Thus, I do not see how the Government can be accused of over-emphasising self-responsibility of the individual and not doing its bit. Provision for the health care needs of the population is shared between the public sector, private sector and the voluntary organisations.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I support the motion standing in the name of the Minister for Trade and Industry.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also accept the Government's objectives and principles on health care, as mentioned in the White Paper, particularly two of the principles which I think are the most important. First, the role of the Government. The Government assures all Singaporeans, including the poor, that they will receive medical and health care, and that the Government shall intervene, if necessary, to compensate for any market failure. In so far as medical service
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1100</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> is concerned, the Government is not only the regulator but also the provider and, for that matter, the biggest provider.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second important principle is the personal responsibility in health care. Every individual must be responsible for his or her own physical and mental health. Maintaining good health will reduce one's demand for medical services. As it is said, prevention is better than cure. The hon. Member, Mr Cheo Chai Chen, said, "Nobody wants to be sick." The hon. Member, Mr Low Thia Khiang, also said, "The individual should not be held responsible for his sickness." I strongly believe that the Government does not wish any of its citizens to be sick because this will affect our manpower, reduce production and productivity; the Government will also have to pay more medical subsidy. However, growing old, getting sick and dying is a process which is inevitable in life. When a person has unfortunately fallen ill, he or members of his family will have to pay at least part of the medical cost. On the other hand, the individual has, to a large extent, the right of choice. He could choose the hospital, the type of ward that he wants to be admitted to, and the method to pay for his medical fees and even the choice of doctors. However, the degree of freedom to choose must be directly proportional to his willingness to pay for the medical fee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 3rd November 1993, the Feedback Unit held a dialogue session with some 45 doctors, unionists, community leaders and employers to discuss the White Paper. I have already submitted the minutes of the dialogue session to the Ministers in charge. Here, I would like to sum up some of the main points at the dialogue sessions, and add on my personal views for the Ministers' consideration and response.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First issue - demand and expectations. The Cost Review Committee's Report mentioned that in 1980, 80% of the patients were hospitalised in Class C wards. By 1992, the number of C class patients dropped to only 21%. This may be due to rising expectation of our people, but can it also be a reflection of the fact that our Class C beds are being reduced
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1101</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> drastically? The Government has been emphasising that the standard of medical treatment in Class C wards is no different from that in the Class B or Class A wards. In a market economy, people's perception of "you get what you pay for" is deep-rooted. Therefore, it is not easy to convince the people that patients in different class wards would receive the same standard of medical treatment. Coupled with the problem of face-saving and the availability of Medisave, it is extremely difficult to ask the people not to opt for higher class wards beyond their means. At the same time, this would also involve some "emotional" and "rational" issues. When a patient is hospitalised, he or members of his family, in order to relieve the patient of his suffering, more often than not, would make some very emotional rather than rational choices. High cost or not, they would not care. They would stay in first and think of the consequences later. So under such circumstances, is the Government's plan to reduce Class C beds from the present 26% to 18% by the year 2010 and to reduce the combined Class C, B2 and B2+ beds from 53% to 50% and at the same time to increase private hospital beds from 21% to 30%, a move in the right direction? Will this further encourage the trend of staying in higher class wards?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue that was raised at the dialogue session was the question of euthanasia, which is an act to terminate the pain and sufferings of terminally-ill patients by allowing them to pass away painlessly. The objective is to terminate the patient's pain and sufferings, and at the same time to alleviate the burden and hardship of the family members, and of course, the medical expenses. The basic medical package does not include the extension of life by artificial means. According to a report in the Lianhe Zaobao on 9th November, in the United States, approximately 1/3 of a person's total lifelong medical expenses are spent on the last year of his life. On the other hand, some people hold the view that life is a gift from God. It is therefore not for the doctor or, for that matter, any layman to decide when to terminate the life of the patient. Children who are filial would
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> normally urge the doctors to try and extend the life of their terminally-ill parents. This is a sensitive issue. It involves not only medical judgment but also religious, legal and social issues as well. A number of participants in our dialogue session advocated that the matter be discussed publicly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our aging population, I think we should formulate the proper policy on this matter as soon as possible. For example, will the Government consider making euthanasia legal, or whether Government accepts "living will" by the individual, permitting the doctors to choose not to extend his life with artificial means in the event of his falling into a coma, or to authorise his next-of-kin to make a decision? Yesterday, the Minister for Health announced that the Government will not accept this practice of euthanasia. However, I think we should look into this matter more carefully.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third issue is the supply of doctors. Several doctors who participated in the dialogue session agree to limit the number of doctors. They felt that the private clinics in HDB estates were competing very fiercely with one another and the clinics have to meet the ever increasing rental and manpower costs. One participant suggested that the HDB should limit the number of neighbourhood clinics in each estate. This is a very natural response by the doctors. But two community leaders who participated in the dialogue session also agreed to limit the number of doctors. They are worried that over-competition would result in a drop in the number of patients per clinic and, thus, prompting the doctors to increase their consultation fees, in order to recover their overhead expenses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When touching on the supply side, the focus of the discussion was diverted to the issue of traditional medicine. Some people felt that the Government should regulate the practice of traditional medicine. But some others felt that the Government had never recognised the legality of traditional medicine and hence it has no moral authority to regulate it. After the publication of Dr Aline Wong's Report, I mentioned in this House, for the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1103</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> benefit of the Ministry of Health, that traditional medicine had reached out to the people and were generally cheaper than western medicine. On the other hand, among the physicians who are practising traditional medicine, the good and bad ones are intermingled. Moreover, the herbs used are not systematically authenticated. I suggest that the Ministry of Health should not neglect the value of traditional medicine, but it should look squarely at the roles that traditional medicine can play in our health care system.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last issue in our dialogue session was on the financing of health care. Generally speaking, most or almost all the participants at the dialogue session accepted the principle that the patients should bear part of the medical expenses. Even the poor people who request for waiver of medical fees or for instalment payments would not talk about their problems openly for fear of "losing face", they too have self-respect. So we must not assume that everyone in the lower-income group would keep on asking for free medical service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our people are worried that with the ever increasing medical cost, there will come a day in future that they will not be able to afford medical and health care. I agree with the Minister for Trade and Industry that this is not just a question of who is paying the medical expenses, but also a question of how to pay the expenses. Each of the individual methods of financing has its own problems. For example, on the provision of medical benefits by employers, the employees consider it as a benefit over and above their wages, but the employers take it as part of their labour cost. The employees feel that the capping of 2% on the total payroll for tax deductible medical expenses for them will result in their employers reducing the provision of medical benefits. On the other hand, the employers feel that the unions may exert pressure on them to increase medical benefits for employees because total medical bill is currently still lower than 2% of the total payroll. Both sides are having
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1104</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> mutual doubts and suspicion, and it is certainly not doing any good to our employer-employee relationship.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper's recommendation to incorporate the medical benefits provided by employers into the national Medisave and MediShield systems is indeed a constructive suggestion. On the use of Medisave and the question of balance billing for Medisave patients, some of our colleagues in Parliament had already touched on and, in fact, the Minister for Health had already given his answer yesterday. I do not wish to repeat it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to raise an observation as a conclusion. The objectives and guiding principles in the White Paper form the basis for MPs and people to discuss. I hope the Ministers concerned would accommodate the different views and perspectives of the various quarters, and consider implementing some of these suggestions which are feasible. This is not a debate in which we want to find a winner. Even if our own reasoning and perspective are correct, we should also try to explain to our people to convince them in order to ensure that our medical and health care system is excellent beyond doubt.

  <!-- Dr Toh Keng Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Toh Keng Kiat (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate on this White Paper. I must first declare my interest as a practising physician in the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore spends only 3.1% of our GDP on health but our citizens enjoy a standard of care that surpasses the OECD in many areas. Why then have we needed three Ministerial Committees in the last two years and now three days of parliamentary debate to discuss this issue of cost of health care? The answer must be the Government's determination not to allow Singapore to be bogged down in the same quagmire of stifling health care costs that Britain, the United States and some European countries are in today. The message is clear: it is not how much one spends on health services but what one spends it on that matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1105</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good medicine alone does not make our citizens live longer nor by itself give our infants a better chance of survival. Let me illustrate. The morbidity and mortality from rheumatic heart disease has fallen, not because the surgeons and cardiologists are better at treating them, but also because of the lower incidence of rheumatic fever due to better living conditions, cleaner environment and better nutrition. I am glad Dr Aline Wong has already mentioned these points, and I share her sentiments that the accolades for what we have achieved in health care today should not only belong to the profession or to the Ministry of Health, but be shared by those in the Ministry of the Environment as well as the Ministry of Labour.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper has outlined what will keep health care cost down. But the first question is: is it already beyond affordability? Apparently, this is so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two events are responsible for this - the liberal use of Medisave by CPF account holders and the restructuring of Government hospitals. Medisave, which is a savings scheme to meet hospitalisation expenses after retirement, was at one time wrongly perceived by the people as citizens' money which was locked away by the Government. This, of course, was fuelled in some ways by Opposition politicians during elections. Therefore, on every occasion that it could be or had to be drawn upon, the practice was to use the maximum allowable or available. The problem was compounded in the early days of restructuring of the Government hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was at the dialogue session with Dr Ow, and I would like to reiterate his comments on the C Class beds. The removal of the highly subsidised C Class beds drove those who could not afford it to opt for the more costly ones at the upper end of the scale. They were exposed to creature comforts and costly high technology medicine which was subsidised. Therefore, when a reduction of these subsidies and upward revision of charges came, matters worsened. A more liberal and lucrative consultancy fee scheme, which was introduced to keep
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1106</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> specialists from resigning, did not help. It led to excesses which have only now been put right. It was this limitation of choice and the narrowing of the differential in prices between the private and the public sectors, coupled with the ready availability of private hospital beds and a more personal care by a specialist of one's choice, even within the ward beds, which were the push and pull factors that led to increased use of private sector health care services.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a while, the intense rivalry between the two public institutions which offer tertiary health care exposed our population to esoteric, expensive and equivocal treatment modalities in high-tech medicine. The public were treated to an almost daily media blitz on advances in medicine which each had acquired. Expectations were raised and, with it, the demand for more health care.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have outlined what I believe are the aggravating factors on perceptions of unaffordability in health care. The philosophies in the White Paper cannot be faulted. I subscribe to the ideals fully but I cannot agree with the reasons put forth for some of the changes that are to come. The private health care sector has significantly contributed to Singapore's economic growth as a regional medical centre of excellence. Its personnel-intensive services employ a large number of Singaporeans. It takes care of 75% of the outpatient and 25% inpatient health needs of Singaporeans. Its only fault seems to be that it has done its thing too well. For this, it has earned the opprobrium for what has gone wrong in health care and inflicted upon itself the curbs that are to come.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high earning capacity outside has been identified as the cause of specialists migrating to the private sector. Some have even hinted of less than honourable means for this high income. Most doctors are still men of honour who abide by the tenets of the Hippocratic Oath and the teachings of Aesculapius. To deny that this is so is to admit the failing of our medical school which selected and trained them. Admittedly, there must be errant doctors just as there are dishonest politicians and crooked lawyers. Do we need to punish a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1107</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> whole community for a few black sheep? When good men were hard to come by for ministerial posts, the then Prime Minister Lee proposed better salaries for the Cabinet so that members would not leave to become bankers or CEOs. When the RSAF lost its pilots to the commercial airlines, the Minister for Defence suggested higher pay to retain them. We did not cap the salaries of our bankers, our CEOs, or our SIA pilots so that Cabinet will have its Ministers and the RSAF its pilots. Why cap the fees of doctors in the private practice so that the ranks of Government consultants will stay repleted?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper on Affordable Health Care is not just about costs. It is also a total reform of the health services. From being a provider, the Government has changed its role to that of a broker for health services, as well as an auditor and a policeman. It has taken upon itself the onus of determining a basic medical package for all Singaporeans. Yesterday, we heard the Minister for Health reassuring us of the comprehensiveness of this package. But I would like to emphasise that it is not the extent of this coverage but rather the content, or level of care, that we want to give to each specific sickness within this package that matters.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of "basic" must, therefore, always remain clear. At OECD levels, "basic" will be state-of-the-art to the underdeveloped and the developing. During the Cultural Revolution, I had occasion to travel in China. My guide appeared to be a commissar of the Communist Party. Like his countrymen, his basic clothing needs were taken care of. Everyone wore the universal Mao jacket, but I noticed a difference. His was tailored in garbedine, theirs in drill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the most common and obvious political issues related to health is based upon the charge that access to medical care is inequitable. Too drastic a return to basic health services will leave Singapore in the backwaters of medical progress when the rich and those with the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1108</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> power and the connections can go abroad for second opinions or the best in care but children of a lesser God will have to make do with second best.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Managed health care is also not necessarily the best although it may be the cheapest. The Rochester New York experience had often been cited in the past as a good model in the USA to follow where against a national budget of 14% GDP, there were surpluses. Large companies, like Xerox and Kodak, call the shots and hospitals and physicians were made to charge 30% less than elsewhere in the US for an equivalent service. I have been to Rochester, I have discussed this with doctors there, and I am told that as a consequence of this low-priced packaging, high calibre physicians are hard to come by in Rochester today and the quality of care has suffered. The White Paper has also hinted of mechanisms, like the Diagnosis Related Groups, to control hospital charges. This can only work where there is an economy of scale when what one loses on the swings one gains on the roundabouts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On medical research and training of doctors, there will also be restraints. Research is important to teaching institutions. It keeps the academic staff in contact with the colleagues around the world and informed of what is happening at the frontiers of medicine. It nurtures an enquiring and analytical mind. It develops brain power and brain power is what keeps Singapore going. Research must not be measured in monetary terms or by a direct applicability of the knowledge gained. The White Paper has identified bone marrow transplants as research treatment that needs strong justification. Sir, I beg the Minister to reconsider this. Like renal transplant, it offers the only hope of a cure for patients with leukaemia and some forms of acquired and hereditary blood disease. Where a suitable donor is available, bone marrow transplant should be offered, otherwise it makes the treatment of leukaemic patients temporary and futile, for cures without a marrow transplant are anecdotal and relapses, after a brief remission, almost a certainty.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1109</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> In most countries, the bone marrow transplant is always a part of the leukaemia package.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of supply of doctors, the White Paper has warned against the training of too many. Even as I was gathering my thoughts for this debate, the Government came out with the announcement that the number of overseas universities approved, where Singapore students can read medicine, has been reduced from 176 to 28. There is also a second level of control in that only 30 graduates each year from these institutions will be registered to practise. Sir, it is a moral obligation for the Government to register all graduates from these already approved institutions even if the number exceeds 30 in any one year, which I think is a highly improbable event. Many of these universities have already closed their doors to foreigners and others have set such a high standard of entry that few, if any, Singaporeans will make the grade.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A control of the number of doctors, it is said, is important because the medical market is a failed market when it comes to supply and demand. A surplus, it seems, will lead to provider-driven demand due to the profession's autonomy. Sure, doctors do have professional autonomy, but so do architects, lawyers and engineers. Few doctors have translated their autonomy into a radical monopoly. Yet market forces have been allowed to prevail when it comes to the allocation of HDB premises for medical practices. The economic research department of a local bank has found that rentals form 40%, at 1990 prices, of the recurring cost in running a clinic. Any cost must ultimately find its way into the patient's bill. Now that the curbs will be imposed, it will keep the cost of health care down if the Government will reconsider an earlier request of mine in this House for preferential rates and purchase prices of HDB units to be used as medical clinics but under restricted tenure. Other tradesmen, businesses and tenants should have no cause for complaint, unless they opt to subject themselves to the same restrictions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper has focused heavily on the control of doctors and hospitals to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1110</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> curb the rising cost of health care. It has remained silent on pharmaceutical trade and providers of diagnostic or ancillary services. These must surely have a role in determining health care costs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is prudent planning that health care cost be controlled. It is also good politics. But sound policies must not be implemented in expediency or with ambivalence as this can only lead to more problems for the future. Until we find an even keel, I do not know what direction medicine will be heading in Singapore. When our forefathers bound the feet of their women to restrict their movement, they also hindered their growth and mobility. In carrying out the proposals of the White Paper, I would like to make some suggestions:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medisave. Restriction on balance billing will come in late 1994. In its implementation, I hope consideration will be given to situations where there is more than one specialist looking after the same patient, or when an ill patient requires a doctor to visit him more than once a day, sometimes after office hours or at night. To discourage frivolous use of Medisave, perhaps a bonus scheme of higher interest earned for savings left undrawn for a certain period of time could be considered. Once the maximum sum has been reached, interest accrued should remain in the Medisave for use in retirement and not be channelled back into the Ordinary Account.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic health care. Steps should be taken to guard against the evolution of a system where the rich, powerful and those with connections can have access to state-of-the-art care overseas, or the lower-income groups have to make do with what is deemed best for them. The Government should also retain enough of facilities to cater to the needs of retirees, the aged, the poor and the pensioners instead of just being a health care broker. As the emphasis will be on primary health care and family medicine, the Department of Family Medicine in our university should be strengthened. At present, it is only an appendage of a larger unit which is basically concerned with gathering health statistics.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1111</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integration of public and private sectors. As one perennial problem is doctor migration from the public sector to private practice, especially at the specialist level, we should think of a system where we can integrate the two. Money alone is not the push or pull force. Job satisfaction as is derived from a lower patient-load and a more personalised style of practice are also factors involved. A solution to this problem is to have a common career path for all doctors with a compulsory stint in public service for a defined period during the earlier years as junior doctors and specialists to be followed by compulsory exit by everyone to the private sector. Only the best are to be retained in Government service or in academia with commensurate financial rewards and other compensations. They will be the teachers, senior consultants, State surgeons and physicians.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPI plus X factor. The Minister has already assured the House yesterday that when this increases, revenue will also increase by tandem changes in the subsidy and cost recovery within the context of the long term subsidy targets and not by cost recovery alone. The White Paper, on page 34, however, states that one incentive to subvented hospitals to improve service "must be a profitable bottom line." Sir, the Public Accounts Committee must have anticipated this as it has stated in page 4 of its Report to Parliament presented on 6th November 1992 that:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"`While cost increases are inevitable over time, the MOH should bear in mind, when reviewing its fee increases, that the objective of restructuring the hospitals is not to enable them to make profits or even to recover costs, but to enable them to work more efficiently.'"
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Health Council. The White Paper has proposed a Medical Fees Council to review fees periodically. I would like to suggest a National Health Council instead, with increased functions. There will be a committee not only to review fees but to act as an Ombudsman to arbitrate in complaints against overcharging, another to review the health care needs of Singaporeans and re-define the basic health package periodically, and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1112</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> a third to deal with ethical and moral issues. The Minister for Health has also commented on this. It is important because of the anticipated contraction in the number of intensive care beds. When a facility becomes limited in supply, rationing follows. In rationing, there must be priorities and someone has to suffer. By his training, a doctor will be hard put to turn off respirators or withdraw life-sustaining lines.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I thank you for this opportunity to participate in the debate on the White Paper. I support the philosophies expounded therein, but I must disagree with the reasons behind some of those reforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, may I ask the Member how would he rate the B2 and class C medical services being delivered in the subsidised hospitals now?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Keng Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Toh Keng Kiat:</b> I think they are good value for the money that the patient spends.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, would he also agree that food items are more essential than medical services?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Keng Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Toh Keng Kiat:</b> No, I do not think so. I think medical services are more important.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> You mean when food becomes so expensive, people cannot afford them and in the end we should still give priority to medical services rather than ensuring that Singaporeans have a full stomach?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Keng Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Toh Keng Kiat:</b> Sir, can the Minister please repeat what he has said?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, he has asked that medical services be given priority, that we should put medical services on a pedestal and ensure that in all our estates, shops be specifically set aside only for doctors. If we have to set aside shops on the basis of importance, should we not set aside shops for the most basic item, which is food, and therefore we should call on HDB to ensure that certain shops in every HDB estate be set aside only for provision shops, so that the people can have access
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1113</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to shops which have very low rentals and therefore the food items will be even cheaper?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Keng Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Toh Keng Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Minister has missed the point. I said preferential rates of rental and purchase prices but under a restricted tenure. I think I brought this point up also at the feedback dialogue session, in the sense that there is now a free-for-all system. In other words, if there are 50 shops available in a HDB precinct for rental or for purchase, 50 doctors could bid for them. And if they overbid all the other people, we could end up with 50 clinics within a district and no clinics in other areas of the same estate. It will be a more equitable distribution if there is some kind of control. Now that we have got control on so many things, we could also control the distribution of clinics within a housing estate so that there will be doctors available in all areas within a district.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a restricted tenure, there should be no complaints because we can control the fees. Therefore, the savings on rentals and purchase prices can be passed back to the consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I am glad he clarified about the B2 and C class and about his thoughts on special preferences being given to doctors. In the White Paper, we have already stated very clearly that the basic package would contain the services that are already available in the existing class B2 and C and the quality will be maintained. Dr Toh has just mentioned that people who are rich can get services, but children of workers will be left with a very poor level of service. I think that is trying to cause unnecessary alarm and trying to misinterpret what has been very clearly stated in the White Paper.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the same scenario about HDB shops can apply to provision shops, that is, there could be 50 provision shops in one estate and zero in another estate. Surely, we must leave it to market forces to ensure that there is a good distribution of shops and that if there is a good distribution of shops, there will be enough competition and that the services will be available and affordable to everybody,
  <br>

  <br> rather than putting the medical profession on a separate pedestal and giving them special treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Harun bin A. Ghani (Hong Kah GRC)</b>(
  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we have read in the newspapers of the many comments and praises about the White Paper on Affordable Health Care. I share the public pleasure with the findings of the Committee as presented in the White Paper and I fully support them. At the same time, though I do not belong to the medical community, I would like to offer some views.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Affordable Medical Care</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This topic is dealt with under two headings. Firstly, the expectations and the education of the public seeking medical attention; secondly, provision of additional care through excessive services by doctors, general practitioners, specialists, surgeons, for example, through the use of CT scan, ultrasound and scopes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Education - Expectations of the Public</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advancement in knowledge and equipment for diagnosis and the patient management is described in newspapers and periodicals. News about a new medical equipment is usually accompanied by descriptions of how conveniently the patient can be managed with the new equipment. Usually these descriptions are true, but improper use of such equipment would increase costs with no definite benefit to the patient. For example, the use of ultrasound for normal pregnancies. CT scan is useful for diagnosis of stroke and stroke management but certainly not for diagnosis of chest infections, where a simple chest X-ray would help in such cases. Members of the public is familiar with descriptions and explanations of the use of such equipment, but the specific use of the instrument may not be known. Conducting a head scan or using ultrasound or scope without first being explained the use of such procedure is improper, because all this would increase costs. What the public must be concerned with is:
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1115</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) gaining more information on health care - this has just been dealt with by the Minister of State for Health;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii) practising a healthy lifestyle such as refraining from smoking, over-eating or high consumption of alcohol;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii) getting proper information about chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, stroke, heart disease, occur or are hereditable in his family that he could prevent or those that can be delayed by adopting a healthy lifestyle;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv) going for regular medical check-ups with the family doctor or at outpatient clinics, discussing medical problems with the doctors and getting advice on how to maintain one's health and prevent illness;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patient can be referred to a specialist at a hospital for evaluation, if necessary, only after he has been advised and examined by the family doctor or the outpatient clinic doctor. Parents are willing to follow the procedures for immunization and medical examination of their children, so they should be prepared to do the same for themselves.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the measures the public can take if health cost is to be reduced. The public are the consumers of health cost. The public make demands on the system of health care, the public expects the system to rectify the damage caused to their bodies by their own adverse lifestyles. The public has the responsibility to educate themselves on self-care, consulting their family doctors and not immediately seeing a specialist to get advice on how to maintain their health or to redeem it when it fails on account of their poor lifestyles. We are prepared to spend on the maintenance of our car and on life insurance, but we neglect our own medical examination every year.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Research</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, research is expensive but it is also necessary. As noted in the White
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1116</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Paper, we have to carry out clinical research if we want to maintain our status as the leader in the medical field in South-East Asia. Clinical research helps us to better understand the patterns of diseases in our population and with better understanding, health improvement measures can be taken and we can even thereby reduce costs - this has also been dealt with by the Minister of State for Health earlier. For example, we know that 8.6% - this is the figure for 1992 - of Singaporeans suffer from diabetes. But we also know that, within the population, the incidence is highest among Indians and Malays - the rates are 8% for Chinese, 9.3% for Malays and 12.9% for Indians.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Alternative Medical Therapy</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The costs for pharmaceuticals have continued to rise. This is due to the marketing of new drugs and claims by pharmaceutical companies that their new drugs are better, more potent, etc. Not all such claims are necessarily correct. Again, there is a possibility, and I stress "possibility", that some doctors are inclined to believe that the "new is better and the old is to be discarded". This might not be completely valid. If it was so, then many of the old drugs that are still being used today would not have stood the test of time. For instance, Penicillin V, which was discovered in 1945, is still useful today. The notion that new must mean better is apparent in the use of antibiotics. For instance, Augmentin, which is quite as good as Amoxycillin in many clinical situations. A course of Augmentin costs $20 whereas Amoxycillin is only $1. The difference is just too much. Also, ordinary, cheaper drugs might not necessarily be less effective than patented medicine. Alternative medical therapy should be looked at in view of the high cost of present pharmaceuticals. However, before alternative medical therapy can be introduced, research has to be conducted to determine the benefits and the problems that might arise with such therapies. Of course, we need to evaluate the benefits and the cost-effectiveness.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Institute of Health in America will introduce programmes to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1117</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> evaluate alternative medical therapies and it will be exciting to see the direction they will take in the selection in alternative therapies to assess, methods of assessment and what benefits to expect.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Curbing of Over-servicing</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment for services might, and again I stress "might", lead to misuse because we cannot teach doctors not to work towards acquiring more money. The over-servicing of patients is the way through which doctors generate an income for themselves. Over-servicing includes extra investigations, surgical procedures that might not be necessary or the use of high-tech equipment, such as surgical microscope for surgery. Indications can be made for the use of high tech equipment for surgery but the doctor must ask himself honestly whether his application will benefit the patient more than it does himself financially. I think the question of over-servicing can be resolved by paying doctors in Government and restructured hospitals fixed salaries. The pay should be increased but let it be "fixed" salary. There are still good doctors and within a fixed salary structure the temptation for more money can be eliminated. Doctors should not take advantage of a patient's situation and profit from him.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, high-tech procedures are generated by:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) doctors seeking to promote themselves as better than their colleagues.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equipment only assist a good doctor in his performance but does not make a brilliant doctor, whether in medicine or surgery. Advertisement on the presence of high-tech equipment attracts patients' attention to the hospitals concerned but they would not necessarily benefit from them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii) requests by patients themselves.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients nowadays tend to ask for what they want and not what is advised by the doctor. CT scan, for example, is very useful. Its effectiveness has been accepted in the medical field but the patient only thinks of the brouhaha over its wonders
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1118</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and would press for its use even if it might not be necessary. Doctors would normally accede to the patient's request for various reasons. One of which is that it is income generating.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii) operations and procedures conducted by junior doctors or housemen under a senior staff are usually less expensive.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv) excessive research, laboratory studies and X-ray ultrasound, MRI and CT scans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v) over prescriptions in quantity and use of new and expensive pharmaceuticals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rectifying the mistakes caused by such excessive services is difficult. This depends on:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) a sense of responsibility to contain cost.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All doctors serving in medical institutions must be educated on cost calculations. We must ask ourselves if there really are two standards of health care for our citizens or two standards of treatment of patients. This question must be carefully examined. If we say there are two standards of care, we are putting the less well-off section of our population at a disadvantage. If we say there are two standards of cost, then we must ask why this is necessary. Does a higher cost of care mean better care or is it due to excessive services, unnecessary services, expensive equipment, etc.? Cost comparisons can be made between the supposedly better and more expensive hospitals, such as NUH and SGH, and others like Alexandra Hospital. Data for such cost comparisons can be obtained from the authorities concerned. What we should ask ourselves is, who will benefit? The patient, the doctor or the hospital? If all existing hospitals now already have subsidised C class beds, do we need one specially set aside as a Government hospital, for the less well-off? The "no frills" hospital gives the public the wrong impression. They tend to think that:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) since it is meant for the less well-off, the quality of medical care will be less;
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1119</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) the medicine given will be of lower quality;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) the doctors are of lesser "quality" and that only "quality" doctors are available in the restructured hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably 95% of patients are already adequately treated in any hospital in Singapore and maybe only 5% really requires special care and special equipment to maznage them. This cannot be a valid reason for charging high fees, money which is then spent on advertisements and high-tech equipment and medicine. Unnecessarily allowing doctors in public institutions built with public funds to generate income for themselves and for their institutions may not be proper. Are we afraid that our doctors would leave these institutions to work in truly private hospitals such as Mount Elizabeth and Gleneagles? Singapore has a ratio of 1 doctor to 850 population. Not so much work is available in private hospitals. People with higher incomes prefer to be treated by specialists in Mount Elizabeth and Gleneagles. Even our neighbours have opened their own specialist hospitals. We should change our system of doctor payment to a fixed salary income. Only in this way can we ensure quality because of better pay.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii) a fixed salary structure be adopted for all doctors in Government and restructured hospitals, salaries and salary increments and promotions should be based on competence, meritocracy, professionalism and teaching and research work, and the doctors must have a holistic approach and be mature in terms of medical speciality practice. The doctors should be subject to tests of their ability. They should be tested and their ability proven. They should teach and help junior doctors to gain their skills. This is the quality of a good doctor.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii) Cost review committees are present in all hospitals, whether private, restructured or Government. If
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1120</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> possible, the report of these committees be published so that we can make comparisons.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar GRC):</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last three days we have covered a lot of medical ground and I suppose they are all interesting viewpoints that have been brought up during the current debate on the White Paper on Affordable Health Care. Sir, I share many of the viewpoints expressed by my Parliamentary colleagues. They have in fact given a lot of prescriptions. The Minister for Health has also given counter prescriptions. They are all good doses to help us manage a better and improved health care plan.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a lot of healthy recommendations have been prescribed. On the whole, I must say that the Government should be given a clean bill of health for spelling out a clear health care plan. In the last few years that I have been in this House, I think the Government has come out with a clear direction in terms of the future of our health services and the types of programmes that would be implemented.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is most important is that affordable health care is the responsibility of everyone - patients, health administrators, laboratory service suppliers, medical personnel and all the others who are related. What is most important is for all these actors to become more cost conscious and accountable in what they do. If each of these actors is able to play his role effectively, then health care cost could be contained. We must work towards this effort. So what is most important is that consumers should not be subjected to high-tech medicine when other cost effective treatments are available. I think there is this danger. If you have read the newspapers, all sorts of transplants do take place. If we run in this direction, then health care costs cannot be contained.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Health stated that there are Audit Committees in hospitals. This is indeed reassuring but the task of Audit Committees should include expenditure audit. This is very important because other than audits on medical issues, expenditure is an area that we should
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1121</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> watch for and I would suggest that independent Audit Committees should be set up with the involvement of some professionals outside the health care system. Audit should, in fact, be made transparent so that the public would know what is the actual cost for the delivery of our health services.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper has not fully addressed a few issues which are likely to become more challenging in the near future. Sir, firstly, much emphasis should be focused on primary health care. I cannot but agree with the Minister who stated that we have a good primary health care system. But I think we should be able to do better than that. If you look at last year's Health Ministry's report, only 11% of the Health budget for 1992 was spent on this area. You may argue that 11% is sufficient, but I feel we can review this area because primary health care is an important arena for health prevention.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to ensure that there are a reasonable number of polyclinics and laboratory services to deliver frontline medical services. However, only a few polyclinics are planned and this can drive more people to use the hospital services. This can choke the hospital medical system. One argues that attendance rates at polyclinics have dropped. But we should also look at the number of polyclinics that has been reduced. So the attendance rates naturally go down too.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> People are healthier.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Vasoo:</b> They say people are healthier. But I think people do need to go to these outpatient clinics from time to time to assess their health care problems. Sir, there is no plan to establish more polyclinics. More support must be given to family medical practitioners to set up group practice in housing estates. This would probably provide some reassurance to Dr Toh Keng Kiat who has been advocating for this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will realise that there is a growing number of families with elderly members who are 70 years and above. It is estimated that there are about 106,000 persons in this age group at the moment. The number will be growing further in the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1122</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> years ahead. MediShield does not cover them. There are, and would be, burdens of health care faced by these families. Sir, I think it would be helpful to allow children of these families to use their Medisave for MediShield to cover their parents' medical treatment. Increasingly, this elderly group will create a burden on our health care system which will be under tremendous pressure in the years ahead.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will also be seeing an increasing number of older persons requiring treatment for terminal illnesses. This will impose serious strains on families and the hospital resources. Both families and medical staff will be faced with the issue of death and dying. There will be ethical dilemmas, and I think we cannot escape this. Hospital staff and families will have to be better prepared to deal with these dilemmas.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper noted the increased cost of various medical and laboratory examinations. The charges in this aspect need to be contained before it runs out of control. Sir, Government can play a role by encouraging NTUC and other groups to provide laboratory and medical tests. This is an area that I think we need to look at the cost, because it forms quite a sizeable part of medical costs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also concern among medical professionals whether the policy changes to be implemented would affect Singapore's effort to promote itself as a centre of medical excellence. This issue has to be squarely addressed. There are a lot of specialists who are concerned about this, and we need to see how we should encourage and provide the necessary support that Singapore can maintain itself and move ahead to become a centre of medical excellence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, we all have the responsibility to keep our health cost trim. Where we can save in our health expenditure, we should. The prescription for all of us is, as the common saying goes: an apple a day keeps the doctor away. But, Sir, life is such that sometimes an apple a day may not keep the doctor away. In this case, we need affordable health care. I support the motion.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee (Tanjong Pagar GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate on the White Paper on Affordable Health Care.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to say something as the President of the Consumers' Association of Singapore (CASE). The content of the White Paper is something CASE can endorse because it provides good affordable basic health care for Singaporeans who are consumers but, more importantly, CASE can endorse the findings of this White Paper because of the checks and balances it has drawn up to protect consumers. In particular, CASE endorses the concept of balance billing when private hospitals allow patients to pay part of the bill through Medisave.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fear that balance billing might encourage private doctors in private hospitals to under-service patients is not likely because of the competition provided by Government and Government subvented hospitals. But experience in other countries, in the West especially, when balance billing is not there, there is a tendency somehow for bills to rise out of proportion. So CASE endorses the balance billing concept.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share the concern of some of my colleagues in this House on balance billing and some doctors have also suggested that balance billing is not good for the patients because it encourages doctors and hospitals to take short cuts, to under-prescribe and to under-treat. If that is the case, then perhaps these people should actually lobby the Government to revert to the pre-1986 situation when Medisave
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1124</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> could only be used in the Government subsidised hospitals. But so far, these people have not done so. Because the fact of the matter is that, right now, the choice lies entirely with the private hospitals. They can choose to exercise this balance billing when it is implemented or the hospitals can choose to take themselves out from this scheme by asking patients to pay the entire amount in cash. Therefore, to balance bill, or not to balance bill, is really not the issue. But I think balance billing provides some assurance on the size of the health care bill to consumers. And on this score, CASE supports it enthusiastically.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was listening to my colleague, Dr Soin's point about this new scheme proposed by the Government about paying 1% of the salary into Medisave and thereby allowing the employee to use that 1% perhaps to buy insurance to cover any illnesses he or she might incur. And Dr Soin, if I heard her correctly, said that this scheme is regressive because, under the existing civil service scheme, all civil servants get universal coverage. In other words, they all get the same kind of coverage, which is not the case, because I serve in the NTUC and we sign collective agreements (CAs) with different employers. We also have the AUPE signing collective agreements with the Government and we know that different CAs provide for different kinds of coverage. Sometimes in one CA, we have different coverage for different categories of employees. So if you are a top executive, you might get Class A or B1. If you are lower down the scale, you might get Class B2 or C. So even under the existing scheme, there is no universal coverage and not everybody is covered equally.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the proposed new civil service scheme, young employees actually benefit from the scheme because they do not consume health care during the early years of their civil service employment and they can choose to either save the money in their Medisave which, when it reaches above a certain amount, will flow over to the Ordinary Account, or they can choose to buy insurance. So, I think on this score, perhaps Dr Soin is misunderstood.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1125</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the words "health care" are of recent minting. The original words were medical care. Because medical care was closely associated with hospital care which, in turn, evoked all kinds of unsavoury imageries, few people avail themselves of medical services. There was, therefore, no problem in medical care, until the words "health care" came along to replace it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, people take health care as a right and demand instant services, where they want it, when they want it. This behavioural change is not inexplicable because Singaporeans believe that health care administered in large doses will extend their lease on life proportionately.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this, of course, Sir, is a fallacy. Because the Americans who consume something like $1 trillion, or 14% of its GDP, do not live longer and healthier lives than the Japanese or Europeans who spend far less. In fact, the average Americans die one year earlier than the Germans, and 3.5 years earlier than the Japanese.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, the key to longer and happier lives is not to throw money at health care. The way to happiness is to reinforce traditional family values, empower people with jobs, and create a sense of purpose and self-worth in society.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excessive spending on health care is a vicious form of poverty trap. If more money is spent on health care, less will be available in education and other social investments. Poorly trained people, and inadequate infrastructure will encourage joblessness which in turn demands higher consumption on health care. So each turn of the vicious cycle traps ever more people into joblessness and higher expenditure on health care. And the cycle will carry on and on until society is bankrupt.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, Sir, the first important point I wish to make about the White Paper on Affordable Health Care is taken from the perspective of younger Singaporeans which, I think, not many of my colleagues have spoken out for, and I hope to represent them in my office as the Deputy Chairman of the National Youth Council (NYC).
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1126</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Youth Council is an umbrella group representing most of the youth movements in Singapore. On 4th July 1993, the NYC debated on various issues affecting youth, including one on health care, and some of these issues are captured in this report "NYC Seminar - The Future in Your Hand". I suggest that everybody should read it. Since then, I have had various discussions with younger Singaporeans both in the NYC and outside. They all support the White Paper. All of them want good basic affordable health care for Singaporeans, especially for their aged parents and relatives. But they also recognise that in a hybrid system like the one proposed in the White Paper, the younger Singaporeans are the ones who will be paying for the subsidies on the B1, B2 and C wards.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the United States, younger Americans are already fed up and disillusioned with the exorbitant health care cost because they have been asked to shoulder a disproportionate share of the nation's health care bill. Calling themselves Generation X, after Douglas Coupland's novel, this group of people see no future for themselves. When Generation X was born in the mid-60s, health care cost in the United States took up less than $100 billion because less was spent on health care. There was more money and everything else for people who were already in their 20s when Generation X was born in the 1960s.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So by the time Generation X started their careers a few years ago, their seniors, who are already in the late 30s and 40s, whom Generation X called the Boomers, were already entrenched in well-paying jobs, while the younger ones were left to pick up the crumbs. And Generation X is very angry and disenchanted with their seniors. Part of the reason is that they think that health care cost is to be blamed. Between 1961 and 1992, health care expenditure in the United States shot up from less than $100 billion to its present $800 billion, and by next year, it will be about $1 trillion. Generation X, the younger people, thinks
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1127</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that it is not fair to them because they are not consuming health care services but they are paying taxes on them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, younger Singaporeans in Singapore are not so antagonistic. They want to share in this health care programme for their parents and their seniors, but they like me to suggest to Members of this House to take their views into consideration when implementing any health care policy. Because while they are not consuming health care now, they will be consuming health care in 20 to 30 years' time. And they are afraid that by the time they get old, there will be not much left for them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my second comment on the White Paper comes from my perspective as a Member of Parliament for Tanjong Pagar GRC and as labour MP for Singapore workers. Sir, most of my wards in Tiong Bahru and the unions are senior citizens, who are either economically inactive or working class people, with little cash savings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike younger Singaporeans who are paying into the health care system but are not using up their share, my residents and my workers are beginning to consume some of the health care services. Fortunately, these are not demanding people. In fact, their needs are quite simple, albeit well-defined. The things they look out for are:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) adequate and prompt medical treatment;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) humane attention from medical staff; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) affordable health care. Sir, the White Paper promises to deliver on all three counts. Hence, for the vast majority of my residents, they are reassured that this Government will not let them down.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, Sir, a few of my residents are really so poor that even affordable is prohibitively expensive. But I am glad to note that our system takes care of even the destitute. Over the last two years,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1128</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> since I became MP in September 1991, I have made several representations on behalf of my poorer residents to get waivers on hospital bills. I am happy to tell everybody in this House that the Ministry of Health has always looked at all these destitute cases personally and sympathetically. In fact, the CEOs of the restructured hospitals have replied to me personally, explaining each case in detail. Sometimes, they have even called me up. I want to take this opportunity to thank the civil servants in the Ministry of Health for this human touch in health care.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because the hybrid system proposed in the White Paper is essentially a cross between the pricing system (which is a fee-for-service system) and the queuing system (which is a free medical system) I think it would be wise to do a means test for people who qualify for the lower wards, the B2 and C wards.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why means testing? Basically because the ward charges in these two wards are heavily subsidised through general taxation. Yes, right now, there does not seem to be a rush for people into the Class C wards. But I believe that, over time, more and more people will rationalise their demand and want to bed themselves into the B2 and C wards primarily because of these reasons.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Government is overhauling the image of class C wards. I heard the Minister's persuasive speech yesterday trying to convince us that class C is as good as class B2, B1 and A in most of the services with the exception of a very small category of medical benefits. Sir, the more successful the Minister and the Government sell the class C and B2, the more people will want to go to B2 and C wards. It must be. Because, after all, Singaporeans are rational consumers. And certainly there is a difference in the C class wards of yesteryear and the C class wards of today. Yes, there is still some social stigma attached to being warded in a class C ward today. But the reality will sink in that class C wards give very good value for money. And I think the more successful the re-imaging process, the higher the demand for C wards.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1129</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, as our population ages, more people will need more health care services. Even if the proportion of people going to B2 and C wards does not increase, the absolute number of people going in will increase over the years, meaning more demand for class C wards.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in the jobless growth era, consumers are evaluating the worth of every single purchase. This is happening in the West and I believe it will come to the East. In the West today, people drive for miles, 10, 20, 30, 40 miles, to get discount rates in WalMart, in discount stores. In Europe, airlines are redesignating first class seats into business class and redesignating more business class into economy class. Many 5-star hotels are retrofitting into 4-star hotels and some 4-star into 3-star.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why this behavioural change? Because in their search for value, consumers in the West are looking for a product's intrinsic worth, not its cosmetic value. If what the Minister says is true, our class C is almost as good as our B1, then why would a person go to B1 instead of going into C? Sir, as the huge cost of health care begins to sink in, Singaporeans will also re-evaluate the worth of their purchase and I think the tendency to migrate from A to B1, from B1 to B2, B2 to C will start sooner rather than later.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the Government is taking this opportunity to revamp the entire health care system in Singapore for the 21st century, I think it will be wise now to signal to the public that at some point later, if not sooner, means testing would be inevitable. After all, we do means testing in many things. For example, in HDB applications, we do a means test. Means testing is also a fair way of rationing scarce resources under any hybrid system, unless you free it altogether and go for the fee-for-service system.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that in the White Paper, the Committee chose the words "equitable access" instead of the words "universal access". Clinton's health care plan uses the words "universal access". "Universal" means everybody gets what he wants.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1130</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Therefore, means testing is not necessary. "Equitable access" means that there will be some form of rationing and therefore I think some means testing is not out of place.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the equitable and efficient way to means testing is to set some simple and easy to administer barrier which prevents the rich from consuming the services for the poor. For a start, if I may suggest, we can set very high limits so that for all practical purposes, the vast majority of both the rich and the poor can have access to B2 and C wards. Then over time, as health care costs rise, the original means test will progressively filter off the rich into A and B1 and allow the less rich to use the heavily subsidised B2 and C wards. One way to do it might be to look at the CPF amount available or withdrawn to gauge the wealthiness of a patient.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support recommendations of the White Paper.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, can I ask Mr Koo to clarify one point? He stated at the beginning that CASE strongly supports the concept of balance billing. But he also suggested that should there be any problems with the quality of health care, since some doctors have stated that with balance billing, doctors will cut corners, he proposed that we revert to the pre-1986 arrangement whereby Medisave could only be used in the subsidised hospitals. But he did not explain whether CASE will support this as an alternative.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, CASE would prefer the balance billing concept. Because under the present concept put forward in the White Paper, there is already a provision for hospitals to withdraw themselves from using Medisave payments. So if a hospital thinks that balance billing is bad, the hospital can say, "Look, I encourage all my patients to use cash." If the hospitals take that position, it is equivalent to the pre-1986 position.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to declare my interest. I am a medical practitioner.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1131</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This White Paper has managed to crystallise the many ideas and issues brought up inside and outside this House. It has addressed many issues like health costs, the role of restructured hospitals, Medisave usage, medical training and education, and financing. I think it is a frank and fair appraisal of the state of health care. The solutions to the issues posed may not be acceptable to all but, on the whole, it is a commendable attempt.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always lamented the lack of emphasis on the health care delivery system in previous health reports. But this time I notice that it has been given more coverage and emphasis, which is correct. Because you need a good health care delivery system to carry out the policies and to better inform Singaporeans of the choices and accessibility to our many health care institutions. I think we have a more structured and defined health care delivery system with the Government identifying the three levels of health care, namely, primary, secondary and tertiary.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step will be to educate Singaporeans on the proper utilisation of the many health care provisions at all the three levels. I hope that we can evolve a good health care programme. Some degree of flexibility is needed in its implementation. And this flexibility of implementation was emphasised many a time in the White Paper. For example, on the topic of basic health care, realising that it will not be practical to enumerate all the items in the basic package, it was suggested that, and I quote from page 23, line 3:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A great deal of judgment as to when exactly to carry out a procedure or to prescribe a drug must be left to hospitals and doctors. They are the ones who actually diagnose and treat the patients."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we have clearly defined three levels of care, namely, primary, secondary and tertiary, we should not allow these institutions to work in isolation but to encourage cooperation and coordination among the many hospitals and primary health care institutions. Restructuring of our hospitals has encouraged competition and independence of operations. While competition is good, too much of it may
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1132</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> lead to isolation and non-cooperation. I find most of our health institutions tend to develop in isolation, eg, day care centres, outpatient clinics, the Home Nursing Foundation. Are they working closely together or each doing their own task? How close are our hospitals to the primary health care institutions? There must be a conscious effort on the part of each one of us to get these institutions to work together as part of a single organisation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe for a start we can refine our present health care delivery system. We could divide Singapore into four or five zones, each zone to have primary, secondary and tertiary health care institutions including community hospitals, private and OPD clinics. For example, if we take the western zone, you can have NUH as a tertiary hospital, Alexandra Hospital as a secondary hospital, then you have community hospitals, private clinics, OPD, day care centres, the Home Nursing Foundation and hospice care, all linked to a common system. In other words, we have a system of delivering health care to the people in a systematic manner to the western zone. You could have a department in MOH to collect and process information and data, collate and coordinate the services available of such institutions. It is a proactive role of delivering health care including health education to the people in the western sector of the island. It is a system that once developed can be duplicated in the north, south and east zones and elsewhere. There is no need to build tertiary hospitals for all the zones. They can share SGH or NUH. A better informed people will help to appreciate the system better, saving cost and time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the White Paper's emphasis on basic medical care. Basic medical care is open to many interpretations. Many are trying to define basic medical care. Some worry that it may not cover certain modalities of care. We can debate this at length, but finally we must come to some understanding. I think the White Paper's definition by excluding certain care is acceptable. There are two important points in the definition of basic medical care in the White Paper: (i) good up-to-date medical practice; and (ii) essential and cost-effective medical
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1133</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> treatment of proven value. I think this is a good start and later, with more experience, we may have to refine the basic health care.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The section on basic medical care that has to be treaded carefully is the part on treatment options. This is a sensitive area because hard decisions will have to be made whether we want to institute active or passive management of such cases as incurable diseases with no chance of survival and whether life support should be given to severely damaged patients or intensive care for premature newborns who are unlikely to survive. Or even if they survive, their long-term prospects are uncertain. If the decision to institute active treatment is made, then one cannot expect the Government to back you at all costs because this is beyond the basics.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many cases of patients who remain in coma for months or years on life support machines. In my years of practice, I find that the people who demand and insist on a particular care or procedure for a relative or friend are those not paying the bills. Those who pay the bills are then made to feel guilty if they do not agree. People must exercise their own judgment carefully in consultation with doctors and care givers so as not to be swayed by emotional guilt feelings. As for myself, if I am brain dead and I depend on the respirator and other life support aids to keep me alive, then I better go. I have told my family members not to allow my medical colleagues to save me by making me undergo active management but just to institute passive treatment. I would not want to live if my quality of life is that of a vegetable. This is my living will.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On balance billing, I think I would not talk on this as too many Members have spoken on it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restructured hospitals have been criticised for the tendency to over provide services and duplication of services, not enough C class beds, more A class beds and more intensive care beds. The White Paper's call for control on the total number of hospital beds and intensive care unit beds is very necessary. Each subsidised hospital cannot have more than 13% class
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1134</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> A beds and must have at least 65% class B2 and C beds. However, I disagree with the White Paper's recommendation that subsidised hospitals that want more A class bed wards for new unsubsidised services should develop the services on a commercial basis and as a distinct entity. The provision of such A class beds is a detraction from the role of our subvented hospitals. Do not invite problems. You are only tempting our doctors to do private practice in a public hospital setting. Leave this to the private hospitals. There is no doubt that this move will put a strain on the hospital's resources, including manpower. There are already complaints that doctors, especially specialists, are not paying enough attention to the subsidised patients. The introduction of such class A beds will again lead to such complaints.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This White Paper is trying to set right the poor image of subsidised beds, but this move will set it back. The subsidised B2+, B2 and C class beds are already having an image problem, as pointed out by Mr Koo Tsai Kee. Do not add more to this. If the idea behind this is an attempt to retain our specialists, I would suggest that you improve upon the Visiting Consultants Scheme where good specialist consultants are invited to join the hospital doctors in the management of patients. The reason why this scheme has not worked out well in the past is the prejudice of the doctors in the hospitals against the private specialists. But they must know that they will face a similar prejudice if they leave the Government and get invited to go back as Visiting Consultants. I think in the interest of the patients we should overcome this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we cap at 65% the total beds in our subvented hospitals for B2+, B2 and C class beds, I would request flexibility when applying to the community hospitals because community hospitals are in its early stage of evolvement. It may require more than the 65% for such hospitals because the patients are probably older and chronically ill. I ask for flexibility because this percentage could be related to funding of the hospitals.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1135</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Do not apply the rules of funding for such community hospitals as you would have for a secondary or tertiary hospital.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undergraduate training. The training of our future doctors must be relevant to our needs and our national health policies. The emphasis in the White Paper on family health care would mean that our undergraduate must be exposed to such teaching, as ultimately 60% of each cohort of doctors will practise as family practitioners. To do so effectively would mean a careful reappraisal of undergraduate training. For a long time our doctors have been trained to be institutional doctors. We follow the British Medical School system where training is confined primarily to the wards and hospital surroundings with a token posting with general practitioners or family practitioners for about two weeks.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should perhaps look elsewhere for other models of medical training. One such institution we could look to for guidance is the School of Medicine of the Ben-Gurion University in Beersheba, Israel. I know it is not included in the 28 Medical Schools. But it does not mean that this is not a good school. When I was in Israel, I was pleasantly surprised to find the school training their undergraduates to be, first, community-based doctors before specialising. In this way, the doctor who finally becomes specialist understands a community well because he started out in the community. The school makes use of the many health institutions at all three levels of health care - primary, secondary and tertiary - as training centres. Let me read to you the goal of this University, and I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"to turn out the highly competent doctor who will have been given a sound basis for specialised training in all branches of medicine and who would have been exposed to a particular emphasis on the importance of the integration into all specialities of a community medicine orientation. To provide the training and expertise which will enhance the graduate's motivation and ability to become a highly trained specialist in the provision of primary health care for patients and families."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, NUH has only 14% of the total acute beds in subvented hospitals. This would not be adequate for the training of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1136</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> our undergraduates. Therefore, the other subvented hospitals and polyclinics, as rightly pointed out in the White Paper, must also be involved in the teaching of our students. Some coordination and regulation is definitely essential. I sense the restructuring of our hospitals has affected our medical student training. This White Paper's recommendation that the Ministry of Health provide all subvented hospitals, including NUH, the same rates of subvention to meet the clinical service role is timely, and the Ministry of Education will separately fund the additional resources which the subvented hospitals will need to support undergraduate teaching is most welcome.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The call to NUH to regularly review its medical undergraduate curriculum together with the Ministry of Health and the Singapore Medical Council and the setting up of an Advisory Committee on Medical Specialists to advise it on postgraduate training are also good moves. In the past, before restructuring, in every Government hospital the doctors were keen to teach medical students. But with restructuring the situation changed. Because the emphasis was for the doctors to pursue clinical work instead of teaching. I hope this would change with the special grants from the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education and, most important, the attitudes of the administrators of the restructured hospitals.

  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have taken a long time to prepare the proposals in the White Paper. It is a complex problem. We have a good system. We have to be careful to make things better, and not unintentionally make things worse.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation today is that we are delivering high quality, affordable, universal health care to Singaporeans, all of them. What we are worried about are long term trends, because our population is ageing and also because all the developed countries have run into trouble with health care, and we do not want to follow their example.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perception of the public is not quite the same. Most Singaporeans, 80%, agree that we have a good health care system. But many of them, as many as 40%, are concerned that they personally cannot afford health care cost. So our problem in this situation is to institute controls on the health care system so that it will operate properly over the long term. Secondly, to reassure Singaporeans that their health care needs are being looked after.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper explains our approach. I will highlight three points. Firstly, we rely on competition to promote efficiency and to improve service. Secondly, the Government will intervene in the health care market in order to remedy market failures in health care. Thirdly, we will emphasise personal responsibility for health. We would intervene in the health care market by limiting cost and by ensuring that people can afford to pay. We control the supply of doctors, of beds, and of specialists. We moderate demand by defining a basic health care package. We moderate demand by depending on savings instead of on taxes, and on third party insurance. We control the operations of the subvented hospitals, the restructured hospitals. We tell them how to structure their wards, what they can put
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1138</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> into their wards, what equipment they can buy, overall how much they can charge. This is not to tie their hands down but to set the parameters and the framework within which they can operate efficiently and flexibly, and compete with one another, and give good service to Singaporeans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a formalisation and elaboration of what we have been doing. It is an approach which has provided Singaporeans with affordable good health care. The Cost Review Committee went into this at some length. We debated its Report a few weeks ago and Members will remember that the Committee confirmed that health care in Singapore is affordable. It is not for free, unlike in some other countries. But all those systems which provide health care for free are in difficulty. The British with their National Health System, Canadians with a single buyer, namely, the Government, the French with national health, and China, which used to go on the principle of need, now goes on the principle of the person benefiting pay, as they say in Chinese [
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] shou hui zhe jiao fei (the person who benefits, he pays). We pay in Singapore, but we enjoy better health care by paying than citizens of these other countries do for free.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang and the other Opposition MPs have made a great to-do about health care being unaffordable and people are being alarmed. How it is possible to die but not possible to get ill in Singapore. I ask a simple direct question: how many actual cases have they come across of patients who have been denied health care because they have no money? How many MP's letters have they written on behalf of desperate constituents asking for waivers of charges? They have been in Parliament now for two years and how many letters have they written. I asked the Ministry of Health. They did not take very long to compile the answer. They should have a copy with them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number of requests: Mr Chiam See Tong, 1991, one appeal for downgrading, approved. 1992, nil. 1993, nil. Mr Ling How Doong, 1992, one appeal for waiver. They classified it as a subsidised patient. 1993,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1139</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> one case. Financial assistance at Kandang Kerbau Hospital. Instalment plan arranged. Mr Low Thia Khiang, 1992, one appeal for free treatment, approved. 1993, one allegation that he was charged a huge consultation fee at SGH and asked why he was made to pay cash before admission and so forth. Investigation was carried out. It turned out that he did not pay cash. He paid with Medisave and he was never sent to SGH. The person concerned withdrew his letter of complaint and apologised to the Hospital for the false allegation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the complete list, Mr Speaker, unless, of course, there are some items which I have left out which the Opposition MPs will no doubt point out promptly if they exist. I am sorry. I forgot to read one more - Mr Cheo Chai Chen. 1992, nil; 1933; nil.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hasten to add, Mr Speaker, that I am in no way doubting that the MPs have been carrying out their duties to the best of their ability, and conscientiously. Indeed, I am quite sure that they have worked very hard in order to find cases like these to embarrass the Government. All the more, this list proves how few there are. So, where is the problem?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rationally, we have no problem with access to health care. But we do have difficulty reassuring people that in fact there are no problems. Health care is a human problem. We are dealing with human lives. Patients and families are agitated and distraught, very worried, frightened, and doctors are also human. They err. They make mistakes from time to time and they respond to financial incentives and pressures, like all the rest of us. Therefore, our system must allow for these human frailties. It should support and help patients and doctors to make rational decisions in their long-term best interest. It should not put too much burden on the doctors or on the patients to be super-human in their detachment or in their infallibility. The system must support them. You cannot assume that he is rational, he is logical, he is informed, he will judge, and he will answer completely for the consequences of his decisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1140</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the system should discourage doctors from over-servicing patients, whether it is to earn fees or whether it is to practise defensive medicine, just in case the patient sues them, let them order the tests, even if they are not essential.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have argued that because medicine is a human problem, we cannot treat the health care system coldly and we should not do cost-benefit calculations of how to treat as many patients as possible for as little cost as possible. They are wrong. I give you an analogy. If I am sick and worried, do I want a doctor who is so sorry for me that he also becomes agitated and overwrought and excited? Or do I want a doctor who is cool and dispassionate, sympathises but retains his professional distance and makes a sober judgement of what is in my best interest? I think I know what to choose, and I think when we design a health care system, we have to choose the same approach. One day we may be patients, but today we have to be the doctors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our resources are always finite. We can deploy the resources which are available for health care in different ways, but one way or another, they are finite and limited. We can put them here or there, or half here and half there, but not all here and also all there. And you can spend more by taking away from some other place, as some MPs have suggested. But, ultimately, it is finite. Because it is finite, in health care, like in other areas of public policy, for every decision we make there is an opportunity cost. What is an opportunity cost? It is what you gave up by choosing to do one course of action instead of another one. For example, if the top surgeon in Singapore spends his time operating on routine cases (piles and appendectomies, for example), then he will have to do fewer of the complex cases which really genuinely require his unique skills.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example. Every patient who stays every day in an ICU, there is an opportunity cost. He is potentially depriving another patient of one-day stay in the ICU, and that other patient, paying or not paying, may well have a better chance of recovering and getting better from the ICU stay than the first one.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1141</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, all right, we spend more on ICU beds. There is an opportunity cost because, then, we will spend less on preventive health care, on primary health care, on the areas which can catch diseases early and cut down on the need for ICU beds.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have enough doctors? We produce more doctors and surgeons and specialists. We can do that. Then we will have fewer entrepreneurs, managers, Permanent Secretaries, MPs, Ministers. Or we can, as Dr Soin has suggested, spend more on health care overall. Then we will have less for education, for housing, for defence, for raising the standard of living of people, which, in fact, is more important than spending money on hospitals for improving their health.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different ways of allocating resources lead to different outcomes. We cannot avoid the responsibility of having to judge which of these outcomes we prefer. We cannot avoid deciding how much overall to spend on health care, and having decided on that, which areas of health care should get more resources, and which areas less. Because a great deal is at stake, especially human lives, therefore, all the more we have to approach the problem rationally, to make sure that no money is wasted, and to make sure that we focus our efforts on areas which do the most good.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economists would coldly call it "rationing". To the laymen, the word "rationing" has a negative tone. It is something unpleasant. But one way or another, allocation, prioritising, is not avoidable. We can allocate in different ways: by price, like they do in America. You do not pay, you do not get. By queuing, like under the National Health Service in Britain. You take your number, you wait your turn. Your turn may be in three years' time. If before then you have died, hard luck. You can allocate by medical need. Let the doctors and the hospitals decide. This person is worth treating, he is young, he has got a family; that person is not, he is old, his chances of recovery are not good. Or we can allocate by merit, and decide who has contributed to society more, who has made more
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1142</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> effort to look after himself, maybe who has donated blood and, therefore, is deserving of being treated first. Or we can refuse to do any of these, in which case, we will still be allocating, but we will do so arbitrarily, as the haphazard outcome of uncoordinated decisions and choices. There is no logical escape from these possibilities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we do it in Singapore? We use a combination of methods. Firstly, we use price. We charge patients instead of providing health care for free, firstly, to prevent excessive demand from developing; and, secondly, to allocate non-basic health care. So you want what is more than basic, you pay. Even basic, you pay some, so that if you do not need it, please do not come and queue up.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we allocate by medical need. We define a basic health care package, and we subsidise it heavily, and we make it available to everybody.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we allocate by merit. Those who have taken responsibility for their own health, for example, they have accumulated their Medisave, they have participated in MediShield, they are living healthy lifestyles, they should enjoy priority in getting Government help.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people wish there was no need to prioritise, and that we could provide all the health care we wish to everyone who needs it or wants it. But in the real world, this is impossible. And in any case, limiting the amount of health care is not necessarily a bad thing, because more medical care does not always mean better medical care. If you look at different developed countries, you will find, depending on their systems, on their incentives, and on their habits and culture of the doctors, enormous variations in the degree to which patients are operated upon.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have circulated a list - I think you have it with you - to give some examples. Consultations with doctors (GPs and specialists) - in Germany, 10 per year; in UK, 5 per year. Hospital admission - Germany, 19 per thousand population; UK, 13. Acute hospital length of stay - Germany, 12; UK, 8; US, 7. Rate
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1143</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of surgical operations - US, 91 per thousand; Japan, 22 (four times). Yet the Japanese live longer than the Americans. Maybe because they are cut up, that is normal. Coronary bypass operations - US, 60 per 100,000; UK, 6. Hysterectomies (removal of wombs from women) - US and Denmark, 7 out of 10 women have hysterectomies. Seven out of 10! UK - 2 out of 10. You mean to say the Americans are three times healthier than British women?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is what the experts themselves say about these developed countries:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Coronary bypass surgery is performed 300,000 times per year in the United States and accounts for about $1 of every $50 spent on healthcare. But a study by the Rand Corporation a few years ago found that more than 40% of such operations did very little, if anything, for the patients. ...
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American doctors performed open-heart surgery 2.6 times as often as Canadian doctors and 4.4 times as often as German doctors."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another opinion:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the US, the long-standing problem of over-treatment, particularly in surgery, persists. A 1988 study by the Albert Einstein Medical Centre found high rates of pacemaker implantation without medical indication ... [that means, there were no medical reasons for doing it, but it was done] 44% were definitely indicated, 36% were possibly indicated and 20% not indicated. ...
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... New research at the RAND Corporation found high rates of inappropriate coronary artery bypass surgery, gastrointestinal endoscopy [that means, putting a tube in to see what is going on inside] and carotid endarectomy [that means, drilling a hole in the carotid artery and cleaning out the inside, like a pumper]. On review by a physician panel, the study found that 32% of the carotid endarectomy procedures were performed for equivocal reasons [one-third], and 32% for inappropriate reasons [another one-third]. The study found that after the procedure, 9.8% of patients had a major complication defined as stroke with residual deficit at the time of hospital discharge or death within 30 days of surgery." Anybody wants more health care in Singapore, I will offer him or her a free carotid endarectomy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In medicine, we cannot depend solely on patients' perception of need, or on what the patients want. The patients are not in a position to decide. They ask for drugs and procedures not because they understand what will really help them, but because they have heard about them, or
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1144</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> read about them, or saw it on TV, or heard from friends, and hope desperately that it may do them some good. I know this from personal experience.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I had chemotherapy last year, I appeared on TV and some people saw I was carrying the portable chemotherapy pumps. My doctors tell me that after that, they have no difficulties persuading any of their patients to use pumps. They explained to the patients, and the patients said, "Ah yes! Same like BG Lee." They take it, in fact, they have to order more pumps.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give you another example - Traditional Chinese medicines. A lot of people have asked me, or if they do not ask me, they ask my wife quietly, what Chinese medicines is BG Lee taking. We tell them truthfully, "No. I am not taking any." But if it became known that I was taking a particular set of herbs, you can be sure that those herbs are quickly going to become hot selling items and will soon be promoted as "BG Lee's medicine".
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is not that Traditional Chinese medicine is no good because I believe there is a great deal of folk wisdom in Traditional Chinese medicine, and there is a lot that Western medicine does not understand. My point simply is that patients make these decisions not based on real scientific or medical knowledge or any understanding of what is necessary, but on faith and hope, which is often misplaced.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public also get worried because they do not understand how the health care system works, what provisions we have made, how they can benefit from it by making wise individual choices for themselves. Should they go to C, B2, B1, community hospital, polyclinic, or see a specialist? It is complicated, and it leads to alarm.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One common misconception they have, and which I think some MPs share, is that restructured hospitals raise medical costs. Actually, restructured hospitals provide better medical services and better value for money for the patient than Government hospitals. Because the Government
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1145</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> hospitals are subject to the very complicated constraints of belonging to the civil service, 30,000 employees, and you are 500. You want to change rules, you want to change salaries, you want to change terms, you want to hire somebody on a different contract, you have to clear it with PSD, PSC. So many relativities have to be reconciled, it is very difficult to work. If you are a restructured hospital, you are the Chief Executive Officer, you decide. You have a budget, you operate, you pay, we will control the bottom line. We give you the subvention, you provide the service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to Woodbridge Hospital a few weeks ago - brand new buildings, $200 million spent, we opened the hospital. New hardware, same software. It is a Government hospital. So I asked whether they had any problems being a Government hospital. They were a bit reluctant to speak but, eventually, we got the story out of the patient. Yes, they had problems. They want to pay special allowances for the nurses who work in Woodbridge Hospital because it is a tough job. You are working with patients not quite right in the mind, long hours, you have to cheer them, you have to wash them, you have to look after them, and you are at risk of being assaulted by them, because some of them are violent. They cannot get an allowance because it will raise questions of relativity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want to create new grades of staff. They need male nurses to deal with male patients. They cannot get. So they said, "All right, we will get wardens." Civil service said, "We never heard of wardens." It cannot be done. They want to recruit other staff, therapy aides, technicians to run the estate, estate management. You get nowhere. You spend all your time arguing, paperwork, instead of treating patients. And it is not because the civil servants in charge of personnel are unreasonable. It is just a very rigid and difficult-to-operate system.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is the solution? The solution is to restructure Woodbridge Hospital into a proper autonomous hospital. Let it run independently, give it the same subsidies which it should now have and let it do what it needs to do, and not be tied down
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1146</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> by the rest of the civil service. I told the Minister this, he said, "After the next Budget." But I said, "Start studying now!" It has to be done, and we have to explain it to the population. They have to understand because, otherwise, you are just making things worse. One day, there will be a disaster because hospitals are not properly manned. We have a Commission of Inquiry and then we will make it autonomous. I think that is too late.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason patients do not fully see things dispassionately is because they and their families are emotionally involved. They are frightened and confused. They may have gone through a traumatic experience, family member may have died, shocked, or they themselves may nearly have died. And it is a well-established phenomenon that families and patients, having gone through such traumatic experiences, are often not reliable witnesses, or judges, of what went right, or what went wrong. It is not reasonable to expect it. You just have to allow for it. It is not to blame anybody who says this. But it is a fact of life which we must make allowance for when we try to manage the health care system. And if you react to emotional sentiments expressed without getting behind that, to the truth, then we will do the wrong thing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the reason why it is important to continuously educate the public about health care, to clear their misconceptions, and prevent them from being unnecessarily alarmed, not least by people who are deliberately out to alarm them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The media play an exceptionally important role. They have got to report medical news responsibly and extra carefully. They should not raise excessive expectations with reports of sensational new procedures or drugs. Each time, there is a story in the newspaper about a new procedure, new drug, new treatment, the patient goes to the doctor the next day, carrying his press cutting, asking for the same. And I have three examples here.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First example, Straits Times of 25th August about the cancer centre. It is a neutral story, but in the middle it said that research has shown that combining three
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1147</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> main therapies of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation can offer a better chance of survival than surgery alone. So all the patients who have been operated on, and not yet given radiotherapy and chemotherapy, came to ask, not knowing that it depends on the type of cancer, the stage of the cancer, the assessment. You may make things better, or you may make things worse.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second example, more recent, Straits Times of 24th September, about cardiomyoplasty. This is an operation to cut the muscle from the back, wrap it around the heart, train it to pulsate like the heart and give the patient, with a bad heart, a new lease of life. The story says, "For one patient here, the countdown to death has stopped." They must have a secret. They have done one operation here, paid for by Mount Elizabeth Hospital. But cardiomyoplasty is not suitable for all heart patients. Thus the need for heart transplants would remain. Immediately patients came to ask this. It is an experimental procedure but expectations and hopes were raised.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most recently, last Friday's New Paper "Family liver transplant here soon". This was drawn to my attention by the Vice-Chancellor. It is a story about a surgeon about to carry out live donor liver transplant from a family member to a child. You cut part of the liver and you donate it across, because it is very hard to get donors for livers. Experimental leading edge technique. I asked MOH what this was about. MOH's reply is that the report was totally unjustified. Gleneagles Hospital has not applied to MOH for permission to carry out live donor liver transplants. The Administrator of Gleneagles Hospital has confirmed that the Hospital has no plans to set up any liver centre next year and it has not authorised the doctor concerned, a certain Dr Tan Kai Chah, a Malaysian working in England, to make such a statement on their behalf. And furthermore, Dr Tan has not anywhere in his application for registration or correspondence with the Ministry of Health mentioned his intention to do liver transplants from live donors. MOH
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1148</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> considers liver transplants using living related donors to be an unproven procedure, and it will not authorise such operations in Singapore until they have been generally accepted and validated. So you may sell a newspaper but think how many hopes you have raised and dashed in vain. It is not the end of the story. MOH will follow up and make sure it does not happen.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The media have got to cooperate. They also must make an effort to explain to the public how the system works. One positive example of this is the way the Straits Times serialised the White Paper, over several days, with pictures, explanations, captions, side stories, and interviews to get people to understand. It is not easy because people only read when they get sick. But it is natural. All the more we have to do it, again and again because each new generation must be educated. They are fresh.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the media should be careful in investigating and reporting individual patient's complaints that their cases have been mishandled by their doctors or by the hospitals. They have to be careful because of the factor which I mentioned earlier, namely, that if you ask the patient, you get a story, if you investigate, you often get a different story. I am not asking them not to report at all, but they have to be very cautious in doing so, because by publishing an exaggerated or inaccurate story, they will very easily generate additional unnecessary alarm among the public who are in no position to judge the accuracy or the plausibility of the stories. Firstly, they do not know the facts. Secondly, they are not doctors. So great caution is called for. I am not saying that the health care system is perfect, or that doctors never make mistakes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctors are human and, occasionally, they will make mistakes. Hospitals handle thousands of patients a day and once in a while, they will slip up. Not everybody is a senior most physician, some are housemen, some are trainee nurses. They are learning on the jobs, sometimes errors occur. Even the best doctors, confronted with a difficult case, will sometimes make the wrong diagnosis or will decide on a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1149</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> course of action which subsequently turns out badly. When you see the top surgeon, or the top doctor, you are not betting on a 100% outcome. You are lucky if you are betting on a 70% or 80% outcome. And if it turns out tail instead of head, you have to accept that the doctor has done his best job, unless there are overwhelming reasons to believe that he has done you in.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, the errors will lead to unnecessary procedures. Patients did not have appendicitis, you cut out his appendix. No harm done. Other areas will lead to deaths of patients. This is a regrettable but unavoidable fact of life. We can minimise it but, like traffic accidents, you cannot eliminate it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You take appendicitis cases. Every now and then, there is a story in the newspaper. In the early stages, my doctors tell me appendix cases are very difficult to differentiate from other sorts of problems. You may have gastroenteritis, you may have some other abdominal problem, generalised pain, and there is no way you can tell for sure. All you can do is wait and see, and as the disease develops, if it is appendicitis, it will show itself. If you want to see the doctor once and have him be sure that he does not leave a bad appendix there, then you must be prepared to see the doctor and have lots of good appendixes taken out because the doctor just wants to be safe. In the case of an appendix, there is no harm. I can think of a lot of other parts of the body where you would mind very much. But it is a real problem. You can either misdiagnose by not recognising something which is there, or you can misdiagnose by thinking that something is there, which is not.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give you another example, viral myocarditis. Once in a while, a national serviceman, or a school boy, running drops dead. Viral myocarditis, what is that? It is the inflammation of the lining of the heart. What does it look like? It looks exactly like flu. Thousands of boys and girls and national servicemen have flu. One or two have viral myocarditis. Are you going to say that all flu cases will be given 10 days MC, rest in barracks? Or can we find some way to be cautious but
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1150</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> discriminate, if possible, and in the end, you still have to run some risks that one or two may turn out tails? There is no clear-cut way to distinguish. You can have the best doctor in the world. He cannot tell the difference except wait and see. So we have to accept that mistakes will take place. But there are certain things which we can do. Firstly, we can keep mistakes to a minimum by maintaining high standards, have good well-trained doctors. Where we find bad ones, weed them out.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, you must establish procedures of review and checking, so that when a doctor makes a mistake, it is discovered as soon as possible. If a doctor sees a person with a tender belly and suspects appendicitis, he should say, "Wait. If it persists, come back and I will see you again." Somebody else will see you. He can check, he can find out. You would not die but just live with the discomfort and the unease. It will be seen to. The situation will develop.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, have standard treatment protocols so that less is left to chance. Doctors make judgments. But many cases follow patterns and a protocol will guide the doctor. In this situation, have an X-ray. In that situation, dispense with an X-ray. In this situation, have a catscan. In that situation, it is better to call a specialist. It is not a cast-iron rule but it sets guidelines which, I think, simplifies a doctor's job.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we need to have a system where patients' complaints are properly investigated so that mistakes are not covered up. But if there are any shortcomings, they are put right. And if anybody has been negligent or irresponsible, that is discovered and disciplinary action is taken.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are formal procedures for doing this. In a serious case, the Ministry of Health will convene a Committee of Inquiry. A formal board will sit as a committee. Senior doctors, including doctors from other hospitals, will look into the case, how was it handled, was anybody negligent, could something have been done better, could this mistake be avoided in future? And the Ministry of Health, I have discussed this with them,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1151</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> has agreed that not only will they have Government doctors serve on the Committee of Inquiry but they will also have private doctors who have established themselves serve on the Committee of Inquiry so that people can see visibly that the system is not covering up.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must find doctors who are incompetent or irresponsible and punish them. But we must be careful not to punish doctors who have made honest mistakes, because if we do that we are going to frighten all the doctors, demoralise them, and encourage them to practise defensive medicine. He does not need this, but it will look good at the Committee of Inquiry. So a balance has to be struck and we should be careful not to generate public hysteria.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people say, "I have had a bad experience. I will never visit the hospital again.", we can sympathise, but I do not think we can agree. In medicine, we are dealing with human lives. Doctors cannot cure all patients, or keep us alive forever. Their aim should be to allow as many of us as possible to live out our normal lifespans while enjoying a high quality of life. That is why the White Paper contains the explicit statement that the basic health care package does not include "extravagant efforts to keep gravely ill patients alive regardless of quality of life or prospects for recovery". I drafted that. I suggested to the Chairman that it be put into the White Paper because I think it is an important issue which should be brought out into the open. It is a sensitive issue, but it is one which we will increasingly have to face as medical science progresses and as our population ages.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You look at the US experience. One-third of their medical expenditure takes place in the last year of the patient's life. They spend 14% of GDP. For the last year of the patient's life, that is 4% of GDP. They have Medicare which is state payment for the old. Most of it is spent for the last phase of terminal illness. Patient is dying, spend more money. 21% during the last six months, most of it in the last 30 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1152</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read you a quotation from the Economist, 28th April 1984. It is out of date but the problem has got worse, not better.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Last year [1983] Medicare alone paid out around US$15 billion - more than the whole national income of Bangladesh - on care of terminally ill Americans in their last six months of life. Although third-party insurance makes it profitable for a doctor to pump the finest medications into an unprotesting near-corpse, there is no evidence that this extended the average such patient's life by more than a few harrowing days. For each day that it did, it will have raised the national health bill by nearly another US$100 million." Our experience is not as extreme but similar: 80% of a person's hospitalisation expenses over his lifetime occur during the last two years of his life.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to these trends, in the developed countries, people, especially those who have incurable diseases like cancer, are increasingly making "living wills". They specify the conditions under which they do not wish to be given medical treatment. Let me die. For example, if my heart stops, do I want to be revived? If I am unconscious, incapacitated, comatose, do I want to be kept alive with ventilation, with intravenous feeding? They are doing this voluntarily, not to save money, but to die with dignity. Lianhe Zaobao carried a report a few days ago. President Clinton said he himself was willing to sign a living well and make its contents public. The President gets free health care. He is prepared to sign a living will and he said:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think families should think about living wills and should have them."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The M D Anderson Cancer Centre is in Houston. It is one of the best cancer centres in America. Some of you may have heard of it. I was there last year. It actively encourages patients to make living wills. Once a patient is diagnosed as having cancer, the Centre will hold counselling sessions to explain to the patient what is likely to happen, advise the patient in his own best interest, better think of eventualities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was there, there were posters on the corridors and in the waiting rooms. While you are waiting to see the doctor, read the poster, memento mori;
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1153</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> remember, you must die. And the poster reminds the patient to make living wills if they have not yet done so. Do not leave it until it is too late.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many countries have enacted legislation to validate "living wills" to enable doctors to carry out the wishes of comatose patients. Thirty-six states in the United States have legislation. The State of Victoria in Australia also has legislation. Britain is also considering a Bill to legalise "living wills". This year, the British House of Lords held that it was lawful to withdraw medical treatment and support for a patient in a vegetative state, which would result in his being allowed to die.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a problem which arises not only when patients have to worry about how they themselves are going to be treated. Some of the most agonizing situations arise when people have to decide for children who are gravely ill. I circulated three examples, just chosen at random. The first is the International Herald Tribune, 26th October 1993. 2-year old Baby K, or just over a year old, born without a brain, permanently unconscious without any ability to see, hear or feel. The mother insisted against the judgment of doctors and the hospital ethics committee that the baby be kept alive with a ventilator. The hospital went to court to find out if it had to continue offering life-sustaining treatment. The lower court said it did. It described the baby as a disabled baby. It has got no brain, just brain stem so it can breathe. Disabled baby. Who is to pay?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday's Straits Times. This is the opposite. The mother wants to let nature take its course, the school objects. 12-year old daughter with cerebral palsy and progressive scoliosis. Scoliosis is a lateral curvature of the spine. This is progressive scoliosis. So it is slowly crushing her vital organs. She is going to die. The mother made a request to the teachers that if the girl collapses during class, they should not try to revive her but only make the little girl comfortable. In other words, Do Not Resuscitate (DNR). The school refused to observe this request. They went to the school board. The school board ruled
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1154</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and upheld the mother. The mother said she consulted a paediatrician and three medical specialists before making the request.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's Straits Times, British girl, 5-year old, two multiple transplant operations. The first in June last year, new liver and new bowels. Paid for by public donations and Saudi Arabia's King Fahd. Failed. Transplant again. This time, six organs - liver, bowels, stomach, pancreas, kidneys, intestines. 15-hour operation eight weeks ago. The child has now died. Patient paid o350,000 ($805,000). Doctors said she did not die in vain. I quote the chairman of the local health authority:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"New frontiers in medicine can bring sadness as well as success." Such cases happen from time to time in Singapore. We do not have generous donors like this, but the same human problem arises. It is heartbreaking to watch a child suffer and die from an incurable illness. But it is even more heartbreaking to raise false hopes in the family, torture the child with high-tech medicine and with repeated operations until at last he or she dies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore doctors have lived with this problem for a very long time. Just like doctors elsewhere, they do their best to make sensible decisions but they prefer not to be exposed to the glare of publicity. You may have read the report in the Life section of the Straits Times a few weeks ago. They interviewed five doctors who all explained why this was a necessary part of medical practice, but none of them wanted to be named except the medical doctor in Toa Payoh Hospital. The problem will grow and it cannot just be left to doctors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the White Paper has brought this matter out into the open. It says no more than what doctors and hospitals have always been doing. Where exactly to draw the line is not just a medical decision, but it is one which will reflect social and ethical values. Therefore, it is right that it be made by an ethics committee and all hospitals in Singapore have set up an ethics committee to deal with these issues. The exact limits will shift with time but the need to draw the line will never go away.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1155</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, I have focused on what we can do as a Government and as a society to look after our health care system. But we must not neglect individual responsibility which is one of the key principles in the White Paper. Some MPs have questioned this. Mr Low Thia Khiang, for example. They argued that once a person is ill, it is the Government's responsibility to look after him, meaning, of course, the Government must pay for his treatment. They are completely wrong. It is the responsibility of each of us to keep fit, live healthy lifestyles, avoid risky activities. You keep fit, you reduce the chance of heart disease. You stay fit and trim, you not only reduce the chance of heart diseases but also the risk of diabetes. You avoid unsafe sex, you minimise the risk of AIDS.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who do not take these precautions are imposing a burden on the rest of society when they fall ill. Even cancer, which accounts for one-quarter of deaths in Singapore, is amenable to how people act and what they do. Smokers get lung cancer. If you do not want lung cancer, do not smoke. If you eat more high fat diet you increase the risk of colorectal cancer and breast cancer. You go sun-tanning recklessly, you increase the risk of skin cancer. So it depends on what you do.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a person has got cancer, very often the chances of his being treated successfully depend on how early he can discover it and do something about it. The most important determinant of the prognosis, of the outlook, for many types of cancer, is what stage is it. First question. Is it early, is it intermediate, is it late? There are elaborate systems of classifying cancer by stage. That determines your chances. For example, colorectal cancer. In Singapore, most cases present very late, "present" means the cases are shown to the doctors long after the warning signs have appeared.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a system called Duke's classification - Duke A, Duke B, Duke C, Duke D. Duke A is earliest and Duke D is latest. In Singapore, one-third of colorectal cancers are Duke D when they are diagnosed. That
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1156</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> means incurable. Only 8% are Duke A. Duke A means surgery alone can achieve nearly 100% cure. So by the time the patient goes to see the doctor, it is months, maybe years, after the symptoms have appeared and the patient knows something has gone wrong, but he is risking his life.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breast cancer, the same thing. The earlier you are treated the better your chances are. My doctors tell me that we have a particular problem with Malay female patients with breast cancer because somehow they present very late. There is a lump, they leave it, maybe they are embarrassed. By the time they see the doctor it is very advanced and there is nothing much the doctor can do. So the way to bring down cancer death rate in Singapore is not to spend another few percent of GDP on medicine, like Dr Soin suggested. It is to educate the public to see the doctors early, and not to invest in high-tech treatments for advanced cases of cancer.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have got to get people to take personal responsibility for their health. In Britain, they are talking about giving smokers and drinkers bottom priority. This is not only because they do not deserve to be treated, but also because even if you treat them, if they continue smoking and drinking, their chances of benefitting from the treatment are poor. That is why in Singapore we have said that, for personal responsibility, Medifund will give priority to people who have conscientiously contributed to Medisave and who have participated in MediShield. I think we should go one step further and say people who live healthy lifestyles should have priority. Doctor advises you not to smoke, you smoke. When you get lung cancer, you then say, "C class cannot find, go to B2, please waive charges." Should we? Is it right?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a good health care system. High quality medical services are available to all, at affordable prices. The total cost of the medical services to the country is low. We are proud that it only costs 3% of the GDP. That does not mean we must spend more. That means we are getting value for money. The results, if
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1157</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> we measure it in terms of standard indicators, life expectancy and infant mortality, are good. Of course, not everybody is happy with the system. But then as one health care economist said to me, when you study this subject, after a while, you will conclude that there is a theorem that every country in the world is unhappy with its health care system and it does not matter what system it has. It will be unhappy. So I would say to those who are unhappy: where would you prefer to live? Where else? You want to go to America? 14% of GDP on health care. If you have money, the best available, it is outstanding, best in the world; if you have no money, 30 million Americans have no health insurance. Or you can go to Canada, it is for free. You just pay 50% of your income in taxes upfront. Or you can go to Japan, it is not very expensive. You can live quite long, but the hospitals are dumps, deliberately so, spartan and ill-equipped, to keep cost down and discourage people from using them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not badly off in Singapore. Let us improve on our health care system progressively. Let us install safeguards now which will contain health costs and keep the services affordable to all. I think, Mr Speaker, the proposals in this White Paper will help us to do that. [Applause.]
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I would like to, first of all, clarify the point raised by the Deputy Prime Minister and seek clarification from him. I would advise the hon. Deputy Prime Minister that when he wants to quote cases, please be more accurate. First of all, it seems to me that the Deputy Prime Minister cannot even spell my name correctly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I am surprised that he could only find two cases in my past service to the constituents in Hougang. I have written a number of cases involving Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Alexandra Hospital and Youngberg Hospital, requesting for waivers because the patients could not pay for the charges. Upon my request, they have been given a discount and instalment payments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some of the cases, the instalments were not paid by themselves, but by their family members.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1158</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> You are telling me that there are no problems, it is affordable. Is it affordable in their case? Can you call it affordable?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister also mentioned in his speech that spending money in other areas, like defence, is more important than spending money in health care. I hope he would clarify what he meant by that. Does he mean that it is not important in terms of health care? He also mentioned in his speech about priority of treatment. I would like to know whether it is this Government's intention, from what the Deputy Prime Minister has said, that in future you will determine who will deserve treatment at B2 or C class subsidised wards. Is it the intention and motive behind the White Paper's philosophy that personal responsibility is part of the consideration in health care? Do you mean people should be responsible for their own sickness? He also mentioned something about bad doctors, and we should weed them out. I would like to know what is BG Lee's proposal to weed out bad doctors. Is it waiting, as he has said, until a life has been sacrificed and thereby we have a disciplinary committee, and say, "Okay, you are out. You are a bad doctor." Is that the prevention the Government is talking about?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, BG Lee talked about medicine. I understand now there is a "BG Lee's medicine". I am afraid that judging from his speech, BG Lee's medicine to Singaporeans is bitter and sour.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, we have gone through all these subjects. I think it is not necessary to answer Mr Low's points one by one. He can file questions and we can discuss them at length. I would just come back to the simple question to him: does he prefer to live elsewhere? If not, accept that we are living in a real world with a good system, not perfect, but not bad at all.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I think it is not fair to ask me whether I would like to live elsewhere. I was born here. That question does not tally with whether we provide a good health care. The fact is that we are all Singaporeans and the Government is the Singapore Government. It is the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1159</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> responsibility of the Government to provide health care. It has nothing to do with whether I would like to live here or elsewhere. The same goes for Singaporeans.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The Member well knows that the question has been asked and an answer has been avoided. Where would you prefer to live and whose health care system would you prefer to benefit from? You have complained about ours. Do you think you would be better off in Britain? China is free. Our neighbouring countries charge much less. The developed countries, you can live in a welfare state. He should be quite honest and tell us whether he thinks Singapore would be better if we were like China, if we were like the neighbouring countries, or if we were like the welfare states of the West, or like the United States. Then we have a basis for comparison. Otherwise, this is casting and cavilling, and getting us nowhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all Members who have spoken during this debate and I have no intention of trying to summarise all that they have said. I think it will be fair to say that almost all support the basic philosophy and the principles of our health care system, and all recognise that we do have a good health care system.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to thank Members for their suggestions. All suggestions would be considered by the Minister for Health and those that can be implemented, I am sure that he will implement them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to thank Members for some of the fears and reservations that they have expressed because these point to the need for us to explain more clearly to the public our underlying intentions, philosophy and thinking of our present health care system and, of course, wherever necessary, we will fine-tune some parts of the system.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper does not propose revolutionary changes. In fact, for the most part, it explains our existing system and why we do things the way we do. It
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1160</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> clarifies the underlying philosophy behind the present system. It makes a number of recommendations on how we can improve the system. These improvements will ensure that our health care system evolves and keeps pace with the changes in our society, in our economy, and also with medical and technological progress.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I want to thank you for being so patient.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House endorses the principles and approaches set out in Paper Cmd 16 of 1993 on "Affordable Health Care" as the basis for Government policies to contain health care costs and to keep good basic health care affordable to all Singaporeans."

   <b>LEGAL PROFESSION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>4.43 pm
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Law (Prof. S Jayakumar): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill has several objectives. Firstly, it enables the implementation of the recommendations of the Committee for the Supply of Lawyers, chaired by the Attorney-General, which were accepted by the Government in April this year. Secondly, it also makes amendments on provisions relating to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court over the discipline and conduct of lawyers and legal officers and makes provisions for other miscellaneous matters. Some of these amendments were made at the request of the Law Society.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal first with the amendments relating to the recommendations of the Committee chaired by the Attorney-General. The Committee was tasked to consider the supply of lawyers for Singapore in the short-to-medium term and to recommend measures to achieve this, having regard also to the need to enhance the quality of future legal services. The number of lawyers had grown sharply in the last decade from 809 practising lawyers in 1980 to 2,402 by the end of October 1993. The ratio of 77 lawyers per 100,000 population identified
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1161</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> by the Committee was a ratio higher than those in Japan, Hong Kong and Switzerland. In fact, Sir, the ratio mentioned by the Committee (77 lawyers per 100,000) has in fact been altered. It is now 82 per 100,000. The Government's concern with the growing number of lawyers was that if left unchecked, it could lead to a misallocation of valuable manpower resources and result in the creation of an over-litigious society with a consequential lowering of standards in practice.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2, 3 and 5 of the Bill give effect to the recommendations of the Committee by amending sections 2, 7 and 16 of the Legal Profession Act to enable the implementation of the Committee's recommendations which have been accepted. Section 2 has been amended to redefine the term "qualified person", that is, persons who are qualified for admission to the Singapore Bar. The following broad categories of persons seeking admission will be affected:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, graduates from the Law Faculty, National University of Singapore. They will continue to be the primary source for practising lawyers in Singapore. In order to qualify for practice, NUS law graduates must obtain at least a second-class Honours degree.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, United Kingdom law graduates. In order to control this source of qualified lawyers for entry into practice, only law graduates from a list of 15 scheduled universities can qualify for practice. The list of such universities is not intended to be exhaustive and will be subject to periodic review. Such law graduates must also attain at least an Upper second-class Honours degree and obtain the Diploma in Singapore Law to qualify for admission to the Bar.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, external law degree graduates. Holders of such external law degrees will no longer be recognised for purposes of admission to practise at the Bar from 1996. However, for those who have been accepted for their external courses before May 1993, a concession has been granted if they graduate by 1996.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, a special scheme for exceptional graduates. It was also recognised
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1162</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that in order to enhance the quality of legal services in Singapore, exceptional law graduates from any University in the Commonwealth or elsewhere should not be denied entry to the Bar. This scheme will allow exceptional law graduates from the non-scheduled United Kingdom Universities, holders of external law degrees or law graduates from the existing gazetted Commonwealth Universities Scheme and the Hong Kong Practitioners Scheme to apply for admission to the Bar. Provision for the scheme is made in clause 3 in re-enacting section 7 of the Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the so-called gazetted Commonwealth Universities Scheme and the Hong Kong Practitioners Scheme are to be abolished.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with respect to the United Kingdom law graduates from the 15 scheduled universities, provision will be made for them to attend a course in Singapore at the NUS Law Faculty and to obtain the Diploma in Singapore Law. It will equip them with basic knowledge of Singapore law. They will no longer need to be called as Barristers or qualify as solicitors in England. Entry to the Diploma course will be based on the merits of each applicant and the number of places available. The intake of the Diploma course will be limited to 50 a year, subject to review. Current students in the United Kingdom Universities will not be required to take the course. However, between 1994 and 1996, such students will be given the option of taking the course in lieu of qualifying as a Barrister or Solicitor of England.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recommendations of the Committee are not retrospective and will not affect adversely those students, including national servicemen, who have already been accepted for a course of legal studies in any university before the release of the Report and its acceptance by the Government. To avoid a plethora of complicated provisions and many details in the Act itself, including various deadlines, the detailed provisions implementing the recommendations on qualifications, education and training will be made by subsidiary legislation. It would
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1163</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> also give us the flexibility should a need arise in the future to modify and review any of these recommendations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the longer term, the Government's intention is to work towards introducing a common competitive examination for all law graduates seeking to practise regardless of where they graduate from. Such a scheme can be run by the Board of Legal Education.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the other major amendments relating to disciplinary proceedings against lawyers and legal officers. Clause 13 provides for a new section 82A setting out a new procedure for disciplining of legal officers (meaning members of the Legal Service) and non-practising lawyers. The Law Society henceforth will have no jurisdiction over such persons. This amendment results from a recent case involving a senior legal officer in the Service where the Court of Appeal ruled that the Law Society could take disciplinary proceedings under Part VII of the Act against such an officer if he had been admitted to the Bar.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that decision created an anomalous situation in that legal officers who are admitted to the Bar and non-practising lawyers are subject to the disciplinary control of the Law Society while those officers who are not admitted are not. To correct this, the Bill provides that both legal officers and non-practising lawyers will be subject to the direct disciplinary control of the Court and not of the Law Society, which means that the Law Society's control is with respect to those who are practising advocates and solicitors. There will be a special procedure for disciplinary action against such persons involving a show cause application to the Chief Justice. The Chief Justice may grant leave for the appointment of a Disciplinary Committee to look into the complaint. Only when a prima facie case of misconduct is established, would the case be referred to a court of three judges who are empowered to impose certain punishment against the errant legal officer or non-practising lawyer, for example, striking off the rolls,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1164</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> prohibiting him from applying for a practising certificate for up to five years, or censuring him or ordering a penalty of up to $5,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments relating to the Law Society which I should highlight are the following:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 amends section 83 of the Act to increase the power of the court to suspend a lawyer found guilty of misconduct from the present two years to five years. At the same time, the amendment also deletes an existing clause which has created problems by requiring our courts to imagine the equivalent position in England in respect of a barrister or solicitor there. Instead, there is a new provision whereby the court may discipline a lawyer if he has been guilty of such misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the court or as a member of an honourable profession.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, clauses 15 to 26 and 29. These clauses deal with disciplinary proceedings against practising lawyers to further improve the procedures and also to increase the powers of the Law Society. For example, clause 15 amends section 85 to enable the Law Society Council, with the leave of the court, to inquire first into complaints against practising lawyers which are more serious in nature and defer the inquiry into other complaints. The complainant will be notified of the outcome at the conclusion of the proceedings. The restriction in subsection 85(1) and 85(2) is that complaints must be "in his professional capacity". The words "in his professional capacity" have been removed because it is clear from section 83 that the Act also envisages complaints about other serious misconduct on the part of the advocate and solicitor which brings into disrepute the profession. The removal of these words does not mean that frivolous complaints should be entertained. The provision must be read in the context of the instances of misconduct enumerated in section 83(2) or it must be "misconduct unbefitting the advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession".
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1165</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 improves the function of the Inquiry Committee, while clause 17 improves the function and increases the powers of the Council after it receives the report of the Inquiry Committee. The remaining clauses also relate to the function of the Law Society and the Council in relation to appointing of Disciplinary Committee to hear complaints against practising lawyers. For example, if the Disciplinary Committee (DC) recommends against a formal investigation and only recommends a reprimand, the Council, if it disagrees, can apply to the High Court in a show cause action.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several miscellaneous amendments, and perhaps I should mention the following:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 14 is amended by increasing the pupillage of a legal officer from six months to three years so as to retain good officers in the Service. In addition, a legal officer of the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) is allowed to act as a pupil master to his other legal officers to provide an incentive for fresh law graduates to join IRAS.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 amends section 26 to enable the Attorney-General to issue a restricted practising certificate to an in-house lawyer employed by the Law Society so as to permit such in-house lawyer of the Law Society to appear in Court on behalf of the Society which will save legal costs for the Society.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 amends section 34A to remove any doubts that sections 32 and 33 prohibiting unauthorised persons from practising Singapore law do not apply to a foreign lawyer in arbitration proceedings where the applicable law is Singapore law, who is also allowed to appear jointly with a legal officer in such proceedings, thereby extending the same privilege presently enjoyed by a local practising advocate and solicitor in such arbitration proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 amends section 66 to empower the Chief Justice and the Attorney-General to require the Council to disclose any matter or information relating to any complaint of misconduct or disciplinary
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1166</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> action against any lawyer. This is necessary because I am told that the present provision concerning confidentiality of proceedings causes an obstacle for the Law Society to disclose such information.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisions and the others relating to the Law Society are aimed at ensuring that the legal profession will be distinguished by honest and competent practitioners of the highest standards who will be able to meet the increasing expectations of the general public and the business community.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Davinder Singh (Toa Payoh GRC):</b> Sir, I support the Bill. I would like to seek clarification from the Minister on a number of aspects of the Bill. My focus is primarily on the new provisions dealing with legal officers and non-practising solicitors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister said, the proposed provisions on disciplinary proceedings have come about as a result of a recent Court of Appeal decision which extends the application of the present Act to legal officers and, in the words of the Minister, that has created an anomaly which this amendment seeks to rectify.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rectification is that from the Law Society, disciplinary jurisdiction over these officers will now move to the courts. However, I would have expected that notwithstanding this move, the same standards ought to apply to both advocates and solicitors on the one hand, and to legal officers and non-practising solicitors on the other. But looking through the Bill, one gets the impression that there are different standards, some make legal officers better off; some make them worse off. For example, in the case of an advocate and solicitor, if he is hauled up for misconduct, he first appears before the Inquiry Committee where he has a right to be heard in his defence and, of course, if the Inquiry Committee determines that there is cause for further investigation, he is referred to the Disciplinary Committee. In the case of a legal officer, the amendment replaces the Inquiry Committee with the Chief
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1167</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Justice. What happens is that if there is an allegation that the legal officer has misconducted himself, a complaint is made by way of an application to the Chief Justice. But the difference and a very fundamental difference is that the application before the Chief Justice is ex parte, which means that the applicant appears before the Chief Justice and there is no necessity to serve the papers on the legal officer who is alleged to have misconducted himself. Unlike the case of an advocate and solicitor who has a right to be heard at the very first stage of the disciplinary process, a legal officer, or a non-practising solicitor against whom a complaint is made, is not given that right under the Act. I wonder whether the Minister can explain why that is so. While that puts the legal officer on a worse footing, there is an example of something which puts him on a better footing vis-a-vis advocates and solicitors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very simple example of that is that in the case of advocates and solicitors, if the disciplinary proceedings are founded on a conviction, the advocate and solicitor is not entitled, by reason of an amendment to the Act, I think, to challenge the validity of that conviction in the disciplinary proceedings. Whereas we do not have a similar provision which bars, or precludes, legal officers from taking up that challenge. Again, I wonder if the Minister would explain why there is a difference in the approach.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, if I could ask the Minister to clarify the effect of the transitional provision. It says that the amendment would not apply to inquiries, investigations, etc, commenced before the date of commencement of the amendments. Because the disciplinary procedure takes many steps before it reaches the court, I would like to know whether the approach is that the amendments would only apply to inquiries commenced after the amendments come into force, or would they apply to any stage of the disciplinary procedure which is in existence on the date of coming into force.

  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, before I speak, may I declare my personal interest as Vice-Dean of the Law Faculty, NUS, and as a practising advocate and solicitor.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill, but there are two major controversial things about this. Firstly, the cap on the number of lawyers and, secondly, the way that cap is being implemented. Paradoxically, these things are in the Bill itself. They are left to subsidiary legislation, as the Minister said. The first question is: Is there really a need to cap the number of lawyers? No one really knows for sure. But what we do know is that the Law Faculty is taking in 200 students per year, three times the number it used to take at the beginning of the 1980s. Three times the number of lawyers cannot be produced indefinitely, unless we are sure that the domestic legal services are going to grow indefinitely and I think no one, least of all the lawyers, wants litigation to grow indefinitely. So some sort of cap is necessary.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other problem is that when we are talking about the domestic legal services, things like conveyancing, which are almost now fully computerised will, I think, be very difficult to retain as a lawyer's monopoly forever. So we may actually find the demand for domestic legal services shrinking. So I fully support the Minister's suggestion and the Committee's suggestion that a cap should be put on the number of lawyers. I think we should make it clear that this cap does not affect people who are already qualified. It does not affect people who want a law degree as an academic qualification because they want to go into business, they want to go into Government, politics, or whatever it is. It only affects those basically who want to do litigation, or who want to do conveyancing. Every year, when we do interviews, I meet a number of young people who tell me that their burning ambition is to be a lawyer and they found this out because they watched "Matlock" on TV. The only people who are really going to be aggrieved by this cap are those people who feel that somehow a law degree is a passport to wealth and riches and I think we can assure them that it is not really so.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1169</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have said that this idea of capping lawyers is actually just a ploy by the legal profession to keep fees high and salaries high. I am not sure that is right. The market for legal services is not a perfect market. It is a very imperfect market. If I may draw an analogy. If you got a brain tumour, you don't go to the cheapest brain surgeon you can find. Is cheapness really something that you look for in a professional when you are looking for professional service? Paradoxically, you may find that no matter how many mediocre lawyers are in the market, the good ones will always have more work than they can cope with, and the good ones will always be able to command a premium. And if you go to a lawyer who does not seem to have any clients, is that really a recommendation? I very much doubt it. So these people who think that this is a ploy by all of us lawyers to keep our salaries high are perhaps looking at it a bit simplistically. Accepting that there should be a cap, the real controversial thing is the way the cap has been implemented because people said, "Well, you know, this is arbitrary. With 15 institutions from the UK, are you saying that second upper from Durham is better than the first class from, say, University of Sydney?" This is the kind of impression they get.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have to look at this pragmatically. What we are talking about is turning off the supply of Singaporeans being qualified. So, in future, anyone who wants to practise law in Singapore knows that there are only 15 institutions outside where he can go to and have a decent chance of getting a degree. It is no reflection on the quality of the graduates of these institutions as such. We are merely making a signal to people who want a law degree that "Look, these are the 15 institutions." And the Minister has given the assurance that this list will be reviewed from time to time and I think we can be happy with that.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two small things that I would like the Minister's clarification, if possible. Firstly, the Diploma in Singapore Law which is going to be a prerequisite for foreign graduates. The Committee recommended a ceiling of 50. I hope that this ceiling is not going to be treated as a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1170</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> sacrosanct thing. Because if, for example, you have got more than 50 applicants from the 15 scheduled institutions, how are we going to make the choice? This is the problem. If some got first class and some got second upper, all right, take the first class. But I doubt we will get 50 first class from these universities. You might get, say, 60 second upper. 10 will be excluded if you have got an absolute cap of 50. So may I ask for a little bit of flexibility, just in case. It may be that the problem will be academic and that we will never get 50 applicants for the Diploma in Singapore Law. But if we do, I do not think it is fair that a person's future livelihood, that his vocation should depend upon something that is arbitrary as a ballot.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing that the Minister said was that they would be looking into the question of a common professional examination. I think this is a good thing, something that we should all work towards. But I hope that the common professional examination will be in lieu of these rather arbitrary limits on institutions. Once you have got your common professional examination, you should not say, "Well, only those people from the 15 institutions can take that examination.", only two-ones or two-twos from NUS can take that examination. So I hope that when that is implemented, it is not treated as an additional hurdle but is treated as a long-term goal. And this restriction of institutions, this restriction on the quality of degrees, is going to be an interim measure until that can be done.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, may I express my support for the Bill again.
  <br>5.10 pm
  <div align="center">
   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I understand that one of the main purposes of this Bill is to restrict the number of persons entering the legal profession every year and, at the same time, to give the Minister the power to prescribe the qualifications for entry, that is to say, to decide who will be allowed to practise law in Singapore. Clause 2 of the Bill serves this purpose. Is this in the interest of the public? I do not think so.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1171</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it goes against the Government's own free market principles. The law is supposed to be an honourable profession, not a money-making machine. Instead of restricting the number entering the profession and thereby making it more elitist and remote, the Government should look at ways to expand the scope of work available to lawyers, for example, by channelling work to arbitrators, or allowing some form of percentage claims. This will increase court work and produce lawyers who are skilled in advocacy and, who knows, lawyers may even be encouraged to become orators and politicians.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it is illogical to restrict the foreign graduates, I believe, to the first 50 per year of those who have gained second upper honours degree from one of the 15 favourite British universities. It is also elitist. Is the Minister in a position to say that the quality of legal education is clearly better in these 15 universities than in other institutions of higher learning? Can the Minister say for sure that the holder of a second upper class honours degree will make a better practising lawyer than one who holds a second lower, or even a third class degree from the same university? For a local graduate, a second lower class degree will do. Is the Minister saying that a second lower class law degree from NUS is equal to a second upper class degree from overseas? I do not follow the logic.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, Sir, this is not being pragmatic and it is discriminatory and wrong headed. What about the non-academic qualities of the graduates? A lawyer is required to be a man or woman of honour and integrity. A high academic qualification is in itself no guarantee of honour and integrity. It could well be that exposure to other aspects of university life would help to give a man the necessary strength of character to turn him into a good lawyer and it may well be that if he spends too much of his time working to ensure that he gains his second upper, he may fail to gain the necessary exposure and experience.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, this Bill is objectionable because it is arbitrary that the Minister
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1172</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> should be given the power to decide the qualifications for entry and to change them from time to time. Basic things, like qualifications for entry into the legal profession, should be clearly set out in statute passed by Parliament, and not left to the discretion of the Minister. The same clause gives the Minister power to exempt any person or classes of persons from the provisions. I think the Minister should not be given this power to exempt. A man is either a qualified person or he is not. He cannot be a qualified person if the Minister says so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 empowers the Board to issue a person a certificate if, in the opinion of the Board, the person possesses such qualification or expertise as would enhance the quality of legal services in Singapore. I do not know what is the intention. Can the Minister give concrete examples of persons who might enhance the quality of legal services in Singapore? I think it is also too discretionary.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 requires the Council to disclose information relating to complaints against lawyers to the Chief Justice or the Attorney-General. This, to me, breaches the principle that unless and until sufficient cause is shown to warrant that the matter be brought to the attention of the court, disciplinary proceedings are confidential, that is to say, it is a matter between the lawyer being investigated and the Law Society, and no one else. This is, as it should be, in the case of a self-regulated autonomous profession.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also question the need for clause 13 for the court to be given power to discipline legal officers and non-practising lawyers directly, that is, on its own volition. Legal officers are, in any case, subject to the discipline of their employer, the Government through the AG, and the Public Service Commission. A lawyer, whether practising or not, is a citizen and subject to the laws of the land, like everyone else. If he breaks the law, he will be brought before the courts. There is no need, I think, to add burden on him just because of his professional status. People should be encouraged to learn the law and become lawyers, not warned that if they become lawyers they must or must not behave in a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1173</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> certain way, or indulge in certain activities, and if they do, they are liable to be struck off the rolls, even if their activities are perfectly legitimate, and they have not broken any law.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 29 is to amend the principal Act by deleting the words "in his professional capacity" from the provisions of the Act. To me, the implication is to extend the powers given by the Act to the Law Society and the courts to discipline lawyers for misconduct which has nothing to do with the practice of their profession. For example, if a lawyer is caught spitting on the road, or dropping a litter, prosecute him by all means. But does that make him unfit to practise law, or to call himself a lawyer? It is true that such conduct does not serve to uphold the honour and dignity of the profession. But it has nothing to do with maintaining the standard of practice in the profession.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, as fundamental changes are proposed to the qualification of persons regarded as being fit to enter into and to stay in the legal profession, I suggest that the Minister consider referring this Bill to a Select Committee and that the Law Society be invited to make representations.

  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I thank the Members who have spoken.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I first take Mr Davinder Singh's comments? I think most of his comments turned on the new provisions for legal officers and non-practising lawyers. I wish to assure him that it is not the intention to have double standards. As for the way the provisions have been crafted, there is a reason for this. The reason is that the Act particularises the various types of misconduct in detail for advocates and solicitors who are practising. Whereas for the legal officers and non-practising lawyers, there is a general provision concerning guilty of misconduct unbefitting a member of the honourable profession or unbefitting an officer of the Supreme Court. The second ground is the various acts of bankruptcy.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a good reason for this because we must remember that there are far more advocates and solicitors than legal officers and non-practising lawyers. There are more than 2,000. Next, bear in mind that they have client-solicitor relationship. They are practising lawyers. Non-practising lawyers and legal officers do not have client-solicitor relationships.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the number of complaints on practising lawyers is far more than for the special category of legal officers and non-practising lawyers. That is the reason why the procedure crafted for non-practising lawyers and legal officers is simpler. That does not mean that their interests or the safeguards will be lost sight of. For example, he mentioned the ex parte procedure. I think the main point, as I said, is that the number of complaints will be smaller and I do not think he will be at a disadvantage. I think the Chief Justice can be expected not to grant leave under this provision if the complaint is frivolous. In practice, I understand the court usually requires the application papers to be served on the defendant and allows him to be heard.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked about the non-inclusion of the provision on convictions. Again, I would like to point out that for non-practising lawyers and legal officers, the approach is taken to have a simpler procedure and criterion of conduct unbefitting the legal officer or non-practising lawyer. The reason for the non-inclusion of the provision on conviction is that it is really not relevant under this new general approach, since a criminal conviction per se is not a ground for disciplinary action, although the circumstances and the acts which give rise to the criminal action can be a matter to be considered by the Chief Justice or the Attorney-General.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to remind Mr Davinder Singh another reason why we have to make a distinction between practising advocates and solicitors and this other category. For practising advocates and solicitors, the procedures which begin from the Inquiry Committee, DC and show cause, almost invariably will affect his right to practise. Whereas for the legal officer, whatever is the result of the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1175</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> actions which may result from the Disciplinary Committee for legal officer and non-practising lawyer, as to whether he is to be retained in the service, whether he is to be demoted or fired or whatever in respect of his career, that has to be the subject of a separate independent proceeding to be brought - Mr Low Thia Khiang referred to it - by the Legal Service Commission. Therefore, because of these differences, the approach has been crafted differently.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as his query on transitional provisions is concerned, I have looked at the transitional provisions and it is fair to say that the interpretation must be of a clean slate approach. In other words, all these amendments will apply only to new cases which have been commenced or referred to an Inquiry Committee after the commencement of this Act. I hope these clarifications are helpful to Mr Davinder Singh.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon for his support. He is right that on the capping of lawyers, you can have different approaches. And I agree with his observation that the fact that 15 universities in the United Kingdom have been selected is not necessarily an adverse reflection on anyone who comes from another university.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked about the ceiling of 50 for the diploma course and whether there can be flexibility. I will discuss this with the Dean of the Law Faculty and the Chairman of the practical course. If there is flexibility, we must ensure that the flexibility is not implemented to such an extent that it will upset the projected growth rate. We cannot let it go totally askew, so to speak. But I will bear in mind his points and examine them with the Dean when they get to the implementation of the Diploma course.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Common professional examination. I would disagree with Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon. When I said common professional examination, what we have in mind is to avoid a situation now where you have the practical course separately organised and the Diploma course proposed for returned
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1176</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> United Kingdom law graduates and whether we can craft a new course which will probably combine the elements and objects of these two courses into one. I think what he hopes is that once we do that, then we do not have any restriction. I think the basic philosophy must be retained. And the basic philosophy is that for the future, short-term and longer-term, our policy must be that the entry to the legal profession must no longer be dependent on foreign qualifications acquired abroad. The mainstay ought to be the Law Faculty at the NUS. If we take that philosophy, then whether or not we have a common professional examination, we must be careful not to open the floodgates to all foreign qualifications.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang started off by saying that capping the number of lawyers cannot be in the interest of the public. He even talked about lawyers being allowed to work as waiters. That might have been tongue-in-cheek or he might have been serious. But when the day arrives that we have lawyers who cannot get employment and have to work as waiters ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Orators.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Orators? I apologise. I thought I heard him say "waiters". I take it back. I am not sure how many vacancies are there available for public orators.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, if Members read the report of the committee, there are very good reasons stated there as to why it is necessary to curb the projected rate. We are already 82 per 100,000 population and other countries like Japan, Switzerland, Hong Kong have far less and these are also commercial centres. We do not want to reach a situation in Western countries where you have a high ratio and a large number of lawyers which leads to a litigious society and also a misallocation of resources.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says "elitist". How do we justify 15 universities? He is not in favour of restriction on foreign law graduates. Here, I would like to take up the point I mentioned just now to Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon. In the early days when we did not
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1177</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> have a Law Faculty or when our Law Faculty was developing, it was right that we had this dependence on foreign qualifications as an entry route. We even had part-time law courses, external law degrees. But we have to review this. Very few countries in the world recognise foreign law qualifications as an entry to their legal profession. The United Kingdom is moving in a different direction. Their legal philosophy is changing fast. They are now tied up with the European Economic Community.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have no control whatsoever over their curriculum, their standards, what they teach, and they certainly do not teach any subject on Singapore law. Thirdly, in Singapore, our Law Faculty has got very high standards. Entry into the Law Faculty is very difficult and we are getting very good graduates. We have control over the standards with the external examiner. There is close coordination between the Law Faculty, the Academy of Law, and the Board of Legal Education to ensure that the legal training in Singapore is the best possible for entry into the Bar. We cannot be assured the same for those returning from the United Kingdom. Therefore, there must come a time when we cut the apron strings from the United Kingdom.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Committee's logical conclusion would have been to recommend a complete severance of ties. But they said that the primary source must be the NUS Law Faculty. And for the time being, allow a limited number to come from the United Kingdom. Once you decide on a limited number, then you must make a selection. And bear in mind, when you talk about foreign law graduates, law is different from other disciplines. In medicine, when we talk about appendectomy, if you have an appendicitis in the United States and a patient who has appendicitis here, we are talking of the same type of organ. But laws are different. Laws reflect certain norms, value systems, in a given society. And for the future, we must be sure that entrants to the legal profession are trained in the environment which they are familiar with and they are familiar with the laws which reflect the legal ethos and values of the country in which they are going to practise.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1178</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point raised by Mr Low Thia Khiang is whether we can be sure that the 15 universities are the best. The report makes it very clear that they are not implying that all other universities are bad, inferior, but a choice has to be made. And they made this choice with the best possible judgment that they could come to. I understand that they looked at the curriculum, they looked at the library resources, track record and, most important, they took into account that most of the returning Singapore lawyers from England traditionally come from these universities. So there is room for debate as to whether other universities should have been included. That is why they have recommended that this list should not be cast in stone and there should be periodic reviews because one of these 15 universities' standards may fall. So we must have the ability to review.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of second uppers or second lowers, we can have debating points on this. But really it comes back to quality. All these recommendations have, as their cornerstone, quality of the future legal practitioners. If you are interested in quality and, as I said, we have no controls over the standards and curriculum of these 15 universities, then you narrow it down to these 15 and from within the 15, make sure that we get the best. Sure, a second upper graduate does not necessarily guarantee that he is going to be better than someone else who has got a second lower. A second lower graduate may turn out later on to be a better practitioner than a second upper graduate. But we have to make decisions in the light of the information that we have before us.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also brought up the issue of subsidiary legislation, a point also raised by Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon. Why do it by subsidiary legislation? As I have pointed out in my speech, if we are not to do this, we have a legislation which will be very cumbersome and complicated because there have to be various different cut-off dates for various different categories of persons mentioned in the report. Therefore, we have decided to follow the approach in the United Kingdom where
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1179</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> for solicitors and architects, their requirements are spelt out in subsidiary legislation. That will also give us the flexibility to alter the list from time to time. So it is really to provide for flexibility.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He disagrees that legal officers must be subject to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in addition to the fact that they may be disciplined by the Legal Service Commission. But we need to take into account two different things. One is that he is employed by the Legal Service Commission. As an employee, there may be certain misdemeanours and disciplinary offences which may or may not duplicate the matters looked at by the Chief Justice. The Legal Service Commission has the authority to fire him or otherwise take action against him as an employee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But such a person has a dual capacity in that he is also an advocate and solicitor. Now, who admitted him as an advocate and solicitor? It was the Supreme Court. As an advocate and solicitor, he is an officer of the Supreme Court. That is why it is right that if a complaint is made, which may warrant him to be struck off the rolls, the Supreme Court should do it. We have changed the position because it cannot be the Law Society. The Law Society's jurisdiction properly should be over practising lawyers who have client-solicitor relationship. Others do not have client-solicitor relationship. For example, I am a non-practising lawyer. It is right that my status as an officer of the court should be subject to somebody's jurisdiction. But I do not think it should be the Law Society because I do not practise law. But it is right that the Chief Justice and the Supreme Court exercise jurisdiction over such non-practising lawyers. As I have pointed out, the legal officer, therefore, has two levels of possible disciplinary proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did we delete the words "in his professional capacity"? There is nothing sinister about this. The reason is that under the Act the list of offences which can be the subject of an investigation includes matters which do not relate to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1180</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> disciplinary professional matters. For example, one is convicted of CBT in respect of monies given to you by a relative. You can be convicted of criminal breach of trust but it may not be in your capacity as a lawyer, but the law has always said that in the legal profession that is a ground for taking action. So there is an inconsistency between the deletion of those words and other provisions. It is really to harmonise. But, as I have assured Members, it cannot mean that you can bring frivolous or irrelevant matters under the guise of this newly amended provision. For example, the wife of a lawyer should not be entitled to bring a complaint on the ground that she had some matrimonial problems with her husband because that is conduct which is completely unrelated to his being an officer of the court or being an honourable member of the profession.
