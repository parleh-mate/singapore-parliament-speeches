<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>DEPOSITS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Purchase of private houses by middle income group)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee</b> asked the Minister for

Foreign  Affairs and Minister for Labour, in  view

of the fact that the Housing and Development Board

is  unable  to  fully meet the  housing  needs  of

workers  in  the middle income group, if  he  will

consider allowing this category



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>



of workers to utilise their Central Provident Fund

deposits  to  purchase  private  houses  built  by

reputable building societies.



<br><br><!--Mr Sia Kah Hui(The Minister of State for Labour (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour))-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr  Speaker,  Sir,   the

Central  Provident  Fund  Board  approved  housing

scheme regulations were introduced in August  1968

to  enable  members  of  the  C.P.F. to  purchase

Housing  and  Development Board flats  and  houses

under the home-ownership scheme of the Housing and

Development Board.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1451</b></font><br><br>



In  March  1970 the regulations were  extended  to

include  the home-ownership scheme of  the  Jurong

Town   Corporation.  The  Housing  Board  is   now

allowing families with a combined income of $1,200

per month to use their C.P.F. deposits to purchase

Housing  Board flats. This ceiling will be  raised

to $1,500 per month as from July this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that applicants for Housing Board

flats  have to wait quite a long time because  the

demand for public housing exceeds the supply.  The

long  waiting  period  is  not  confined  only  to

applicants from the middle income group, but those

from the lower income group also have to wait  for

their flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not intended to extend the C.P.F. approved

housing scheme regulations to allow C.P.F. members

from  the middle income group to purchase  private

houses  built by building societies.  This  policy

may be reviewed in five years' time, depending  on

the  housing  position then and  the  Housing  and

Development Board building capacity as it grows in

the next few years.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, in view of the fact that there are people who

have  been  on the waiting list for Housing  Board

flats  for  two  years  or  even  more,  will  the

Minister  care to review the position so that  not

only  the  middle income group but also the  lower

income group can utilise their C.P.F. deposits  to

buy private houses?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, when I said "review", of

course, I meant a review of the whole picture.  It

need  not  be confined to the middle income  group

only.

<div align="center"><b>RE-ROUTING OF BUS ROUTES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>TO CENTRAL BUS STATIONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>IN CITY AREA</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  if  his  Ministry   has   made   a

feasibility study on the establishment of  two  or

more central bus stations in the City area



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1452</b></font><br><br>



and the re-routing of bus routes where practicable

to  one  or  other  of the bus  stations  so  that

commuters  to and from the City will not  have  to

change buses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the bus transport system

is of a flexible nature by which passengers can be

conveniently  loaded and unloaded  at  very  close

intervals along the routes, unlike a rail or other

mass transport system. The need, therefore, for  a

concentrated  passenger  stop,  where   passengers

unload  and  walk  to  their destination,  is  not

considered  necessary. Nevertheless,  in  the  bus

reorganisation plan a number of high capacity  bus

stops  in  the City area, for example,  in  Market

Street, Cecil Street, Empress Place, Collyer Quay,

Prince  Edward  Road, which is just  opposite  the

Singapore  Polytechnic, are provided to cater  for

the   needs  of  the  majority  of  commuters  who

concentrate in this area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed re-routing of services has also

been  designed  so  as  to  provide  direct  links

between  major  residential areas  with  the  City

area,  namely, Collyer Quay, Shenton Way, Robinson

Road,   Chinatown,  North  Bridge  Road,  Victoria

Street,    High   Street,   and   Orchard    Road.

Furthermore, a series of re-routes and inter-urban

services  also provide direct links between  major

residential and industrial areas. This arrangement

of  services  should enable the  majority  of  bus

commuters  to  complete  their  journeys   without

changing   buses  or,  at  most,  with  only   one

transfer.

<div align="center"><b>COMPLAINTS AGAINST CIVIL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SERVANTS OF DISCOURTESY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Conduct of courtesy courses)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  (a) the number of complaints made against

civil  servants  who  have been  discourteous  and

impolite  to  members  of the  public  during  the

period   1st  January,  1969  up  to  the   latest

convenient date; (b) whether courses on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>



courtesy  have been organised for civil  servants

and,  if so, (i) how many courses have been  held;

and  (ii)  how many and what categories  of  civil

servants  participated in them;  and  (c)  whether

more such courses will be conducted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  number of complaints of discourtesy  of

civil  servants received by the Central Complaints

Bureau during the period 1st January, 1969, to 8th

February,   1971,  is  154.  Out  of   this,   118

complaints were not substantiated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government is aware of the need to conduct

courses  on courtesy for civil servants, and  such

courses  have  been held regularly  in  the  past.

Since  January  1969,  10  Customs  officers,   12

Immigration  officers and 12 Health officers  have

attended  a "First Course in Courtesy".  About  24

Administrative  officers are currently  undergoing

an intermediate training course, which includes  a

course  on public relations at the Staff  Training

institute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More courses on courtesy are being planned. A

courtesy  course for about 20 personal assistants,

telephone  operators,  receptionists  and  counter

clerks is scheduled to begin some time next month.

Another course for Division II and III officers is

to  be  held  at  the  National  Youth  Leadership

Training Institute on 28th April, 1971. The course

will  include  lectures on  "Essentials  of  human

relations" and discussions and role-play  sessions

on how to deal with members of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is intended to conduct training courses which

will  include  courtesy to members of  the  public

similar   to   the   course  which  Administrative

Officers  are  currently  undergoing,  for   other

Division I officers in departments which come into

constant contact with the public, such as those in

the   Foreign,  Immigration,  Customs  and  Postal

Services.

<div align="center"><b>FORTY-TWO HOUR WEEK FOR</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>CIVIL SERVANTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Evaluation of benefits)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  if  it  is feasible for his  Ministry  to

evaluate  what benefit has been derived  from  the

introduction of the 42-hour week, by the  increase

of  an  hour per day, in all sectors of the  civil

service,  and whether any inconvenience  has  been

encountered by civil servants by the change in the

times of arrival at, and departure from work.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not possible to

quantify  the  benefits  of  the  changed  working

hours. However, the fact that offices are now open

from  8.00  a.m, to 5.00 p.m, on weekdays  except

Saturdays, instead of from 9.00 a.m, to 4.30  p.m.

as before, means an improved service to the public

in the sense that they now have more time to visit

these offices to get their affairs attended to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No survey has been conducted and it is,

therefore,   not  known  definitely  whether   any

inconvenience  has  been  encountered   by   civil

servants  by the change. As far as can be  judged,

it would appear that while some civil servants did

encounter  some inconvenience in the beginning  in

adjusting to the new routine, all of them  by  and

large are now used to the changed hours of work.

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Main Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure

for  the  financial year 1st April, 1971, to  31st

March, 1972, have been considered and approved  by

the  House  as  Cmd. Paper No. 3  of  1971.  Under

section 85 of the Constitution of Singapore, heads

of expenditure other than statutory expenditure to

be  met  from  the Consolidated Fund  have  to  be

included in a Bill to be known as the Supply Bill.

The  purpose of such a Bill is to provide for  the

issue  from  the  Consolidated Fund  of  the  sums

necessary   to  meet  the  expenditure   and   the

appropriation  of  these  sums  for  the  purposes

specified therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supply Bill before Members is to give

legislative approval for the issue of  funds  from

the   Consolidated  Fund  to  meet  the  sums   of

expenditure  for  the financial  year  1st  April.

1971, to 31st March, 1972. In the Schedule to  the

Bill  are  shown the various heads of  expenditure

and  the  sums that may be incurred in respect  of

each  head. These have been approved by the  House

in  the Estimates of Expenditure for the financial

year  1st  April, 1971, to 31st March,  1972,  and

appear in pages 51 and 52 of Cmd. Paper 3 of 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the Supply Bill is approved, I will be

empowered    to    issue   warrants    authorising

expenditure  up to the amount under each  head  as

shown  in  the  Bill  to  be  paid  out  from  the

Consolidated Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
