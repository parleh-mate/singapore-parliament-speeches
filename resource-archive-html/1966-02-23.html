<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>PRIMARY SIX REPEAT CLASSES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>IN SEMBAWANG</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Education whether the Government has any plans  to

start Primary Six Repeat Classes in schools in the

Sembawang  Constituency for students who  fail  in

the  Primary  School  Leaving Examination  in  the

English and Chinese streams.



<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Inche A. Rahim Ishak) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all Primary Six Repeat pupils in

the Chinese stream have been found places in their

own  schools in the Sembawang area. In the English

stream,  Primary Six Repeat pupils who  could  not

find  places in their own schools have since  been

admitted to other schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government plans to build extensions to Nee

Soon  School and the Sembawang Hills Estate School

to   provide   12   additional  classrooms.   When

completed, some of these classrooms will  be  used

for Primary Six Repeat Classes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): A

supplementary question, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister concerned about

the   Primary   Six  students  in  the   Sembawang

Constituency. If they do not have any -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am sorry. Will the Member

please  resume  his  seat? I am  not  getting  the

translation through.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like

to  ask  the  Minister concerned  this:  when  the

Primary Six students have no more places in  their

schools,  will  the Principals  of  these  schools

report  to the Ministry of Education so  that  the

Minister  can  take steps to allocate  places  for

these pupils in other schools?



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, because I

was  not  able to hear the translation through  my

earphone,  I  had  a  running translation  of  the

question from the Member seated next to me.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have earlier stated that all Primary Six Repeat

pupils  in  the  Chinese stream  have  been  found

places. So that question does not arise.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps if Inche Rahim resumes his

seat,  I  will  ask  the  Member  to  repeat   his

supplementary question again, so that we will  get

the  full  text of his question. Will  the  Member

mind repeating his supplementary question again?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  just now I was asking the Minister concerned

if  there are any Primary Six students who do  not

have any accommodation in their schools, will  the

Ministry  of  Education,  on  a  report  from  the

Principals  concerned, allot places  for  them  in

order to allow them to continue for one more year?



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> I have only to repeat that all

places have been found for them. But if the Member

is  referring  to next year, then, of  course,  we

will cross the river as we reach it.

<div align="center"><b>SAWMILLS IN KAMPONG KEMBANGAN</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b> asked the

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng) (for the Minister for Culture and Social Affairs):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I have been instructed to reply that

there  are three licensed sawmills in the  Kampong

Affairs  inform this House whether action will  be

taken against those unlicensed sawmills?

action  has been taken against the operators,  and

one operator has since been convicted and fined.

<div align="center"><b>DAMAGE TO ROADS IN KAMPONG KEMBANGAN</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b> asked the

Minister for Law and National Development if he is

aware  that several roads in the Kampong Kembangan

Constituency have been damaged by lorries carrying

heavy  loads  and  whether action  will  be  taken

against the drivers or owners of such lorries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon) (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  I  am  directed  to  answer   the

question.  I  am aware that several roads  in  the

Kampong  Kembangan Constituency have been  damaged

by  heavy vehicles. This includes lorries carrying

heavy  loads. The Public Works Department has  now

stationed   men  at  various  points  to   collect

evidence  of vehicles which cause damage to  roads

with  a view to prosecution in Court under section

22   (a)   of  the  Local  Government  Integration

Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, is the

Parliamentary  Secretary aware that Jalan  Perwira

at  Kaki  Bukit has been damaged on  a  number  of

occasions  by  lorries  carrying  sand?  Will  the

Minister  for National Development take action  to

prosecute the lorry owners?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes.

Investigations  carried out by  the  Public  Works

Department revealed that the roads were damaged by

vehicles  belonging to operators of sand  quarries

in  the Kaki Bukit area. Action is now being taken

against  them  under section 22 (a) of  the  Local

Government   Integration  Ordinance.  To   prevent

further  damage  to the roads,  the  Public  Works

Department  has  applied to the  Urban  and  Rural

Services   Committee  for  release  of  funds   to

construct bollards at entrances to the roads. This

is  due  for consideration by the U.R.S.C. at  its

meeting next month.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of the Bill is to make such changes of

terminology to the Customs Ordinance, 1960, as are

required   in   the   light  of  Singapore's   new

constitutional   position   on   separation   from

Malaysia. The opportunity has also been  taken  to

make  such  amendments as are considered desirable

in  the light of past experience and to revert  to

simpler administrative procedures which existed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>



in  the  Customs Ordinance in Singapore  prior  to

Malaysia. Such amendments will provide for greater

flexibility    and    streamline    administrative

procedures  to improve efficiency in administering

the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;References to the Crown, Federal Minister and

such  other  titles which are no longer applicable

here  have  been removed and suitably  substituted

with the appropriate titles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of simplification of the procedure is

the reversion to the pre-Malaysia practice whereby

Customs Duties could be prescribed by the Minister

by Order published in the Gazette and subsequently

presented to the Legislature. During Malaysia  for

the  duties  to  be  effective  they  had  to   be

confirmed by a resolution passed by Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 of the Bill extends the exemption

provisions from Customs Duties to apply to  taxes,

fees and other charges payable under the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 makes provision for the refund of

erroneous  payments  for which  no  provision  now

exists under the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 extends the period during which

recovery  may  be made of moneys and empowers  the

Comptroller  to  waive such recoveries  where  the

amounts do not exceed $5.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 provides for the method of calculation

of   duty  in  Government  warehouses  and   other

warehouses   to  be  similar  where   at   present

different systems apply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where at present the Comptroller has power to

withdraw  the  warehouses or bottling  warehouses'

licences, no provision exists for suspension; such

powers are now provided in clauses 23 and 29.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing law relating to exemption from

licensing  of premises for the sale of liquors  to

British  Armed Forces personnel has been  extended

to  cover all Armed Forces in Singapore in  clause

13.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing law, where partial exemption

of  Customs  duties  has been given,  no  drawback

facilities  can be given. Clause 31  provides  for

liberalisation of drawback facilities taking  into

account   the   need   to   foster   export    and

manufacturing industries.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses have also been included to exempt from

Customs  duty  raw  materials used  by  bona  fide

export orientated local manufacturers. For control

purposes,  "licensed  factory  warehouses",   with

provisions for storage, release of dutiable  goods

and  Customs  inspection are  provided  for  under

clause 22 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 39, 40 and 42 provide for increased

composition sums, penalties for tax evasion,  etc.

so  that  with more duties being imposed, adequate

deterrents will exist in the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under existing law, toddy is a Government

monopoly and provision has been made in clause  33

for  the  supply and use of toddy as an ingredient

in  the manufacture of other products and for  the

bottling of toddy for retail sale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less important clauses include powers for the

Comptroller  to  prescribe places  of  import  and

export of dutiable goods by sea from time to time;

and  the  requirements  for  full  statements   in

respect  of all goods imported and those  intended

for  transhipment instead of inconvenient extracts

in  respect of dutiable goods. Changes  have  also

been  made  in  the prescribed times within  which

statements  have  to be submitted.  These  changes

will  prepare  the  way for the necessary  customs

controls  for  a  period of expanding  tariffs  to

assist industrialisation and development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other modifications or changes are mainly

procedural and not substantive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Lim Kim San].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>MALAYSIAN INFANTRY BATTALION IN SINGAPORE</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Statement by Minister of Defence)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I wish to inform the House  of  the

latest   position  in  regard  to  the   continued

presence  of  a  Malaysian infantry  battalion  in

Singapore. The issue was first brought  to  public

attention by a public statement made by the  Prime

Minister  of  Malaysia on 17th February,  when  he

described how he was taken aback by what he termed

the sudden demand by the Singapore Government that

the  Malaysian  battalion should vacate  the  camp

that  they had been occupying. This came,  in  the

words of the Tengku, as a bolt from the blue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, quite some time before the Tengku's

public  statement, events had already been set  in

motion.  The first step was taken by the Malaysian

Ministry  of  Defence.  In  a  letter  dated   4th

February,  1966, i.e, nearly two weeks before  the

Tengku's   public  statement,  the  Deputy   Prime

Minister of Malaysia and Minister of Defence wrote

to   me   proposing  that  a  Malaysian   infantry

battalion  remains stationed in the  island.  This

particular  battalion had been  in  occupation  of

Camp  Temasek, following upon the posting  of  the

2nd  Battalion,  Singapore Infantry  Regiment,  to

defence duties in Sabah. In February the battalion

had  completed its tour of duty and was  scheduled

to  return  to  its  own camp by  stages.  Advance

parties  of  the battalion had already arrived  in

Singapore  and were in occupation of Camp  Temasek

to  prepare  for the arrival of the  rest  of  the

battalion.   At  the  same  time,  the   Malaysian

battalion in Camp Temasek was scheduled to move to

another  battalion  camp in  Tapah  and,  in  like

manner,  advance  parties of  this  battalion  had

moved to Tapah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The request of the Malaysian Defence Minister was

therefore  an  unexpected move not  in  conformity

with the schedule of rotation of troops previously

laid  down.  It  constituted an obvious  departure

from policy. I replied on the 9th February stating

that the question



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



of  the continued presence of a Malaysian infantry

battalion  in Singapore was something that  should

be discussed as a separate issue. In the meantime,

it was urgent that the Malaysian battalion vacates

Camp   Temasek  to  allow  units  of  the   Second

Battalion  of the Singapore Infantry  Regiment  to

return to their camp since they had been living in

very difficult conditions in the jungles of Borneo

for the past six months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Tengku's statement, there has been

public controversy as to the respective rights  of

the  two  Governments  under  the  separation   of

Singapore  agreement in respect of  stationing  of

troops. The Ministry of Defence, Malaysia, claimed

that  "it  is  obligatory  on  the  part  of   the

Singapore Government to allow Malaysian troops  to

stay  in  the  present bases or, if  they  require

these  bases  for  their own  troops,  to  provide

suitable alternative accommodation." Article V (3)

of  the Independence of Singapore Agreement, 1965,

was invoked in support of this claim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government had made it clear in a

statement on 18th February that it does not accept

this  interpretation  of  the  agreement  on   two

grounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Article V stipulates that the two

Governments  will enter into a treaty of  external

defence  and  mutual  assistance  to  provide  for

matters set out in four separate sections. The two

Governments have not as yet entered into any  such

treaty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, when such a defence treaty is agreed and

signed,  it  will  provide,  in  accordance   with

paragraph  (3) of Article V, that "the  Government

of  Singapore  will  afford to the  Government  of

Malaysia  the  right to continue to  maintain  the

bases  and  other facilities used by its  military

forces  within  Singapore  and  will  permit   the

Government of Malaysia to make such use  of  these

bases and facilities as the Government of Malaysia

may consider necessary for the purpose of external

defence".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operative words are "right to continue" bases

and   facilities  "used"  by  Malaysia's  military

forces.  Camp Temasek was not "used" by Malaysia's

military  forces  on the date  of  the  separation

agreement - 7th August,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



1965, or the date of separation, 9th August, 1965.

By  section  9  of  the Constitution  of  Malaysia

(Singapore  Amendment) Act, 1965,  passed  by  the

Parliament of Malaysia, all property which  before

Malaysia   belonged  to  Singapore  reverted   to

Singapore once again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We offered to submit the issue to arbitration by

an   independent  Commonwealth  or   international

tribunal  as a means of resolving the disagreement

as  to the interpretation of the Agreement. Up  to

now,  this  offer  has not been  accepted  by  the

Government of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the Parliamentary Secretary to

the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence,

Malaysia,  issued  a  public  statement  on   21st

February, 1966. In one respect, the statement  was

re-assuring  in  that the Parliamentary  Secretary

stated that his Government accepted the fact  that

Singapore  is an independent and sovereign  State.

He  also stated that the Malaysian Government  had

never  maintained the right to station  troops  in

Singapore  without  regard to  the  agreement  and

without  the  consent of the Singapore Government.

So far so good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he went on to say that the Singapore

Government  had agreed to the Malaysian Government

stationing  their  troops in Singapore  under  the

separation  agreement. He also stated  that  under

the separation agreement Singapore had agreed that

Malaysia  shall be responsible for the defence  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important that the two Governments

should  be  in no doubt as to what the  separation

agreement  provides  for  and  what  it  does  not

provide for. Nowhere does the separation agreement

state  that  Singapore  has agreed  that  Malaysia

shall be responsible for the defence of Singapore.

If   the  Malaysian  Parliamentary  Secretary  had

consulted his own Attorney-General, he would never

have  made a statement like this. The second point

is  that  the  agreement in respect of  bases  and

facilities  in  Singapore, as we  have  repeatedly

pointed  out,  is  limited  to  those  bases   and

facilities used by the Malaysians on the island at

the   time  of  separation.  The  right   of   the

Government of Malaysia is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



the  right to continue to maintain these bases and

to  make  such  use  of these bases  as  they  may

consider  necessary for the purpose of  Malaysia's

external defence. It does not extend to the  right

to  occupy new bases with new troops. Here  again,

if  the  Malaysian Government disagrees  with  our

interpretation,  the matter can  quite  easily  be

resolved    by   reference   to   an   independent

international tribunal, whose decision  should  be

accepted as binding on both Governments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me, for a moment, move away from the

constitutional and legal aspects of  this  matter.

There  are  two points to which attention  may  be

drawn.  The  first  is the obvious  one  that  the

Second  Battalion of the S.I.R., having  served  a

gruelling campaign in the jungles of Sabah in  the

defence   of   Malaysia,  surely  deserve   better

treatment  on  their return to Singapore  than  to

find   that  their  camp  has  been  occupied   by

Malaysian troops.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second observation is that a disagreement of

such a nature could have arisen in the way it  did

is   symptomatic  of  a  deeper  malaise  in   the

relations  between the two Governments on  defence

matters.  This  issue  is  but  one  of  the  many

outstanding issues which had arisen between us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to overburden the House with the

minutiae of the many points of unresolved disputes

arising  between  the  Ministries  of  Defence  in

Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, but an outline of some

of the matters may be illuminating.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Battalion, S.I.R., has not only been

deprived  of its camp accommodation, but  also  of

the  greater  part of its Battalion  transport.  A

search  party  is  now in Batu  Gajah  to  try  to

collect the Battalion's transport which has  found

its  way  there.  So far their efforts  to  locate

their trucks, jeeps, landrovers and other vehicles

have  met  with only limited success. Nor  is  the

First   Battalion  of  the  S.I.R. in  a   better

position.  Much  of its transport had  been  taken

over  by  the  Fourth Malaysian  Infantry  Brigade

Headquarters during the time when Singapore was in

Malaysia. In spite of repeated requests  over  the

last four or five months for the return of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



the transport to the First Battalion, S.I.R., both

the  trucks and the drivers still remain with  the

Fourth  Malaysian Infantry Brigade,  who  maintain

that  until  they receive instructions from  Kuala

Lumpur, they are unable to make any move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Singapore Day, there were large numbers of

Singapore  army personnel, some three  hundred  in

number,  posted in various units of the  Malaysian

army.  Similarly,  there  are  large  numbers   of

Malaysian citizens in the Singapore army. Attempts

to  have  this matter sorted out so that  citizens

may  return to their own armies, have so far  made

very  little headway. However, a message has  been

received  from Kuala Lumpur recently that suggests

that  there is hope that this vexatious issue will

be settled shortly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is the army transport and camp

accommodation taken over by Malaysian units, but a

large  part of our signals equipment and personnel

have  also been taken over by them. There  are  60

officers  and  men of the Singapore  Armed  Forces

posted  to the Fourth Malaysian Infantry  Brigade.

It  was  agreed in November last year  that  these

officers and men and their equipment should return

to  Singapore  units in a phased  programme.  Here

again, no progress has been made to carry out this

phased   programme,  with  the  result  that   the

operational   efficiency  of  our  Battalions   in

carrying   out  internal  security  functions   is

reduced.  Again,  armoured  cars,  equipment   and

personnel  belonging  to Singapore  were  attached

during   Malaysia   to   the   Federation    First

Independent  Reconnaisance Regiment  and  all  our

attempts  to  unscramble this  have  met  with  no

success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards our Navy, the story is even more

extraordinary. Before we joined Malaysia, we had a

naval ship, the renowned "Panglima". This ship has

disappeared under Malaysian Command, and  attempts

even  to  find its location have not met with  any

success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, where do we go from here? It is important

that  we  should never lose grasp  of  the  proper

perspective  of  the fundamentals of  our  defence

policy. Both Malaysia and Singapore do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



have  adequate defence forces at their command  to

deter aggression from their larger neighbours, nor

are  they able successfully to fend off any  major

assault  that may be mounted upon us. So for  some

time,  until  our defence forces are substantially

increased, we shall have to depend on the military

shield  provided by our Commonwealth  Allies.  But

our Commonwealth Allies will be willing to provide

us  with  this  shield only  if  they  find  their

international political position a tenable one and

the domestic scene stable enough for their defence

effort  to  be  effective. If the  Governments  of

Singapore  and Malaysia are unable effectively  to

co-operate  in their common defence  effort,  this

must in turn adversely affect the efficacy of  the

defence  arrangements with Britain, Australia  and

New  Zealand who are expending large sums of money

and men in retaining their military commitments in

this  region. So co-operate we must, but this  co-operation must be as between two sovereign  States

and not as between big brother and his satellite.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore necessary that the Malaysian

Government should revise its attitude towards  the

Singapore    Government   in   defence    matters.

Peremptory  requests, stone-walling and  obviously

dilatory  and  evasive  tactics  in  dealing  with

legitimate requests and enquiries from us can only

lead  to increasing exasperation. If the Malaysian

Government is prepared to accept Singapore both in

word  and  in  deed  as an equal  partner  in  the

defence arrangements of the whole region,  then  I

do  not  see that there is any problem that cannot

be resolved to our mutual satisfaction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if the Malaysian Government

were to insist on having its own way regardless of

the  legality of its actions in international law,

then   the   whole   issue  will   acquire   wider

implications   and   it  may   eventually   become

necessary for us, in order to have our sovereignty

in these matters recognised and respected, to have

recourse to appropriate international tribunals. I

am  certain  that  it is not  the  desire  of  the

Malaysian  Government to bring matters to  such  a

pass,  and that they are as prepared as we are  to

arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution of  all

outstanding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



issues. On our part, we have acted with the utmost

circumspection,  and indeed the public  revelation

of  the  disagreement over the Malaysian  Infantry

Battalion  in  Singapore  was  not  made  by   the

Singapore  Government but by the  Malaysian  Prime

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it that the Member wishes to

ask a question on the Ministerial Statement?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I wish to ask the

Minister some questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, having heard the statement by

the  Minister of Defence, I wish to know how  long

it  has  been since the Second Battalion,  S.I.R.,

returned to the Republic of Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, how much longer do the Malaysian troops

wish to remain in Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, why are they not willing to return to

Malaysia  in  view  of the fact that  Malaysia  is

their fatherland?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, are they aware that if they return to

Malaysia,  their  surplus  rations  will  be  made

available to them in Malaysia?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, are they stationed in Singapore with a

nefarious    object    in    order    to    create

misunderstanding  or friction with  the  Singapore

Infantry Regiment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, are they of the opinion that the

Malaysian troops -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Could the hon. Member please

ask  one question at a time? I have lost count  of

all these questions!



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think so. I was coming to that

myself. The general practice is for Members of the

House who wish to elicit further information on  a

Ministerial  statement to ask  questions  so  that

they  can be answered to the satisfaction  of  the

questioners. But if the questions proceed to  six,

seven,  or  ten at a time, I am afraid the  Member

for Kampong Kapor will not get a single answer. So

will he confine himself to a single question first

rather than six or seven at a time?

heard so many complaints from our S.I.R. since

their return from Sabah, and they have not been

accommodated properly. Hence, I put forward such

questions. Nevertheless, I bow to Mr Speaker's

advice to put my questions one by one.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is no objection to the Member

asking  a second question if it becomes necessary.

But  perhaps, in the first instance, he might just

ask  a  single  question of the Minister  and  the

Minister might then be able to answer it. Then  we

will  see where we get to from there. One question

please.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I have about 15

questions. The first one is: since when  have  the

S.I.R. returned to Singapore, and whether they are

accommodated  under canvas tents  in  Farrer  Park

intentionally or otherwise?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The S.I.R. returned to

Singapore  in  batches, beginning with  the  first

week  of February. As I said in my statement,  the

advance party found accommodation at Camp Temasek.

But  as  later groups came in, there was  no  more

space  at  Camp Temasek and they have  had  to  be

accommodated under canvas in Farrer Park.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps I should inform Members that

I  will  only permit questions arising out of  the

Ministerial  statement.  I  will  not  permit  any

questions  on which the Minister has  not  made  a

statement but which may be exercising the minds of

Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

arising  out  of  the  Ministerial  statement,   I

understand   that   the  Malaysian   Parliamentary

Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister, Tun  Abdul

Razak,   issued  a  statement  saying   that   the

Malaysian  troops are here to stay and  to  defend

Singapore  by  agreement. Here, we all  know  that

Malaysia  herself is not in a position  to  defend

against  Indonesian aggression. How on  earth  can

their  soldiers  defend  Singapore?  So  will  the

Minister of Defence inform



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>



this House whether there is such an agreement that

we  request the Malaysian troops to stay here  and

to defend Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thought I

talked  at length on this subject in my statement.

But   in  the  event  the  hon.  Member  had   not

understood everything that I said, I think  it  is

best  if  I  read  the relevant  sections  of  the

separation agreement. Now, under Article V,  there

are  four sections. I think I had better read  the

whole  of  Article V because this is the one  that

deals with Defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Article V



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties hereto will enter into a treaty on

external  defence and mutual assistance  providing

that -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the parties hereto will establish a joint

defence  council  for purposes  of  external

defence and mutual assistance;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the Government of Malaysia will afford to

the  Government of Singapore such assistance

as may be considered reasonable and adequate

for  external  defence, and in consideration

thereof  the  Government of  Singapore  will

contribute  from its own armed  forces  such

units   thereof   as   may   be   considered

reasonable and adequate for such defence;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the Government of Singapore will afford to

the  Government  of Malaysia  the  right  to

continue  and maintain the bases  and  other

facilities  used  by  its  military   forces

within   Singapore  and  will   permit   the

Government of Malaysia to make such  use  of

these bases and facilities as the Government

of  Malaysia may consider necessary for  the

purpose of external defence;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) each party will undertake not to enter into

any  treaty  or  agreement  with  a  foreign

country  which  may  be detrimental  to  the

independence and defence of the territory of

the other party.'



<br><br>Now,  paragraph  (3)  of Article  V  is  the  most

relevant  one. Under this the Malaysian Government

will  have the right to continue and maintain  its

bases.  The  Malaysian Government does maintain  a

number  of  bases  and military establishments  in

Singapore.  For instance, the main naval  base  of

the Malaysian Navy is in Woodlands,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



that   is,   in   Singapore,  and  the   Malaysian

Government,  therefore, has the right to  continue

to  maintain  this  base and use  it  in  whatever

manner   it  thinks  necessary  for  the  external

defence  of Malaysia. Similarly, there  are  other

units with which I need not burden the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point that I am making is that this agreement

extends the right to the Government of Malaysia to

use  these bases and not to establish new ones  or

occupy  them  with new troops. It is  not,  in  my

opinion,  correct for the Malaysian Government  to

invoke  this  particular Article  to  support  the

continued stay of the Malaysian Infantry Battalion

in  Camp  Temasek. Should it want to  station  its

battalion  here for whatever purposes  it  has  in

mind,  this  is  something  which  we  are  always

willing  to discuss with it and reach an  amicable

settlement. But it is not correct to say that  the

agreement gives it the right to do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> May I ask a supplementary

question?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, just one supplementary

question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I wish to ask the Minister of

Defence  whether there is any secret agreement  or

undertaking  other  than those  published  in  the

separation agreement -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have already informed the

House  that I shall only allow questions  directly

arising  out of the Ministerial statement,  and  I

will not allow any other question. That question I

will not allow, unless the Minister -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am prepared to answer that

question.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Very well then. Mr Ho, you may put

your question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I would like to ask the Minister

of  Defence whether there is any secret  agreement

or  undertaking other than those published in  the

separation agreement.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I can say quite clearly and

categorically that there is no secret agreement or

understanding   other  than  the  open   agreement

published and presented to this House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I thought the Member is going to ask

his last supplementary question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The very last, yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> In view of the domineering and

bullying  attitude  of the Federation  Government,

just  in  case the Malaysian Government refuse  to

move out their troops from here, what steps are we

going to take, of course, without having to resort

to military confrontation?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister need not answer that if

he does not want to.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, we are trying to settle

this  issue  with  the  Malaysian  Government   by

discussion,  by  reason, and by logic.  I  do  not

think I am being assisted in this task by the  use

of  strong  words  by  the  hon.  Member.  However

strongly  he  may  feel about this  matter,  I  do

implore him to bear in mind the wider implications

of  this  subject.  Of  course,  one  admires  the

courageous  attitude he has taken in this  matter,

and no doubt his recent military training may have

something to do with it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wish to ask two questions. First, if the Malaysian

troops  continue to occupy our barracks  at  Camp

Temasek,  how  long does our Minister  of  Defence

expect our own troops to undergo inconvenience and

hardship by having to live under canvas at  Farrer

Park?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, discussions at

Staff  level  already took place  yesterday.  They

have not been as fruitful and productive as I wish

them  to be, but we are very anxious to have  this

matter  settled satisfactorily and as  quickly  as

possible.  I  entirely share the feelings  of  the

hon.  Member that it is a most regrettable  matter

that  our troops on their return from Borneo  have

to   continue   to  live  under  very  distasteful

conditions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope our

Minister  of  Defence will answer  this  question.

When  will  negotiations for a defence  treaty  or

treaties commence? Will the treaty or treaties  be

tripartite or bi-lateral?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Of course, this would have to

be  taken  in a number of steps. The first  to  be

taken is, I think, by the British Government. They

have to decide whether they want to run down their

bases.  At this present moment, I believe a debate

is going on in the British Parliament on the White

Paper  on  Defence. So when the British Government

have  made up their minds, no doubt in the  course

of this year, approaches will be made to us and to

the  Malaysian  Government to discuss,  negotiate,

and   conclude   appropriate  defence   agreements

between ourselves. Whether it will be two separate

agreements  -between  Britain  and  Singapore  and

between Britain and Malaysia - or whether it  will

go  into one combined defence agreement, these are

matters  on  which we shall decide at  the  proper

moment  when the issues become clearer. I  do  not

think I want to anticipate these issues now.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): I wish to

ask  the Minister of Defence one question. I  know

there  are  British troops in Singapore.  But  are

there  Malaysian troops? Why are Malaysian  troops

in Singapore? Will the Minister explain? Secondly,

our  citizens are in the Malaysian army.  What  is

their  position?  Will they  be  recalled  to  our

country?  When  will this happen? And  will  their

equipment be brought to Singapore? Thirdly,  there

are lorries -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> One question at a time. I think the

first  question has already been answered  by  the

Minister, and the second question has also already

been  answered  by him. I do not propose  to  call

upon  him  to  answer  them.  What  is  the  third

question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): There are lorries

and  other equipment which belong to us. There are

boats  also which belong to us. Has the  Malaysian

Government given them back to us? If they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



are  not  returned  to  us,  what  action  is  the

Minister going to take? Will he explain this?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister's answer, I think, is

that  we are trying to look for them. I think that

is the answer. Is it not, Mr Minister?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to know from the

Minister  of Defence this. He has stated just  now

that ships of our Navy and transport from our army

had been used by the Alliance Government while  we

were  in  Malaysia and up till now they  have  not

been  returned yet. Apart from this, is there  any

other  equipment which has not been  returned?  Is

this  because they wish to weaken our  defence  or

have they any nefarious designs on our State?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not,

of  course, for me to make a defence on behalf  of

the Malaysian Government. But I do wish Members to

remember that they are engaged in defending  their

territories   against  military  aggression   from

Indonesia.  They are in the process  of  expanding

their  defence forces both on land, sea  and  air,

and  they are having an extremely difficult  time.

So   the   point   is  this;  because   of   their

preoccupation in these matters, they may not  have

sufficient time or sufficient energy to deal  with

our  request as expeditiously as they should have.

At  the same time, four to five months have passed

since we raised the question and I do wish that we

can  see some finality in it. I am as anxious  as,

indeed  more  anxious than,  the  hon.  Member  in

getting  back our ships, our lorries, our  signals

equipment and other things which are due  back  to

us.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): A supplementary

question, Mr Speaker. It seems that I have to cut

down  all the fifteen questions I intended to  ask

originally. However, I would like to ask something

about  Temasek Camp. Who was it who supplied funds

for   the  building  of  this  Camp?  Was  it  the

Malaysian Government which provided funds for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



the expenses of this Camp, or was it the Singapore

Government  which  provided  funds  for   building

Temasek Camp for use by the Malaysian forces?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The money to build this Camp

was voted for by this Assembly out of the funds of

this  Government  and meant for  the  use  of  our

troops.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah):</b> May I question in

Mandarin?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In Mandarin, yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

would like to ask the Minister concerning this. As

Singapore  is a member of the United Nations,  and

if  another member of the United Nations thinks it

has  obligations  in the defence and  security  of

other  member  countries,  this  will  cause   the

impression  that our Defence Council is  one  that

has only a name without substance. I would like to

ask  the Minister concerned whether he could  give

us a clarification as to the Council of Defence to

be set up; or whether he may give some information

on  that; or whether he would request the Security

Council  or  the United Nations to  give  us  some

guidance on this aspect?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Ministerial statement was

on  Camp  Temasek and with regard to the occupancy

of   Camp   Temasek.  That  is   the   Ministerial

statement. Any questions directed to the  Minister

must  relate  themselves  to  that  statement.  No

questions  can  be  asked of the Government  about

foreign  policy, about defence policy,  which  are

matters  at  large. If Members are  interested  in

them,  they are entitled so to be interested.  But

they  have  their  processes  under  the  Standing

Orders  whereby  they can bring up these  matters.

Unless  they choose to do it in that way, I cannot

permit  them to raise these matters under  such  a

Ministerial   statement.  I  cannot   allow   that

question. Any other questions which are relevant?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. A. Gonzales -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. A. Gonzales (Serangoon Gardens):</b> May I ask

the Minister of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



Defence  why  it  is that we are allowing  British

troops  to  remain in Singapore and, on the  other

hand, we are asking Malaysian troops to leave  the

island? I have my own reason for wanting Malaysian

troops  to  go away, but quite a lot of people  in

Singapore  want  to know the reasons  why  we  are

asking Malaysian troops to leave.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The presence of troops from

other  countries  in  Singapore  is  regulated  by

defence  treaty, defence agreement and such  types

of  legal  document.  So far as  British  military

forces  are concerned, their position is  governed

by  Article 13 or clause 13 of the Bill  to  amend

the  Constitution of Malaysia which was passed  in

the  Malaysian Parliament. This provided  for  the

continuation of treaties, agreements,  conventions

entered   into  before  separation   between   the

Government  of  Malaysia and other  countries.  In

other   words,   until  they  are  expressly   re-negotiated, then they continue to remain in force.

Therefore,  the  defence  agreement  between   the

Malayan  Government  and  the  British  Government

governing   British  troops  in  this  area   will

continue in force until it is re-negotiated by us,

presumably some time this year. So the position of

the British Army, Air Force and Navy is sanctioned

under this agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Malaysian troops, although we have

not  entered  into  a treaty on  external  defence

provided   for  in  Article  V, and,   therefore,

strictly speaking, none of them have any right  to

be  here, nevertheless, it was agreed that such  a

treaty  would be entered into to provide  for  the

presence  of some of their troops and the  use  of

some  of the bases. So those units and those bases

which  come within the ambit of Article V (3)  are

here  quite  correctly; that is, it is within  the

constitutional rights of both Governments to allow

the continued presence of such troops. The point I

was  making  is  that  this  particular  Battalion

staying  in  this particular camp  does  not  come

under the provisions of Article V (3) or any other

article of the separation agreement.

<div align="center"><b>IMMIGRATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b>

Mr  Speaker, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Immigration (Amendment) Bill, 1965, seeks to

amend   certain   provisions  of   the   Malaysian

Immigration Ordinance (No. 12 of 1959) to  provide

for  the  control  of immigration  with  power  to

declare  the presence of a person in Singapore  to

be  unlawful  when such a person fails  to  comply

with the conditions stipulated in the entry permit

issued  to  him.  This power is sought  mainly  to

enable  the  Controller of Immigration to  rescind

the  permission to reside permanently in Singapore

granted to persons who have obtained entry permits

on  grounds of economic interest to the country if

they  fail  to  carry out the purposes  for  which

their stay in Singapore has been approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there is no provision for conditions

to   be   imposed  in  entry  permits  under   the

Immigration   Ordinance  nor  do  the  Immigration

Regulations  provide for this. It  is,  therefore,

necessary  to  amend the Immigration Ordinance  to

provide for such powers, as there have been a  few

cases  where persons have taken advantage of  this

omission in the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is also taken to amend the

Ordinance  to enable the Controller of Immigration

to  require  masters of vessels  and  captains  of

aircraft  to  furnish, and not merely to  produce,

particulars of passengers on board all vessels  or

aircraft  arriving in Singapore and  also  to  put

captains  of  aircraft  on  the  same  footing  as

masters  of  vessels with regard to the furnishing

of  particulars  of members of  the  crew  of  the

aircraft.  These  particulars  are  required   for

record and statistical purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move the motion standing in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament in accordance with section 4

of the Foreshores Ordinance (Chapter 246) approves

the  reclamation by Government of that portion  of

the fore-shore and river bed containing an area of

approximately  387  acres  at  Kallang  Basin   as

delineated  on  the  plan,  marked  "LAND   OFFICE

RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 4/65", which is deposited  in

the Land Office, Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, an estimated 25 per cent of the

total  area of our Republic consists of swamps  or

waste   lands   which   can   be   reclaimed   for

development. Some of these swamp lands fall within

the  Kallang  Basin,  and  a  scheme  costing   an

estimated  $24.5  million  has  been  prepared  by

Government for the comprehensive re-development of

the   Basin.   Its  implementation  includes   the

realignment  of Kallang River and the  reclamation

of  tidal  swamps  along the  river  banks.  These

swamps  are  coloured green  in  the  Land  Office

Reclamation  Plan No. 4 of 1965, a copy  of  which

has  been deposited in the Library of this  House.

When   completed,  this  reclamation   will   make

available  an additional 387 acres of land  within

the  Basin  for  more industrial  and  residential

development.  The scheme will enable syphoning  of

some  of  the  families residing  in  urban  areas

affected  by  urban renewal in  this  area.  About

2,518



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



families are affected by the reclamation works, of

whom  about  1,525  have  already  been  resettled

mainly in Housing and Development Board flats. The

resettlement  of  the remaining families  will  be

undertaken as reclamation work progresses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament in accordance with section 4

the construction of an earth dam by Government  at

the  mouth  of  Sungei Poyan and Sungei  Berih  to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this scheme is part of an

overall  plan  to  reclaim as much  coastal  swamp

lands in our Republic as possible for development.

This  proposal  involves the  construction  of  an

earth  dam across the estuary of Sungei Poyan  and

Sungei  Berih with tidal gates to allow  the  free

drainage  of water into the sea during  low  tides

and to prevent the inflow of sea water during high

tides.   The   scheme  will  make   available   an

additional  900  acres,  approximately  1�  square

miles,  of  land  for agricultural development  as

shown coloured blue on the Land Office Reclamation

Plan No. 5/65, a copy of which is displayed in the
