<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>BANISHMENT ORDINANCE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(White Paper on amending legislation)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr D. S. Marshall</b> asked the Chief Secretary

whether  Government  will publish  a  White  Paper

indicating what action has been taken since  April

1955  to prepare a Bill amending or replacing  the

existing Banishment Ordinance (Cap. 127) and  when

it  is  planned to have the first reading  of  the

said Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Stewart:</b> The answer is no, Sir. The

Government does not propose to introduce  at  this

juncture  a Bill to amend or replace the  existing

Banishment Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Will the Chief Secretary please

read  the  question?  I did not  ask  whether  the

Government  was  going to introduce  a  Bill.  The

question is: Is Government going to let us have  a

White  Paper - a  White Paper, Sir - indicating  what

action has been taken in the past, and action  has

been  taken to prepare a Bill of amendment - a White

Paper, Mr Chief Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is

still no.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr David Marshall.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, could I ask

the Chief-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr David Marshall.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,

Sir, question No. 2.

<div align="center"><b>PRESERVATION OF PUBLIC SECURITY ORDINANCE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Outstanding Appeals)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr D. S. Marshall</b> asked the Chief Secretary-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) how many outstanding appeals there are at

present  in respect of Orders made  under  the

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance (No. 25

of 1955) and the date of each appeal;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1570</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) how many appeals are outstanding-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) for more than two months;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) for more than three months;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) for more than four months:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) for more than five months;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) for more than six months; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) what action he is taking to provide

facilities  to enable these appeals  to  be

dealt with speedily.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in regard to (a)

of   the   question,   there   are   106   appeals

outstanding - 73  against Detention  Orders  and  33

against  suspension  of  Detention  Orders.  Three

persons have appeals outstanding against Detention

Orders  as  well  as  Suspension  Orders.  Because

reading  out  the date of each outstanding  appeal

will  take up the Assembly's time unduly,  I  will

supply the hon. Member with a written statement on

the dates as soon as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to part (b) of the question, the

question can more suitably be answered as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Appeals outstanding for up to three months

are  22  appeals against Suspension  Orders  which

have been outstanding for about a month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Appeals outstanding for up to four months

are  one appeal against a Dentention Order and  11

against Suspension Orders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Appeals outstanding for up to five months

are 71 appeals in respect of Detention Orders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) There is one appeal against a Detention

Order outstanding for more than five but less than

six months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) There are no appeals outstanding for more

than six months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to part (c) of the question, Sir, I

am hopeful that all outstanding appeals by persons

who are still detained will have been disposed  of

by the end of May this year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1571</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>PLAYFAIR ROAD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Repair and maintenance)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Lim Koon Teck</b> asked the Minister for

Local   Government,  Lands  and  Housing,  whether

Playfair Road leading to Playfair School  will  be

repaired and maintained either by the City Council

or the Public Works Department.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (for the Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

Playfair  Road is at present a private street  and

the  City Council is now proposing to take  action

under  section 103 of the Municipal  Ordinance  to

make  up  this private road. A survey of the  road

has  already been completed and estimates of costs

are  being  drawn  up for apportionment  of  costs

among the frontagers. Work is expected to commence

during the second half of this year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1571</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>TRAFFIC CONGESTION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Lim Koon Teck</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  and Works what progress  has  been

made towards easing the traffic congestion at  the

junction of Upper Serangoon Road and Yio Chu  Kang

Road.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> As the hon. Member will

probably  recall  from answers I  have  previously

given in the Assembly, plans have been drawn up by

the  Rural Board on its own and the City Council's

behalf to relieve traffic congestion along Yio Chu

Kang  Road by straightening and widening the  road

from its junction with Upper Serangoon Road to its

junction with Serangoon Garden way. Effect  cannot

be  given  to  these plans until  proceedings  are

completed  for  the acquisition of the  additional

land  required for the project. I am informed that

enquiries  under  the  Land Acquisition  Ordinance

have  been  fixed for next month, May. When  these

are  completed, offers of compensation can be made

to  the owners after which possession can be taken

of the land.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems

that  this  question relates to traffic congestion

at the junction of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1572</b></font><br><br>



Upper Serangoon Road and Yio Chu Kang Road. It is

not along Yio Chu Kang Road as the Minister said.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member ask a

supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, it seems the answer is

not for this question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Is that a question, Mr Speaker?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it it is a question, Mr

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I am only indicating to the House,

Mr Speaker, what measures are liable to improve

the flow of traffic in that area. Presumably cars

moving rapidly along Yio Chu Kang Road will

debouch from Yio Chu Kang Road more rapidly also.

If the hon. Member has anything further in mind,

perhaps he will indicate it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the faster

traffic moves along Yio Chu Kang Road towards the

junction, the greater will be the congestion and

we would like to ask the Minister what step he is

going to take to help ease that congestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> This is a matter which can be

referred to the local government authority and not

to the Minister.

<div align="center"><b>LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR BILL</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Introduction and First Reading)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Sir, I beg leave

to move to introduce a Bill to incorporate the

Reverend Mother Superior of the Little Sisters of

the Poor in Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Sir, I second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Who is prepared to introduce the

Bill?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> I, Sir. Sir, I beg to

introduce a Bill intituled "An Ordinance to

incorporate the Reverend Mother Superior of the

Little Sisters of the Poor in Malaya."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill read the First time.

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is not the hon. Member anticipating

that there will be a sitting in June?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> I hope there will be one. Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Shall we say the 22nd of May?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1573</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>PAWNBROKERS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>10.10 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister, Chief Secretary's Ministry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister, Chief Secretary's Ministry (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Sir, I rise to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a good number of years the practice of

issuing  licences to pawnbrokers in  Singapore  has

been  based on a three-year tender system. Normally

the highest bidder is successful and pays a monthly

rental  equal  to his 'bid' which  depends  on  the

locality   of  the  business  and  the  number   of

competitors  for the licence. The fees  range  from

$6,000  to $56,000 a year. In 1955, realising  that

the  system  was out of date and needy  of  change,

Government  appointed  a Committee  to  review  the

system  and to make recommendations for a  new  one

and   to  draft  any  necessary  legislation.   The

Committee's  findings  and the  Government's  White

Paper   on   it   which  has  accepted   the   main

recommendations,  were published and  presented  as

Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 62 of 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the publication of this White Paper,

several  letters have been received in my  Ministry

as   well   as  in  the  Chief  Minister's   Office

indicating    a   general   acceptance    of    the

recommendations of the White Paper. The Bill is the

culmination  of the investigations instituted,  and

it  sets  out  to  amend the Pawnbrokers  Ordinance

(Chapter 195)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1574</b></font><br><br>



so as to incorporate such of the recommendations of

the   Committee   which  have  been   accepted   by

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main object of the Bill, Sir, is to establish

a Pawnbrokers Licensing Board responsible generally

for  the regulation of the pawnbroking business and

particularly  for  the  consideration  annually  of

applications  for licences, for the issue,  refusal

and  cancellation of licences, and for the  receipt

of  fees  and  monthly returns from licensees.  The

constitution  of the Board, the definition  of  the

scope  of  its  duties, the conditions  subject  to

which  licences  may be granted,  recourse  to  the

Minister  for  persons  aggrieved  by  the  Board's

decisions,  and  the duties of the  pawnbrokers  in

respect of pledges remaining in their custody after

the   determination  of  their  licences,  are  all

matters provided for in clause 3 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proviso to section 9 (1) (c), Sir, proposed

by  clause  3  of the Bill, safeguards the  banking

business which is commonly conducted by pawnbrokers

in Singapore as a sideline.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill provides that pawnbrokers

may  be  required to make monthly  returns  to  the

Board  in accordance with rules made under  section

45 of the Ordinance. Such returns would be of value

in  determining, for instance, the  extent  of  the

community's  dependence  on  the  services  of  the

pawnbrokers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill amends section 24 of the

Ordinance  so as to simplify the calculation  of  a

pawnbroker's  liability  in  respect   of   pledges

destroyed  or  damaged by, or  in  consequence  of,

fire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill amplifies the provisions of

section  45 of the Ordinance, defining the purposes

for which rules may be made under this Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 (e) of the Bill provides for rules for

the  procedure to be followed by applicants and the

procedure and proceedings of the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill introduces an amended

schedule of profits allowed to pawnbrokers. The new

schedule provides for a maximum rate of interest of

two per cent per month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 of the Bill is designed to make

amendments passim to provisions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1575</b></font><br><br>

in the Ordinance which require to be brought up to date

in reference to the amount of loans and to the maximum fines that may

be imposed for offences under the Ordinance, and other amendments resulting

in the constitution of the proposed Pawnbrokers Licensing Board which replaces the existing Licensing

Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While clause 3 of the Bill provides the basis for the procedure and proceedings of the Board and that of

applicants and applications, regulations are being framed to make more specific provisions in these respects,

especially in regard to reference to departments, advertising of applications, notice of objections

from the public and departments, fees for licences, and display of licences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 (1) of the Bill provides for the fee to be prescribed by the Governor in Council and this will be done under

the regulations which are being made. Neither the Committee's Report nor the White Paper has provided for any

basis of classification or the scale of fees. However, it has been the view that the fees collected

should not be looked upon as a revenue measure but as a means of covering the cost of the administrative

system. It is proposed, Sir, to have classifications and fees as shown below.



<pre>

                     Classification                      Fee per annum

                                                              $

             Pawnbrokers "A" Class - pawnbrokers

               with an investment of $50,000

               to $1,000,000                                 250



             Pawnbrokers "B" Class - pawnbrokers

               with an investment of $20,000

               to $50,000                                    150



             Pawnbrokers "C" Class - pawnbrokers

               with an investment of $5,000

               to $20,000                                    100



</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is felt, Sir, that the above will be acceptable both to Government and the pawnbrokers. Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.17 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S. Marshall (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, I am happy to be able to support this measure which is the result

of a thoroughly workmanlike report of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1576</b></font><br><br>



public-spirited gentleman who sat on this commission to enquire into means of changing a colonial

monopolistic system that sought through commercial concerns to tax the poorest people in the country.

This Bill is perhaps a little late, but otherwise I think that every citizen should welcome it, particularly

as now it provides for the lessening of interest rates in view of the fact that the pawnbroker

does not have to pay those exorbitant fees which he was called on to pay in the past.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are happy to support this Bill and we are glad

to know that at last this Ordinance, which has been in operation for many years with many loopholes,

is being amended today, particularly more so when the interest rate charged by the pawnbrokers now is

to be limited to two per cent per month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<br><br><div align="center"><b>Committee</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Committee stage, what day?

<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Now Sir. Sir, I move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly will immediately resolve itself into a Committee on the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Sir, I second it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.



<br><br>10.19 a.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1-

<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I rise to move an amendment to clause 1,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 1, line 7, at the end to add the words",and shall come into force upon such date as the Governor

may, by notification in the Gazatte, appoint".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, in its present form will come into force as an Ordinance on the date that is passed

by the Assembly. When it does so, Sir, sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the present Ordnance will be repealed

and therefore the present licences will become null and void. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1577</b></font><br><br>

will take time for the new system to be bought into being and for the Pawnbrokers Licensing Board to

receive, consider and decide on applications. It is therefore felt that clause 1 of the Bill should

be amended to provide for the date of coming into force of the Ordinance to be appointed by the Governor,

so that there can be a time lag between the date on which the Bill becomes an Ordinance and the date on which

it is brought into force to allow for the preliminary work to be completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3-



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I rise to move an amendment to clause 3,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, lines 5 to 7, to leave out paragraph (c) and insert the following-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(c) three persons to be appointed from their own number by the Justices of the Peace;".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the amendment is self-explanatory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I rise to move another amendment to clause 3,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 11, to leave out the words "by the Minister" and insert "in accordance with the

provisions of subsection (1) of this section".

approved by the Government in its White Paper. This amendment is proposed to make the Bill consistent

with the Government's recommendations.

<div align="center"><b>CLERKS EMPLOYMENT BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Report from Select Committee)</b></div>

<br><br>10.31 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to move the motion

standing in my name, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Report from the Select Committee on the

Clerks Employment Bill, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>



contained  in Sessional Paper L.A. 2  of  1957, be

adopted, subject to the recommittal of the Bill  in

respect  of  clause 27, clause 28,  clause  29  and

clause 46 to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Clerks Employment Bill was committed to

a  Select Committee and from Sessional Paper L.A. 2

of  1957, it will be seen that the Select Committee

held  five meetings. The minutes of the proceedings

of these meetings can be found in Appendix III. The

Bill  reproduced  in Appendix II contains  all  the

amendments  to the Bill recommended by  the  Select

Committee.  Most of the amendments made  are  minor

ones  for the purpose of improving the drafting  of

the  Bill  to clarify still further its provisions.

The  representations made by unions  and  employers

have   been  duly  considered  but  they  are   not

considered  to  be  of such substance  as  to  make

necessary amendments to the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must not be overlooked, Sir, that the Bill is

an  improvement on the previous Bill introduced  by

the  Government  during the last session  and  that

account   has   already   been   taken    of    the

representations then made. Moreover, the  Bill  has

been  considered  by the Labour Advisory  Board  on

which   workers   and  employers   are   adequately

represented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with reference to the telegram from the

Singapore  Business  Houses Employees'  Union,  the

points  raised  therein have  been  given  due  and

careful  consideration and it was felt  that  there

should be a distinction between clerical workers in

offices  and  those  whose  work  bears  a   direct

relation to the workmen in the same employment  who

are  covered  by the Labour Code. There  are  tally

clerks, supervisors, store clerks, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of the Select Committee has been in

the  hands of hon. Members for some time and  I  do

not  therefore  propose to deal with  it  at  great

length.  I  am  confident that this  Assembly  will

support my motion and so ensure that the conditions

of  employment of clerks are set to a  standard  of

which  Singapore can be proud and that our clerical

workers can enjoy this new charter on Labour Day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal, Sir, to recommit the Bill in

respect of the clauses named is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>



merely to tidy up the Bill and improve further  its

drafting. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mak Pak Shee (Assistant Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Mak Pak Shee):</b> I would like to second the

motion  and  reserve my right to speak at  a  later

stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.35 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the clerical

workers  of  Singapore  are  undoubtedly  the  most

docile,  the most humble, the most timid  group  of

people in the island and a group with less money to

spare  than most. This group, the clerical  workers

of  Singapore,  unlike the Singapore Federation  of

Employers,  did not have a lawyer to present  their

views  to the Select Committee at the last time  or

this  time. We have promised them for a  long  time

not a maximum standard of living Bill but a law  to

protect  them against unreasonable exploitation,  a

law  to  give them statutory minimum conditions  of

service.  There is much that is very good  in  this

Bill.  There  are  nevertheless  provisions  of   a

character  which  by  some extraordinary  oversight

have slipped in which make it not a clerks Bill but

an   employers  Bill  and  not  even  an   ordinary

employers Bill, because there are many very  decent

employers,   but   the  Singapore   Federation   of

Employers  Bill, that Federation which through  the

pages  of  these  reports and  last  year's  Select

Committee's  reports comes through as  a  mean  and

crafty scrooge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have had an illuminating talk this morning

with  the  Attorney-General and I am glad  to  note

that  at least in respect of clauses 6 and 7  there

was  never  the intention to have the effect  which

they  do  have but I shall take, clause by  clause,

the  clauses to which I take objection and  then  I

shall  ask this House to give me an opportunity  to

put the arguments before you in Committee. I do not

ask  you  to  accept  at  this  stage  what  I   am

suggesting to be true but I do ask you to permit me

to  amend  this motion before you so  that  we  can

recommit  ten other clauses to a Committee  of  the

whole House to consider them quietly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first clause which I shall ask for

recommittal  is clause 2. Clause 2  creates  three

classes of clerks. God created only two classes of

human  beings,  men and women.  We  are  asked  to

create by law: one, clerks earning more than  $500

a  month  and  clerks earning  less;  two,  clerks

working in offices; three, industrial clerks. They

are all different. Clerks earning more than $500 a

month  have  no protection whatsoever.  Industrial

clerks as compared to clerks have to work 44 hours

instead  of  39 hours a week, get only seven  days

holidays  instead of 14 days for annual leave  and

11  days  instead of 13 days for public  holidays.

The   Minister  for  Labour  and  Welfare   is   a

Socialist,  as  we all are in this House,  barring

Mr  Sutherland - no offence meant, Sir. He  frankly

said,  "I  represent capital, so what!  And  I  am

proud of it." Fair enough! Everybody else in  this

House says that he is a Socialist. Well, Sir,  let

us then look at it as Socialists, as honest people

who   seek   to   assist  these  really   helpless

people - this group known as the clerical workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Clerical and Administrative

Workers'  Union at page 4 of this Report protested

against  limiting  clerks to those  under  $500  a

month. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... that all persons clerically employed should

come  within  the meaning of and  benefit  by  the

Ordinance   otherwise  clerks   drawing   salaries

exceeding  $500  would not be able  to  claim  the

privileges contained in the Ordinance."



<br><br>Now, Sir,  again the Confederation  of  Singapore

Chinese  Engineering Tradesmen Union at column  37

of  Annexe  I protested against this  and  in  its

letter of 12th November, 1956, it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our interpretation of the contents of United

Engineers'  letter  is that  they  will  adhere

strictly   to   the  provisions  of   the   Clerks

Employment  Ordinance, when passed,  and,  in  its

present  form,  apart  from giving  no  protection

whatsoever to clerical workers drawing  more  than

$500 per  month, it provides less benefits  than

currently  enjoyed by U.E. workers  who  would  be

classified  as  "Industrial  Clerks"   under   the

Ordinance, in that they would be allowed one  week

annual  leave  against two weeks  now  enjoyed  by

them, and they would work 44 hours weekly, instead

of 40 hours at present."



<br><br>Sir,  the  Attorney-General  in  Select  Committee

seemed to suggest that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>



$500    limit   was   necessary   for   ease    of

administration and I think you will find  that  at

columns 2, 3 and 4 of the Minutes of Evidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I for myself would like to ask the House to

permit  the recommittal of this clause for  closer

scrutiny.  I  say  that there is really  no  valid

reason whatsoever for putting this arbitrary limit

of   $500  except  that  the  Singapore  Employers

Federation,  seeking the maximum possible  control

in  the minimum possible conditions of service for

these workers, has asked that there be a limit and

it  be  $400. Any decent human being who has  read

the  representations  of the  Singapore  Employers

Federation   should   take   the   attitude   that

everything they say is suspect. It is evil:  those

documents  that they have put in and  the  control

that   they  seek  to  have  over  these  entirely

helpless  human beings whom they employ as  fodder

for their obscene profits.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Come, come!



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Come, come! I have asked

repeatedly in this House, Mr Speaker, Sir, for  a

declaration  as  to the profits  earned  by  these

companies  and  it has never been  available.  The

Financial  Secretary and this House  know  exactly

why  I  am not given those figures because  it  is

feared  that publication of the "obscene  profits"

(I repeat) made by these organisations would shock

the  conscience of this country. But that  is  the

Singapore   Employers  Federation.   Yet   it   is

interesting,   gentlemen,   that   the   Singapore

Employers Federation does not want the distinction

between  "clerk" and "industrial clerk".  So  here

you have got the poor trade union saying, "Please,

why  a  clerk who gets 14 days leave and doing  39

hours a week and then why an industrial clerk  who

is also a human being doing the same work doing 44

hours  a  week  with only seven  days  for  annual

leave?"   And  the  Federation  agrees   but   for

different reasons. You will see them in a  minute.

Sir, may I refer you to pages 6, 10, 11 and 12  of

the  memorandum  of the gentlemen  I  have  called

Scrooges:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1585</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Federation appreciates that this feature of

the  Bill  has  probably been introduced  to  meet

objections   put   forward  when  previous   draft

legislation of this nature was under consideration

that to impose a standard working week of 39 hours

for  all  categories  of clerks,  irrespective  of

whether  or  not they were employed  in  industry,

would  make  the effective working  of  industrial

concerns   virtually  impossible.   Unfortunately,

however   such  a  distinction  between  the   two

categories  of  clerks will also be impossible  to

operate  in  practice... (this  distinction

between clerks and industrial clerks)".



<br><br>And they go on to say that the Federation suggests

that  the  clerks  should all be  reduced  to  the

status  of  industrial clerks and that they  would

all be very happy. Now, Sir, I would like to go in

detail through the arguments used for the division

of  these clerks and industrial clerks. I say that

the  Minister for Labour and Welfare errs and errs

gravely when he suggests that it is necessary that

there  be this distinction of two different  types

of  clerks: one a superior human being and another

an  inferior human being. I say that  if  in  some

concerns it is necessary to have different working

hours  then there can be overtime pay and  in  the

last resort he can always accept that organisation

in  accordance with the terms of clause 2 from the

provisions of this Code.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, clause 6 perpetuates exploitatory

contracts.  If  there is a contract  in  existence

which  gives the clerk much less favourable  terms

than   the   present  Bill,  then  that  agreement

continues  in  force. Why should  we  condone  and

endorse   contracts  which  fall  below  what   we

consider a minimum standard of conditions? I would

be ashamed, gentlemen, to be in any way associated

with  a clause of that nature. I say that no  true

Socialist would seek to perpetuate and to give the

authority   of   statutory  law  in   support   of

provisions which are contrary to what he considers

to  be  minimum human needs. Why should we endorse

these contracts?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... any term of a contract of service which is

contrary to the provisions of this Ordinance shall

be illegal, null and void."



<br><br>Now, in fairness to the Government, let us get it straight. They did not mean

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1586</b></font><br><br>



it.  The Minister for Labour and Welfare has  been

engaged  and busy elsewhere. Fair enough!  He  did

not  mean it and now that it has been drawn to his

attention,  I  have reason to hope  that  he  will

correct  it  but  that clause  7  if  you  do  not

recommit it to this Assembly means that these  are

not   minimum  conditions  of  work  but   maximum

conditions  of  work;  because  let  us  take  the

instance  of clause 36. Clause 36 gives to  clerks

13  days public holidays a year but, gentlemen,  I

had   the   privilege  of  being   associated   in

negotiations  with  Boustead  and  Co.  Ltd, who,

though  a  member of the Singapore  Federation  of

Employers,  is of a totally different  type.  They

showed a sympathy, an understanding and a goodwill

that was very heartening and we obtained from them

16  days in respect of this particular aspect - 16

days public holidays a year. Now, according to the

terms of clause 7, that agreement with Boustead is

illegal.  Sir, I do ask that you permit that  that

should  go  back for reconsideration  despite  the

fact  that two Select Committees have sat and  the

satisfaction  of  the Minister in  charge  of  the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, look at clause 14, gentlemen:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An employer may without notice dismiss an

employee on the grounds of misconduct."



<br><br>The  clerks went before the Select Committee  last

year  and  said, "Look, is this not a  bit  harsh?

Supposing I speak to my employer in a loud  voice.

That  is misconduct, is it not?" And the Attorney-General  said, "Gentlemen, do you not  agree  that

for  misconduct, an employee shall be  dismissed?"

So they just withered and made their protest. Then

let me show you something, gentlemen, of which the

Attorney-General should have been  aware.  Sir,  I

quote  the  case  of Clouston and  Company  versus

Corry,  1906 Law Journal Reports, 75 Privy Council

at  page  20;  also, Sir, reported in 1906  appeal

cases  -a  Privy Council case, an appeal from  New

Zealand, Sir. Why I emphasize the Privy Council is

because what is decided here, as you are aware, is

applicable to Singapore. The decisions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Privy Council are law in Singapore.  What

does  Lord  James of Hereford, Sir, who  delivered

the judgment say about misconduct:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no fixed rule of law defining the

degree of misconduct which will justify dismissal.

Of  course,  (please  notice this)  there  may  be

misconduct in a servant which will not justify the

determination of the contract of service by one of

the parties against the will of the other."



<br><br>Now, may I repeat it, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...there may be misconduct in a servant which

will not justify the determination of the contract

of service...".



<br><br>But what does this clause say? All misconduct. You

can  dismiss your clerks. Why? May I read on, Sir,

so  that you may fully understand what is intended

here,   Sir?  The  common  law  says   that   only

misconduct which goes to the root of the  contract

of   service,  which  nullifies  the   terms   and

conditions  of  your service, only  that  kind  of

gross  and  grave  misconduct  is  a  ground   for

immediate dismissal. But this clause is seeking to

protect  whom? The Singapore Employers  Federation

says  all  misconduct  is a ground  for  immediate

dismissal  without notice. Let me  read  on,  Sir,

from this judgment of Lord James of Hereford:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the other hand, misconduct inconsistent with

the   fulfilment   of  the  express   or   implied

conditions  of  service  will  justify  dismissal.

Certainly when the alleged misconduct consists  of

drunkenness, there must be considerable difficulty

in   determining  the  extent  of  conditions   of

intoxication    which    would    establish    the

justification for dismissal. The intoxication  may

be habitual and gross and directly interferes with

the  business of the employer or with the  ability

of the servant to render due service but it may be

an  isolated act committed under circumstances  of

festivity  and  in  no  way  connected   with   or

affecting the employer's business. In such a case,

the question of whether the misconduct establishes

the  right to dismiss the servant must depend upon

facts."



<br><br>So, gentlemen, all I ask is that we do not put the

shackles even more firmly on the employee and that

we  recommit  clause 14 in order  to  add  such  a

phrase   as  "misconduct  inconsistent  with   the

implied  and express terms of service".  Sir,  the

present  law  applies if the  employers  think  it

necessary to have it but do not let us make things

worse for the clerks than they are today.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Sir, clause 15. There is nothing wrong with

clause 15 except its silence. Sir, for many  years

now, workers have been bedevilled in their efforts

to obtain honest conditions of service by the fear

that  if  they go on strike, they may  be  legally

committing  a  breach of contract which  justifies

their immediate dismissal and you know, Sir,  that

in  this  colony  even recently  there  have  been

successful efforts to dismiss employees  who  went

on  strike on the ground that this is a breach  of

contract. Now, do we as Socialists all believe  in

the  ultimate right to strike? If we do, Sir, then

we should make it lawful and if it is lawful, then

it  should not be a breach of contract and  I  ask

that  clause  15 be recommitted to this  House  so

that this should be made clear by the insertion of

subclause (2) reading:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strike action by an employee in pursuance of the

lawful request of his registered trade union shall

not be deemed to be a breach of contract."



<br><br>Let them be at peace, these workers. We are saying

that  this  is a clerks charter, a lighthouse  for

the  future  for  the protection of  these  humble

people.  Let them be at peace and know where  they

stand. If they take strike action in pursuance not

of  the request but of the lawful request of their

registered  trade union, then they  shall  not  be

deemed to have committed a breach of contract.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, in respect of clauses 34, 35, 36 and

37, they  are  consequential to  my  request  for

amendment  of clause 2 and I say, "Please  let  us

consider them in Committee."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, clause 38 is an absolute beauty, it

says  that you are entitled to a maximum aggregate

of   twenty-eight  days  of  sick  leave  if  your

employer's   doctor  has  examined  you   and   so

certifies but I ask the Minister: what happens  if

the  employer's  doctor refuses  to  examine  him?

[Interruption]  Are  you  suggesting  that  it  is

impossible?  What  happens  then?  Supposing   the

employer  says,  "I will have no doctor.  You  are

sick,  well,  psk!."  If you  read  the  Singapore

Employers Federation memorandum, you will not have

much  respect for employers. What happens? Are  we

to give no protection to the clerk if the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>



employer  is obstructive? So I say that we  should

add a further clause:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"or if the employer's medical practitioner does

not  examine the employee within twelve  hours  of

the   employee's  request  reaching  him  on   the

certificate    from    any   registered    medical

practitioner whose charges shall be  paid  by  the

employer."



<br><br>Is that unreasonable? I wait twelve hours and I am

sick. I wait twelve hours for my employer to  send

a doctor or to tell me what doctor to go to and he

tells  me,  "Take  a running jump."  After  twelve

hours, I can consult any medical practitioner  and

that  certificate protects me for the twenty-eight

days. Is that unreasonable?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, the Minister for Labour and Welfare

spoke with considerable weight when it came to the

question  of  how  they labour  in  his  Ministry,

particularly  on  the Labour Code  in  respect  of

maternity  leave. But under this  Bill  he  forgot

about  that  aspect  of  his  labour - there  is  no

maternity leave. Under the Labour Code, a woman is

entitled to four weeks; under this clause she  has

none. I do not know whether it is suggested,  Sir,

that  there  are no women clerks,  or  that  women

clerks  do  not have babies, or that women  clerks

are  of  such sturdy character that they can  drop

their babies into the waste-paper baskets? Why  do

not clerks have maternity leave? I have not got  a

right to it as a clerk; it does not matter to  me.

We   are   seeking  to  make  provision  for   the

protection of timid human beings who cannot  speak

for  themselves.  Why is there  no  provision  for

maternity leave? There are 28 days sick leave  for

everybody.  Is  a woman not entitled  to  be  sick

whilst  a  man  is  entitled to  be?  Is  she  not

entitled to some rest if she has a baby?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am going to move, if the House will permit

me,  the recommittal of this clause 38, that every

employee shall be entitled to additional paid sick

leave  during terms of four weeks each before  and

after  her maternity confinement, and I  hope  the

Hon. the Minister for Labour and Welfare, who  has

the  privilege of being a married man with  lovely

children,  will  remember  that  his  wife  needed

maternity leave and so do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1590</b></font><br><br>



those  who are less fortunate and have to work  in

offices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, I move that these clauses be recommited

to  the  House.  I  say to you,  let  us  have  an

opportunity  to examine them in Committee - that  is

all  I ask at present - and I move to delete all the

words  after the words "in respect of" and  insert

in  place  thereof the following words "clause  2,

clause  6, clause 7, clause 14, clause 15,"  (then

the  Government  clauses) "clause 27,  clause  28,

clause  29," (my clauses) "clause 35,  clause  36,

clause  37,  clause 38," (Government clause)  "and

clause 46 to a Committee of the whole House".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I sit down, I would state that I do

not  quite know what the procedure is, but I think

that  I ought to disclose to this House that I  am

the legal adviser to the Singapore Business Houses

Employees Union which has 4,000 clerical  members,

that my remuneration is an annual retainer of $1 a

year,  and that I am not here before this Assembly

either as counsel or as solicitor; let me add,  $1

a year not per member but for the whole Union.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Does the Member for Cairnhill not

consider  that  a clause providing  for  maternity

leave should be a separate clause?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Sir, I am grateful to you for

drawing  my  attention to that.  In  fact,  I  had

thought of consulting you but it seems to me, Sir,

with  respect, that it does come under clause  38.

"Sick  Leave", and I would ask, Sir,  that  it  be

included.



<br><br>11.03 a.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in  Singapore we have so many labour  unions

which  arc  so  strong that we  see  a  number  of

strikes  by  labourers  but,  unfortunately,   the

clerks in Singapore are not bound together as  one

single  body.  As you can see from their  numerous

unions,  they are separated, one section from  the

other,  and as such they do not represent  such  a

strong  force.  I believe that this  Bill  is  now

introduced to exploit the clerks because they  are

not united and have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1591</b></font><br><br>



not got a strong union to protect them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Shame! Real shame! Why then,

should  we exploit the clerks because of the  fact

that  they do not have a strong union? A clerk  is

always  a clerk. Why should we classify them  into

three categories - those earning $500 a month, those

below $500, and industrial workers? Does this mean

that  a clerk whose income is above $500 is not  a

clerk? There are many firms and many organisations

which do have clerks whose incomes are above $500.

Why  do  they not come under this Bill and so  get

protection? Why should we bar clerks drawing above

$500?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to industrial workers, Sir, if a clerk is

a  clerk,  why  should we call him  an  industrial

worker? A labourer, a foreman and a technician are

industrial  workers, but not a store  clerk  or  a

tally  clerk.  If he is a clerk, he  should  be  a

clerk.  What is the difference between an ordinary

clerk  and  a  store  clerk? I  do  not  see  much

difference between them. A clerk sits at a  table;

he  performs clerical duties. A store  clerk  also

works  at  a  table  and  also  performs  clerical

duties.  The only little difference I may  see  is

this,  Sir, that a store clerk is responsible  for

the  goods within his store: and that should  give

him  more  responsibility in his employment,  and,

with  more  responsibility, he should have  better

conditions of service rather than that his  status

should  be  lowered.  By  classifying  him  as  an

industrial clerk, we are trying to create  a  sort

of  inferiority complex in him, and that will just

kill  his initiative. Is that fair, Sir? We should

not classify clerks into so many categories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to clause 14, Sir, on "misconduct" I am

not  a  lawyer, so I do not know how to  interpret

the  word. I was working in the Army as  a  senior

clerk. My status at that time was equivalent to  a

warrant  officer,  class  one.  At  that  time,  a

sergeant came up to me and said. "Mr Lee, I  want

you  to  address me as 'Sir'." I told him that  my

status  was  far  above his and asked  him  why  I

should  address him so. I firmly refused  to  call

him "Sir". Was that misconduct?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1592</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> If you say that it was not

misconduct     then    I     would     call     it

insubordination - and  that is  a  worse  term  than

misconduct. Would that refusal to call  him  "Sir"

mean  that I would have to lose my job? No, I hope

it  does  not;  but the word "misconduct"  is  not

clear  to me. If a clerk can be dismissed  without

notice on this account, is that not exploitation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clauses 35, 36 and 37, the Member for

Cairnhill has said that we will elaborate on  them

when we go into Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to clause 38, on the question of 28 days

sick leave in a year - is the period sufficient?  As

the  Member  for Cairnhill has said, if  a  firm's

doctor  refuses to examine its clerk,  where  else

can the clerk go? He will not be entitled then  to

any  sick  leave at all. Apart from  this,  is  it

sufficient that a human being should have only  28

days sick leave, that he will only be sick for  28

days  and no more? Is that fair? He may have  put

in 15 years of efficient service with the firm and

within  that time he has not taken any sick  leave

but,  unfortunately, on the sixteenth year or  so,

he  falls  sick,  and it may  be  a  very  serious

illness.  According  to  this  Bill,  he  is  only

allowed 28 days; he must be sick for only 28  days

and no more, or else he gets no pay. Is that fair?

I  think  this  clause should be amended  so  that

there  should  he at least 52 days full-pay  leave

plus another 26 days half-pay leave. Why should we

limit a man to being sick for only 28 days? Let us

extend  the limit and, if he falls sick,  let  him

enjoy  that  privilege; and  if  he  exceeds  that

period,  at least give him half pay. If  he  falls

sick, he has to incur medical expenses; yet,  with

all the cost of medical attention, he will get  no

pay  after 28 days! Is that fair? Clerks, as  the

Member  for Cairnhill said, are among the  lowest

paid workers: clerks are the most modest people in

Singapore.  Then where can they get the  money  to

pay  for medical attention? Cannot we grant  them

half-pay leave or so, so that they can continue to

get   some  income  not  only  to  maintain  their

families, but also to pay for medical expenses?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1593</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of maternity leave, I fully

support the Member for Cairnhill. Women give birth

and  it  takes  at least 30 days for  a  woman  to

recover from it. According to Chinese custom,  the

period for recovery is set at 100 days before they

come out into the open; they are confined to their

rooms for 100 days.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Red Indians say one year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> What, a hundred days per

year?  That is new mathematics to me! Are we going

to  say  to  a  woman  that  we  cannot  give  her

maternity leave? She has to regain her health,  to

look after the child, to give the child food; and,

again,  she  has to pay for medical  expenses.  We

have to grant maternity leave! This issue has been

fought  in  many organisations for  a  long,  long

time,  and  I hope that, with the introduction  of

this  Bill,  women will no longer be exploited.  I

support the Member for Cairnhill on committing the

Bill to a Select Committee.



<br><br>11.10 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Report from the Select Committee on the

Clerks  Employment Bill, as contained in Sessional

Paper  L.A. 2 of 1957, be adopted, subject to  the

recommittal of the Bill in respect of  clause  27,

clause  28, clause 29 and clause 46 to a Committee

of the whole Assembly."



<br><br>Since  when,  an amendment has been  proposed,  to

leave  out  "clause 27, clause 28, clause  29  and

clause 46", and there to insert "clauses 2, 6,  7,

14, 15, 27, 28, 29, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 46".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that the Member for Cairnhill has repeated

the Government clauses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I have indeed repeated the

Government clauses, Sir. They are clauses 27,  28,

29  and 46; I have not deleted a single one. I  do

not want to be obstructive, Sir; I am a Socialist.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will propose the Question in a

different way, then. The Original Question was  as

I have read out. Since when, an amendment has been

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the words "clause 46", to insert the words

"and clauses 2, 6, 7, 14, 15, 35, 36, 37 and 38"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1594</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the clauses proposed to be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of information?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Yes, Sir. Is the Government

going  to let the House have the advantage of  the

expert advice of the Hon. the Attorney-General  on

the criticisms made against the technical accuracy

of  the Bill - on construction and interpretation - as

distinct  from  the  question  of  principle   and

policy?  Certain  criticisms have  been  levelled,

particularly against clauses 6 and 7,  on  certain

provisos in clause 14, and on the clause  on  sick

leave,  that  is on the question of the  lapse  or

alleged lapse in the Bill in not providing for the

contingency   where   an   employer   deliberately

obstructs. In drafting this Bill has consideration

been taken of the same difficulties which arose in

the  Labour Ordinance during the Select  Committee

stage?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think those points could probably

best  be  raised  if and when this House  resolves

itself  into Committee. They are matters of detail

affecting  clauses  which  might  be  recommitted,

matters  which  perhaps would lend  themselves  to

debate, and I suggest that they could be raised in

Committee,  in passing, I might mention  that  the

practice  is that, if an hon. Member  asks  for  a

clause to be recommitted, it is almost a matter of

form  that that clause is recommitted, so  that  a

detailed debate on that particular clause can take

place in Committee rather than in open Assembly.



<br><br>11.15 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all my life

I have been a clerk, and when I am no longer Chief

Minister, I will still be a clerk and I will die a

clerk. I am therefore deeply touched by the  great

concern  which  the  Member for  Tanglin  has  for

clerks - I   am  sorry,  I  mean  the   Member   for

Cairnhill. Being a clerk, and having been  in  the

trade union movement ever since there was one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1595</b></font><br><br>



after  the  war, may I respectfully  submit  that,

since   1946,  I  have  been  looking  after   the

interests  of  clerical  workers  and   of   other

workers? Yet I am told now that what I hope to  do

for the clerks is to tie a knot around their necks

for  the benefit of employers! Sir, this Bill lays

down  the bare minimum. If we are to lay down  the

maximum,  there  will  be no necessity  for  trade

union organisations, or for such organisations  to

have  legal advisers at a nominal fee of $1; there

will  not have been the chance or opportunity  for

trade union organisations to grow, or for advisers

coming on - and coming off - the scene.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to clause 2, Sir, the Member for

Cairnhill asked why we limited the salary to  $500

per  month. Sir, may I respectfully point  out  to

this House that when the Member was Chief Minister

in   the   last   Government,  he   approved   the

presentation of a Bill to this Assembly fixing the

salary limit at $400?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> He was depending on his Minister

for Labour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> It is the same thing. Now,

when we fix the salary at $500, we are told that

we are -



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> On a point of information, if I

may, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, if the Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> It has been indicated to the

Minister  that  it  is a convention  that  when  a

Member  of  the House asks for the recommittal  of

certain  clauses,  the request is  conceded.  This

would  imply  that the Minister has conceded  that

these clauses be recommitted so that we can debate

them in Committee?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I am always pleased to

concede  anything  which can  help  to  point  out

either  to me or to other Members of the  Assembly

the error of my ways or the error of their ways - it

is always a pleasure to concede.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the other clauses on which the Member

for  Cairnhill has spoken with such vehemence,  he

has made me



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1596</b></font><br><br>



feel  that something must have been wrong with  me

or  something  must  have  been  wrong  elsewhere,

because  all  the  clauses which he  attacked  are

clauses taken from the Labour Code, which Code was

approved  during  the  time  when  he  was   Chief

Minister  and when he was proud to say,  "This  is

the  Labour  Code for the workers  of  Singapore!"

Today,  however, we are told that  that  Code,  of

which he was then proud, is a set of shameful laws

imposed on the workers of Singapore!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does happen, Sir, that when one has

responsibility one speaks one way, and  that  when

one  has  less responsibility, one speaks  another

way. But at least I have been consistent, Sir,  by

introducing  the same sections in the Labour  Code

into  the  Clerks  Employment Bill  and  the  Shop

Assistants Employment Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 2, we are asked why there should be

three  classes of clerks. The reason is  this:  We

lay  down  minimum  conditions of  employment  for

clerks and workers who are unable to look, or  who

have  difficulty in looking, after themselves.  We

lay  down a maximum salary of $500 because we feel

that  those  drawing above that figure  are  in  a

better  position to fend for themselves in  court,

and to have the advantage of legal advice in court

as  to the interpretation of "misconduct" or  some

other term of law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have defined clerical workers into

office   clerks   and   industrial   clerks-   the

industrial  clerks  are  already  there.  What  we

propose  to give them is the minimum, and in  fact

the  Bill  is  going  to help  a  good  number  of

industrial clerks who do not have the advantage of

trade union organisations or the benefit of a good

employer.  It  does not detract from those  clerks

who  are industrial clerks because of their  close

relationship with the labourers - or workmen, as  we

now call them under the Labour Code - who work under

them.  A store clerk has to be in a store to  keep

it  open  so that workmen can bring goods  in  and

out - there  is  that relationship; or a  supervisor

has  to keep on working when there are workmen for

him to supervise. It is felt



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>



that   there  should  be  a  direct  relationship

between the two classes of workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in regard to this limitation of $500, Sir,

it  will  be  seen  that,  under  clause  2,  the

Minister  can at any time, or from time to  time,

raise  the  figure. If the Minister is  satisfied

that,  as a result of this limitation of $500,  a

large number of clerical workers drawing say from

$600 to $700 are, shall we say, being ill-treated

by  their  employers and are unable to  fend  for

themselves,  I  am  sure that  the  Minister  for

Labour  and  Welfare, whoever he may be  at  that

time,  will  alter the limitation to  cover  this

unfortunate class of workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to all the other points brought up, I

would  say  that the relevant clauses  have  been

taken  from the Labour Code, and I do  not  think

any  useful purpose will be served if I  were  to

speak  on  them and so lengthen this debate.  The

points  brought up will, of course, be  mentioned

again at the Committee stage, when I will explain

the  policy  of the Government on the  points  as

they arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of maternity benefits is one which

requires a reply now. We did not insert a  clause

in  the Bill on maternity benefits but this  does

not  mean  that  there  should  be  no  maternity

benefit  for women clerks. However, as  a  worker

myself,  I  can  say this: If you want  to  drive

women  out  of  work and see that men  remain  in

work,  demand  as  much as  you  can  for  female

workers,   for   they  will  no  longer   be   in

employment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are all

glad  soon to have the opportunity to discuss  in

Committee the various criticisms which the Member

for  Cairnhill  has levelled against  this  Bill.

There  are two distinct types of charges  he  has

made. One is purely on the technical soundness of

the  draftmanship of the Bill, the way  in  which

the  intentions of the Government (which  are,  I

think,  fairly certain) have been expressed,  and

what they will in fact presume to have expressed.

The other is on questions of principle - whether or

not  there  should  be  this distinction  between

industrial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>



and non-industrial clerks, and whether sick

leave should include maternity leave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the technical point, I hope that it will be

sufficient to clarify the position, because  some

of  the  points  which the Member  for  Cairnhill

raised  were raised by me in the Select Committee

on  the  Labour Bill - as to the interpretation  of

"misconduct" and on clauses 6 and 7. I would like

to  point out that clauses 6 and 7 of the  Clerks

Employment  Bill  are  in  identical  terms  with

sections 6 and 7 of the Labour Ordinance  No.  40

of  1955.  The  word "misconduct"  in  clause  14

appears  in  section 17 of that Labour Ordinance.

The  Hon. the Attorney-General will remember that

when I raised the point whether "misconduct"  was

not  too  broad a term and the whole  matter  was

thoroughly  debated. Again, as to  the  lapse - the

alleged  lacuna - in clause 38, as  to  what  would

happen  if  an employer deliberately  refuses  to

appoint  a  medical practitioner to  examine  his

workmen,  the clause is in identical  terms  with

section 48 of the Labour Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill is at a disadvantage,

for  he  must  be  responsible  for  this  Labour

Ordinance, he was then the principal advocate  of

it.  He  and his Government assured me then  that

there  were no such doubts in existence, that  in

fact-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it on a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the hon. Member will give way?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am sure there will be ample

opportunities for explanation, but if the  Member

for  Cairnhill  wishes to explain now  before  he

forgets it by all means let him do so!



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I would like to correct the

inaccurate  memory  of  the  Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar - I  never  gave him such an  assurance.  The

whole  matter  was  handled by the  Minister  for

Labour.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1599</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I thought, Sir, that there

was  such a thing as cabinet responsibility,  and

that  the  leader of a cabinet, like Sir  Anthony

Eden,  accepts full responsibility  for  whatever

goes  wrong.  I am sure the Member for  Cairnhill

would  not like to be in undistinguished  company

in  this  matter,  and that he will  accept  full

responsibility for all the errors  and  omissions

in  the  Labour Ordinance. I am in the  fortunate

position  of  never having been a chief  minister

but  I  hope  I  shall never, if placed  in  that

position,  allow myself to be led up  the  garden

path by a subordinate Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on these questions of construction and

interpretation,  let us by  all  means  have  the

whole  matter reopened. If it is finally conceded

by  the  chief  legal draftman to the  Government

that   in  fact  there  may  be  ambiguity,  then

amendment must not only be made to these clauses,

but  also to the Labour Ordinance. Let us  always

put  right  what has gone wrong, even though  the

wrong was done by someone else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of principle, I support the

Member  for Cairnhill - that there should not  have

been this distinction between industrial and non-industrial clerks - and I am not satisfied with the

explanation  given  by the  Minister  for  Labour

that,   because  industrial  clerks   work   with

workmen,  therefore  they  must  have  the   same

reduced  number  of holidays and  longer  working

hours  per week as workmen. I think it is  a  non

sequitur  to  say  that because workmen  work  44

hours a week, if a tally clerk who works with the

workmen  does  39 hours per week, there  will  be

five  hours in which there will be no tally clerk

working  with  the workmen. It  does  not  follow

because  you  can  always make the  employer  pay

overtime  for the five hours. I know the  counter

which  the Minister for Labour has put in  Select

Committee,  namely, that that would be compelling

industrial  clerks  to work  overtime,  which  is

contrary  to  one of his major tenets  on  Labour

relations.  Before the Bill was  sent  to  Select

Committee,  I drew the attention of the  Assembly

to:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1600</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The ceiling of $500 and how that arbitrary

figure was reached;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) This distinction between industrial and non-industrial clerks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we would all be grateful to know in

Committee  once again whether, first, the  figure

of   $500   represented  in   actual   fact   the

distinction   between  supervisory   clerks   and

ordinary clerks, whether that can be supported by

evidence on the current rates paid to supervisory

clerks and ordinary clerks. Second, let us  again

debate  this  question  of  industrial  and  non-industrial   clerks  and  all  the  consequential

disadvantages of the industrial clerk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, "That the clauses proposed to be

inserted, be there inserted," put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Report from the Select Committee on

the  Clerks  Employment  Bill,  as  contained  in

of  clause 27, clause 28, clause 29 and clause 46

<div align="center"><b>(Loan)</b></div>



<br><br>11.38 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acting Financial Secretary (Mr Oon Khye Kiang): Mr Speaker, Sir, beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with section

343  of  the Municipal Ordinance (Chapter 133  of

the  1936  Edition), sanctions the raising  of  a

loan  to  be effected by increasing the issue  of

Singapore City Council 5 per cent Debenture Stock

1956 from an amount not exceeding $30,000,000  as

sanctioned  by  a  resolution of the  legislative

Assembly on the 7th March, 1956, to an amount not

exceeding $50,000,000 for the purposes stated and

under the conditions specified in Sessional Paper

No. Cmd. 12 of 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members will recollect that at a

previous  sitting  of  the Assembly  on  the  7th

March,  1956, the City Council was authorised  to

raise  a  loan not exceeding $30,000,000 for  the

purpose  of  continuing  the  extension  of   its

Electricity,  Gas  and Water  Undertakings.  This

amount of $30,000,000 has now been fully taken up

and  the Council requires further money to  carry

on  with these extension works in accordance with

the  proposals  which have been approved  in  its

Budget   for   this  year.  The  extensions   are

essential  to  the  further  development  of  the

Island,   the   expansion   of   industry,    the

improvement   of  living  conditions,   and   the

erection of more housing accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is considered that the money required by the

City  Council for the current year  may  best  be

raised  by an extension of the authorised  amount

of  the 1956 Loan from $30,000,000 to $50,000,000

rather than by the floatation of an entirely  new

loan.  This  method  will  lead  to  considerable

savings  in  floatation costs  and  also  obviate

other  difficulties which would have to be  faced

in the floating of a new loan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from getting the loan money, the Council

will  be enabled to accept any money which  might

be  offered for investment, especially  from  the

Central  Provident  Fund, which  might  otherwise

have  to  invest overseas. The Council  therefore

now  applies  for the sanction of the Legislative

Assembly to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1603</b></font><br><br>



further borrowing up to a limit of $50,000,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated in the Sessional Paper, the City

Council is empowered under the Municipal Ordinance

to  borrow a further sum of $151,000,000.  Sir, I

beg to move.

principle  to  the reorganisation of the  clerical

services.   We  therefore  support  the  financial

arrangements which have to be made as a result  of

this  reorganisation. But the Financial  Secretary

must  be  aware  that there is  a  great  deal  of

concern  amongst the temporary clerks for quite  a

number  of their colleagues who will be discharged

as  a  result  of this reorganisation.  The  House

would  be less anxious over their fate if we could

be  informed as to what the Government proposes to

do  to reabsorb as many of these temporaries as is

possible.



<br><br>11.50 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart (Acting Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Chief Secretary (Mr S. T. Stewart):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, there have been two absorption

schemes - one  in  1955 and the other  in  1956 - both

negotiated  and agreed with the unions  concerned,

and  they  have led to the absorption of some  850

temporary  clerks out of a total of  approximately

1,000.  Some  120  clerks  have  not  been   found

suitable for absorption, and for this reason  were

under notice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say, Sir, that out of the 120

clerks who have not been absorbed, we have managed

to  offer employment to 25 of them as typists.  We

assume a number of other junior appointments which

will  shortly be available to be 15 and this  will

go  towards helping to find employment  for  these

unabsorbed  clerks.  We have  transferred  to  the

Census  Department 20 and there remain  unabsorbed

59 out of the 120,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>



ten  of  whom are being retained until they  reach

the age of 55. In addition, 26 of them are married

women.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision not to appoint these temporary

clerks,  Sir,  was  taken by  the  Public  Service

Commission   in  its  executive   role,   and   in

terminating  their services - that  is,  giving  two

months' notice to those with less than five years'

service and four months' notice to those with more

than   five   years'  service - the  Government   is

constitutionally carrying out the  Public  Service

Commission's  directions. The union  has  in  fact

appealed  to  the  Government to  ask  the  Public

Service Commission to reconsider the cases of  the

unabsorbed  clerks. That appeal has  gone  to  the

P.S.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also told that a firm of lawyers are acting

on   behalf   of  these  clerks  and   have   made

representations to the P.S.C. As the matter is sub

judice  in the Public Service Commission, I  hope

the  House  will appreciate it if  I  do  not  say

anything on the question of their absorption;  but

I  can  say this - that the Government, outside  the

absorption scheme, is trying its best to help find

employment  for  the balance of  these  unabsorbed

clerks. There are not 120 clerks, but 59, less 10.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

rightly  when we voted this sum in 1956 of $40,000

Government  to  produce  a  film  in   colour   of

Singapore    for   distribution    overseas    for

advertising  purposes  to  encourage  the  tourist

trade. I notice however that the amount spent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1610</b></font><br><br>



in  1956  was only $14,700 odd. I therefore  would

like to know what has happened to that project?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $1,200,000 for Head 20 stand

part of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, a sum of

$1,700,000  is  estimated to be the  cost  of  the

census  that is intended for this year.  Could  we

know   before  we  level  any  criticism  at   the

Government how much the Federation census  over  a

much  wider  area and over six times  as  large  a

population   as  Singapore  cost  the   Federation

Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am afraid that

I have not got that information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Has there been no consultation

or  exchange of information between the Federation

and the Singapore governments on this question



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1611</b></font><br><br>



of the technique of collecting census in Malaya?



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang (Financial Secretary (Acting)) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> Mr Chairman, in the middle of

last year, it was intended to hold the census on a

Pan-Malayan basis and the Federation's

Superintendent of Census was asked to make an

estimate of the census. Speaking from memory, I

think he estimated that the census in the

Federation would cost $2.8 million and the census

in Singapore about $� million

.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Surely if that answer was

known  to  the Financial Secretary he  should  not

have  allowed the Chief Secretary to say  in  this

House that it is not known to the Government  what

the  estimated  cost  of the census  was,  if  the

Federation's  estimate  for  the  whole   of   the

Federation  consisting of several thousand  square

miles  as  compared  with Singapore's  236  square

miles is only $2.8 million, how do we explain  the

fact that our census over a much smaller area  and

one-sixth  the  population of  the  Federation  is

going to cost about 60 to 70 per cent of the  cost

in the Federation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, when I said that

I   had   not  the  estimate  for  the  Federation

expenditure, I was meaning the present estimate of

the   Federation  census.  The  $500,000  was  the

original expenditure put up some time ago  by  the

Superintendent-designate   for   the   Pan-Malayan

census.  Now that $500,000 has been proved  to  be

grossly  under-estimated.  When  the  estimate  of

$500,000  was  put  in  the  1957  Estimates,  the

Superintendent   of   Census, Singapore,   which

appointment was made in December 1956, pointed out

that  this estimate was an under-estimate and that

when  the  Technical  Census Committee  on  census

matters  had  completed its  task,  it  should  be

possible  to give more accurate figures. Now  that

the  Superintendent of Census, Singapore, has  had

the opportunity with a fair degree of accuracy  to

know  where  and  what staff can be  obtained  for

carrying out the various census operations, it has

become



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1612</b></font><br><br>



clear that the vote is so far from sufficient  for

the  necessary  expenditure that a  supplement  is

required of the order of $1.2 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has set up a very highly

organised  machinery  to carry  out  a  thoroughly

reliable  census. Fully trained,  full  time,  and

adequate  field  staff under  the  supervision  of

trained senior officers of the Government will  be

employed.  The  numbers  of  supervisors,   house-numberers and enumerators have all been based on a

trial  census  held some time last  year  and  the

Superintendent of Census has given much  time  and

thought  to  the  proper  reticulation  of  census

areas.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is no need for me to stress how

vitally  important  this  coming  census   is   to

Singapore with the coming political changes. An up-to-date   and   thoroughly  reliable   census   of

population  is  vital  for  the  determination  of

national  policies  in  the spheres  of  economic,

educational,  social and even political  planning.

Consideration  of questions relating  to  economic

and  social  development,  unemployment,  housing,

public  health  and  welfare  must  be  based   on

accurate facts about the population. Various plans

of  social  assistance  and social  insurance  are

dependent upon reliable census material. Available

population statistics based on the last census  in

1947  have now become obsolete. In fact, Sir,  the

census  in  Singapore  is  I  speak,  subject  to

correction- probably on a more complex scale  than

the  one  in the Federation. Conditions differ  in

Singapore and in the Federation and the conclusion

was arrived at after very careful consideration at

high  official level in both territories  that  as

the   Federation  and  the  Singapore  Governments

desire  the census in both territories  to  follow

somewhat different lines, there should be separate

censuses  for  each territory but to be  conducted

simultaneously  on the same date.  With  the  free

movement of population between Singapore  and  the

Federation,   the   reasons   are   obvious    for

administrative  convenience  for  the   count   of

population to be simultaneous in Malaya. Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1613</b></font><br><br>



census  day  is  fast approaching  and  the  whole

machinery  of the census organisation  is  in  top

gear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we would like to get on with the job and

I  can assure this House that we are going to have

a  thoroughly reliable census. I think it will  be

the biggest census that Singapore has ever had and

this is the first time that Singapore is holding a

census of its own and we would like to see  to  it

that  the census is a very successful one. I would

suggest to this House, Sir, that this increase  of

$1.2  million is well worth the money  if  we  can

achieve  the  aims that we intend to have  in  the

census.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,200,000 for Head 20 ordered to

stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 23-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $12,420 for Head 23 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Could the Government tell us

whether  this particular postmaster who  absconded

with  $12,420  had any saving in the  Government

Thrift and Loan Society and whether any saving was

made  by  the  forfeiture of the pension  that  he

would otherwise have been entitled to?



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang (Financial Secretary (Acting)) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> Mr Chairman, from

enquiries, it was found that he had no savings and

it  was  not then known how much pension he  would

have  been  eligible for. But if the  hon.  Member

would  like  to  know,  I  can  arrange  for   the

information to be passed on to him.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I would just like to know

what  steps  have  been taken to tighten  up  this

system  as  a  result of this misappropriation?  I

think    that   the   House   will   agree    that

misappropriation generally takes place as a result

of  a faulty system or of someone taking advantage

of  a  faulty system. We should like an  assurance

that  losses of public money of this kind will  be

avoided in the future as far as possible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1614</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang (Financial Secretary (Acting)) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> Mr Chairman, this matter was

investigated by the Director of Audit and the

Accountant-General and they reported as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are satisfied that there is no flaw in the

system of account, which is basically the same  as

that   used   in  all  British  Post  Offices.   A

defalcation  of  this  nature  could  not   remain

undetected  for  more than two or three  days.  We

also  consider that surprise surveys  are  carried

out  at  sufficiently frequent  intervals  by  the

Postal  Services and Audit Departments. No  system

of  account  or  check can prevent an  officer  in

charge of cash from stealing it and the fact  that

an  officer  in  a position of trust,  such  as  a

Postmaster, stands to lose so much in the  way  of

retiring benefits by a criminal act is in itself a

powerful deterrent against dishonesty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, therefore, no responsibility for

the  loss  attaches to any officer of  the  Postal

Services   Department  other  than   the   officer

concerned who has been convicted and sentenced."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $12,420 for Head 23 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 26-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $123 for Head 26 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 27-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $19,715 for Head 27 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 28-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $48,458 for Head 28 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Chairman,

supplementary provision of $9,200 is required  for

the  purchase of toddy to allow the contractor  to

increase his price from $1.55 to $1.60 per gallon.

I  wonder  if the Financial Secretary  could  tell

this House whether the contract was given out on a

public tender or was it under negotiations?



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang (Financial Secretary (Acting)) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> It was by public tender.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> If it was given on a public

tender, I wonder how we could allow the contractor

to  increase this price. If the contractor,  after

accepting the tender, could be allowed to increase

the  price,  that serves no purpose  of  a  public

tender because there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1615</b></font><br><br>



may  be  other  tenderers who  may  have  tendered

either  above or below this price. A public tender

is   a  competition  amongst  the  contractors  or

tenderers and once a tender is accepted,  a  price

should be stuck on to that value. According to the

explanation  here, I see that the increase  is  to

allow  the  contractor to rent 450  new  trees  to

replace trees now in tapping which were discovered

recently   to  have  lost  their  toddy   yielding

properties. Now, if that be the case,  why  should

toddy  consumers be made to pay by increasing  the

price of toddy from 25 cents to 30 cents per pint?

The  contractor should bear the loss  rather  than

that the toddy consumers be made to pay to recover

this  money.  I  cannot understand why  we  should

allow  this  unless,  in the tender,  there  is  a

clause  which gives the contractor a variation  in

price  and  even  if it does, the reason  for  the

variation  in price to increase this price  should

be  sufficient enough to warrant this increase.  I

am not happy about this increase, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang (Financial Secretary (Acting)) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> The tender concerned was the

only  tender received. It was in 1955 and  a  two-year   contract   was  entered   into   with   the

contractor. There is a provision for review at the

end  of  the first year. At the beginning of  this

year,  the tenderer made representations regarding

the  cost he would incur in order to keep  up  his

supply  of  toddy for the rest of this year.  They

were carefully examined by the Treasury and it was

agreed to a review.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the other point on the increase

in the price of the sale of toddy from 25 cents to

30 cents per pint, the Government sells the toddy.

It  was calculated that, on the price of $1.60 per

gallon, and if Government sold it at 25 cents  per

pint,  it would be possible that Government  might

suffer  a  loss and this five cents per  pint  was

meant  to  cover  the possibility  of  a  loss  by

Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I am not quite satisfied with

the  explanation given, Sir. As I have  said,  why

should  the  toddy consumers be made to  pay  that

extra  five  cents  per pint  so  as  to  pay  the

contractor who has already tendered his price?  He

should  bear  the cost of whatever losses  he  may

have to incur.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1616</b></font><br><br>



May  I  then move, Sir, if I am allowed, to delete

the sum of $9,200 under this item?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Standing Orders require two

days' notice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the hon. Member

raises an important and interesting principle  and

one  which  perhaps  needs some  clarification.  I

myself am in complete sympathy with any efforts to

economise in public service but, at the same time,

I  may  be  wrong  here, I am  of  the  view  that

Government should not act merely with legality and

insist  on  the letter of the law but should  also

act  with  equity and that if there are  contracts

with  Government  which it is  fully  proved  were

entered   into,   through  some  misunderstanding,

though  the contractor is, in fact, liable in  law

and  Government  could insist on his  bearing  the

loss  arising  from a misunderstanding  for  which

Government is not responsible, nevertheless, I  am

of  the view - here I say I may be wrong and I would

like enlightenment from the Financial Secretary on

the principles applied - that Government should show

a sufficient sense of equity in conceding a review

in  those particular circumstances and should  not

seek to act with Shylock commercial instincts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang (Financial Secretary (Acting)) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> Mr Chairman, each case will

have  to  be  decided on its own merits,  in  this

case,  the Government is satisfied that the  price

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $2,712 for Head 41 stand part

more  mysterious than it already is. It seems that

this  sum  of  money is now required  to  pay  the

Federation   Employees  Provident  Fund - employers'

contribution - in  respect of certain  employees  of

the  Trade  Marks  Registry  who  were  Federation

Government servants seconded to Singapore and  who

were  to be paid for by the Federation Government.

What  I  would like to enquire from the  Financial

Secretary is: if he has been paying x dollars  for

these  Government servants and has been  receiving

from the Federation Government x plus y dollars, y

being   the   Federation   contribution   to   the

Federation of Malaya's provident fund scheme,  how

does  he square up his accounts for so long before

it  is  discovered  that, in  fact,  he  had  been

receiving from the Federation Government, x plus y

dollars, and he is paying x dollars? After several

years it is discovered that y dollars had not been

paid  to the Federation Employees Provident  Fund.

We have great respect for people who are intituled

Auditors-General,  but  that  respect  cannot   be

commanded  if  this  sort  of  mis-accounting   is

discovered now and again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang (Financial Secretary (Acting)) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> When the accounts were

received from the Federation, the Singapore  Trade

Marks   Office   thought   that   the   Federation

Government had made a contribution direct  to  the

Employees  Provident Fund.  It  was  only  when  a

reminder was received from the Employees Provident

Fund  that  it  was realised that the contribution

had not been made. It was an oversight on the part

of the Singapore Trade Marks Office.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> How do you square your accounts?

The  question  is an interesting one,  Sir, I  am

merely drawing attention. It is not my idea; it is

the  idea  of  the Member for Tanjong  Pagar.  His

question  is  simply this: how does the  Financial

Secretary  square  his accounts  for  1952,  1953,

1954,  1955 and 1956, to discover it only in 1957?

In those six years, how did he square his accounts

when he got x plus y dollars



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1618</b></font><br><br>



and paid out x dollars? That is a fair question.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I take it that the Public Accounts

Committee will look into that.

<br><br>In   other  words,  six  months'  payment  to  the

Specialist Officer comes to $16,200. We  are  told

now  that  his  services must be continued  for  a

further six months because certain officers  under

training  will  not return in time  to  take  over

before  this six-month period is out  and  we  are

asked to vote a sum of $18,100. There is therefore

a  difference  of  $1,900 between  the  first  six

months'   payment  and  the  second  six   months'

payment. Is this officer getting a salary rise for

the second six months?

<div align="center"><b>SEAMEN'S REGISTRY BOARD BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Report from Select Committee)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Report from the Select Committee on the

Seamen's  Registry  Board Bill,  as  contained  in

Sessional  Paper No. L.A. 6 of 1957,  be  adopted,

subject  to the recommittal of the Bill in respect

of  clauses  3 and 5 to a Committee of  the  whole

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report, Sir, of the Select Committee is

before the House. Representations were made to the

Select  Committee by all interested parties,  that

is   shipowners  and  the  seamen's  unions,   and

witnesses  from  both  sides appeared  before  the

Select   Committee   and   were   examined    very

thoroughly.  The salient feature of this  Bill  is

the  provision for a roster system,  and  on  that

particular feature, there was great divergence  of

opinion  between  the  shipowners  and  the  trade

unions.  On  the rest of the Bill, there  was  not

much  difference of opinion between the two sides;

in   fact,  representations  and  suggestions  for

amendment  made by one side (except of  course  on

the  roster clause), were not objected to  by  the

other side and, in some cases, even accepted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the roster system, the employers were very

emphatic  that it would operate harshly  and  that

the  harshness of the system would make  Singapore

less  attractive for recruiting seamen.  In  fact,

they   even  thought  that  it  might  drive   the

recruitment of seamen away from Singapore to other

ports, probably Hongkong. The unions, on the other

hand, were equally emphatic that the roster system

was  the  only one which could prevent  corruption

and  the financial "squeezing" of seamen, and give

seamen a fair chance of getting employment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1622</b></font><br><br>



without   their  being   preyed   upon   by

unscrupulous persons in charge of the Registration

Bureau,   and  also  by  agents  or  servants   of

employers  who were unscrupulous enough to  demand

money for giving them the jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to read a letter addressed to

the  Select Committee but which arrived after  the

Report was prepared; it is addressed to the Select

Committee in fulfilment of a promise made  by  the

unions to submit this information to it. It  is  a

letter  from  representatives of the International

Confederation of Free Trade Unions and I will read

out  the  relevant paragraph. I may say here  that

the roster system was established in the ports  of

Bombay  and  in Calcutta in 1953, or  three  years

ago,  and it was put up by the shipowners  to  the

Select  Committee that the system  had  failed  in

Calcutta as far as they knew. On this point,  this

is  what  the I.C.F.T.U. representatives  have  to

say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The roster register system of selection and

engagement prevailed in both recruitment centres

under rules and regulations found generally

acceptable." -



<br><br>that is referring to Calcutta and Bombay-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two offices have now been in operation for

some  three years. Speaking for the large body  of

seamen,  we  can  say most emphatically  that  the

scheme  has  proven,  a success.  It  has  ensured

fairness  and  equity in selection and  engagement

matters  .  . . It has, to our personal knowledge,

freed  seamen from the stranglehold of  interested

petty   unions,   and   company   and   government

officials.  We  are  not in a  position  to  state

whether  any  avenue for corruption still  exists,

but  this  we do know from our personal  knowledge

and investigations - that job-buying no longer holds

sway  and  that  the  seamen, by  and  large,  are

satisfied with the working of the scheme."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a great deal of deliberation, the

Committee,  on  balance, decided that  the  roster

system  should be preserved as it appears  in  the

draft  Bill,  and  therefore  provisions  for  the

system  still  remain. However, the harshness  has

been  lessened to a great extent by  removing  the

four-year  limitation clause. The  original  draft

Bill  contains  a  limitation clause  whereby  the

shipowner  could  retain  the  services   of   old

seamen - those who had served with him - for up  to  a

maximum



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1623</b></font><br><br>



of  four years, provided he signed them on  within

seven  days.  That four-year clause has  now  been

removed so that a seaman can continue to work  for

an  employer for as long as he likes, provided  he

is  signed on within seven days, and the  Minister

has  certain  discretionary powers to  waive  even

this seven-day limit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowance is also now made for the transfer of

seamen  between ships of the same  owner.  In  the

previous  Bill, a seaman had to sign on  with  the

same ship within seven days but he was not allowed

to  sign  on  with  a different ship  although  it

belonged  to  the same owner. That  has  now  been

provided for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main amendments to the Bill therefore, are

the  removal  of the four-year limitation  clause,

and provision for seamen to sign on with different

ships  of  the same owner. There is also provision

whereby  a  seaman who wants to take  two  months'

leave  and go, say, to the Federation, can  inform

the  Registry Office that he will not be available

for  employment and thereby not lose his place  on

the  roster.  There  is  also  provision  for  the

emergency  recruitment of seamen when the  Board's

office  is  closed or in case of other  emergency,

subject to report being made to the Board.  These,

I  think,  are the main changes to the Bill  which

the Committee has made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned a little while back that the

Minister  has been given discretion to  waive  the

seven-day  requirement. That was  found  necessary

because in some cases ships sailing regularly from

Singapore to neighbouring ports are put in service

in  the harbour limit of Singapore while they  are

here.   Seamen  working  on  these  ships  cannot,

therefore, be articled; they cannot sign  articles

when  they are working within the harbour limit - it

is  only  when they go out of harbour limits  that

they  sign articles. Therefore, what would  happen

if these ships operated within harbour limits for,

say,  a  month? When the ships want to  leave  the

Singapore  harbour  limit for  another  port,  the

owners  would  then have to go to  the  roster  to

engage a new crew and to discharge the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1624</b></font><br><br>



old  crew. It is in such cases that the  Minister

has  the discretion, provided a recommendation  to

that effect is put up to him by the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course there will be a lot of criticism on

the  roster system - I do not expect that there will

not  be  any.  The whole spirit of the legislation

can  only  be  realised if there  is  co-operation

between  the representatives of the employers  and

the unions on the Board. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>3.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, it gives me

great  pleasure  to second the motion  before  the

House. I am conscious that the Minister has for  a

very  long time - almost two years now - been engaged

in   laborious   efforts  to  bring   about   some

protection for seamen, and I think that after  the

exhibition  yesterday on the Education  Bill,  the

House must be delighted to find a Minister who is,

in fact, thoroughly conversant with the Bill which

he is propounding to this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the principle, Sir, of the roster.

There  is  no  other  way of  protection  for  the

seamen, and in this connection I think it my  duty

to  bring to the attention of the House a somewhat

ugly  incident which occurred a few days ago. Sir,

I  received  a  telephone call from a  person  who

purported  to represent a group of shipowners;  he

told  me how very dangerous the roster system  was

for  Singapore,  how detrimental  it  was  to  our

entrepot trade; and he assured me that I would  be

very well paid as a solicitor for this group if  I

would  undertake  to  vote  against  it  in   this

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I was so angry at the time, so rude,

that  I  forgot to take note of the name. Probably

acted  in  good  faith, but  I  think,  Sir,  that

perhaps it might be well if you were to make  some

statement  which the Press could carry,  that  any

attempt  by any person or organisation  to  pay  a

member  of the Assembly, whether a lawyer or  not,

to  vote  or  not  to vote, for any  Bill,  is  an

attempt  to  bribe that Member, an act  which  can

carry the gravest consequences detrimental to  the

person.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1625</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Since that point has been raised - and

the Member for Cairnhill was good enough to inform

me  beforehand that he was going to mention it - all

I  need  do, I think, is to draw the attention  of

the  Assembly  to  the  relevant  section  in  the

Legislative   Assembly  (Powers  and   Privileges)

Ordinance,  Section 18, which makes it an  offence

for  any  person  who "offers  to  any  Member  or

Officer   of   the  Assembly,  any   bribe,   fee,

compensation,  reward or benefit of  any  kind  in

order  to  influence him in his  conduct  as  such

Member  or  Officer, or for or in respect  of  the

promotion   of,  or  opposition  to,   any   Bill,

resolution, matter or thing submitted or  intended

to  be submitted to the Assembly." The penalty  on

conviction is a fine of $2,000 or imprisonment for

two years, or both fine and imprisonment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I felt, in

listening to the debates yesterday and today, that

we  are all getting rather used to one another and

that we have a fair idea of what we may expect  to

hear  when any particular Member gets to his feet;

though,  speaking for myself, I am  no  longer  as

impressed  as  I  was in the  early  days  by  the

oratory  of  the legal Members. I still  would  be

disappointed if the Member for Cairnhill  did  not

rage,  storm  and cajole, and if  the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar did not finish up his  speech  with

hints   of  dire  peril  in  store  for  somebody,

Singapore  headed for destruction and the  British

for the sea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you heard this morning, Sir, that I am the

only  non-Socialist in the House, and Members will

therefore have a good idea of what I am  going  to

say  on this Bill, but I can assure you, Sir, that

no one has attempted to bribe me in the matter!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Easter holidays, I read through the

90 pages of Minutes of Evidence on this Bill taken

at  the  sittings of the Select Committee,  and  I

must  admit, Sir, that I did so not so  much  from

zeal  as an Assemblyman, as in order to study  how

you, Sir, conducted those meetings, in order that

I might



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1626</b></font><br><br>



improve  on  my  own  amateurish  efforts  in  the

Committee   on   Public  Accounts.   However,   on

completion  of my reading, I really was astonished

to  find that the roster clause was still included

in  the  Bill.  I gained the impression  from  the

Minutes of Evidence that the Members of the Select

Committee  themselves entertained a good  deal  of

anxiety  about this clause and, indeed,  had  very

grave  doubts about the wisdom of introducing  the

roster system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence on the shipowners' side appeared to

me  to be perfectly clear, and of course there was

no  doubt that they were definitely not in  favour

of the roster system. Now, it seems to me that the

shipowners had no real financial stake in this and

that their opinion was genuine and objective.  The

evidence on behalf of the unions was given by  the

representatives of the Seamen's Council of  Action

and,  in  my  view,  that evidence  was  sometimes

rather  vague and unconvincing. In Appendix  I  of

the Sessional Paper L.A. 6 of 1957, the Council of

Action state that they represent all 12 registered

seamen's unions in the colony-



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> What page?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> I beg your pardon- it is just at

the beginning, Appendix I, page 5 of the Sessional

Paper.  They  state  that  they  speak  with  full

authority  on behalf of the seamen. Well, Sir,  I

have  been  given to understand that the  Seamen's

Council  of Action was called into being  for  the

sole  purpose  of forming one single  non-communal

union.  This purpose has not so far, I understand,

been  achieved by the Seamen's Council of  Action,

and   indeed  there  have  been  reports  in   the

newspapers  of unions resigning from  the  Council

and  rejoining it. I have also been informed  that

the  Singapore Chinese Seafarers' Union is against

the introduction of the roster system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spokesman of the representatives of the

Seamen's  Council of Action admitted  to  being  a

landsman and to have no knowledge of the sea,  and

some  of his evidence was not evidence at all.  It

was,  in  fact, sermonising and giving  gratuitous

advice to Government. He



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1627</b></font><br><br>



claims success for the roster system Calcutta, and

I  gathered this was the only port which had  this

system,  but I have since learnt from the Minister

that  it  also exists in Bombay. He claims success

for this system but was unable to substantiate his

statement to the Committee at that time.  We  have

since  heard  this afternoon that the  system  has

been successful in these two ports, but I did  not

know that when I came into this House at 2.30 p.m.

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the other two representatives, one was a bank

employee and the other a trade union leader.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, one wonders whether those gentlemen

fully realised the importance of having a crew  in

a  ship working in close harmony together, and  of

the importance of selecting them to that end?  We

often hear the expressions "happy team" and "happy

office", and often a "happy home", but it seems to

me  that  a  "happy ship" is of greater importance

than any of these, for obvious reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I am being rather naive, but I also

felt, in reading the Minutes of Evidence, that the

shipowners'  representatives seemed  to  have  the

interests and welfare of their seamen at heart.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Sutherland talks about

having  a  "happy  ship"  and  selecting  a  happy

crew - can he inform us as to how the roster  system

prevents this from coming about?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Have patience, and I will try to

do   that.  I  was  saying  that  the  shipowners'

representatives  seemed  genuinely  to  have   the

interests  and welfare of their seamen  at  heart,

and  that  they  were convinced  that  the  roster

system, which is, after all, an untried novelty in

Singapore, will not be a success in Singapore. For

my  own  part, I feel rather apprehensive  of  the

system - and  I will now answer the Minister - because

of  the  multi-racial population of this  City  of

Singapore, so much of it Chinese and so much of it

Chinese  clansmen. Added to that are the  problems

of different religions and sundry inhibitions. The

limitation, therefore, of two rosters seems to  me

to  be  a  very grave difficulty to get over;  and

there  is another point - no other industry  has  a

roster system imposed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1628</b></font><br><br>



on it, so why pick on the shipping industry?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate, Sir, that the main purpose of this

system  is to eliminate corruption, but  has  that

been    referred   to   the   Corrupt    Practices

Investigation   Bureau   for   investigation   and

subsequent report? If not, why not? Would  it  not

be  better  to  refer this matter  first  to  that

Bureau before introducing a system which obviously

has  defects  and has been tried out in  only  one

country,  where  its success, as we  know  it,  is

based merely on one letter which we have had  read

to  us this afternoon by the Minister for Commerce

and Industry?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not intend to vote against this Bill,

but  it  seems  to me that there are  one  or  two

points I have raised which require consideration.



<br><br>3.37 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> In reply, Sir. I can

understand  the  grave  doubts  and  apprehensions

expressed  by  Mr Sutherland but I am  sure  that

those fears will not be found to be true when  the

roster  system is working. Perhaps I must  explain

at  the  outset  how I envisage the roster  system

should  work. The Bill provides for  a  roster  or

rosters.  In  addition to that,  I  have  made  an

amendment  to it in Select Committee  setting  out

that the Board may also subdivide the rosters into

category  or  categories.  In  Singapore  at   the

moment,  seamen are recruited by clans, especially

where  the Chinese are concerned. There are  three

main  categories  of seamen - deck crew - sailors  who

work on deck - engine room crew, who work below  in

the  engine room; and catering staff, who are  the

waiters,  cooks and so on. The Board  can  provide

three separate rosters, one for deck crew, one for

engine room crew and one for catering staff. These

rosters  can  again  be  sub-divided  into  racial

categories    or    sections - Malays,    Hainanese,

Cantonese, Foochow and so on. If on a certain ship

you  have say, only Hainanese catering staff,  and

if that ship wants to recruit two more caterers,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1629</b></font><br><br>



they go to the catering staff roster. The employers

see  the  two  names at the top  are  of  Cantonese

caterers. If these are engaged, there is  going  to

be  trouble on board the ship. What they do then is

that they are referred to the Hainanese section  of

the  catering staff roster, and so they  get  their

Hainanese  seamen. The same thing will apply  where

deck crew are concerned. Some ships have Malay deck

crew  and  must therefore recruit only  Malays;  so

they  will be referred to the Malay section of  the

deck crew roster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shipowners' real objection, as I see it, is

based  on  the fear that they will have to  recruit

some  seamen who have in the past been found to  be

useless  or idle or are loafers, who they know  are

not going to do their work efficiently. If that  is

so - in   fact   I  raised  this  point   in   Select

Committee - the answer is that if a seaman  is  found

by  a  captain to be loafing, idle or  useless,  he

should  then not give the seaman a good  discharge,

so  that he will then be penalised by the Board and

will  not  then be put in the proper place  on  the

roster.  But  if seamen are given good  discharges,

then  there is no case against them, and I  do  not

see  why  they  should be refused employment  by  a

shipowner claiming that they are lazy when in  fact

their  discharges are good. If the captain finds  a

seaman to be lazy, incompetent or insubordinate, he

has a right to give him a bad discharge. So that is

the answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other real fear, I think, is that shipowners

are  afraid that there will be no choice  and  that

they  will get trade unionists on board ships; that

is, I think the real fear behind their minds. But I

do   not   see   any   way  of   preventing   trade

unionists - provided they are good workers, and  take

interest  in their work and discharge their  duties

efficiently - why trade unionists  should  not  get

employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides a shipowner with two choices.

If  he  comes round to the Board's office and says,

"I want 10 Malay deck crew", he may be given 12, 15

or  20  names  to  choose from, as  the  Board  may

decide. Great latitude is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1630</b></font><br><br>



given to the Board. The number of names offered  is

not fixed by the Bill. The Board can decide that if

an  owner  wants 10 seamen, it offers 15, where  he

wants 20 it offers 30, where he wants 100 it offers

150, or where he wants one, it offers two - the Board

can  decide  how many names to offer for selection.

Now  when  10  are  asked for and 15  offered,  the

shipowner has a choice. He may pick not 10  out  of

the  15  but only seven, and say, "Sorry, the  rest

are  no good to me." He still wants three more - and

he will be given another three from the next on the

roster;  so  he  has  a second  choice  then.  That

latitude  has been provided for; to say, therefore,

that  certain  seamen who are  "residue"  and  whom

shipowners  do not want to employ will get  to  the

top  of the roster, is unfair. Probably they do not

want  to  employ them because they are known  trade

unionists,   or,   as   the   owners   call   them,

"agitators".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Council of Action, Sir, I admit it was set

up  for  the  purpose of uniting  seamen  into  one

union.  I have received a letter today, dated  25th

April, from the Seamen's Council of Action, and  it

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To date, seven seamen's unions, including

practically  all  the big unions, have  signed  the

resolution  of  amalgamation  to  form  one  single

seafarers' union under the auspices of the Seamen's

Council of Action to be called the Singapore  Union

of  Seafarers  with  autonomous  sections  of  ship

officers,  seamen, harbour craft  workers,  and  an

interim  committee  has been  set  up  .  .  .  The

remaining five seamen's unions will also  be  asked

to  dissolve themselves and get their membership to

join  the new union for the sake of unity.  Whether

they do or not, little difficulty is expected."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know - and I have some knowledge as far

as  these unions are concerned - out of the remaining

five, only one matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested that this roster system is

an   untried  novelty  and,  therefore,  there   is

apprehension  about  its implementation.  Sir,  the

Rendel  Constitution and this  Assembly  also  were

untried novelties two years ago. Well, there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1631</b></font><br><br>



a  difference of opinion on how it works - some  are

satisfied, some are not - but the point is  that  if

you   stick  to  the  conservative  practice,   of

refusing  to introduce reforms or to try  out  new

things, you will never advance; you will not,  for

example,  have  the hydrogen bomb.  That  is  not,

therefore,  a  valid reason for  refusing  to  try

something  which  you  do not  know  may  prove  a

success; if it proves a failure, and if shipowners

go  out to other ports to recruit seamen, probably

we  will  have  to come back to this Assembly  and

repeal that portion of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the question why no other industry

has  this  roster system, why only this particular

industry  has it, is simple: in no other  industry

are  persons  engaged on a casual basis.  In  most

industries on land, there is permanent employment.

When  a man is taken on, he continues working with

the   firm,  provided  he  is  efficient,  is  not

insubordinate  and  is found to  be  suitable,  or

provided  the firm does not close down. But  in  a

ship, a seaman signs articles for that, six months

or,  if it is an ocean-going, long voyage ship for

two years. After that period, he comes back and is

thrown  out  of employment. There is no obligation

on  the part of the employer to reengage him,  and

therefore  he  may not be able to find  employment

after returning from a particular voyage, or after

he  has  finished  his term of service  with  that

ship.  The  roster system, therefore, is necessary

in  order to give him some security of employment.

He  knows that when he comes back, he can put  his

name  down  on  the  roster and has  a  reasonable

chance  that  in  so many months he  can  work  in

another ship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as I said, the system can fail if there

is  no co-operation between shipowners and unions,

and  that  is what I fear. If only shipowners  and

unions will co-operate, I am sure the system  will

work.  If  any  defects are found, we  can  always

legislate to remove them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final question which Mr Sutherland asked

was that if corruption is prevalent,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1632</b></font><br><br>



why  has there not been an investigation?

There has been an investigation into corruption; I

mentioned it at the Second Reading of this Bill. I

believe it was in 1950 but the report was that  no

proof of corruption was found. We tried to abolish

the  ghaut  serang system and put in  the  present

system, but it has not worked successfully and  we

know  that  in  fact  there  is  some  amount   of

financial   "squeeze"  of  seamen  by   interested

parties. I will not name them here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a typographical error.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 5, as amended,

stand part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, if this

clause 5 is for the protection of local seamen  so

that  they can have full employment, then I  think

it  may,  in  reality, deprive them of employment.

The Minister has realised that the working of this

roster  system  depends on the  goodwill  on  both

sides,  employer as well as employee. I know  that

in  this  Assembly everybody is trying to  give  a

good  deal  to workers, but if they are  going  to

introduce  what they think are good  measures  but

which  finally  deprive them of  employment,  then

they will not be doing a good turn to the seamen.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1635</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Select Committee Report, I know that

shipowners are not very happy about this, and  that

they  need  a  great  deal  of  persuasion  by  the

Department concerned to co-operate in this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if this clause is adopted, I think there is

still  another  escape  for  ship-owners - they   can

employ seamen who are in transit: these people  can

come  to Singapore to join their ships. I know that

ships   come  to  Singapore  because  this   is   a

convenient port and because they make Singapore the

focal   point  for  trade  in  South-East  Asia - and

Singapore  has  benefited  from  this  to  a  great

extent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are trying to protect seamen, but I hope that

this  protection is for local seamen only  and  not

those  who  come  here,  park  themselves  in  this

Colony,  owe  allegiance to other  lands  and  then

benefit from our laws. I think protection should be

given  only to the citizens of Singapore, to  those

who     will    become    citizens,    and     not,

indiscriminately,  to  people  who  owe  allegiance

elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard that a number of ships which

contemplated   registering   in   Singapore    have

transferred their registration to other  countries.

This means a loss to us. This also means that these

ships need not comply with our laws. This will mean

that  shipowners may not offer their  co-operation,

and  may  take  seamen  from other  ports  instead.

Again,  some  local ships, I have been informed  by

reliable   people,  have  avoided  Singapore   and,

instead  of  coming from Bangkok to  Singapore  and

then  going  to other South-East Asian ports,  have

proceeded straight from Bangkok to other ports like

Kuching.  In such cases, not only will  our  seamen

lose their chances of being employed, but Singapore

will also lose a great deal of its entrepot trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear the Minister say that he is going to

devise a system whereby there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1636</b></font><br><br>



will  be  sub-sections in his rosters according  to

race  of  seamen,  and types of work.  But  if  the

roster system is implemented in this way, what will

prevent  seamen from a particular race  being  left

out  all  the  time? If you have many  ships  which

employ  Chinese  seamen, and only  Chinese  seamen,

where  will  the Malay seamen find employment?  How

will  the roster system help them in securing jobs?

It seems that with a roster having many sections, a

seaman  will  not  get  much  protection.  It  will

probably  turn  out to be a white  elephant  to  be

discarded after some time. The main-
