<div align="center"><b>APPROPRIATION BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second and Third Readings read.



<br><br>2.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's

recommendation that this Bill be proceeded with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Main Estimates of Revenue and

Expenditure for the year 1962 have been considered  and

approved by the Assembly as Paper Cmd. No. 35 of 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now necessary to give legislative approval to

the  expenditure of the sums shown in these  Estimates,

and the annual Appropriation Bill now before Members is

intended to so provide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 97(1) of the Singapore (Constitution)

Order   in   Council,   1958,  an  Appropriation   Bill

containing, under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2336</b></font><br><br>



appropriate  heads of expenditure, the  sums  of  money

which   are  required  for  the  several  services   of

government  shall be introduced into the Assembly.  The

Appropriation Bill lays out all the amounts approved by

the  Assembly  in  the  Estimates  of  Expenditure  and

arranged under the Heads of Expenditure shown on  pages

41   and   42  of  Cmd.  No.  35  of  1961.  Once   the

Appropriation Bill has been approved, the Minister  for

Finance will be empowered to issue warrants authorising

expenditure  up to the amount under each  Head  in  the

Appropriation  Bill to be paid out of the  Consolidated

Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there

is one point on which I wish to touch, and that is Head

33  in  the  Schedule - Charge on Account of  the  Public

Debt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first occasion when the Budget was presented to

the Assembly by the present Government, I raised one or

two  queries on the items set out under Head 33- Charge

on  Account  of the Public Debt - and you,  Mr  Speaker,

ruled  me  out  of  order because they  were  statutory

debts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under Head 33, the total figure to

be  allocated is set out on page 350 of the  Estimates,

and  on  pages  41 and 42 is an abstract  of  estimated

expenditure  for  the  year  1962,  showing   statutory

expenditure and the amounts to be voted. Now under Head

33,  the  statutory expenditure is $20,549,310 and  the

amount  to  be  voted  by the Legislative  Assembly  is

$1,500,710. When one examines these items, one  notices

two  points.  The first point I wish to  bring  to  the

attention  of the House is subheads 4 and 5. Subhead  4

is  Discount on Treasury Bills . . . . $1,500,000,  and

subhead 5 is Interest on Treasury Deposits .... $1,600,000. The point I wish to make is that these

two  subheads  appear  as  statutory  expenditure  and,

therefore,  the  Assembly  has  no  control  over   its

expenditure. But the difficulty here is that these  are

interest payments on debts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2337</b></font><br><br>



which   are   not  yet  incurred  and,  therefore,   my

contention is that any interest payment on debt not yet

incurred is not a public debt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 97(4) of the Singapore (Constitution) Order in

Council,   1958,  sets  out  the  heads  of   statutory

expenditure and one of such heads is section 100  which

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The public debt of Singapore is hereby charged on the

Consolidated Fund.'



<br><br>What  I  would like to ask the Minister for Finance  is

this.  If  he  does not raise money by way of  Treasury

bills or does not take in Treasury deposits, then these

two sums do not become payable by way of interest. That

being so, how can he then come to the Assembly and  say

that  this  is  statutory  expenditure  and  that   the

Assembly has no control over it? This seems  to  be  a

left-handed way by means of which Government can  raise

money  without  the consent and, if  I  may  say,  Sir,

without  the  knowledge of the Assembly  regarding  the

purpose  of  expenditure. Assuming that a  discount  on

Treasury bills is obtained at an average rate  of  five

per cent interest, then under subhead 4, Govermnent can

borrow about $30 million for 1962. Similarly, they can

borrow  another $30 million by way of Treasury deposits

under  subhead  5.  So  that  the  Government  is  then

enabled,  by the use of subheads 4 and 5, to borrow  up

to  $60 million without the consent of the House.  That

is the first point, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point to which I wish to draw the attention

of  the Minister for Finance is this. Under subhead  10

on  page  350  of  the Estimates, there  is  a  sum  of

$1,500,000  which appears as Repay ment of  War  Damage

Interest-Free Loan, but that apparently is not a public

debt.  Although  it seems to be a debt which  is  being

paid  out  of  the Consolidated Fund, yet it  does  not

appear  under  Head 33 as a Charge on  Account  of  the

Public  Debt, because the Minister is, in fact,  asking

the Assembly to vote $1.5 million for the repayment  of

war  damage  interest-free loan. Perhaps  the  Minister

might care to explain to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2338</b></font><br><br>



House why it is that this particular debt is treated as

if it were not a public debt.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Goh, in reply.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I have been assured of the

correctness  of  regarding interest  paid  on  Treasury

bills  and Treasury deposits as coming within the terms

of  Charge on Account of the Public Debt. Therefore, it

is  statutory  expenditure which need not  require  the

assent  of  this  House before it is paid.  However,  I

think  the Member for Farrer Park has a point, that  in

respect  of  long-term le2ns, it is necessary  for  the

Government  to  seek the approval of the  House - at  any

rate  as  regards  the maximum limit to  which  we  can

borrow  by way of loans from the public. But as regards

the Treasury bills and Treasury deposits, reference  to

this  House is not necessary. I am not quite sure  what

the legal position is in this respect, because Treasury

bills  have  the  authority of an Ordinance  which  was

passed  by the former Legislature, and I am not certain

whether  or  not  any ceiling has been imposed  on  the

amount that Government can so borrow. It could well  be

that a ceiling has been imposed under that Ordinance on

the  amount  that could be borrowed by  the  Government

through Treasury bills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second point, that is the repayment of

war  damage interest-free loan, the position  is  this.

Before  World War II, there was a compulsory war damage

insurance   scheme  to  which  various  categories   of

business  were required to contribute. After  the  war,

the damage was assessed and large amounts were paid out

by  way of war damage compensation. The funds available

under the war damage insurance scheme were not adequate

to  meet  all the claims for war damage, and  the  U.K.

Government  had to come to the assistance of  both  the

Singapore  Government and the Federation Government.  I

think  this was in 1948 or thereabouts - just a few years

after  the  end of the Second World War.  Part  of  the

financial assistance was made by way of grants and part

was  made  by way of interest-free loans. Although  the

loan carried no interest, it is necessary,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2339</b></font><br><br>



of  course, to make annual repayments of principal, and

this is the contribution which the Singapore Government

has to make to the U.K. Government in repayment of this

loan. There is still another 15 years to go. I think it

is  for this reason that the repayment of this loan has

not  been regarded legally to fall within the terms  of

Charge on Account of the Public Debt as defined in  the

Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2339</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read

a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The University of Malaya was established on 8th

October,  1949, as a national institution to serve  the

higher   educational  needs  of   Singapore   and   the

Federation  of  Malaya. The origins of  the  University

could  be  traced back to the founding in Singapore  of

the  King  Edward VII College of Medicine in  1905  and

Raffles  College in 1929. Both these Colleges gradually

expanded  to  serve  the  educational  needs   of   the

increasing  population of Malaya  until  World  War  II

intervened in 1942.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1947 a Commission was appointed under the

chairmanship of Sir Alexander Carr-Saunders to  inquire

into  and  make  recommendations concerning  university

education in Malaya. As a result of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2340</b></font><br><br>



recommendations of this Commission, the  University  of

Malaya  was  founded in 1949. Although  the  Commission

recommended  that  the  two Colleges  should  form  the

nucleus of the new University, it also anticipated  the

rapid   demand  for  higher  education  in  a   swiftly

expanding population of the two territories, and so  it

recommended  that  the new University  should  consider

moving into South Johore in order that future expansion

would not be hindered for lack of space. However,  this

did  not  materialise  because  of  the  enormous  cost

involved, and the scheme had to be abandoned in

1954.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1957 a Commission of Inquiry headed by Dr R. S.

Aitken  was set up by the Governments of Singapore  and

the  Federation,  this  time  at  the  request  of  the

University,   in  order  to  review  the  constitution,

working, and finances of the University in the light of

experience and rapid expansion of the last seven years,

and  of  the prospective expansion in the near  future,

including  the  plan for developing the  University  in

Kuala Lumpur, and to make recommendations. Arising from

the   Commission's  Report  and  resulting   from   the

recommendations   of  the  two  joint   Committees   on

Constitution   and  Finance  appointed   by   the   two

Governments,  legislation was passed in  November  1958

providing  for  the  continuance of the  University  of

Malaya   as   a   single  university   but   with   the

establishment  of two largely autonomous  Divisions  of

equal  status, one in Singapore and the other at  Kuala

Lumpur.  This  legislation came  into  effect  on  15th

January, 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The University's running expenses continued to be met

from  grants from the Governments of Singapore and  the

Federation  of Malaya, hitherto made on a  quinquennial

basis  in  the ratio 40 : 60, on the basis  of  student

numbers from the two territories. But in 1959 they were

amended to a triennial basis for the period 1959-61 and

the  ratio  changed to a basis of 1:  2.  It  was  also

expected   that  by  1962  each  Government  would   be

responsible for looking after its own Division  and  at

the same time contributing towards the annual recurrent

cost of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2341</b></font><br><br>



the other Division in respect of its students attending

courses  not  available  in its own  Division.  Capital

grants, however, would continue to be made on an  equal

basis during the triennium.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 1960 the Governments of Singapore and the

Federation  of  Malaya  indicated  their  intention  to

establish autonomous separate national universities  in

Singapore  and  the  Federation  by  1962.  Steps  were

accordingly  taken in both territories to  redraft  new

constitutions for each Division to found  two  separate

national universities. At the request of the Divisional

Council   of   the  University  of  Malaya   (Singapore

Division),  a joint Government/University committee  of

seven  were  appointed  in  June  this  year  for  this

purpose.  And  the present draft Bill was submitted  to

both  the Divisional Senate and Divisional Council  for

their  views.  I  might add that  the  Singapore  Joint

Government/University  Committee  were  in  the   happy

position  of  being able to use the draft Bill  of  the

Federation's Joint Government/University Committee  in

its  deliberations.  On  the whole,  our  Bill  closely

follows the present pattern of the Constitution of  the

University  of  Malaya so that a feeling of  continuity

with the old is being maintained. The present Bill  has

also incorporated all material points suggested by both

the Divisional Senates and Council of the University of

Malaya  (Singapore Division). Our Bill is also  closely

in  line  with the main provision of the University  of

Malaya   Act   which  was  passed  in  the   Federation

Parliament this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should now like to enumerate the important

differences between the provisions of the present  Bill

with   those  of  the  present  Constitution   of   the

University of Malaya Ordinance, No. 12 of 1949, and  as

further  amended  by  Ordinance  No.  7  of  1954   and

Ordinance  No.  44  of  1958.  Firstly,  there  was  no

provision  in  the  past for the  University  to  grant

external  degrees.  Our draft Bill permits  this  under

clause   4  (b)  (ii)  at  page  9,  Part  II  of   the

Constitution. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2342</b></font><br><br>



marginal note reads, "Powers of the University":-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The University shall, subject to the proviions of this Constitution, have power -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to confer degrees upon persons who have -

<br><div align="center">*     *     *</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) satisfied such requirements as may be prescribed

by Act;'.



<br><br>I am sure Members of this House will welcome this

provision.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Singapore being a City State and

highly  urbanised, it is but fit and proper that adults

who  of  some  reason  or  other  could  not  join  the

University after a brilliant academic record in school,

and  for  some  reason  or other, perhaps  on  economic

grounds, are unable to pursue higher education and have

to  get  down to the business of employment, should  be

given the opportunity to catch up if they wish to  burn

the   midnight   oil  and  pursue  their   intellectual

pursuits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, membership of the Court. I am referring to

page 25 of the University of Malaya calendar year 1960-61.  Although  under  clause 15  (g)  of  the  present

Constitution four persons are appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to the Court, under clause 13 (g) of  the

draft Bill at page 13:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Court shall consist of -

<br><div align="center">*     *     *</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) two persons appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong;'.





<br><br>So although our draft Bill has reduced this number from

four   to   two,  provision  has  been  made  for   the

appointment  of three additional members,  namely,  one

person  appointed by the Sultan of Brunei,  one  person

appointed  by  the Governor of North  Borneo,  and  one

person appointed by the Governor of Sarawak. There  are

similar  reciprocal  provisions in  the  Federation  of

Malaya  Act, 1961, for the Court of the new  University

of  Malaya. In view of the current merger talks and the

proposed new Federation of Malaysia, I am sure  Members

of this House will welcome the provisions of membership

of the Court



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2343</b></font><br><br>



whereby the close association with our brothers in  the

Borneo   territories   are  being   embodied   in   the

Constitution of our University. Provision has also been

made  for  the  following  additional  members  to   he

admitted  to  the  Court of our  future  University  of

Singapore. If we turn to page 14, clause 13,  paragraph

(n):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'the head or director or such other representative as

may  from  time  to time he appointed by the  governing

body of each of the following:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the Lembaga Gerakan Pelajaran Dewasa;

<br><div align="center">*     *     *</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the University of Malaya established by the

University of Malaya Act,    1961;



<br><div align="center">*     *     *</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) the Dewan Bahasa dan Kebudayaan Kebangsaan;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) the Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka, Federation of

Malaya;'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, membership of the Council. Although the

representation  of  the Council has not  been  altered,

remaining  at  20,  with  the Government  having  three

representatives being officials holding  the  posts  of

Permanent  Secretary  in  the Ministries  of  Treasury,

Education  and Health, our draft Bill has amended  this

clause  to  read as follows - if we refer  to  page  15,

clause 16:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Council shall consist of -

<br><div align="center">*     *     *</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) three persons to be appointed by the Government

of Singapore;'.



<br><br>Such a provision will allow for more flexibility in the

appointment of officials and also for continuity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the transitional provisions of the Bill.

It  will be noted that under clause 49, at page 23, the

first   Chancellor  of  the  proposed   University   of

Singapore will be an appointment by the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara  on the advice of the present Divisional Council

of the University of Malaya in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 50 provides for the present holder of the

principalship of the University of Malaya in  Singapore

to   become  the  first  Vice-Chancellor  of  the   new

University.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> How long?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2344</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Clause 54, if you turn to page 24

of  the  Bill,  provides for the  continuation  of  the

present Divisional Council of the University of  Malaya

in  Singapore to be the first Council of the University

for  a period of one year or such shorter period as may

in   the  opinion  of  the  Vice-Chancellor  be  deemed

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 55 provides for the present Guild of Graduates

of  the  University of Malaya to be  divided  into  two

Guilds;  that  is,  the  Guild  of  Graduates  of   the

University  of Singapore and the Guild of Graduates  of

the  new  University of Malaya, at the  option  of  the

graduates.  Such  option could be  exercised  within  a

period  of  twelve months, and if such  option  is  not

exercised  during the period mentioned, then  the  last

known address of the graduate will .be taken as a basis

for going on to the register. I may add that there is a

similar  clause in the not disposed of of  the  present

University of Malay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, clause 62, at page 25, provides for the

setting  up  of a Joint Winding-up Committee  of  eight

persons  to  take  over the powers now  vested  in  the

Central Council and any other central authority of  the

University of Malaya. It will have up to two  years  to

wind  up  affairs still not disposed of of the  present

University of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will not involve the expenditure of

additional money. Annual estimates for recurrent annual

expenditure  and  for  special  expenditure   will   be

submitted  by  the  University  in  the  usual   manner

annually.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is confident that with the

establishment  of  the University  of  Singapore,  more

facilities  will  be  provided both  in  the  field  of

expansion of courses of studies and the number  in  the

intake of students annually.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a growing State both in status and in its

population.  With  the  rapid  expansion  in  secondary

education in all the four language streams, it is to he

expected that yet greater demands will he made for  the

provision  of  higher studies, With the provision  thus

made,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2345</b></font><br><br>



it  is hoped that less and less of our students need go

overseas  to  pursue their higher studies for  a  first

degree. Perhaps I should conclude by adding that it  is

the  intention of my opposite number in the  Government

of the Federation of Malaya and myself to see that both

national universities, the University of Singapore  and

the new University of Malaya at Kuala Lumpur, will come

into  being  on  the  same day, that  is,  the  1st  of

January,  1962, if the Bill meets with the approval  of

this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

sure we all welcome this Bill. Although for sentimental

reasons we may regret that there cannot be one national

university  to serve the whole of Malaya, yet  we  know

that for practical purposes, this means that instead of

one university, we shall have two, and altogether three

Universities in Malaya, including Nanyang University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 15 years ago, when the Carr-Saunders Commission

was  here, there were still doubts whether there should

be a university. They were thinking even in terms of  a

university college. Yet within 15 years, we have  three

universities.  I  am sure that within one  more  decade

people  in  northern Malaya may be thinking of  another

university to be sited in Penang or in Ipoh. Then with

this  idea of a united Malaysia coming to fruition,  we

can expect Singapore will continue to be very important

as  an  educational centre for South-East Asia. I  hope

that  we  shall  be  drawing  students  not  only  from

Singapore but also from the neighbouring regions.  Sir,

I notice that in page 2, paragraph 2 of the Bill, there

is  a statement to assure that each university will  be

autonomous.  Sir,  I  am sorry that  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister  is  not present in the House  today.  I  have

asked  a few members of the staff of the University  to

take part in politics, and they have expressed the view

that  they  were  not  very sure  whether  the  present

Government would show the same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2346</b></font><br><br>



degree  of tolerance as the previous Government did.  I

hope  that the present Government will be able to  give

us  the assurance that there will be the same degree of

courtesy given, and that the Barisan Sosialis will also

give  the  same  assurance in case they  ever  come  to

power:  that is, if any member of the University  staff

should  want to take part in politics in an  opposition

group,  then they would have the same courtesy as  they

had  before. I am sure that in the case of  the  Member

for Anson, he would give that assurance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> For expulsion!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I am not ashamed to say that I

was one of those poor fellows who were unable to go  to

a university and had to study as a external student. We

had  to  do  it the hard way. I believe the Member  for

Anson also did it the hard way. I am glad the chance is

now being given to those in Singapore to continue their

studies   after   passing   their   Cambridge    School

Certificate or Senior Middle III, so that in  spite  of

adverse circumstances they will still be able to attain

the object of their ambition and serve their country in

a better way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that we all wish success and still greater

success to the University of Singapore in spite of  its

new  name.  We  believe  that  the  standard  will   be

maintained  and that our products will be  as  good  as

those  that  graduated previously. We extend  our  good

wishes, Sir, to the University.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not regret to see

the  establishment  of  an  autonomous  University   in

Singapore.  It  is  true  that  the  Division  of   the

University  of  Malaya  has been spurred  by  political

motivations.  But I do say, Sir, that the  requirements

of the two territories, and certainly, the requirements

of   this  territory,  can  only  be  fulfilled  by   a

university here in Singapore. We have room aplenty  for

two  universities, one in the English  language  stream

and  one in the Chinese language stream. I do not  view

the establishment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2347</b></font><br><br>



of an autonomous university as being in  any

way derogatory to the unity of this area. Mr Speaker,

there  are political divisions which separate us.  The

University  of  Malaya, which was a single  unit,  did

assist, I believe, very considerably in bringing about

a  common approach anti understanding between students

from Singapore and the Federation. I believe this will

continue  despite the division of the  University,  by

the  need  of each territory to send students  to  the

other territory to study in those faculties which  are

absent in the local University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another aspect, Sir, which engages me and

compels  me  to  rise  to sneak  this  afternoon.  The

Minister  for  Education has  told  us,  and  told  us

correctly, that   a  university   is   a   national

institution.  Sir,  it is a national  institution  not

merely for the dissemination of knowledge but also for

the  advancement of knowledge, as I think you will see

stated  in clause 4 (a) of the Schedule. That  is  the

distinction  between  a  university  and  a  technical

college.   In   a  technical  college,   you   acquire

knowledge.  In a university you do not merely  acquire

knowledge,  but  you  also  expand  the  frontiers  of

knowledge. That is by far the more important  function

of  a  university, that it should keep alive the human

spirit  of inquiry, research and independent thinking.

Before   our  youth  can  be  trained  in  independent

thinking, there must be academic freedom for those  in

whose  care  they  are - the  academic  staff.   My

complaint about this Bill is that it does not  provide

for  the  protection of academic freedom. Mr Speaker,

the  leader of the S.P.A., with considerable courtesy,

soft-pedaled what is a legitimate fear,  and  that  is

the  fear  of political intimidation whereby  academic

freedom can be arid is inhibited.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is the hon. Member for Anson

referring to the Member for Tanglin?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2348</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If he is, I do not think the Member for

Tanglin claims to be the leader of the S.P.A.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sorry, Sir, surely he is the leader of

the S.P.A.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He is the leader only in this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> My apologies. Thank you for the

correction. Of course, it is the Member for Cairnhill.

Sir,  I was saying that this fear is a very real fear.

It  is  a fear which has arisen from certain incidents

which  have  occurred during the short lifetime  - not

too short; the shorter the better - of this Government.

I  would  like  to draw your attention, Sir,  to  this

matter  of  principle,  of the  urgent  need  for  the

protection  of academic freedom and the  insertion  in

this Bill of such protection. I would like to draw the

attention  of  this  House to  certain  correspondence

which  took place between me and the Principal of  the

University,  who  will, under the provisions  of  this

Bill, he the Vice-Chancellor on the 1st of January.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the 14th of October, 1961. I wrote to the

Principal, University of Malaya in Singapore:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The discussions between the Singapore and the

Federation  Governments on the issue  of  Merger  have

raised, in so far as information is available and will

no doubt in future raise matters of constitutional law -'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not suppose the Member for

Anson is going to read the whole letter, because he is

not  permitted to do that. All he need do is  to  read

extracts and paraphrase the correspondence.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

thought in fairness to the officer concerned and  the

principle of academic freedom that is involved. There

are four letters. They are all fairly short, Sir,In

that case, I shall try to paraphrase and, in fairness

then,  may  I  ask that the entire correspondence  be

tabled, so that it may be available to be checked?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Certainly, that is the correct course.

In  his speech, the Member for Anson could paraphrase

what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2349</b></font><br><br>



is  contained in that correspondence and then later on

table  it for the information of any Member who wishes

to see it.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged, Mr Speaker. I drew

the  attention  of the Principal of the University  of

Malaya  in Singapore to the need for clarification  of

the  public in respect of certain matters which  arose

on these constitutional issues. I pointed out that, in

my view, there was a responsibility on the part of the

academic staff of the University to assist the  people

of  Singapore  and their elected representatives,  and

asked  whether  he  would have  any  objection  to  my

approaching  a certain professor of international  law

with  a  view of obtaining his views on constitutional

issues  raised by the joint statements issued  by  the

Prime  Ministers.  I said "I...write  to  you  to  ask

whether  you agree a member of the academic  staff  of

the University can properly advise political parties...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I did not ask for permission to do so, because,

to my mind, a member of the academic staff requires no

permission   to   indulge  in  such  extra   curricula

activities as he thinks proper so long as they do  not

encroach  upon the time required for the discharge  of

his responsibilities to the University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I received a reply which slated, in effect, that

the  University is prepared to permit individual full-time  staff  of  the Law Faculty to  give  the  advice

requested if the request is made by the Speaker and is

addressed  to  the  Principal.  Sir,  I  thought,   in

fairness, I should have read the lot, but I  now  will

table  it.  I can only say this. I take a  very  grave

view   of   what  I  consider  to  be  the   lack   of

understanding  displayed  in  that  letter  of  basic,

academic  traditions.  And there  are  two  traditions

affected.   One  is  the  freedom  of  the  individual

academician in his unfettered discretion to advise  or

not to advise such person or organisation as he thinks

fit   on  such  matters  as  are  within  his  special

competence, without any interference of any  character

whatsoever, on the part of his colleagues or the Vice-Chancellor.  The other tradition is the responsibility

of  the University and its teaching staff to recognise

that we do not subsidise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2350</b></font><br><br>



Tomtits  in  ivory towers. That is  not  what  we  pay

millions of dollars for. It is an organisation for the

advancement  of learning to assist the nation  and  if

and  when matters vital to the nation arise and  there

is  an  honest  request for information  within  their

specific  field  of  competence,  then  they  have   a

responsibility to advise - a responsibility which, again

in   their  discretion,  they  may  refuse,  for  good

reasons, to comply with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wrote to the Principal seeking to avoid the

possibility  of  a  misunderstanding.  At  length,   I

finally received a reply on the 22nd of this month  to

say that while a member of the University may, subject

to limitations imposed by his contract and the ethical

code  of his profession, freely give advice to anyone,

the danger lies in the use to which such advice is put

to.  He  would,  of course, he giving  advice  in  his

individual capacity, but the quotation of his  opinion

by  a  political Party is bound to give  rise  to  the

impression  that  the University  is  involved  in  or

sympathetic to any particular stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, though much more courteous in tone and to

some  extent  recognising basic academic rights,  this

letter does substantially say that they are afraid  of

being  involved in political controversies. Therefore,

it would he his view (the Vice-Chancellor, the present

Principal)  that members of the academic stall  should

not  give  advice and that they would  be  discouraged

from doing so. It is indeed a pathetic commentary that

the  University of Singapore, on the eve of its birth,

should    fail   so   signally   to   recognise    its

responsibility to the people of Singapore, and display

a   lack   of  moral  courage  as  indicated  in   the

correspondence to which I have referred  and  which  I

would  be happy not only to table here but to have  it

quoted widely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the fear of the University as

displayed by its Principal's letters arises  from  the

conduct  of  this  Government with  reference  to  two

persons. One has already been the subject of debate in

this House and that is the horror known as the Enright

Letter. The other concerns the professor who,  in  the

legitimate  exercise of his discretion and within  his

special field of competence,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2351</b></font><br><br>



had the temerity to advise the Member for Hong Lim who

sought  his  advice.  I  do  not  know  exactly   what

transpired  thereafter, Like an  honourable  gentleman

and a man of dignity, he never saw fit to complain, so

far as I know, to anybody. But it is widely recognised

in  the  University  that, because of  his  legitimate

activity in advising a Member of this House on certain

constitutional  matters  which  affected   him,   that

professor  came in for grave criticism from the  Prime

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You heard the Member for Tanglin express to you what

is  recognised  now  throughout the  University,  that

political  activities will only be tolerated  if  they

arc  pro-P.A.P. If you invite the Prime Minister, Sir,

permission  will  be  granted for  the  holding  of  a

meeting. If you invite Mr Lim Ching Siong, that  will

not  be  granted.  I  would urge that  the  Government

itself  should give an undertaking that every contract

of  every  member of the academic staff  will  include

some such clause as the following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every teacher shall be free in his unfettered

discretion  to  advise any person or  organisation  on

matters   within  his  special  field  of  competence,

provided that such activity does not encroach  on  the

discharge of his responsibility to the University."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we cannot have freedom for the academic staff, we

cannot  have  a  University.  It  will  merely  be   a

university in name, a technical college in fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House cannot be unconscious of the very genuine

fears  of  the  academic stall of the  University  and

those whom it seeks to recruit, that here in Singapore

one  must mind one's P's and Q's, and if you annoy the

Government, your visa is cancelled and you are in  for

the  high jump. Such conditions of intimidation cannot

bring  out the best or cannot bring out anything  that

is  really  valuable in the way of the development  of

the human spirit for our youth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The two instances mentioned by the

Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2352</b></font><br><br>



Anson as being evidence that academic freedom is being

curbed   by   the  Government  related  to  expatriate

professors,  and  I think the Government  has  clearly

stated  its  stand on the participation of expatriates

in  local political affairs. Does the Member for Anson

not take this stand of the Government to account?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for Finance

for  himself admitting what I am asking this House  to

accept. He now says, in effect, that any member of the

academic  staff  who, within his field of  competence,

advises   on  matters  which  may  have  a   political

connotation  is acting improperly and  will  be  dealt

with  by  the Government, just as I am saying,  and  I

disagree totally - but totally. I consider that stand to

be  barbaric  (if you permit the expression,  Sir,  in

respect  of the stand) and truly at variance with  the

basic   concept  of  academic  freedom.  II  Professor

Sheridan or Professor Groves, or any lawyer who is  an

expatriate, advises on questions of law any person  in

this  territory  in matters which may  have  political

implications,  I  say, Sir, he is absolutely  entitled

to.  They  have  to  lecture on the legal  aspects  of

politics.  How can you seek to prevent them?  And  why

should  you seek to prevent them from advising on  the

legal aspects of politics? I say this, not only in the

legal  field  but in every other field,  Sir,In  the

field   of   culture,  about  which  the  P.A.P. are

justifiably touchy, because they know so little of it,

and like all ignorant people they are so terrified  of

what they are ignorant of. But I protest vehemently in

this House against the suggestion that a member of the

academic  staff,  because he is an expatriate,  cannot

advise or lecture on matters within his special  field

of   competence  if  such  matters  have  a  political

connotation  in  the context of local  politics.  What

does  matter,  Sir, - and  in  this  I  would  like  to

compliment  the  Minister,  I  am  delighted  at   the

provision  for external degrees. It is  true,  as  the

Member  for Tanglin has pointed out, that my  academic

degree  is an external one. Some of my friends in  the

University  say that that is an example of the  danger

of external degrees! That certainly is one way one can

take it, Sir. But I think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2353</b></font><br><br>



one  should recognise that in this area, where  poverty

is  widespread, bursaries are only recent - and even  the

Government  will admit that they are not adequate - where

many  who  are adults cannot afford to pursue  academic

studies,  and  the provision of external degrees  would

encourage them, to the greater benefit of Singapore - and

not   only   Singapore,  Sir.  We  know   that   London

University,   through   its   external   degrees,   has

influenced  considerable areas of the world far  beyond

the shores of England. I say that if this provision for

external degrees is imaginatively pursued in Singapore,

we can make a very valuable contribution to the culture

of  South-East Asia - a contribution which would redound

to our own benefit. I will naturally support the Second

Reading of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had hoped to have the assurance I asked for about

academic  freedom.  [Interruption]  In  view   of   the

interjection  of  the  Minister  for  Finance  and  the

snorting  noise I hear right opposite, I take  it  that

such  an  assurance will not be forthcoming. I can  but

regret, Sir, that I have not had the foresight to  move

an amendment so that it could be adequately debated and

voted on.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had not

intended to participate in this debate until the Member

for Anson worked himself into a frenzy as usual.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It is improper and unfair to talk about

"frenzy". May I ask that it be withdrawn?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Chair has to decide whether

any   expression  used  in  this  house  is  considered

offensive.  The  expression used by  the  Minister  for

Finance is considered offensive by the Member for Anson

and therefore it must be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I so withdraw it, Mr Speaker. Sir,

But   I  cannot  help  noticing - because  of  the  short

distance  that  separates  the  Member  for  Anson  and

myself - the way in which he works himself into  a  state

of excitement. I think that would be parliamentary, Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2354</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, no one, least of all Members of the Government,

would  want  to  curb  academic  freedom  in  any   way

whatsoever. That is not the issue. The issue  is  this,

and  I  pose it quite fairly and squarely to the Member

for   Anson.  Should  any  expatriate,  be  he  in  the

University  or outside the University, be permitted  to

interfere in local political party affairs? That is the

issue.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification, if you

please.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, you will remember the question he

posed  to  which I answered. The question  was  that  a

member  of the academic staff of the University, though

an  expatriate, may within the field of his  competence

advise  on  matters  even though  they  have  political

connotations.  I  repeat  "within  the  field  of   his

competence".



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No one will object to that, if his

activities are confined to matters within his field  of

competence even though they have political connotations

[Interruption].  But that is quite different.  When  an

expatriate  enters the arena in which there  are  local

political contenders, then he is taking a great risk.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> On a point of

clarification, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember during

the  early  days of the P.A.P. there was an  expatriate

senior lecturer at the University who was a good friend

of  the  local people. He stood on the P.A.P. platform

and  we welcomed him. We thought he was serving a  good

cause at that time for the local people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on the question of Professor Sheridan -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is rising on a

point of clarification. What he is now saying can  well

be  said  in  his  own speech. What  is  the  point  of

clarification? I have not got that and I do  not  think

the Minister has got it either.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2355</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, since the Member for Hong Lim

has  raised this point, I think, in fairness. I  should

reply.  He  was,  of  course,  referring  to  Professor

Elliot.  He  is a Singapore citizen and  he  cannot  be

considered an expatriate because he refused  to  accept

expatriation pay from the University.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No. Sir. I thought it was on a

point of academic freedom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I merely want to distinguish between the practice of

one's  legitimate profession and one's speciality  even

though, in the words of the Member for Anson, these are

matters  having political connotations.  That  sort  of

activity  and  entry into the political arena  are  two

separate  and  distinct activities. I  think  even  the

Member   for   Anson  cannot  gloss  over  this   great

difference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we do place a great value on

academic freedom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Oh!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I have just made the point that

there is a distinction between academic freedom in  the

exercise  of one's skill and one's special  line,  even

though there is a political connotation, and the active

entry into the political arena.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If after all I have said the Member for Anson is still

unable to grasp this distinction, I am just wasting  my

time and might as well end up here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with the utmost respect

to  the  Member  for  Anson, I cannot  agree  that  the

present   Principal   of  the  University   of   Malaya

(Singapore Division) is a man who lacks moral  courage.

I have known him for well over ten years. His political

thinking in some ways is not the same as mine. We  have

different  ideas on different matters, but  in  certain

areas  of thinking we agree. But I have never,  at  any

moment  during  our  ten years or  so  of  association,

thought  that he was a man lacking in moral courage.  I

personally  felt  that  he was outstanding  insofar  as

moral  courage  was  concerned. If I remember  rightly,

when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2356</b></font><br><br>



the  Member for Anson was the first Chief Minister, and

was  speaking  and  governing Singapore  through  Press

headlines   every   day,  when  he  was   mooting   the

Malayanisation Commission, he picked on Dr Sreenivasan

as  the  most eminent and able man to carry out a  most

difficult  task  confronting Singapore at  that  stage.

[Interruption]  But  he certainly did  not  lack  moral

courage then. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> In my opinion, his moral courage has not

gone  down  one  bit,  However, Sir,  that  is  not  my

business.  But  I  did  think, in fairness  to  someone

absent, I had to say something about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is just one matter on which I

wish  to  speak  in  respect of this Bill.  During  the

Budget  debate, I rose to speak on this, but you  ruled

me out of order, Mr Speaker, Sir, because there was  a

Bill before the House. I personally regret that it  has

become  necessary to separate the two  Universities.  I

entirely agree with the previous speakers that there is

more   than   a   pressing  need  for  two   or   three

universities. But I was of the view that all this could

be  done  within the ambit of the University of Malaya.

However, Sir, since the position has been reached where

the  two Universities have been split, I think we  have

to  make  the best of it. If this business of  the  so-called merger had come about two years earlier, perhaps

the  Universities  need not have been  split.  However,

Sir,  the  split  has come. I think our  main  function

today should be to try to keep the two Universities  as

closely  together as possible, to see  that  they  work

together  in  such  a way that each of  them  uses  the

faculties  of  the other without duplicating  them  too

much,  I  know  it  is necessary to  duplicate  certain

faculties in the interest of both countries, but  there

are certain faculties which need not be duplicated. One

faculty in respect of some subjects will be enough  for

both the territories for some considerable time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the Court is an important institution in

the  University set-up and it has its place,  the  more

important unit of the University is the University



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2357</b></font><br><br>



Council, both here and in the Federation. Sir, I  would

like  to  see  a  closer unity between  the  University

Council in Singapore and the University Council in  the

Federation  of Malaya so that the policies of  the  two

Universities  would be kept as close to each  other  as

possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 on page 15 of the Bill sets cut the

composition  of the Council. Under clause 16  (1)  (d),

the  Chancellor is given power to appoint not more than

four  persons.  I  was wondering whether  the  Minister

would not think it a good idea, and if he did think  it

a  good  idea to press this upon the University authori

ties,  to  make it possible for the Vice-Chancellor  of

each  of  the Universities to sit in on the Council  of

the  other. The Vice-Chancellor knows what is going  On

in  his  own University, and if the Vice-Chancellor  of

the Federation of Malaya University could sit in on our

Council, then his advice and his knowledge as  to  what

is going on in Kuala Lumpur could be readily and easily

available to the Council here. Similarly, if our  Vice-Chancellor were to sit in on the Kuala Lumpur  Council,

his  knowledge would be available to the Council there,

and  once  the  knowledge is made available,  then  the

Councils  could keep in line with each other.  That  is

the main point on which I wish to address the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of academic freedom, I myself have

once  or twice spoken in this House, and I do urge upon

the  Government  that  autonomy  means  nothing  unless

academic  freedom is possible. But the Government  says

something  else. These are all matters which  are  very

difficult  at the moment from the Government  point  of

view,  but  if academic freedom does impinge  upon  the

political  field,  I  venture  to  suggest   that   the

Government should not take too serious a view of it  if

it  is satisfied with the bona fides of the person  who

is embarking on such ventures.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, originally I did not wish to take part in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2358</b></font><br><br>



this  debate,  but  from what I  have  heard  from  the

Minister for Education it seems that he wants  to  make

use   of  this  Bill  to  establish  a  university   in

Singapore,  saying  that it is an  achievement  of  the

P.A.P.  I am not convinced of this point and so I  want

to stand up and say something about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, we must know that we want to pass

this  Bill  solely because Singapore is  in  a  passive

position.  It is because the Federation has a  national

university of its own and Singapore cannot make use  of

its  facilities, and the name also cannot  be  used  by

Singapore. If it is used, it does not mean that it is a

national  institution. Therefore,  this  University  of

Singapore  Bill  has  been  drafted  passively  due  to

pressure  exerted on Singapore. It is not anything  new

done  by  the  P.A.P. Government. This  point  must  be

clarified.  We  must  not  take  this  as  a  sort   of

achievement of the P.A.P. It does not mean that this is a

good result of the P.A.P.'s policy on education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, several Members have spoken on this

matter.  I  wish  to point out that the  University  of

Malaya was established during colonial days and its aim

was  to serve colonial rule. Today cur country has  not

achieved independence and the people of Singapore  have

not  achieved complete independence and have not joined

the   Federation  as  equals.  However,  if,  say,  our

University is only a semi-colonial university, and  you

want to talk of academic freedom for such a university,

it  is really a dream, because I feel that only a  true

university  can  have  true  academic  freedom  in   an

independent country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the split of the University

into  two Divisions as provided in this Bill, it  seems

that the Guild of Graduates is also to be split. I hope

that in future graduates of both Universities will  not

be  separated and have the feeling that "I am from  the

University of Malaya and you are from the University of

Singapore."  If that is the case, then it will  not  be

good  for us, because having intellectuals with such  a

concept is detrimental to the unity of our country.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2359</b></font><br><br>



I  especially hope that in future all the graduates  of

both  Universities  will be treated  alike  as  far  as

employment  is concerned. There should not be  priority

or privileges given to one University over the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I again hope that the P.A.P. Government will take

close  note  that in Singapore and the  Federation  the

desire  of  the  people to pursue higher  education  is

very,  very  intense, and so it is  not  sufficient  to

depend on a university run by the Government. In  this

respect,  I  hope the Governments, apart  from  running

their   own  University, must  be  liberal  and   also

concerned  themselves with the University  run  by  the

people themselves.



<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker.  I am placed an invidious position in  that  I

should he speaking on this Bill, being a member of tile

academic staff of the University of Malaya and, at  the

same time, a member of the Government. I came into  the

Chamber  just  in  time to hear certain  remarks  being

made. Therefore, in all honesty and conscience, I  must

rise to reply to all those remarks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me answer what has been uttered by

the Member for Upper Serangoon. I am quite prepared  to

listen  to  any constructive suggestions or any  useful

arguments  that have been put forward in this  Chamber.

But  so  hollow is the drivel that has been uttered  by

the Member for Upper -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Leader of the House must know

that the word "drivel" used of speeches of a Member  of

this  House  is unparliamentary. Will he withdraw  that

word?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I withdraw the word "drivel" and

use "nonsense".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Upper Serangoon has said that the

University of Malaya is a colonial university.  We  all

know that Raffles College, upon which the University of

Malaya  was  founded, was instituted  by  the  colonial

rulers who came



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2360</b></font><br><br>



to  Singapore  and the Federation. But  that  does  not

necessarily imply that those of us who went to  Raffles

College  and  the University of Malaya are,  therefore,

colonialists, as he would have imputed. Here  you  have

in this Chamber my colleague, the Minister for Finance,

who  was  in  Raffles College; the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs   in  the  University  of  Malaya;  the   Prime

Minister, in Raffles College with me; the Minister  for

Law  in Raffles College: the Minister for Education  in

Raffles College -



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> Point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> He has spoken, so let me continue.

The  Member  for  Queenstown was from  the  College  of

Medicine;  the Member for Nee Soo from the  College  of

Medicine;  the  Member for Farrer Park was  in  Raffles

College.  Are  we colonialists because  we  went  to  a

colonial institution?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was just wondering whether there

was that imputation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> He never said that.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Upper Serangoon perhaps

could  be  given an opportunity to elucidate.  This  is

misrepresentation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

want  to  clarify this. What I said was that when  this

University  was  established,  it  was  founded  by   a

colonial  government  because it  served  the  colonial

government.  I  did not say the present  University  of

Malaya is a colonial University because -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The point is: has the Member for

Upper  Serangoon imputed that those who  went  to  this

University are colonialists?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Has he imputed that? The answer is "yes"

or "no"?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2361</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): No, I did not say

that. That was distorted by the Deputy Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> He just said that this institution

was  built by the colonialists to serve the purpose  of

colonialism;  ergo those who went to  that  institution

were dupes of the colonialists.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What logic!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Is that not correct? Yes or no?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the

Deputy Prime Minister must know that in the mainland of

China,  all those who oppose America are from  American

universities.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> We are interested in the Federation

and  Singapore. I am not interested in what happens  in

China.  If he is interested in China, then let  him  go

elsewhere and debate what is happening in China. We are

interested in the University of Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Point of

clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I protest against the

rough manner of the Deputy Prime Minister. It is a very

unacademic speech.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think what Members of this

Assembly  are  interested in is whether the  allegation

made by the Deputy Prime Minister, that the Member  for

Upper Serangoon is alleging that all those who went  to

this   University  are  colonialists, is   a   correct

representation or an incorrect representation  of  what

he said. That is all that Members are interested in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I am obliged to The Member for

Upper  Serangoon for his clear answer; and, of  course,

the Member for Anson is not with us.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> A

different kettle of fish!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2362</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, it appears from what has been

expressed   that  we  are  now  going   to   have   two

Universities, one in Kuala Lumpur and one in Singapore,

and that this might lead to a disunity of opinion or  a

disruption of national feeling in Malaya. It  is  quite

unfounded. The mitosis for the University of Malaya  to

divide into two parts has already taken place. We  have

a  very simple example. Australia, with a population of

round   about   10   million,  has  today   about   six

universities for a population of 10 million.  There  is

no  reason,  therefore,  why  we  in  Malaya,  with   a

population  approaching nearly 8  million,  should  not

have two Universities.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Three.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sorry, three Universities. And

there  is no necessity to fear that there would be  any

duplication or triplication. I put to you a very simple

example.  Once  upon a time you had  only  one  medical

school in Canada. Then came the discovery that the only

medical  school  in  Canada was  not  producing  enough

doctors  to  supply the needs of the country.  So  they

thought  they could solve the problem - by putting  up  a

second  medical school, which they did. They put  up  a

second medical school. However with two medical schools

in  Canada, they still found that they could not  solve

the  shortage  of doctors. And I say the  same  problem

faces  us today. And it will be very selfish of  us  to

think   that   everything   can   be   centralised   or

concentrated in one institution - that we should  produce

all our engineers from one institution, all our doctors

from  one institution, and all our scientists from  one

institution. I say that is not a healthy or  a  logical

approach  to the problem of higher education. You  have

innumerable universities in Europe, the United Kingdom,

and  the United States. And in no way has the unity  or

thought  of nationalistic feeling in European countries

or  the U.K. or the United States been disrupted by the

fact  that  you  have  so  many  universities.  On  the

contrary, a healthy spirit of competition can arise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2363</b></font><br><br>



The idea that any particular institution .should have a

monopoly  of  higher knowledge or that any  institution

should  have  a  monopoly of training  professional  or

science students should be totally thrown overboard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was out of the Chamber just now, Mr Speaker, when I

gathered  the  Member for Tanglin made certain  remarks

about  me. I must admit that when I became the Chairman

of  the  People's Action Party and, at the  same  time,

held  a  post in the University, steps could have  been

taken to make life uncomfortable for me. In fact, steps

were taken to make life uncomfortable for me. I do  not

wish  to  make this Assembly a bureau where I  can  lay

down my complaints. I have forgotten all that.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> No, I do not wish. Let me continue,



Mr  Speaker, I will say this. The last Government was  generous  enough to permit me to continue teaching  at



the  University. I must admit that, I will  give  them



that tribute. But I will say in this House that I have



never  at any time made the University a battle-ground



for  party  politics.  I  had  ample  opportunity   to



influence my academic colleagues and to influence  the



students  who  came under me. But I never  did  it.  I



deliberately   kept   party  politics   out   of   the



University.  I  kept politics out of  my  relationship



with  the students and out of my relationship with  my



staff colleagues, because I sincerely believe that the



University should remain a neutral ground.  It  should



never   degenerate  into  a  battle-ground  for  party



politics.  I would regret very much indeed if  in  the



future   we  should  find  that  the  University   has



degenerated into a playing field for politicians.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Members of this House will be fully

aware  that  we  have  an  excellent  example  in   the

University of Rangoon. I have met professors from  that

University. I have met politicians



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2364</b></font><br><br>



who  came  from the University. The sad  fact  is  that

students in that University are running the government.

Sir,  I  say  this  under cover of  privilege  of  this

Assembly.  I do not wish it to be taken as  a  mark  of

disrespect  towards another country. Perhaps  it  is  a

custom which they are used to. But I say that we should

never  allow any university in this country  to  become

the back-seat driver of any politician. I will say that

we  should  never allow any university in this  country

also to become the playing field for any politician.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Any other speaker? Mr Yong, in reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if only the

Member  for Farrer Park had spoken earlier, before  the

Member  for  Anson  had  to say  his  piece  about  the

exchange  of  letters between him and the Principal  of

the  University of Malaya, Singapore Division:  on  the

one hand, he said there was a lack of moral courage  on

the  part of the Principal of the University and in the

next  moment he said he acknowledged that he had  moral

courage.  One  moment  this,  the  next  moment   that.

Sometimes we do not know what he talks about.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, on a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I have been grossly misrepresented by

the Minister. Is it fair? Is it in order?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Minister will give way now,

the   Member  for  Anson  can  say  how  he  has   been

misrepresented.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged, Sir, I think it was

in  1956,  Sir,  that  I appointed  this  gentleman  as

Chairman of the Malayanisation Commission. I had  great

pleasure to express in this House the gratitude of  the

Government  for his excellent job, which was  extremely

well  done. There is no question at all about it.  That

has  nothing to do with the fact, except that the  same

person is involved in the exchange of letters which  we

had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2365</b></font><br><br>



which is going to be tabled, and which the Minister can

read. The fact that the man showed moral courage  of  a

very  high order, intellectual integrity of a very high

order, and intellectual ability of a very high order on

one occasion does not necessarily mean he does not fail

in  lack of understanding of academic traditions  at  a

later stage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am glad he has given himself

away,  Sir,I think the Member for Anson, the  more  he

has to say, the more he gets involved, and the more  he

speaks  against himself. He is trying to  suggest  that

there should be academic freedom in the University. But

the  very fact that he is talking about it is just  the

opposite.  He  expects  the  Government  to  tell   the

University  what  to do. Where will there  be  academic

freedom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It is not true.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> He said so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> So, it is clear then, Sir, that all

this so-called fear of lack of academic freedom in  the

University  depends on how the man uses his words.  The

Government  has distinctly said, and it is so  in  this

Bill,  that  the  University is  to  be  an  autonomous

University  and that it would respect the  autonomy  of

the  institution.  That is why the Government  too  has

taken  the  precaution to see that the constitution  of

this Council is, as far as possible, left intact. There

would  only be three Government representatives on  the

Council  which has a membership of 20. I am  glad  that

the   Principal  of  the  Singapore  Division  of   the

University of Malaya showed his independence by telling

the  Member for Anson what he thought about  the  whole

matter, by stating that members of the University staff

may  do  what they like in accordance with the contract

which  the  particular serving member of the staff  has

with  the  University,  who are the  employers  of  the

staff.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> But -



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> There are no buts -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2366</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> There is -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Unless the Member for Anson wishes

to have big "buts".



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Me?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> But we as the Government are very

clear about the part which expatriates should play. Non-citizens are advised not to enter local politics. If it

is necessary to give an example - say, for example,  a

Singapore citizen wishes to go to Montreal to join  the

University  there. If he tried to poke fun at  politics

in  Canada, he would be given a walking certificate and

asked  to get out of the country. If he wants  to  take

part  in local politics, he should become a citizen  of

that  country, go in wholeheartedly, and not be a  bird

of  passage, expect to damage the country and then pack

up his bag and go away.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> That is right. That is what we do

not want of an expatriate.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It is not true.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The Member for Anson has suggested

that the University of Malaya would be happy to arrange

parties if the Prime Minister went to the University to

address  the  students, but that if  members  of  other

political Parties attempted to go in, they would not be

permitted to do so. This is not in accordance with  the

facts. Sir. The Member for Anson -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I said Mr Lim Ching Siong -



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The Member for Anson was invited to

a forum before the Anson by-election where he had a lot

to say.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> A lot of P.A.P.s!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> So why all this reference which

cannot be supported by facts?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2367</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I need not answer the query raised by the

Member for Tanglin about autonomy and academic freedom.

I think it is the first time that a University Bill has

the  word  "autonomous" written into it. So  it  is  an

improvement over the previous Ordinance under which the

present  University  of  Malaya  is  carrying  on.  The

Govermnent  respects the autonomy  of  the  University.

But,  of course, we would expect the University  to  be

responsible  enough to realise that it is  not  outside

the  law  of the State and that it has a responsibility

towards the -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> - the security of the State. That. I

think, is an important factor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to answer the Member for Farrer Park.

His  suggestion  is  that, as far  as  possible,  there

should  not  he any duplication of faculties.  This  is

something, I am sure, both Universities would  bear  in

mind, because it would mean competing for staff and  so

forth  which  will  not  be  healthy.  But  in  certain

respects, it  may  not be possible,  because  for  any

proper university to function it will have to offer its

Art  and  Science basic courses to students of its  own

territory.  There is the School of Agriculture  in  the

University  of Malaya at Kuala Lumpur, and  it  is  not

likely  that Singapore would establish its own separate

Faculty  of Agriculture. Singapore would send to  Kuala

Lumpur  those  students  who  would  like  to  take  up

agriculture. The same would apply to Engineering, which

faculty was transferred from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur.

For  some  time  to come, it would appear  that  we  in

Singapore  would have to look after students  from  the

Federation  who want to take up medicine. But  everyone

is aware that the Federation authorities are interested

in  establishing  a new Faculty of Medicine.  How  soon

they  can  do  it is a matter which they will  have  to

face.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the suggestion put forward by the Member

for  Farrer  Park  that perhaps the Vice-Chancellor  of

each University could sit in as a member of the Council

in  the other University. I wonder whether he is  aware

of the fact that there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2368</b></font><br><br>



is  provision in the Councils of both Universities  for

one  person to be appointed, say, in our case,  by  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Agong. There is similar  provision  in

the  new University of Malaya Act for one person to  be

appointed  by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.  But  in  the

past  it  used to be filled by the officials, generally

the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Education. I

think  the  Member  for Farrer Park has  a  good  point

there.  I  will discuss this matter with my counterpart

in  the  Federation Government that  perhaps  for  this

particular   provision  we  might  invite   the   Vice-Chancellor of each University to fill the post. I think

that is a matter for private negotiation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I should like to deal with the remarks passed

by the Member for Upper Serangoon. I find that he wants

to  belittle the fact that the University of  Singapore

is  something  established under the P.A.P.  Government

and  that  the P.A.P. Government is taking  credit  for

establishing this University. Well, that is a matter of

opinion, Sir, I do not think we are crowing over it. In

my  speech just now on the Second Reading of the  Bill,

all  I did was to trace the background history: how the

University  was  founded, how  it  broke  up  into  two

Divisions, and what would happen if we were  to  create

two  separate national Universities. Today the Bill  is

up  for Second Reading and, therefore, it is my duty to

present   facts  and  not  opinions  as  to  how   this

University of Singapore is to come into being. The hon.

Member lamented the fact that the Guild of Graduates of

the  University  of  Malaya has  been  split  into  two

bodies. Well, I do not see how otherwise it could  have

happened, because when there was one University, there

was  one  Guild  of Graduates; and when one  University

becomes  two  Universities, then the  two  Universities

would  have  to  share the number of graduates  amongst

themselves to form two separate bodies, because out  of

those two separate Guilds they would have to elect four

graduates (in our case, and I think it is high) to  the

new University of Malaya Council. I must say this, Sir.

That  this  is  yet  another step in  the  evolutionary

process which produces the new university, just like an

ordinary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2369</b></font><br><br>



cell  which  breaks  up and forms two  separate  cells,

fairly close. I think, in their upbringing, having  the

same  chromosomes as far as possible  and  showing  the

same,  shall  we  say,  potentialities.  We  hope  both

Universities  will have a great future when  they  come

into being in the near future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill.-[Mr Yong Nyuk Lin].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Which clause?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Clause 43.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir, you

will  notice that clause 43, sub-clause (3) states  the

conditions  which a teacher's contract should  contain,

and  a  teacher  is defined in the definition  part  as

including professors,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2370</b></font><br><br>



lecturers,  etc.  Sir, the misrepresentation  that  was

indulged in by the Minister for Education in regard  to

my  efforts  on  this Bill can now be clarified.  I  am

urging that provisions similar to those indicated there

about  the  terms  and  conditions  of  service  should

include the additional term that every teacher shall be

free  in his unfettered discretion to advise any person

or  organisation on matters within his special field of

competence, whether he is an expatriate or not.  It  is

not a question of telling the University what to do. It

is  a  question  of  making it quite clear  and  giving

constitutional  protection to the academic  staff  that

they  need  fear no P.A.P. reprisals if  they  exercise

their academic right in an extra curricula field within

the  limit  of  their competence, whether  there  is  a

political connotation or not. It is a sad reflection on

Singapore, Sir, that though we have here academic staff

who can advise us, we have to employ and pay not merely

expatriates, but expatriates in other areas,  in  order

to  give  us advice on matters which our own University

professors could do and do well. I ask that my  request

should  not  be  treated in a spirit of antagonism  and

distortion.  It  should  be  recognised  as   being   a

legitimate request for the protection of the staff.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I see no reason

at  all  to  accept the suggestion put forward  by  the

Member  for Anson to make any change to sub-clause  (3)

of clause 43, Part VII, General Provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the Joint Government - University

Committee  of  seven included the Chairman,  who  is  a

member  of  the Council, i.e., Dr Gwee Ah Leng, three

from   the  Government  represented  by  the  Permanent Secretaries  of  Education.  Treasury  and  the   legal draftsman  from  the  State Advocate-General's  Office, three   from   the  University  of  Malaya.   SingaporeDivision,  represented by the Chairman of the  Council, i.e.,   Dr  Tay  Teck  Eng,  the  Principal   of   the

University's Singapore Division, i.e., Dr Sreenivasan,

and the representative of the Senate. Professor of Law.

i.e., Professor Sheridan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also earlier on I indicated in my speech that the

draft Bill had been submitted to the Divisional Senate,

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2371</b></font><br><br>



people who are involved in this, and there had been  no

protest.  All  the major suggestions, if  any,  I  have

already incorporated in this draft Bill and the  people

who  matter have not protested over this so-called lack

of  academic freedom, which is just in the mind of  the

Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the fact that they

said  nothing - does that mean that my  request  is  not

legitimate? Sir, because a Bill is presented to  us  by

the   State   Advocate-General,  who  is   a   man   of

considerable legal acumen, therefore it must be correct

in  every form and this Assembly should not look at  it

nor  should  it  amend  it,  and  every  amendment   is

unreasonable. Is that the logic of the Minister?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given to this House two clear examples of

intimidation in the academic field. I am prepared  that

the  matter  should  be referred  to  a  commission  of

inquiry. I know how frightened they are of commissions.

The question is this: is this a reasonable request?  Is

the  provision  I seek for the protection  of  academic

freedom  reasonable? Is there anything unreasonable  in

the  suggestion that every teacher shall be free in his

unfettered   discretion  to  advise   any   person   or

organisation  on  matters within his special  field  of

competence,  whether such teacher be an  expatriate  or

not? Is there anything unreasonable in that?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, what is unreasonable is the

context  in which this request is made. We have nothing

against  expatriates  in  their  exercise  of  academic

freedom,  but I have gone to great lengths  to  explain

that  this is a case where expatriate members join  the

political arena. They should not do so, both  in  their

own  interests and in the interests of the  University.

We  do  not  want to see members of the academic  staff

embroiled   in   political  fights  either   with   the

Government or any political Party. It will not  do  the

staff  any good, and it will not do the University  any

good. This is a simple proposition, Sir, which I put to

the Member for Anson. Yet he has deliberately chosen to

evade the issue.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2372</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is fortunate that

we are in Committee and I can answer. The gentleman who

has just risen, who I understand is a -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister for Finance.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Forgive me, Sir. Minister for Finance,

statistician promoted. He asks what is the  context.  I

take the context of Prof. Sheridan, Dean of the Faculty

of  Law,  who  within his special field  of  competence

advised a Member of this Assembly on his constitutional

rights. He did not enter the political arena. He did  a

perfectly  proper  act.  He  is  an  expatriate,   Sir.

Nevertheless  it  has  not  been  denied  what  I  have

indirectly  learnt, that he came in for - to  my  mind - gross  criticism  from  the Government  to  the  extent

which,  I  understand, has decided  him  to  leave  the

University. A man who has been of considerable value to

the University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance says it is a matter of

coming  into  the  political  arena.  Where  was   that

question "coming into the political arena"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue was a professor who is a Professor

of Literature. He was speaking within his special field

of competence. The letter that lie received will be one

of  the  hallmarks  of disgrace, a thing  of  which  no

civilised  government  could be anything  but  ashamed.

They  ask,  where  is the political  intimidation?  For

their  own  good  they should not interfere.  They  are

adult  professors, Sir, perhaps a lot more mature  than

the Minister for Finance, and as adults they should  be

left  free to choose what is good for them and what  is

in  accordance with their responsibility and their duty

to  the University. I am not limiting this issue to the

political   sphere.   I  say  it  is   important   that

expatriates as well as local staff should feel free  to

advise  or  refrain from advising in  their  discretion

without  outside  influence, without  any  intimidation

from the Government. We have heard from the Member  for

Hong  Lim  that this Government, when it could  get  an

expatriate  who  was  on  the  academic  staff  of  the

University to stand on its platform, utilised him.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2373</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> He was not an expatriate.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That was not answered.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Well, the Member for Anson heard

the   answer.  The  answer  was  that  that  particular

professor is a Singapore citizen.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Ah, thank you, Sir. He became a

Singapore citizen, did he? Very interesting! I am sorry

to indulge in personalities.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us go back to the essential principle. Surely

the principle itself is one which every decent person

can accept, that the academic staff should feel secure

in acting in a manner totally in conformity with

academic traditions in giving or refraining from giving

advice, and particularly that they should be conscious

of a sense of responsibility in advising on matters of

national interest when these are within their field of

competence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance said that I had not answered him.

I trust he is now wiser.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question I

posed to the Member for Anson is simple. Does he accept

the principle that a non-citizen, an expatriate, should

not interfere in local political affairs?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think we are just straying from the

point. I think the point is whether or not the term  of

service  suggested by the Member for  Anson  should  be

written into the constitution. That is the point, is it

not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson

knows  quite  well  that  it  is  essential  that   the

University should be autonomous and that there must  be

some meaning to the word "autonomy". You cannot have an

autonomous  body which does not have any  control  over

what  its own employees do. If the University wants  to

maintain itself as an autonomous body and does not want

to get embroiled in political disputes in Singapore, it

has the right to maintain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2374</b></font><br><br>



that autonomy and it also has the right to control  the

activities of its employees. Mr Speaker, Sir, we  must

leave it to the University to set those limits. Who are

we  to write in these provisions saying that University

employees  are free to do as they please  within  their

intellectual competence? If we as legislators try to do

that,  Sir, I say that we will be derogating  from  the

autonomy of the University. Surely the Member for Anson

understands that.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The argument of the Minister is

delightful.  So if we tell them that they have  freedom

we  are limiting their freedom. That is the argument of

the  Minister. It is particularly interesting to me  to

learn  from the lips of the Minister that, in fact,  he

expects  the  University to discipline its members  and

control   their   extra   curricula   activities.   Any

University  that  seeks  to  do  that  ceases  to  have

academic freedom. Let us recognise, Sir, when he  says,

"Who are we to intervene in this autonomy?", that I was

speaking of our Prime Minister, his own leader and  his

own  Government  who interfered - and interfered,  to  my

mind,  in the most improper fashion - in respect  of  the

conduct  of two Professors of the University.  Who  are

the "we"? They are the P.A.P., Sir, and it is them from

whom  I  seek  to  protect the academic  staff  of  the

University.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already

said  that  in  drawing up this Bill we have  tried  to

maintain practically the same constitution under  which

the  University of Malaya was carrying on, and this  is

so. The present clause 42(3) is practically a word-for-word  transcription  of section 57(3)  of  the  present

constitution of the University of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the Member for Anson who keeps on saying

that   it  is  a  reasonable  amendment  that   he   is

suggesting,  I say that it is an unnecessary  amendment

which we can ignore, because insofar as the persons are

concerned.    Professor    Enright    and     Professor

Sheridan - assuming that the Member for Anson is  correct

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- that happened long ago. Professor Sheridan was one of

the  members to draw up this draft Bill. He  went  into

the  Senate only two to three months ago and no one  in

the Senate raised this point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2375</b></font><br><br>



They are quite happy with the present constitution, and

so  is the Government. The same provisions are in  this

Bill  which  we are now asking this House to  pass  and

not, as suggested, with an amendment by the Member  for

Anson.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think we must press on unless the

Member for Anson is very short.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes, it is very short. It is merely

this.  It  is  true  that  it is  similar  to  previous

provisions.  Previous provisions have  been  proved  by

subsequent  experience  to  be  inadequate.  I  am  now

seeking to fill a lacuna that has been proved to exist,

which is dangerous.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Part VIII. Any comments on Part VIII

recommendation that this Bill be proceeded with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of the Bill is to amend certain sections of

the  Private  Lotteries Ordinance so as  to  facilitate

administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 4 of the principal Ordinance provides that the

Minister may, at his discretion, grant a permit to  any

person  or  society  for  the promotion  of  a  private

lottery.  He may also withdraw a permit so  granted  or

vary  any  conditions imposed. At present, the  appeal

lies to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara from any decision of

the Minister. It is now proposed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2376</b></font><br><br>



that  the power of the Minister in regard to the  grant

of  permits and that of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  in

regard   to  appeals  under  this  section  should   be

transferred  to the Commissioner of Estate  Duties  and

the  Minister  for  Finance respectively.  It  is  also

proposed that the powers of the Minister under  section

3,  5, 6, and 16 of the principal Ordinance should  now

be transferred to the Commissioner of Estate Duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7 of the principal Ordinance is repealed and

is  replaced  by clause 5 of the Bill which  prescribes

the  rates of duty on private lotteries and regularises

the  present  method of calculating  the  total  amount

accruing from the operation of fruit machines  for  the

purpose  of charging duty. Discretion is given  to  the

Commissioner  of  Estate Duties  when  calculating  the

duty  payable  to  allow deduction for sums  previously

paid out by the clubs to winners of jackpots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 of the Bill empowers the Minister to

authorise the Commissioner to prescribe forms  for  the

purposes of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 of the Bill empowers the Minister to exempt

social  welfare organisations in receipt of  Government

grants  from  the  payment of tax on private  lotteries

sponsored by them for charitable purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr Byrne):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read

a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2377</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court at

present  derives  from the jurisdiction  and  authority

conferred  on  it by the Colonial Courts  of  Admiralty

Act,  1890,  by virtue of section 17(c) of  the  Courts

Ordinance  (Chapter  3). Section 17(c)  of  the  Courts

Ordinance  confers on the High Court  the  jurisdiction

and  authority of the Colonial Court of Admiralty.  The

Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890, in effect makes

the  High Court in Singapore a Court of Admiralty  with

the  like  jurisdiction over the like places,  persons,

matters  and  things as the High Court  in  England  in

Admiralty matters and where in any English Act relating

to  the  Admiralty jurisdiction of the  High  Court  in

England  reference is made to England and Wales,  there

shall be substituted the name of the British possession

concerned when such Act is applied to a Colonial  Court

of Admiralty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as Singapore is concerned, the Admiralty

jurisdiction  of  the  High  Court  is  the   Admiralty

jurisdiction of the English High Court as it  stood  in

1890.  We have therefore to look at the law as it stood

in  England in these matters before 1890 in relation to

the  maritime matters dealt with in this Bill. Most  of

these  provisions have, in fact, been consolidated  and

re-enacted  in  section  22 of  the  Supreme  Court  of

Judicature  (Consolidation) Act. 1925, but the  Act  of

1925   does   not  apply  to  Singapore  although   its

provisions in the matters relating to the present  Bill

are similar to those which are contained in the English

Acts  prior to 1890, which are the Admiralty Court Act,

1840, and the Admiralty Court Act, 1861.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1956 the Administration of Justice Act, 1956, was

enacted  in  the  United Kingdom  in  order  to  enable

ratification  of  three  international  Conventions  on

maritime  law signed at Brussels in 1952, to which  the

United Kingdom was a party. These Conventions were :-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The International Convention on certain rules

concerning Civil Jurisdiction in Matters of Collision;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The International Convention for the Unification

of  Certain  Rules  relating to Penal  Jurisdiction  in

Matters  of Collision or other Incidents of Navigation;

and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The International Convention relating to the

Arrest of Seagoing ships.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2378</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Convention relating to Civil Jurisdiction

seeks  to unify the law as regards the places in  which

the  plaintiff may initiate proceedings in the case  of

any collision between ships and limits the jurisdiction

of  any  State  in  this field. The  Second  Convention

relating  to  Penal Jurisdiction in cases of  collision

seeks  to  prevent penal or disciplinary  action  being

taken  against the Master or crew of any seagoing  ship

except    before   the   judicial   or   administrative

authorities  of  the  State whose  flag  the  ship  was

flying.  The  adoption  of  this  convention  did   not

necessitate  any amendment to English law  because  the

United  Kingdom have made a reservation empowering  the

taking  of  penal or disciplinary action if  the  State

whose  flag  the  ship  was  flying  consents  to  such

proceedings being taken in the United Kingdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third Convention relating to the Arrest of

Seagoing   ships   seeks   to   produce   international

uniformity in the law relating to the arrest of a  ship

to  secure a claim. This Convention calls for amendment

of  English law to permit not only the ship in  respect

of  which the claims arose to be arrested but also  any

other  ship  which was under the same  ownership.  This

Convention  necessitated the majority of the amendments

included   in   the  1956  Act.  The   more   important

amendments,   apart  from  the  outstanding   provision

permitting the arrest of "sister" ships, are:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The right to arrest a ship where the ship was a

passive cause.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The interpreter has signaled that

the Minister is going a bit too fast.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, this is a very technical

Bill, and a lot of technical phrases are being used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Convention, that is the third

Convention  relating to the Arrest of  Seagoing  ships,

necessitated the majority of the amendments included in

the 1956 Act. The more important amendments, apart from

the  outstanding provisions permitting  the  arrest  of

"sister" ships, are:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The right to arrest a ship where the ship was a

passive  cause.  For example, where a  stevedore  falls

down the hold of a ship;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2379</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To enable a mortgage to arrest a foreign ship.

Formerly this could not be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question has arisen whether these Conventions

should  be  extended to Singapore. The Master Attendant

and Local Shipping and Shipowners' Association favoured

extension  of  these Conventions to  Singapore  on  the

ground  that Singapore should, as a major port,  follow

international maritime practice, and that it  would  be

in  the  interest of local shipping for this Government

to  adopt the same attitude to these Conventions as the

Government of the United Kingdom. This Bill accordingly

is  designed  to bring the law in Singapore  into  line

with  the  provisions of Part I of the  United  Kingdom

Administration of Justice Act, 1956, in order to enable

the  extension  of these Conventions to Singapore, and

has  been  cleared with the Hon. the Chief Justice  and

the  Singapore Bar Committee since the matters affected

by  this Bill relate to the jurisdiction of High  Court

in admiralty matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will deal with the main clauses of

the  Bill  now. Clause 3 (1) (c) seeks to provide  that

the  High  Court shall have jurisdiction  to  hear  and

determine a claim in respect of a mortgage or a  charge

on any ship or a share therein. Under existing law this

jurisdiction  is limited to claims where  the  ship  in

question  is already under arrest by a process  of  the

court  or where the proceeds of sale thereof have  been

brought  into court or to claims where the mortgage  is

already registered under the Merchant Shipping Acts  as

provided  in  sections 3 and 11 of the Admiralty  Court

Act,  1861. This clause removes the requirement that  a

ship  must already be under arrest before the  mortgage

can  bring  an  action before the High Court.  It  also

renders  unnecessary the alternative  requirement  that

the  mortgage  must  be registered under  the  Merchant

Shipping Acts before action can be brought. Section  22

(a)   (ix)   of   the  Supreme  Court   of   Judicature

(Consolidation)  Act,  1925, similarly  provides   for

jurisdiction  in respect of any claim in respect  of  a

mortgage  of any ship being a mortgage duly  registered

in accordance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2380</b></font><br><br>



with the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Acts or in

respect  of  any mortgage of a ship which  is,  or  the

proceeds  thereof are under the arrest  of  the  court.

This  Act, of course, as I have said earlier  does  not

apply to Singapore, but the provisions of the Admiralty

Court  Act,  1861,  to which I have  already  referred,

contain  substantially the same provisions. The English

Administration of Justice Act, 1956, on which this Bill

is  modelled, has already made the amendments  referred

to in clause 3 (1) (c). I need hardly say that that the

English  Act  of 1956 does not apply to Singapore,  and

that is the reason why this Bill is before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 35 of the Admiralty Court Act, 1861, provides

that   jurisdiction   may  be   exercised   either   by

proceedings  in  rem or by proceedings in  personam  in

respect  of  Admiralty claims dealt with in  that  Act.

Clause 4 of this Bill provides similarly in respect  of

such claims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 (1) (f) seeks to provide that the High Court

shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any claim

for  loss of life or personal injury caused by any ship

or  occurring in connection with the operation  of  any

ship.  The  English Acts before 1890  made  no  similar

provision  for  such  claims to  be  determined  in  an

Admiralty action -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The same signal has come through.

I  do  not  know whether the Hon. Minister has supplied

copies of his speech to the Interpreters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No, I did not.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps the Minister will speak a little

slowly.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  on  a  point of  clarification.  I  was

listening  to the Malay interpretation and I think  the

interpreter  is ahead of the Minister! And surely  they

have copies.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The signal actually came from the Tamil

interpreter. Perhaps the Minister will speak  a  little

slower.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Clause 3 (1) (f) seeks to provide that the

High   Court  shall  have  jurisdiction  to  hear   and

determine any claim for loss of life or personal injury



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2381</b></font><br><br>



caused by any ship or occurring in connection with  the

operation  of  any ship. The English Acts  before  1890

made  no  similar  provision  for  such  claims  to  be

determined in an Admiralty action, and only the  common

law  remedies lay against the responsible  parties.  In

England,  however,  the  Act  of  1925  expressly  made

provision  for  the High Court in England  to  exercise

Admiralty jurisdiction in respect of claims for loss of

life  or personal injuries. As this Act does not  apply

to  us,  there is no similar statutory provision  which

applies  to  Singapore. This clause 3(1) (f)  makes  it

clear  that the High Court can hear and determine  such

claims by virtue of its Admiralty jurisdiction,  and  a

claim  can proceed either in personam or, as  clause  4

provides,  in rem in cases where the person responsible

is  the  owner, character, or in possession or  control

and  was,  at  the  time  the action  is  brought,  the

beneficial owner of that ship or any other ship. In the

case  of  his owning not the ship involved but  another

ship,  an  action in rem could be invoked  against  the

latter. Thus even where a ship is the passive cause  it

can  be  arrested  if  the person responsible  for  the

injury  is its sole beneficial owner. This is in clause

4(4).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 (1) (g) of this Bill seeks to provide for

jurisdiction  in respect of any claim for  loss  of  or

damage to goods carried in a ship, and clause 3 (1) (h)

seeks to provide or claims arising out of any agreement

relating to the carriage of goods in a ship or  to  the

use  or  hire of a ship. The existing law contained  in

section  6  of the Admiralty Court Act, 1861,  provides

for  jurisdiction in respect of claims for damage  done

to goods carried in a ship by negligence, misconduct or

any breach of duty or breach of contract on the part of

the owner, master or crew of the ship, unless the court

is satisfied that at the time of the institution of the

proceedings any owner or part-owner is domiciled within

the  jurisdiction. Section 22 (a) (xii) of the 1925 Act

makes a similar provision. Thus both in England and  in

Singapore  no such claims as these could be pursued  if

the owner or part-owner of the ship concerned possessed

a  domicile within the jurisdiction. Paragraphs (g) and

(h)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2382</b></font><br><br>



of  clause  3  (1) seek to remove this  restriction  in

order to conform to the Convention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 (1) (l) seeks to provide jurisdiction in

respect  of  any claim relating to goods  or  materials

supplied  to  a ship for her operation or  maintenance.

Under  section 5 of the Admiralty Court Act, 1861,  the

High  Court  in  Singapore  has  jurisdiction  only  in

respect of a claim for necessaries supplied to  a  ship

elsewhere  than in the port to which the ship  belongs,

and  even  in such a case a claim cannot be pursued  if

the court is satisfied that the owner or part-owner  of

the  ship  is domiciled within the jurisdiction.  These

restrictions  are  sought  to  be  removed  to   enable

conformity with the Convention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 (1) (m) seeks to provide jurisdiction in

respect  of  any  claim relating to  the  construction,

repair or equipment of a ship or dock charges or  dues.

Under  the existing law contained in section 4  of  the

Admiralty   Court  Act,  1861,  such  jurisdiction   is

possessed only if at the time of the institution of the

proceedings the ship in question is under arrest of the

court.  Section 22 (a) (x) of the 1925 Act  contains  a

similar  provision.  This restriction,  that  the  ship

concerned  is  already under arrest, is  sought  to  be

removed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 (1) (p) provides for jurisdiction in respect

of  any  claim  arising out of an act which  is  or  is

claimed to be a general average act. This provision has

no  precursor in the existing law, nor did the  Act  of

1925  contain  such  a provision Only  the  common  law

remedies relating to carriage of goods by sea applied -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Another signal from the Chinese

Interpreter  this  time. I would suggest  that  if  the

Minister  is  making  a prepared statement,  he  should

supply  the  Interpreters  with  copies  so  that   the

interpretation    could   easily   flow    from    the

Interpreters. Perhaps the Minister could  go  a  little

slower.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Clause 3 (1) (p) provides for jurisdiction

in  respect of any claim arising out of an act which is

or is claimed to be a general average act. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2383</b></font><br><br>



provision has no precursor in the existing law, nor did

the  Act  of  1925 contain such a provision.  Only  the

common  law remedies relating to the carriage of  goods

by sea applied whereby competing interests in the ship,

in  freight and in cargo were liable proportionately in

a  general  average contribution for losses arising  in

consequence  of  extraordinary sacrifices  or  expenses

incurred  for the preservation of the several interests

involved. A shipowner, however, has a lien on the cargo

for  its contribution in general average, but the owner

of  the  cargo  in  a  ship has no corresponding  right

against  a  ship where he is a creditor  in  a  General

Average  Adjustment. The third Convention provides  for

any  claim in respect of a general average act to be  a

maritime claim which can be pursued against a ship, and

this  paragraph gives effect accordingly  in  order  to

comply with the Convention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 prescribes the manner in which Admiralty

jurisdiction may be exercised and limits the action  in

rem to conform to the Arrest Convention. Sub-clause (4)

of  this  clause provides that in certain cases  claims

are  enforceable  against "sister ships", i.e.,  ships

held under the same ownership as the ship in connection

with  which the claim arose. The sister ship  principle

will  allow foreign "sister ships" to be arrested  here

in  the  same  way as our ships can now be arrested  in

foreign ports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 provides that the court may not entertain

actions  in person am on claims arising from  collision

between ships unless:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(a) the defendant has his habitual residence or a

place  of  business within the State of Singapore;

or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the cause of action arose within inland

waters  or  within  the  limits  of  a  port   in

Singapore; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) an action arising out of the same incident

is  proceeding in court or has already been  heard

and determined in court.'



<br><br>Notwithstanding   non-compliance   with    the    above

requirements, the court will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2384</b></font><br><br>



also  have jurisdiction where the defendant submits  to

the jurisdiction of the court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 removes the restriction on claims for wages

by  the  Master  or  the crew of a  ship  by  repealing

section  91  of  the  Merchant  Shipping  Ordinance  to

conform to the Arrest Convention. Section 91 at present

provides that suits shall not be instituted in the High

Court  by a seaman for wages not exceeding $500  except

(a) where the owner of a ship is bankrupt, or (b) where

the  ship  is  under arrest, or (c) where the  District

Court  refers the claim to the High Court, or (d) where

neither  the  owner nor the Master  is  or  resides  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 excludes jurisdiction in cases falling within

the  Rhine Navigation Convention as the United  Kingdom

is not a party to that Convention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 repeals provisions inconsistent with the

three  Conventions signed at Brussels or which are  re-enacted  in the preceding clauses of this Bill. Section

480  of the Merchant Shipping Ordinance, which provides

for  the  detention of foreign ships found  within  our

territorial waters in respect of damage caused  to  the

property of British subjects in any part of the  world,

is  sought to be repealed in order to comply  with  the

Conventions. Provision is also made for section 17  (c)

of  the  Courts Ordinance, which confers  the  existing

Admiralty  jurisdiction on the High Court, to  be  read

subject  to  the provisions of this Bill.  Furthermore,

this  clause also provides that no proceedings  in  rem

may  be instituted against the Crown nor may any  ship,

aircraft cargo or other property belonging to the Crown

be arrested, detained or sold.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 9 preserves causes of action arising

before the coming into operation of the Bill.

<div align="center"><b>SAND QUARRIES BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Tan Kia Gan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to control sand quarries

so that they may be operated in a manner which will not

create a nuisance or cause damage to an adjoining area.

During sand operations, liquid waste is discharged into

streams which drain the area, causing them to be silted

and  blocked up. The blockage of the streams  leads  to

flooding  which  causes  damage  to  the  farmers   and

villagers  living  around  the  area  where  there  are

concentrations  of  sand deposits.  These  farmers  and

rural  folks have repeatedly complained of  the  losses

they have suffered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flooding has been particularly extensive after a heavy

rain, and while the Government has taken remedial steps

in  the  past to de-silt the drains, the nuisance  will

recur unless proper steps are taken to ensure that  the

operations  are conducted in a satisfactory manner.  It

would  be  unfair to expect public funds to be utilised

for  remedial measures solely for the benefit of  these

operators, but, at the same time, Government  does  not

wish  to prohibit sand quarrying operations since  sand

is an essential



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2386</b></font><br><br>



material  to  keep  the building  industry  going.  The

proper remedy, therefore, is to permit the quarrying to

operate  under  conditions that can  be  satisfactorily

controlled.  It  may be as well for me  to  inform  the

House that complaints from farmers have been coming  in

year  after year. Over the last few years, such  floods

have caused damage to farmers which could be valued  at

thousands of dollars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far back as 1958, the Rural Board has caused action

to  be taken under the Municipal Ordinance, and notices

were  served on the sand operators to require  them  to

abate  the  nuisance. As a result of this  action,  the

sand operators contributed a sum of $5,200 towards  the

cost  of de-silting. Despite the effort to de-silt  and

clear  the  drains and streams, flooding in such  areas

recurred  again in 1959 and 1960. On investigation,  it

was revealed that the flooding was caused by the drains

and  canals  being choked up with waste from  the  sand

quarries.  The Government then took steps to clear  the

Sungei  Api Api and a 60-foot wide canal at  Pasir  Ris

was  constructed. This work, however,  proved  abortive

and the canal was chocked up again after a short time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sand operations have been going on in many places in

Singapore  for  some years, the principal  areas  being

Tampines, Changi and Bedok. Activities for the last few

years  have been concentrated at Tampines. In an effort

to  secure  the co-operation of the sand operators,  so

that  their method for the production of sand will  not

destroy  the livelihood of the farmers in the  Tampines

area, the operators were invited by my Ministry in June

this year for discussion, the purpose being to agree on

acceptable   steps  to  be  taken  and  for   necessary

precautionary  measures laid down by the  Public  Works

Department  and the Health authorities to  be  complied

with  to  prevent silt from flooding the common  drains

and  streams. The sand operators agreed that they would

comply  with  the requirements of the authorities,  and

that  they  would  compensate  any  farmer  for  losses

suffered as a result of sand operations. The quantum of

such  losses  for  damage would be  determined  on  the

adjudication



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2387</b></font><br><br>



of  a  three-man committee, consisting of the  farmers'

representative, the sand operators' representative  and

a Ministry official.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent further damage to the property of

the  farmers, steps were taken to obtain an  injunction

from  the  High Court to restrain these sand  operators

temporarily until satisfactory arrangements were  made.

The sand operators also voluntarily agreed to a payment

pro  rata among themselves of a sum amounting  to  some

$20,000  as contributions towards the cost of desilting

the   drains.  On  the  assurance  given  by  the  sand

operators  to  abide by the requirements, the  farmers

were  temporarily appeased and no steps were  taken  to

apply  to  the  High  Court  for  continuance  of   the

injunction   when  it  expired  on  31st  July,   1961.

Following  the  resumption  of  sand  operations,  some

operators  have  of  late begun to  fall  down  on  the

undertaking they had given that adequate measures would

be   taken  to  prevent  nuisance  or  damage.  It  is,

therefore,  necessary, if all the Government's  efforts

were not to be nullified and the whole issue opened  up

afresh  time  and  again, that  legislation  should  be

introduced  to  ensure  proper  control  of  operations

before  further  damage takes place or  serious  health

hazards  arise.  There are areas in  Changi  and  Bedok

where  sand excavations have been going on in the past.

Here  again,  the farmers living in the  vicinity  have

made  complaints from Lime to time that the excavations

are   causing  damage  to  their  livestock  and  their

vegetable  crops,  and  polluting  their  health.   New

legislation  is  necessary because most  sand  quarries

stand  on land under private ownership over which there

is  no  satisfactory control under existing legislation

when  such  land is used for the purposes of  producing

sand.  In  view of the present activity in the building

trade,   which   is   likely  to  increase   with   the

implementation  of  Government's Four-Year  development

programme, the demand for sand will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2388</b></font><br><br>



continue  to  arise. Hence, there is  every  likelihood

that   the  sand  operators  will  step  up  production

activity  considerably, giving rise  possibly  to  more

damage to the surrounding areas and adversely affecting

the  farmers,  their livestock and  crops.  It  is  the

responsibility of my Ministry to take steps  to  ensure

that  the  sand operators work their pits on a properly

controlled basis so as not to create health problems or

flood or other nuisance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill before the House provides that after the

coming  into force of this Bill, it shall be an offence

for  anyone to operate a sand quarry without a licence.

The  grant or renewal of a licence will be given at the

discretion  of the licensing officer, who shall  impose

such  restrictions and conditions as are necessary  for

the  sand operations to be conducted on a proper basis.

To  ensure that such conditions are carried out,  there

is provision for the depositing of security so that, in

the  event  of failure on the part of the  licensee  to

provide  remedial measures, such work would be  carried

out  by the licensing officer who may then recover  the

cost of the work from the security deposited. The Bill

will   ensure  that  sand  digging  and  sand   washing

operations  shall not cause any nuisance or  damage  to

neighbouring lands and buildings. There are  provisions

to require that the licensee shall use only fresh water

for  his sand operations in view of the possibility  of

contamination of wells.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also provision to prevent the licensee from

interfering with the banks of rivers, streams of  water

courses  and  to give effect to the proper disposal  of

earth, dirt or other waste matter from the sand quarry.

In  the case of these used sand pits, provision is made

for  them to be fenced in and the necessary precautions

taken to prevent danger or damage to life or property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid any case of possible hardship in special

circumstances, the Minister will be empowered to exempt

any  sand quarry from all or any provisions in the Bill

when  necessary. There is also provision for appeal  to

the Minister in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2389</b></font><br><br>



event  of  any action to grant or refuse to  grant,  to

renew  or  to  suspend or revoke  any  licence  by  the

licensing officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Minister for National Development has

today  tabled this Bill. But before it was  brought  up

some  operators  of sand quarries had been  prosecuted,

and  so  the  minor operators are unable to  carry  out

their  work and business. On the other hand, all  along

the  farmers  who have suffered damage have  not  been

given compensation. Even in this Bill we do not see any

provision  for compensation to be made by the operators

to  the farmers in respect of the damage caused by such

operations.  It is not stated clearly that compensation

will be made accordingly. So, can we say that when this

Bill  is  passed  by this House, the interests  of  the

farmers and other vegetable gardeners will be protected

by it? I am very doubtful about this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to know whether this Bill will be able to

solve the shortage of sand in the building industry. At

present   the  building  industry  is  expanding   very

rapidly,  but the production of sand is  rather  slow.

There  is  a reduction in the production of sand.  Why?

Well,  this  has come about as a result of  the  action

taken  by the Minister for National Development.  So  I

must  tell this House that before this Bill was brought

up, the Minister for National Development had acted  in

accordance with some of the provisions in this Bill  by

prosecuting  some  operators of sand quarries.  As  the

Minister  himself  has  said,  in  June  this  year  an

injunction  was  applied  for  in  the  High  Court  of

Singapore  against certain operators of sand  quarries.

So we would like to know whether this Bill will be able

to  bring  about  something good for  the  farmers  and

workers,  and what it will do to the building  industry

in respect of sand production.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, never in the history of Singapore

have we heard of any shortage of sand in respect of the

building



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2390</b></font><br><br>



industry, lit is only recently, according  to  the

report of the Ministry of National Development, that we

have  this  shortage of sand. As a result,  some  1,000

workers  have  been  out of work. Now,  who  is  to  be

responsible  for  this?  I  think  the  main  blame  or

responsibility  should  be  put  on  the  Minister  for

National  Development for his dealings  with  the  sand

quarry   operators.   Actually   the   Tampines    area

contributes  90 per cent in respect of sand production.

Recently, because some operators have come to a stop in

their  business, some 4,000 workers dependent  on  such

operations  have  been out of work.  Some  sand  quarry

operators  just  carry  on their business  without  any

regard  to the interest of the farmers. As a result  of

this,  many drains have been choked, water cannot  flow

freely,  and  on rainy days there is flooding  in  this

area.  As a result of this situation about 100  farmers

in  this area had to suffer damages and losses. So they

went  to  their  representatives, i.e.,  the  Singapore

Rural Dwellers' Association, and asked them to complain

to  the  Minister for National Development in the  hope

that  the  said Minister would be able to  solve  their

problems and reduce the damage they were suffering. But

the  Minister for National Development, in dealing with

this matter, had, on the one hand, no knowledge of sand

quarry  operations,  and, on the other  hand,  did  not

consult  the dwellers concerned. He rashly  took  steps

without  giving consideration and warning to  the  sand

quarry  operators. So when these sand quarry operations

were  stopped for a month, some 1,000 workers dependent

on  such operations were put out of work. There  was  a

standstill  in the building industry, as  a  result  of

which  some building construction workers were put  out

of work as well. Lorry drivers engaged in carrying sand

were  also put out of work. So I say that this  trouble

has come about due to lack of experience on the part of

the Minister for National Development. We all know that

in   dealing  with  any  matter,  you  must  take  into

consideration  the interests of all parties  concerned.

You  must also know the true situation. Without knowing

the true



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2391</b></font><br><br>



situation,  it  is not right to act or  make  any  rash

decision.   Let  us  take,  for  example, these   sand

operations  again.  Before any  action  is  taken,  the

following points should be considered:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The 1,000 workers connected with sand quarry

operations  must be taken into consideration,  so  that

they  would not be confronted with the difficulties  of

unemployment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We must make sure against whom action is to be

taken. Action should not be taken against the farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Adequate consultation should take place between the

Government and the sand quarry workers' representatives

so that their interests could be well looked after.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Such action before it is taken and when it is taken

should  not  put a stop to the sand quarry  operations,

which would put the workers connected therewith out  of

work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I can safely say that, as a result of such actions

taken  by the Minister for National Development,  there

were  some  difficulties.  He  had  laid  down  certain

stringent  conditions in respect  of  the  sand  quarry

operations. As a result, minor operators are  not  able

to  carry on their business smoothly. So about  200  to

300  workers  are out of work or will be out  of  work.

Then  as  a  result of such stringent  regulations  and

conditions,  you  will  have major  operators  in  sand

quarries.  These people will then be able to monopolise

the trade and raise prices as they like.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It seems to me the hon. Member is

reading  something he cannot even read! I do  not  know

whether the hon. Member is making his own speech. But I

ask him to try and make a speech and not read too much.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): he price of sand has

been  raised  by  one-third and  consequently  building

costs  have  also  risen. The taxpayers  will  have  to

suffer in the end and so will the poor people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2392</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third aspect of the problem that I wish to touch

upon concerns the farmers whose interests have not been

protected  by  way  of  compensation.  This  unilateral

action  of  the  Minister for National Development  has

given rise to more difficulties with no actual solution

to  the real problem. The problem of sand shortage  has

not  been  solved;  the  unemployment  problem  of  the

workers  connected with this trade has not been solved;

the   farmers'  interests  have  not  been   adequately

protected. All these are to be answered by the Minister

for  National Development. In the meantime, in  dealing

with the matter, the Minister has disregarded the views

of his Parliamentary Secretary.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I have heard the lengthy speech  of  the

Member  for Pasir Panjang Without knowing what  he  was

talking about, because I could not catch the main point

in  his speech. I do not know whether he said that  our

Bill  is  detrimental to the farmers  or  to  the  sand

quarry operators. He has not made himself clear in this

respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for National Development has tabled this Bill with this main aim, and it has been clearly stated by him. We are trying to do our best and hope that Members opposite will give their valuable views in respect of this Bill so that it will be able to look after the interests of all. But it is a pity that the Members opposite - especially those in the Barisan Sosialis - oppose good and bad things at the same time.

They  do not seem to have any principle at all in  this

debate, as they do not try to put their valuable  views

across. For example, the Member concerned says that the

shortage of sand is unprecedented and he does not  know

the cause. We can tell him that this was not due to our

absentmindedness, but because we have had  very  little

rain  for  a long period. It was because of  this  that

sand  quarrying  was  affected, as  sand  quarrying  is

dependent on the supply of water. As a result of  this,

some workers connected with this work were affected and

we received



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2393</b></font><br><br>



a  lot  of complaints from these people in the Ministry

of National Development. On receipt of such complaints,

we investigated the cases and we found that the farmers

also  suffered  a  great  deal.  So  the  Minister  for

National Development thought fit to take proper  action

to  deal with this situation. Of course, in the  course

of this action, some inconvenience and difficulties may

have  been caused to sand quarrying operations. But  we

must  also  realise  that, in  view  of  the  expanding

building  industry,  we must not put  an  end  to  sand

quarry operations and that, on the other hand, we  must

also  look after the interest of the farmers.  That  is

why  we have this Bill which is in the interest of both

the  farmers and of the sand quarry operators. We  want

to  ensure  that sand quarry operations can be  carried

out  systematically  and orderly  without  causing  any

interference to the farmers' crops.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope that the Members opposite - especially those

in  the Barisan Sosialis - will not go against the  Bill

just  for the sake of going against it. They must  take

into  consideration the interest of the people and  put

across  their  views  accordingly.  They  can  make   a

contribution  to this Bill by telling us  how  to  deal

with the situation. But it would appear from the speech

of  the Member for Pasir Panjang that he did not  write

it himself. I do not know where he got the speech from,

because  it appears to me that he could not  even  read

his  speech  properly. We must try to say things  which

come from our hearts and we must not do otherwise.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the explanation of the Member for  Delta

seems  to  be all right on the surface, but  I  have  a

feeling  that  she  seems  to  want  to  represent  the

Minister for National Development. It seems that she is

more  qualified  than the Minister and  the  Government

should   appoint  her  as  the  Minister  for  National

Development.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the speech made by the

Member from the Barisan Sosialis, the Member for  Pasir

Panjang,  is not as absurd as it might seem. First,  he

wishes the interest of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2394</b></font><br><br>



farmers  to be protected. Then he wants to protect  the

interest of the sand quarry operators. Then he wants to

protect  the sand itself. Then he wants to protect  the

building operators. Then he wants to protect the lorry-drivers.  Then  he  wants to protect  all  the  workers

connected with the sand quarry operations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the face of it, Mr Speaker, Sir, quite a few of

them  seem  to me, anyway, to be conflicting  interests

which  you  cannot protect. Sir, I asked  my  colleague

sitting  on  my  left  which  particular  division  the

spokesman for the Barisan Sosialis represented.  I  was

told  that  he is the Member for Pasir Panjang.  So  on

that basis, Sir, it was quite a rational speech that he

made. What he is trying to persuade the Minister to  do

is  to  give  up the pits at Tampines and go  to  Pasir

Panjang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

principle,  I do not oppose this Bill. The  purpose  of

introducing it is to control sand-washing operations in

the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill, in fact, should have been introduced

in this House in the early part of 1960. If it had been

introduced then, then there would not have been so much

trouble about sand-washing operations in Singapore. But

the  Government paid no attention to the sufferings  of

the  people, and it completely ignored the opinions  of

Assemblymen.  As a result, places in sand quarries  are

always flooded when rain falls and people suffer a loss

of  their  domestic  animals and their  properties  are

damaged  for which they get no compensation.  Recently,

sand-washing operations had to come to a standstill and

quite a number of sand-workers lost their jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1959, I did ask the ex-Minister for National

Development to control sand-washing operations, and  he

did   send  some  members  of  the  Primary  Production

Department  to investigate; but nothing  was  done.  In

1960,  this matter was always brought up for discussion

in the Rural and Urban Services Advisory Committee, but

the  Government did nothing about it. At the  beginning

of  1961,  I wrote a memorandum to the present Minister

for National Development requesting him to license sand-washing operators but I received not a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2395</b></font><br><br>



word of reply from him. In the middle of 1961 - I was  a

P.A.P. Assemblyman then - I again wrote a memorandum to

him  criticising  him for ignoring  my  memorandum  and

delaying  a  settlement of the  problem,  and  I  again

received no reply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in page 3 of the Bill, clause 8 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No licence shall be granted unless the Licensing

Officer is satisfied that the use of the premises as  a

sand quarry will be unlikely -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to cause any nuisance or damage to occupants of

adjoining or neighbouring land or buildings;'.



<br><br>Sir,  damage caused by sand-washing is not always  near

the  sand  quarries. Damage can be caused to  a  person

living  one mile away. For example, Sir, if one  person

has a farm which is flooded because a stream is blocked

up by sediment washed down -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The Member for Changi has overlooked

paragraph (b) of the same clause - the point he is making

here - which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No licence shall be granted unless the Licensing

Officer is satisfied that the use of the premises as  a

sand quarry will be unlikely -

<br><div align="center">*     *     *</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to cause depreciation in the value or

amenity  of  adjoining  or  neighbouring  land  or

buildings;'.



<br><br>So  damage  to  adjoining  or  neighbouring  lands  and

buildings is also covered by this clause.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will come to

that. Sir, as I said, because the stream is blocked  up

by  sediment  washed down from sand-washing operations,

has  the Government thought that the farmer has a right

to claim for compensation? But we cannot see any clause

under which people can claim for compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in clauses 9 to 14, provision is made to prevent

flooding. But the provision is not positive. Also it is

inadequate. Sir, compensation must be given



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2396</b></font><br><br>



to  those  whose  property  and  domestic  animals  are

affected by sand-washing operations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot see any clause in the Bill where

farmers  or any person affected can claim compensation.

We  also  cannot see any clause in this Bill to protect

the  farmers.  I hope the Government will  see  to  it,

otherwise there will be much trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Delta talks about sand-washing

operations.  She  does  not know what  is  sand-washing

operation.  She  has  not even  seen  how  sand-washing

operation is carried out.



<br><br>6.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr   Speaker.  Sir,  the  Minister  has  very  clearly

explained the Sand Quarries Bill. I fully support  this

Bill because we know that anything we do must have  its

merits. Members of the Barisan Sosialis oppose this and

that,  but  they  have not put forward any  principles.

They  object for the sake of objecting, and the  Member

for Delta has touched on this very clearly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the speech of the Member for Pasir Panjang.

the  Member for Farrer Park has touched on it - that  the

first  part of his speech contradicts the latter  part.

If  he knows something about construction, he will  not

say  anything  like  that.  The  building  construction

industry  has been expanding over the past  few  years.

Let  me tell him that in the building industry not only

is  there  a shortage of sand and bricks, but there  is

also  a shortage of other building materials. Now, what

are the causes of the shortage of building materials?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I will not allow that, as we might

have   a   debate  on  building  materials.  Will   the

Parliamentary   Secretary  confine  himself   to   sand

quarries?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

just want to repeat what I have said just now - that as

regards  the question of compensation our Minister  has

said very clearly that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2397</b></font><br><br>



we have a committee comprising representatives from the

sand  quarries industry and officials from the Ministry

to discuss this. This is the proper way to go about it.

This  matters concerns the farmers and the sand  quarry

operators,  and  the  Ministry  officials  act  as   go

betweens to reconcile their differences. I am sure sand

production can be stepped up. I will be repeating  what

has been said, and therefore I will not touch on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am disappointed as regards the Assembly as it is

being made use of as a place where jokes are exchanged.

I  hope  that  Members from the Barisan  Sosialis  will

change their attitude towards debates. They should  not

take  the Assembly as a place where they can joke. This

is  my sincere hope and I hope that other Members  have

the same feeling.



<br><br>6.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I was not here just now during  part  of

the  debate.  But I heard my colleague the  Member  for

Changi  and also the Minister for National Development.

The   Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister   for

National  Development  said  that  we  in  the  Barisan

Sosialis were joking. This is wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sand Quarries Bill before us is a very important

Bill and deserves our close attention. In principle, we

do  not  oppose it. We do not say this Bill is bad.  We

just  want  to  give our opinion to the Government  and

point  out  that the Minister for National  Development

has  so  mishandled this question that a lot of  people

have  suffered. But the Parliamentary Secretary to  the

Minister   said   that  we  were   joking   and   being

lighthearted about it. He also touched on the  question

of  compensation. The Member for Changi has  said  that

there  is no provision in the Bill for compensation  to

be  paid  to  farmers  or others whose  properties  are

damaged  by  sand-washing  operations,  and  that   the

operators must compensate those who are affected.  This

is  what  we  are  concerned about - why  was  this  Bill

brought  up?  The reason is to protect the  welfare  of

those  affected  by  sand  quarry  operations.  If  the

Government  does not protect them, what is the  use  of

bringing up this Bill? If the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2398</b></font><br><br>



Bill cannot solve this problem, then it is useless.  If

there  is no provision for compensation, then  it  will

lead to trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that

the Government had formed a three-man committee to deal

with  the  problem of compensation.  That  was  a  good

constructive move. We do not oppose it. But what we are

concerned about is whether this three-man committee can

really   shoulder   this   task,   and   whether    its

recommendations  can have any effect at  all.  That  is

what  the Assembly should pay attention to. Let me tell

the Parliamentary Secretary this:



what   is   the  use  of  establishing  this  three-man

committee?  When  it  was established,  it  recommended

certain  conditions for compensation to those  affected

by  the sand-washing operations. But the sand operators

paid  no  heed  to  its decisions,  and  the  three-man

committee   had  not  enforced  compliance   with   its

decisions,  and  so no compensation  was  paid  to  the

farmers  affected.  From what  I  know,  the  three-man

committee  mentioned this to the Minister for  National

Development, and he summoned the sand operators to  his

Ministry to talk it over. But what was the result? Only

the Minister can now tell us whether the sand operators

did  turn up in his office or not. The final result was

that  the  sand operators paid no heed to the committee

and  did  not turn up at the Ministry. They  considered

the summons of the Minister as something insignificant.

This  shows how the three-man committee dealt with this

problem. It is a great disappointment. I believe  after

this  first failure, there will be successive  failures

in future. The reason is this: if there is no provision

in the Bill to provide for compensation to the farmers,

then  the  interests of the farmers  cannot  be  looked

into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary has said

just now that we oppose every Bill. This allegation  is

not true. We shall be happy if we can be of any use  or

help to the Government to resolve all difficulties  and

problems. We can assure them that we shall try our best

to  help  them  solve  all kinds  of  difficulties  and

problems,  and  that  they  should  not  consider   our

suggestions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2399</b></font><br><br>



meaningless  and  think  that we  are  only  trying  to

embarrass them by putting up such suggestions. That  is

a wrong attitude on their part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary has also

touched on the matter of building materials. I  do  not

want  to  touch  on  it. What I want  to  say  is  that

Government's policy in regard to sand quarrying is full

of  contradictions. We know that the  Work  Brigade  is

shouldering  the responsibility of sand quarrying.  The

usual method of sand quarrying is -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder if those details come

within  the  general principles of this  Bill.  We  are

discussing the general principles of this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): What I want to say

has  something to do with the principles of  the  Bill.

Members  of  the  Work Brigade are  carrying  out  sand

operations. The usual method of operation  is  to  make

use  of the water from the rivers, by drawing the water

into  the sand quarry to wash away certain sediment  to

get  the  sand.  The Minister has also said  that  some

wells should be dug in order to store the sediment. But

then  Government's action in this respect is a kind  of

mockery.  On  the one hand, the Government is  carrying

out  water rationing and, on the other hand, the  water

used  in  sand quarrying is pipe-water. I want to  know

from the Minister whether, according to his suggestion.

there  will be no damage or no bad effects as a  result

of  their making use of pipe-water to wash sand. I want

to  ask him whether this kind of operation will not  be

more  costly, using pipe-water rather than using  water

from a stream or river for sand operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sand Quarries Bill tabled by the Government in the

Assembly  today comes about only because  in  May  this

year  the Rural People's Association responded  to  the

Minister's   request   by  giving   their   views   and

suggestions  as to how to resolve the problem  of  sand

quarrying, which has caused much damage and  losses  to

the   farmers   in  the  affected  surrounding   areas.

Therefore, I want to ask the Minister whether in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2400</b></font><br><br>



drawing  up  this  Bill  he  has  consulted  the  Rural

People's  Association. I hope that in future, when  the

Government  deals  with this kind of problem,  it  will

consult all the people concerned. The Government should

consult  the  rural people's organisations  before  any

steps  are  taken. At the same time, I hope that  after

the  passage  of  this Bill, those people  and  farmers

living  in  the rural areas will, in fact,  have  their

interests safeguarded.

all when they made statements in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the Member for Changi, Sir. He wrote

this  note to me. Admittedly at that time I just became

the  Minister  for National Development. I  was  taking

over from the Member for Hong Lim. Later on he wrote to

me again. But this time I took notice of it. I think it

was  only a matter of one or two months. Then I did ask

him, Sir, to come and see me and discuss the matter.

to  see  me  to  discuss the details. Possibly  what  I

should  have  done,  as I have done on  many  occasions

after understanding the position in certain cases,  was

to  go  with him and have a look into these matters.  I

did this after representatives from the farmers saw me.

Sir, whenever we look for the Member for Changi, it  is

very  difficult to find him. I asked him to see me.  He

never  turned  up. I looked for him. He  could  not  be

found.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Special Branch!



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Well, they will probably use the

Special Branch!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the point about these three Assemblymen who

are living in the Tampines constituency. After repeated

discussions, I made many trips to Tampines, seeing the

sand  operators,  seeing  the farmers  themselves  from

house to house, and I came to the conclusion, from  the

mouths  of  the farmers themselves, that  they  had  no

faith in these three people who have been living there -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of clarification?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way. The

Minister is not giving way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, instead of wasting the time of

the  Assembly talking about the Barisan Assemblymen,  I

had  better  get  back  to the Bill.  Sir,  the  P.A.P.

Government has the welfare of the State, the  interests

of the farmers and justice at heart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sand Quarries Bill has been deigned to ensure that

the  sand  operators  may continue producing  sand  for

profit  and, at the same time, to provide the necessary

safeguards  and controls and prevent damage from  being

caused to the farmers and other rural folks as a result

of  the  sand operations. The complaints of  the  rural

folks,  the  farmers and the fishermen abut the  damage

that  they  had suffered because of the sand operations

are  of  long  standing, but the previous  Governments,

because  of vested interests or for reasons best  known

to  themselves, had not looked into the  grievances  of

the farmers.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Might I remind the Minister that

he is replying to the debate? Therefore, he cannot make

another  Second  Reading speech.  In  replying  to  the

debate,  he  must  answer  the  points  raised  by  the

speakers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2403</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> The complaints of these rural folks,

farmers  and fishermen were brought to the  Member  for

Hong  Lim when he was Minister, when he was responsible

for  rural matters. But again the farmers and the rural

people  received no redress. The sand operators carried

on  with their operations, doing more damage and making

themselves  a  nuisance. This resulted in  my  Ministry

taking  drastic action to apply for an injunction  from

the  High  Court  to stop them from carrying  out  sand

operations  that  would  cause  damage  to  the   rural

residents.  The Bill now before the House provides  all

the  necessary safeguards to ensure that damage to  the

farmers will be prevented or minimised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also intended that the regulations made under

the  provisions of this Bill will help the  farmers  to

establish  liability  for the damage  caused  to  their

property. Hitherto, it was not easy for the farmers  to

make  any  claim for compensation even though they  had

suffered  considerable  damage  as  a  result  of   the

flooding  caused by sand operators. It is  intended  to

seek  the assistance of the Legal Aid Bureau to provide

the farmers and rural folks with the necessary help  in

their  claims for compensation, should any damage arise

from sand operations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the further possibility of the

Government  doing the work of desilting and  recovering

the  cost of such work from the security deposit  which

must  be  put  down  by  the sand  operators  with  the

licensing  officer before a licence is issued.  In  the

event of the operators not abiding by the rules of  the

game,  it  will  be  possible  for  the  Government  to

withhold  their  licences  and  to  prevent  them  from

operating.  There have been occasions when  mischievous

operators have tried to frustrate Government's  attempt

to reach an amicable settlement between the farmers and

the  sand  opera, tors. These sand operators have  only

themselves to blame if their licences are suspended  or

revoked. If they play the game according to the  rules,

they  will  find that the Government is just and  fair.

But  if  they  think that they can  get  away  with  it

because   there   are  loop-holes   in   the   existing

legislation, they are sadly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2404</b></font><br><br>



mistaken,  for  the  Bill is specifically  designed  to

prevent  mischievous and mercenary sand operators  from

doing  harm  and damage to farmers and fishermen,, all

because of their selfish private motives. We are  aware

that  the farmers have not been able to obtain  justice

because  of their lack of acquaintance with the process

of law and also the intricacies of legal procedure. But

there  is  little  doubt that they understand  what  is

justice,  and can differentiate between what  is  right

and wrong. It is doubtful, however, because of the lack

of  evidence, whether compensation for damage that  has

been  done  previously  by the sand  operators  can  be

obtained from them. But the Government will continue to

pursue   this  matter  and  hope  that  the   three-man

committee who has been agreed between both farmers  and

sand   operators  will  be  able  to   come   to   some

satisfactory  finding. Mr Speaker, Sir, we  are  doing

this for the helpless farmers and fishermen who had for

years   suffered  at  the  hands  of  sand   operators,

landowners  and vested interests. For those  who  think

that  they  can  get  away  with  their  mischief,  the

Government will use whatever there is in its  power  as

provided  in  this  Bill to prevent them  from  causing

further damage and nuisance. To those who abide by  the

law  and ensure that, in seeking after profit they will

not  in  any  way  adversely affect  their  neighbours'

property,  the Bill provides a fair and  just  way  for

them to continue their occupation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole Assembly.
