<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>POST OFFICE SAVINGS BANK</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Renovation of headquarters)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  (a)  why the Post  office  Savings

Bank  spent  a substantial amount of  money  on  a

major  renovation of its headquarters at the  site

of the Registry of Vehicles, when the ROV site has

already been earmarked for urban renewal; and  (b)

whether  the Bank had obtained the concurrence  of

the  relevant authorities such as the Land Office,

Planning  Department,  Urban  Renewal  Department,

etc., before embarking on the renovation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1970 when the Post

Office   Savings  Bank  was  part  of  the  Postal

Department,   it  was  decided  to  renovate   its

headquarters at Middle Road. At that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>



time,  the  area  occupied by the Bank  was  about

6,000  sq. ft.  To  cope  with  the  Bank's  much

increased business, it was necessary to expand the

headquarters  premises  to  alleviate  congestion.

Plans  were  finalised and  funds  voted  for  the

project. At the end of 1970, the Bank was informed

that  the premises of the Registry of Vehicles  in

Middle  Road  were  earmarked for  re-development.

Attempts   were  made  to  look  for   alternative

accommodation   for   the   Bank   but    suitable

alternatives  could  not be found.  Since  it  was

considered  that the Bank's continued use  of  the

premises  at Middle Road would be consistent  with

an urban renewal site, the Bank discussed with the

Land  Office the question of the purchase  of  the

present building and site. In the discussions, the

Commissioner  of Lands indicated that  the  Bank's

purchase  of the site could only be considered  if

the  Bank  had  firm plans for the  building.  The

Commissioner  of Lands was advised  that  detailed

plans  would be submitted in due course  and  that

the Bank was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



of  the view the ROV complex at Middle Road  would

be  suitable for the permanent headquarters of the

Bank.  The Bank also stated it would be interested

in  bidding for the whole ROV site when the latter

was put up for re-development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st January, 1972, the Bank became a statutory

corporation and, as the need for accommodation was

very  acute,  the  Bank decided  to  proceed  with

renovation  of  the  existing  premises,  and  the

Public Works Department was appointed to plan  and

execute  the  project. The Bank  has  assured  the

Commissioner  of  Lands that it  does  not  intend

seeking   compensation   if   the   building    is

subsequently  demolished for  re-development.  The

Bank also reiterated its interest in making a  bid

for  the whole of the ROV site at Middle Road when

the   site   is  eventually  available   for   re-development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When completed, the renovation costing

approximately $266,000 will provide a  total  area

of  10,500  sq. ft. If the Bank had tried  in  the

open  market  to lease 10,500 sq. ft. of  office

space  it would have to pay at least $120,000  per

annum  in rental. The ROV site at Middle  Road  is

unlikely  to  be available for re-development  for

another  three years. On this basis, even  if  the

Bank's renovated building at Middle Road is pulled

down  for  re-development in  three  years'  time,

there would still be a saving of about $94,000  to

the  Bank  in  renovating these existing  premises

rather  than  renting similar space  on  the  open

market.

<br><br>2.37 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1001 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1001 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

(* The  same amendment also stood in the name  of Mr P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Sports Promotion Board, under

the  Ministry  of Social Affairs,  has  the  great

responsibility  of  promoting  sports.  In  recent

years, the NSPB has done a lot in this respect. We

have seen a lot of sports activities being carried

out  because  of its efforts. For instance,  under

the  auspices of NSPB last year, we conducted  the

first   soccer  competition  among   the   various

constituencies  and also a basketball  tournament.

All these had been very successfully organised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the NSPB still has much to do to further

improve  sports  activities.  Firstly,  since  the

responsibility of the NSPB is to promote and raise

the  standard of sports, it should go all out. For

instance, in badminton we were well known  in  the

past.  But our standards have fallen "10,000 feet"

down, and are still on the decline.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



Every  time  our  players took part  in  badminton

competitions, they scored Nil. And for  basketball

or  soccer matches too, the score was Nil;  if  it

was not a chicken's egg, then it was a duck's egg.

So  as  the  NSPB is the nerve centre  for  sports

promotion  and  as  the Government  has  allocated

large  sums of money for this purpose to make  our

next generation a rugged one, the NSPB should live

up to its name by not letting the people down, but

give   them  confidence  and  hope  that  it  will

succeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what has

the  NSPB done or achieved since its inception  to

raise the standard of sports. I regret to say that

it  has  done nothing. It seems that the NSPB  has

not  paid  enough attention to promote sports  and

games   in  the  last  two  years.  It  has   only

concentrated its attention on soccer.  It  appears

that  the  NSPB  has neglected  to  promote  other

sports  like badminton, basket-ball, volley  ball,

field and track events, judo, and others. If it is

so, I hope the Minister can rectify the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 1973 is undoubtedly an important year in our

sports history because the SEAP Games will be held

in  Singapore in September this year. In  addition

to playing our part as the host country, we should

also be able to ensure that our athletes put up  a

good   performance  in  order   to   qualify   for

participation  in these Games. I  would  therefore

like  to  ask the Minister whether he has  started

any intensive training courses for our athletes to

raise their standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter I wish to mention is that not

enough  publicity has been given to  these  Games.

And  very  little  has been  done  in  respect  of

promotion or readiness for the Games. I feel it is

not  enough to have just a few posters  pasted  at

the  back  of buses as advertisements. It  is  our

glory  that  these  Games  will  be  held  in  our

country.  So  the National Sports Promotion  Board

should  publicise early so as to enable our people

to  be aware of this important event and the  NSPB

should  also put in more effort to get the  people

to support the Games.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to give some suggestions to the

Minister   for  his  consideration.   Firstly,   a

magazine  should  be published  to  introduce  the

sportsmen  of the various countries who come  here

to  participate in the Games. Our local newspapers

can  also  do this. In this way, our athletes  and

sportsmen  will be better prepared. Secondly,  the

NSPB   should  prepare  in  advance  the   various

souvenirs,   gifts,  and  awards   depicting   our

national  characteristics so as  to  give  a  good

impression on the competitors from abroad. This is

also  one  way  to  promote tourism.  Thirdly,  we

should  publicise through Radio and TV the  sports

events.  In  this  way, we can inform  our  people

better.  At  the same time we should  prepare  our

athletes well so that they can win laurels for our

country in the Games.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

formation of the National Sports Promotion Board a

few years ago by the Ministry of Social Affairs is

commendable. As a result, I believe officials from

the  various  sports organisations have  organised

themselves  to promote sports in the Republic.  We

should  be proud that the SEAP games will be  held

in  Singapore  very  soon. We have  provided  many

facilities  to  promote  sports  in  the   various

fields. However, I am a little perturbed over  the

standard   of   our  sportsmen  in   international

competitions. I wonder what the Ministry is  doing

to  inject  new blood into the various  fields  of

sports.  It  is no use spending so much  money  in

providing  facilities  when  the  people  are  not

taking   advantage  of  them.  Sportsmen  do   not

directly  contribute  to the  Republic's  revenue.

Nevertheless, their achievement abroad is a morale

booster for our country. We have introduced family

planning  and  one of the reasons  is  to  achieve

quality  in  our society. Therefore, sports  as  a

social benefit should never be neglected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Minister to inject new blood

into our sports organisations. In this way we  can

bring  the standard of our sports to international

level.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



Every   encouragement  should  be  given  to   our

sportsmen, otherwise it will be very hard for them

to reach a high standard. This can be accomplished

to  a  great extent by offering incentives to  our

sportsmen,  such  as time-off and allowances.  For

example,  a  man  may  want  to  go  for  football

practice, but he may not do so because he  has  to

work  the  whole day. The result is that he  would

not be able to play football well. He might not be

able  even to kick the ball! They should  also  be

given training in international events.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps should also be taken to ensure that

discipline  is  maintained  among  our  sportsmen.

Sometime  ago the National Sports Promotion  Board

took  action  to  suspend  some  prominent  soccer

players  for  their bad conduct abroad.  I  wonder

whether  precautionary  measures  have  also  been

taken to prevent a recurrence of this nature among

all other sportsmen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the inter-constituency tournament in soccer

and basket-ball has to a certain extent provided a

change of scene for our sportsmen from the various

constituencies.  A  few  talented  sportsmen  were

selected to represent the State. I wonder  whether

competition  of this nature can be  organised  for

the other sports.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

since  I  will be speaking on the National  Sports

Promotion  Board under subhead 2027 of Head  1001,

for  which I have an amendment* , may I be  allowed to  speak now? If so, I will withdraw my amendment

when it comes up.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The  amendment, standing in the names of  Dr Tan  Eng  Liang  and  Tuan Haji  Mohd.  Ariff  Bin Suradi, reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) That the sum to be allocated for Head 1001 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2027.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Sembawang  has initiated some observation  on  the

role  of  the National Sports Promotion  Board.  I

would like to add some of my own observations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Sports Promotion Board was

officially formed on 1st February, 1971, with  the

primary objective of promoting all sports  in  the

Republic.  Besides  encouraging,  developing   and

promoting  sports for competition and recreational

purposes,  the  Board is also supposed  to  foster

research and studies in sports, physical education

and  to  train instructors. However, I  regret  to

suggest that since its inception the Board has not

achieved its prime objective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many in the sporting fields have observed and

complained that the NSPB has been obviously biased

towards  soccer. In this respect, I would like  to

ask the Minister for Social Affairs how much money

the NSPB has spent in promoting soccer as compared

to the other sports. I was surprised to learn from

many  members of the sporting public that the NSPB

is  often  referred  to  as the  "National  Soccer

Promotion Board."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this partial approach in favour of' the

Football Association of Singapore, the standard of

soccer  in our Republic has still some way to  go,

as  told  to me by many a previous expert. Another

interesting  feature is that  a  scratch  team  is

often  called the Singapore Selection team or  the

Singapore  Invitation team. It was  only  about  a

fortnight ago that I read in the newspapers that a

few   players  from  the  paying  spectators  were

requested,  just  before  the  match   began,   to

represent  Singapore in a soccer match  against  a

foreign  team. I think the Republic's name  should

be treated with greater respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soccer team also appears to be the privileged

national  team  in regard to overseas  travelling.

The  team had made about eight trips abroad during

the past year, although the Association has little

money. I was told that seven officials accompanied

the team of only 17 footballers to participate  in

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>



King's Cup tournament at Thailand. Of these  seven

officials, five were paid for by the NSPB.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard also from the Sports Parade programme

last  Friday  that the National Soccer  Team  will

make  an  extensive tour of Australia sometime  in

October/November this year after the  SEAP  Games.

This  is  arranged as an incentive  or  reward  to

perform   well  in  the  coming  Games.  I   would

therefore suggest that NSPB should look  into  the

probability  of arranging such trips or  "rewards"

for  other games, which 1 am sure may perform much

better  than  the soccer team in the  coming  SEAP

Games!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, some officials of the NSPB

have seized every opportunity to travel abroad for

no apparent good reason. Selection of officials to

lead  and  travel with certain national  teams  is

seldom  based  on  merit and  necessity.  I  would

therefore suggest that available public funds must

be spent wisely and fairly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me now, Sir, to shift the scene back to

Sports  House - the headquarters of the NSPB.  The

Medical  Unit, I understand, consists of  a  well-equipped  Sports Medical Department as well  as  a

Physiotherapy sub-unit. I would also like to  know

how  much money was spent to set up this Unit? How

many cases were treated for 1972, and whether  any

research papers were produced to help our  various

coaches  and  athletes? I was also told  that  the

medical  officer spends much more time  trying  to

promote sports than conducting research in  sports

medicine.  In  addition, the  physiotherapist  has

resigned due to the lack of work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker, Sir, that I would like

to  raise concerns the indiscriminate promotion of

inter-constituency   games,   which    was    also

previously  mentioned by the other Members.  While

the  good  objective of such promotion is welcomed

by  all,  proper and efficient planning should  be

exercised.  The  NSPB should not get  involved  in

organising age-group games. This group of students

is well catered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



for   by  the  schools  themselves.  Hence,   this

exercise  by NSPB is a duplication of  effort  and

taxes the young students to maximum capacity.  Our

national need is to look after the school  leavers

and  to  provide  healthy sporting activities  for

their  well-being. The Board can  therefore  spend

its  time  more  profitably if it seriously  looks

into this problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the above few observations, Sir, it appears

that  the  administration of the  NSPB  is  indeed

lacking in efficiency. There is completely no  co-ordination and rapport among the various  sections

and there appears to be also a lack of experienced

officials.  I  would therefore  suggest  that  the

whole  administration of the  NSPB  he  thoroughly

reorganised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is heartening to note that the Board has

received  much financial aid from the  commercial

sector, and that for 1971 alone the Board received

a grant of $400,000 from Singapore Pools (Private)

Ltd.  These  contributions and grants  from  well-wishers are meant to promote sports in general and

not  to  be so biasly confined to certain  sports.

Perhaps  the Finance Committee of the NSPB  should

spend  more  time  looking into a  fairer  way  of

apportioning funds, and should meet more regularly

to effect better control of expenditure and funds.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampung Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

suggestion  made by the National Sports  Promotion

Board   to   organise  inter-constituency   soccer

tournament with the object of promoting sports and

scouting talent in sports is a good one. This will

increase  the  standard of  soccer  in  Singapore,

which  seems to be on the decline. But,  Sir,  you

will  be disheartened to learn that at this moment

only 16 constituencies have organised sports clubs

which  have since been registered. Nine clubs  are

under consideration for registration, but the rest

have   not   submitted  their   applications   for

registration. Although the effort of the NSPB is a

good  one, nevertheless more than 50 per  cent  of

the constituencies have not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>



yet  made  any  applications for  registration.  I

believe   there  must  be  some  reason  why   the

constituencies have not responded to the call.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NSPB has so far only made suggestions, but it

has  made  no  real contribution  whatsoever.  For

instance,  in  some  constituencies  like  Kampung

Kembangan,  there  are  no  facilities   for   the

training  of  badminton,  especially  those   with

talent. The open badminton courts in the community

centres  are not suitable for players with talent.

These  players need to be trained in indoor courts

because  badminton competitions, whether  national

or international, are played in indoor courts. But

I  think  the  NSPB  can at least  make  a  useful

contribution  by  organising  group  training   in

badminton, and also other sports like soccer,  for

players  who  show promise. Although the  NSPB  is

biased   towards  soccer,  nevertheless,   in   my

constituency there is not a single football  field

in  which to play soccer. The public is prohibited

from  using  the  school playing  fields  for  any

sports  activities. Therefore,  I  hope  the  NSPB

will,  in addition to organising sports at  inter-constituency  level, also provide  facilities  for

the  training  of talented youths.  For  instance,

there  should  be facilities for the  training  of

soccer, swimming, badminton, etc.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may  1  join the chorus of four Members  who  have

spoken  about  the somewhat sad state  of  affairs

that  exists  in  the  sports world  in  Singapore

today.  I remember having risen here and said  the

same thing some six months ago, and to this day  I

am  sad  to  say  that there has been  no  visible

improvement in any particular game in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, six months ago, I called for the formation

of  a  Sports  Ministry and I have  not  forgotten

about  this  call. If the NSPB, as we  have  heard

earlier   on,  cannot  properly  carry   out   its

functions and responsibility expected of it,  then

scrap  it. Let us not continue to allow vast  sums

of money to go down the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>



"soccer drain". Soccer has risen to no heights. We

hope  it  will rise. But despite all  the  efforts

that have been put in, I think it still stays on a

pretty low plane.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to be fair in my comment. Over

the  last year or so the Government has, in  fact,

tried  to  promote sports in the  form  of  inter-constituency games, and it has definitely  aroused

more  interest and more participation from various

people   -sportsmen  and  athletes  -   throughout

Singapore.  But I think we have to  do  much  more

than  what  we have done. I would like  to  repeat

what has been said earlier by certain Members that

the  emphasis by the NSPB has been and still is  -

we hope never - lopsided. This lopsidedness is too

apparent  and  is  not  in  the  interest  of  the

sporting  world  in  Singapore.  Soccer  has  been

promoted  too much without any reasonable  result.

What about the other sports organisations? We have

yet  to  hear of the volley ball association,  for

example,   sending   its  team   for   competition

elsewhere. We have yet to hear of the NSPB  trying

to  promote the other sporting activities. Members

may   be   aware   that  at  the   recent   karate

competition, one member of the Singapore team  did

very  well,  and nobody has suggested sending  our

karate team for further training in Japan. I think

we  should  promote  our  national  teams.  Boxing

requires  to  be further promoted.  Table  tennis,

badminton,  even  swimming and  water  polo,  need

further promotion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In swimming, our boys and girls have been sent

overseas  through the main efforts  of  their  own

parents.  I  say  swimming has done  far  more  to

uplift the standard of Singapore sports than  many

other games.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> It has won us the most gold

medals  in the last SEAP games. And I am  sure  it

still  will. But we have not done enough.  Sir,  I

can  continue  rolling on.  But  let  me  come  to

specifics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest to the Minister concerned

that perhaps we should, at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



least  for a start, consider two matters and grant

special  consideration for our sportsmen. Firstly,

we should give time-off to our sportsmen for their

training.  Let us facilitate them.  Some  of  them

might be working in Jurong, and they have to  come

down for training at Fairer Park. They finish work

at  5  p.m. and they are expected to be at  Fairer

Park  at  5 p.m. I say, this is a bit too much.  I

can quote cases where they just cannot make it. In

the  end,  they  would probably drop  out  of  the

national team.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I am sure the various sports

associations  would appreciate it if the  Minister

can arrange with the Singapore Airlines, just like

the  arrangement by the Ministry of Education  for

special concession rates, to send our athletes  or

sportsmen   overseas  at  concession  rates.   The

Ministry of Education has arranged group tours  at

half-price. Why not do the same for our sportsmen?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

to  speak  as  I am provoked by the  very  sincere

though very vigorous arguments put forward by  the

Member for Kim Seng. From the impromptu utterances

in  this  House, one can actually sample the  true

feelings of the Members here. The Member  for  Kim

Seng  has  put  up  a  pretty  balanced  argument,

although  the  Member for River Valley's  argument

might  appear  to  be  lopsided.  Probably  it  is

because  he was an exponent in water polo  in  his

younger days. I hope he still is. But I would take

his  argument  very  seriously,  Sir,  because   I

believe  the Member for River Valley, as  well  as

the  Member  for  Kim  Seng, know  what  they  are

talking about because they were sportsmen before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we in Singapore are faced with a

rather  difficult situation in that our population

is not sufficiently sports conscious in as much as

they  are not sufficiently culture conscious  from

the arguments we heard yesterday. A solution might

well appear to be to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



broaden  the sports base. The best approach  would

be  to train our young students in the schools. It

is  indeed a very heartening sight nowadays, if we

drive around or near the locations of the schools,

to see young students sweating themselves, running

along  the  road and unfortunately,  at  the  same

time, breathing in rather polluted air.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to face the fact that our population

here  is  of  migrant stock. We carry  with  us  a

rather  different thinking on matters like sports.

Sir,  I remember that when I was a young lad,  any

extra-mural activities on my part, like trying  to

kick  a football in a back-lane, would always  end

up  with  a few strokes of the rotan at  the  most

tender part of my body. That was unfortunately the

opinion or idea of our older generation on sports.

Our  forefathers rather preferred us to spend more

time  digging  into  our books  than  going  round

kicking a ball, unfortunately, at the wrong  place

too  -  in  a backlane. The situation has  changed

now. We cannot afford to have a population digging

into  books  with  total  disregard  for  physical

fitness,   particularly  in  a  highly   urbanised

society as in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have the advantage of seeing a few highly

industrialised cities in this part of the world. I

find  that  the  population  there  has  a  rather

significant peculiarity in that they are small  in

build,  fair, and rather timid in nature. I  think

this  is  due to the fact that the country  is  so

highly urbanised that the people have got to  live

in  small houses. There is no chance for  them  to

stretch their muscles. The working rhythm and lack

of nourishment are contributing factors. And, most

important, they are not sports conscious. In  that

situation, I am afraid it is almost impossible  to

produce  good  sportsmen because  of  insufficient

facilities  for  the promotion of sports.  In  the

end, they produce a young generation who are small

built.  Sir, I mention this not with the intention

of  throwing any reflection on any Member in  this

House.  I  say that we have to accept what  nature

has  given us. But I think we can improve  on  our

physical make-up by better nourishment,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>



facilities for sports and exercise.  We  do

not  need  to  develop  ourselves  into  a  highly

urbanised  and  civilized society  but  with  soft

knees  and  soft elbows. We may have good  brains,

but  I  think  we  also need the muscles  and  the

stamina to make our brains work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Members have put forward very

positive arguments. In my younger days, I was only

a  second  grade  sportsman; I never  reached  the

first  team in the school. Probably I did  not  do

enough.  I do not wish to put the entire blame  on

my  generation.  But I feel that the  Members  who

have  spoken - I hope all Members in this House  -

can  be equally positive, physically, in promoting

sports  as they are vocal on that subject in  this

House.  I was rather impressed by the argument  of

the Member for Sembawang. This is a rare occasion,

Sir,  that  I agree with him. I believe that  when

credit  is  due, it must be readily given.  I  was

quite impressed by the rather balanced argument in

the  first  part  of his speech, but  disappointed

towards the end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Member for Sembawang stood up, I

recall  that  he had also on a few  occasions  got

himself  involved or perhaps someone else involved

him  in  some  kind of sports  -  I  do  not  know

whichever  way  it was. He was the leader  of  the

table  tennis team that toured Seoul, South Korea.

Am  I correct? Sir, before I go on I would like to

seek  clarification. If it is  not  true,  then  I

would  divert  the  subject. Did  the  Member  for

Sembawang lead a table tennis team to Seoul and  a

swimming team to Rangoon in Burma?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  this  is  quite irrelevant to  what  we  are

talking about.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, I am trying to prove my

point.  And  I hope Members can be equally  active

and  positive  in  their physical actions  towards

sports, as they are vocal or championing the cause

in this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,   the  Parliamentary  Secretary  is   talking

rubbish!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I seek

your  ruling on the last remark of the Member  for

Sembawang   as   to   whether   or   not   it   is

parliamentary?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You are swimming very close to the

danger line. Standing Order 47 (10) says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No reference shall be made to the conduct or

character of any Member or of any public  servant,

other than his conduct in his capacity as a Member

or as a public servant.'



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, I am just trying to seek

clarification. That is the lead for me to  develop

my  argument.  I  do not know why the  Member  for

Sembawang   is  so  self-conscious.  Probably   he

suspects that my argument would be leading in such

a  way  that it is not in his favour. Sir, I think

that  is prejudging. It may be a bouquet for  him.

May I be allowed to carry on?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Fong, are you making remarks

about him as a Member of Parliament?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Yes, Sir,It is a bouquet for

him.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Are you praising him?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, whichever way you want to

interpret  it,  I think I will leave  it  to  your

ruling.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would rather you stop referring

to  the  hon. Member for Sembawang, and  carry  on

with your speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Very well, Sir, if it pleases

you,  I  will put it this way. May I in  doing  so

repeat  what I have in my mind earlier,  and  that

is, that Members should be active and positive  in

their  approach  towards this  subject  physically

rather  than  merely  making  utterances  in  this

House.  I believe it is of no use if some  Members

of  Parliament headed some sports associations.  I

know  one  Member, Sir, who is involved  with  the

Boxing  Association and this Association is  doing

well.  They produce good boxers. But I cannot  see

the  logic that a certain Member of Parliament led

teams of, say, table tennis and swimming overseas,

when he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



himself did not in the first place contribute much

to  deserve those trips. Secondly, what  were  the

experiences of these two trips?



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the results of the matches, whether we

brought home duck's eggs or chicken's eggs as  one

Member referred to, I think is immaterial. The two

trips  should  be  sufficient  enough  to  provoke

anyone, including The Member in this House, to get

himself   involved  in  these  two   sports   more

seriously. What I intend to put forward is that it

has  become rather ridiculous and a mockery to the

sport  itself  a Member leading a sports  team  or

accompanying the team overseas, while  he  himself

knows  nothing about the sport. I used to  involve

myself in these two particular sports before,  but

I  felt  I could not positively contribute towards

the  sports and I declined a proposal made  to  me

several  years  ago,  to  head  a  certain  sports

association. I did not believe at that  time  that

my  involvement  in  that particular  association,

either  as  an  official or just to  lead  a  team

overseas, would do much good to that sport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should view this with a more balanced and

logical mind. Instead of merely catching on a trip

-  I  think  the  Members for Kim Seng  and  River

Valley  said  that trips were paid  for,  or  that

there  would be reward trips and so on, I  do  not

think  that  is  a good thing. Sir,  because  this

vacant  seat in the aeroplane could well be  given

to  a young sportsman who could be trained, rather

than sending someone who had never even touched  a

racket  or  a  bat, or even went  as  far  as  the

water's  edge.  I  do not know  how  we  can  make

ourselves answerable to the sports public that one

who  has  never involved himself in the sport  and

knew  nothing about it could get himself  involved

in heading an overseas trip for that sport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to listen to some arguments

afterwards  so that when I leave this  Chamber  at

the  end of this debate, I can walk away with some

fresh ideas



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



as  to  how  sports  can be promoted,  other  than

getting   a   few   well-known  personalities   to

accompany the sports team, because that is  surely

not the way to improve sports.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I think the

Parliamentary Secretary is talking something which

is  quite  irrelevant to what  we  are  discussing

here. I think we should have a fair view here.  We

are  talking  about how we are  going  to  promote

sports  more  effectively. But what  he  has  been

talking about is irrelevant. He is trying to  show

his   capability  that  he  was  a  second   grade

sportsman in his school days. He is trying to show

off  his ability. I wonder what he has in mind.  I

am a bit puzzled here. I regret very much.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I assure you, Sir, that I would

not  make your job any more difficult. I just want

to answer a few points. It was out of modesty that

I  regarded  myself  as a second  grade  sportsman

only,  never the first grade. That is  one  point,

Sir.  Secondly, had I been out of order, I believe

you  would have put me in my proper place earlier.

So I do not think there is the need for the Member

for  Sembawang  to take over the functions  of  Mr

Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  all have heard what you have  ruled.  So

what else is there to say?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I merely wish

to  clarify  the  stand of those  few  Members  of

Parliament  who  spoke  earlier.  They  were  only

trying  to constructively criticise the  NSPB.  We

would like to assure the Member for Stamford  that

each   of  us  in  our  own  field  could   easily

demonstrate  the particular sporting  organisation

that  we  are  attached to as  to  how  to  run  a

particular  sports association. I, for one,  would

like  to  assure  him  that, as  far  as  positive

contribution is concerned, I can suggest many ways

of  running a particular game or a few  sports.  I

think  it  has  been misunderstood. The  intention

here is to show cause as to why the NSPB should be

reorganised and in what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



areas. I have only given, in my particular case, a

few  examples showing why it is not completely  in

order.  Therefore, I am obviously putting  forward

criticisms  which I hope are constructive.  It  is

understood that whatever little good that you have

done,  the public will appreciate. So let  me,  on

behalf  of  those who merely take the  stand,  say

here that we are trying to tell what is wrong with

NSPB.   As  to  positive  contributions,   certain

Members are associated with certain sports, and so

on,  and  I  think  they will work  on  their  own

particular area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something basically wrong with NSPB in

its  major role to promote all forms of sports.  I

think  what we have all tried to say was  that  it

was  biased. It was also unnecessarily lacking  in

efficiency in certain areas as pointed out by some

of  us.  I think it was not meant to be a balanced

statement. It is obviously an unbalanced statement

to pin-point the areas which need improvement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, we are very fortunate to be able to  host

the  SEAP Games in our country for the first time.

When  preparing  for such an important  event,  we

have  to  be  very  careful in  dealing  with  the

various   problems.  The  Government   itself   is

actively engaged in planning the Games. This is  a

good  indication.  But  I have  some  doubts  here

which,   although  might  have  been  brought   up

already, still give rise to some confusion.  So  I

would like to bring them up for clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that in planning for the SEAP Games, the

National  Sports Promotion Board and the Singapore

National   Olympic  Council  seem  to  have   some

confusion    over   each   other's   duties    and

responsibilities. As we understand it, the NSPB is

the  official body for the promotion of sports and

is  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the

policy  of Government, for example, in respect  of

financing sports, provision of facilities for  the

various games, and in the welfare of sportsmen and

budgetting. All these are the responsibilities  of

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



NSPB.  I  think it should not directly control  or

intervene in the activities of the various  sports

associations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SNOC, however, consists of members from

various   sports  associations.  Each  member   is

responsible for the membership of his  own  sports

association.  That is why they should  play  their

part in the Council. Members of the SNOC should be

asked  by the NSPB to do something positive.  They

should  not  play a passive role. They should  act

under  instructions. From what  we  can  see,  the

various  sports  associations have been  receiving

certain  questions and queries from the NSPB.  But

they did not know whom to refer to. And when there

is a real problem to be solved, and they are given

specific  instructions and orders, all they  could

do is to pass the buck.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the Organising Committee of

the   Games,   there  is  a  so-called   Executive

Secretary and also a Secretary-General.  What  are

the  duties  and  responsibilities  of  these  two

posts?  How do you differentiate the two posts?  I

hope   the  Minister  concerned  can  give  us   a

satisfactory reply.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you very much for

giving me a chance to speak at last.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me tackle the Member for Sembawang. I

use  the word "tackle" in the context of sport.  I

will answer the Member in two parts, first on  the

NSPB, and then on the SEAP Games.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the establishment of the National Sports

Promotion  Board  two  years  ago,  it  has   been

actively engaged in promoting sports at all levels

and  in  supporting  the various  national  sports

organisations in realising new ideas  and  efforts

in  this  field of expanding endeavour. The  Board

has already taken root and started promisingly  in

evolving  a  national sports programme  through  a

network  of  sports  councils,  associations   and

clubs,   as   well   as  sports  secretaries   and

convenors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last two years much has already been

done  to promote competitive international sports.

But it must be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



recognised that it takes time and effort to  raise

the  standard of performance of our sportsmen  and

teams  to  the  level required to win  honours  in

international  competitions. The Board  could,  in

fact, create an impact in terms of performance  by

putting  all  the  means of the  Republic  at  the

disposal  of a relatively small number of champion

athletes  and to attempt to achieve victories  and

medals  by  their  prowess. Such  an  approach,  I

think,  will bring immediate results. But  in  the

long  run  it  will  not help to  raise  standards

because  of  the  lack of a broad base  of  sports

talent,   which  can  only  be  developed  through

systematic work and intense and dedicated training

on  the  part  of a large number of sportsmen  and

teams.  It  is indeed gratifying that  this  broad

framework  of participation in sports has  already

been  established and no doubt, Sir, we  will  see

better performance in sports in the near future.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, although the problem of developing

standards of excellence is an important one, it is

by   no   means  the  major  objective  in  sports

promotion.   Our   primary   objective   in    the

organisation  of  sports is not  just  to  produce

champions, but also to raise the general  physical

fitness of the population. The approach then is to

encourage more people, particularly our youths, to

take   up   sports  seriously  as  it   leads   to

improvement  of  the individual's body  and  mind,

character  and  capacity, which is  important  for

social peace and happiness, and for individual and

national productivity and progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for inter-constituency sports, Sir, which has

been  introduced  recently by the  Board,  it  has

demonstrated  very  clearly  the  principle   that

sports   activities,   properly   conceived    and

organised,  can  he  promoted effectively  at  the

constituency  level. This represents  a  breakaway

from  the  traditional concept of sports promotion

whose  major  effort  seems to  be  restricted  to

institutions like clubs and various community



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



agencies.  In  the past  year,  the  NSPB,

although  working  under  considerable  strain  of

manpower and finance, has successfully implemented

the  following:  the  inter-constituency  football

tournament, which most of us here know; the inter-constituency    basket-ball    tournament;    and,

incidentally, the Grand Prix, which is being  held

every  year  with popular support; and the  sports

festival,  Pesta Sukan. I think there is  no  need

for me to elaborate because most of the Members of

Parliament  were  present at the  Grand  Prix  and

other sports activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another thing which I would like to touch

upon is the sports facilities. We are conscious of

the  shortage of facilities in Singapore,  and  we

will  therefore provide better facilities for  the

people  of  Singapore  by improving  most  of  our

football  fields, tennis courts,  swimming  pools,

squash courts, football stadiums, athletic centres

and  so  on. At the present moment, we believe  we

have  the  best  maintained lot of facilities  for

Singaporeans.  Altogether, Sir,  we  have  at  the

moment  24 football fields, eight swimming  pools,

36 tennis courts, five squash courts, two athletic

centres,  besides the Jalan Besar and the  Kallang

football    stadia   which   are   available    to

Singaporeans at very low rentals. Perhaps  one  of

the  most difficult tasks devolved upon the  Board

is  the taking over of sports facilities from  the

former British bases. These facilities had  to  he

renovated   and   improved  upon,   and   a   huge

administrative  machinery had  to  be  established

very quickly to make the facilities available  for

public  use  and to run them. The Board  has  also

been  given  the responsibility of  maintaining  a

large  number  of sports facilities run  by  other

Government  departments. All  these  put  a  heavy

strain  on  the Board which has to maintain  these

facilities  and  run them on a  non-profit  making

basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have also produced a sports magazine.

This  was  launched  in October  1972.  With  this

production,  we  have provided  one  more  healthy

magazine  for our youths and sports lovers.  Since

its inception, the magazine has promoted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



sports consciousness, especially among our youths.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other activities of the NSPB are to assist in

all  major international sports organised  by  the

respective   associations   in   Singapore.    The

Commercial  Department sought  many  sponsorships,

big  and  small, from the private sector  for  the

respective associations. This included  a  sum  of

$38,000  for the Badminton Association to  prepare

them  for  the Thomas Cup tournament. The Research

Department assisted in conducting three  intensive

courses   in  athletics,  hockey  and  tennis.   A

comprehensive  gymnasium  for  weight  and   power

training was also provided for the first time  for

Singapore sportsmen. At the present moment,  under

the   auspices   of  the  Training  and   Research

Department, approximately 250 sportsmen  each  day

go   through   the   mill.  The  Sports   Medicine

Department   treated  more   than   600   national

sportsmen,  providing them with  more  than  4,500

treatments  during the year. The  Department  also

provided  medical  coverage for all  international

games.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding expansion, Sir, one of the priorities

of  the  NSPB  is  to  promote  "Sports  for  All"

programmes in Singapore. It is our belief that  in

order  to  prevent social ills and to improve  the

health  of our people, sports has a large part  to

play.   Moreover,  each  and  every   Singaporean,

including  the Member for Sembawang,  should  have

the  opportunity to take part in whatever physical

activities  he  may choose. The ingredients  of  a

"Sports   for   All"  programme  are   three-fold.

Firstly,  adequate facilities.  I  mentioned  this

just  now,  Sir,  and  it is our  contention  that

Singapore, as I have said, has far too few  public

amenities   for  sports  recreation.   So   urgent

attention   will  be  paid  to  the  priority   of

establishing   more  facilities   throughout   the

Republic.  Secondly,  improved  organisation   and

promotion. The NSPB is at the moment looking  into

how  we  can encompass all sports activities  from

primary to tertiary levels into one national breed

so  that  there  will  be planned  activities  for

Singaporeans from cradle to grave. Thirdly, sports

consciousness. This has not been given very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



much  attention in the past. It is  our  intention

that  people  should be educated into  the  belief

that  sports and recreation is good for them, good

for  their  families, good for the  community  and

good for the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans are afoot to further promote the ideal

through  the  public media as well as through  top

level  promotion of international sports. We  also

hope  that  the  Board will be able  in  the  near

future  to  introduce  a  scheme  of  fitness  and

performance test which can be promoted  throughout

the  Republic. It has also taken steps  to  ensure

that  training in all sports is carried out  on  a

professional and scientific basis, and it is hoped

that  more  professional  personnel  can  be  made

available  to  ensure the success of  the  various

training programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the SEAP Games. After the

Sixth SEAP Games which was held in Kuala Lumpur in

December  1971,  the  Singapore  National  Olympic

Council, in consultation with the National  Sports

Promotion    Board,   appointed   the   Organising

Committee of the Seventh SEAP Games which is to be

held  in  Singapore this year. This  Committee  is

responsible  to the SEAP Games Federation  Council

whose  President is my colleague, Mr E. W. Barker.

Like  the  Olympic  Council, it is  an  autonomous

organisation.  It does not conic under  Government

or  commercial control, but enjoys assistance from

both.  On 19th May, 1972, the Organising Committee

met for the first time and since then, the 12 Sub-Committees     looking    after     accommodation,

ceremonies,   decorations,   souvenirs,   finance,

medical  facilities, press and  public  relations,

programmes,   technical   facilities,    protocol,

reception  and  liaison,  security  and   traffic,

social  and  catering,  and  transport,  have  had

several   meetings  and  they   have   made   very

satisfactory  progress in staging the  Games  from

the  1st  to the 8th September. Arrangements  have

been    made   to   house   approximately    1,500

participants from the seven SEAP countries, namely

Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam

and Singapore, in four 4-point blocks in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



Games  Village,  which will be at Toa  Payoh.  The

flats  are expected to be ready in July this year,

and  the Singapore teams may make use of them from

the  1st  of August for their centralised training

or  final phase of training in preparation for the

Games.  Foreign teams are expected  at  the  Games

Village  on  30th  August. The  SEAP  Secretariat,

which  is  now housed in Sports House,  will  also

move  to the Games Village in August. Besides  the

shopping  complex,  which already  exists  in  Toa

Payoh, there will also be postal, telegraphic  and

banking facilities in the Games Village.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am pleased to inform the House that the

President  of  the  Republic  of  Singapore   will

officiate at the opening and closing ceremonies of

the Seventh SEAP Games. An elaborate and colourful

programme   is   being  planned  for   these   two

ceremonies  where school children will  give  mass

dance  and band displays. The bands from the Armed

Forces, Police, and People's Association will also

be  in  attendance. 5,000 members of our Vigilante

Corps  will  also put on a "flash  card"  display.

There  will  also  be the flame lighting  ceremony

which  will  be held at Mount Faber and  the  SEAP

Torch will be carried by our outstanding sportsmen

to the National Stadium for the opening ceremony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants from the seven SEAP countries will

participate  in 16 sports disciplines.  Athletics,

football  and  lawn tennis will  be  held  at  the

National  Stadium;  badminton,  boxing  and  sepak

takraw  at  the Singapore Badminton Hall;  basket-ball at Gay World; cycling at Farrer Park Athletic

Centre;  hockey  at Jalan Besar Stadium;  judo  at

Chung  Cheng High School; shooting at Mount Vernon

and  Rifle Range Road Ranges; swimming, water polo

and  diving  at  the new Toa Payoh swimming  pool,

which  will be ready by July; table tennis at  the

National Junior College; volley ball at Chung  Hwa

Girls' High School; weight-lifting at the People's

Theatre; and yachting in Katong, off Nallur Road.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of the National Stadium is

expected to be ready by June, and all other venues

will be brought up to international standards  for

the  hosting of the Games. Arrangements will  also

he  made  to provide first-aid facilities  at  all

Games venues. A medical centre will also be set up

at  the  Games Village, and we will also  purchase

equipment  to  perform dope  and  sex  tests.  All

participants  and officials will be provided  with

official   transport  and  buses   or   cars   for

practices, games and official functions. They will

be  provided with polaroid identification tags  to

enable them to travel free of charge on any of the

public  transport buses for the  duration  of  the

Games.  Special  buses for the  public  will  also

operate  to  as  many  of  the  Games  venues   as

possible.  The  Transport  Sub-Committee  is  also

looking into the possibility of providing a launch

service from Clifford Pier to the National Stadium

Complex.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides programmes for the various sports

disciplines,   which  will   be   published,   the

Organising  Committee  will  also  produce   daily

result sheets and a souvenir handbook. All results

of  games  will  be  channelled  to  the  National

Stadium  for computerisation. The National Stadium

will  also  be the official press centre  for  the

Games   and  from  there  telegraphic  and   telex

facilities will also be available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to publicity for the Games, 25

different   articles  have   appeared   in   local

newspapers concerning the SEAP Games in Singapore.

Besides   this,   the  Organising  Committee   has

produced  two colourful posters. These  have  been

distributed  to all primary and secondary  schools

in   Singapore,  Government  Ministries,  and  the

Olympic Committees of all the SEAP countries. More

advertising  of  the Games is  expected  from  May

onwards. Radio and Television Singapore will  give

at  least  an  hour's programme  for  each  sports

discipline. The commercial firms involved  in  the

Games  will also help to publicise. Souvenir coins

and  commemorative stamps will  also  be  on  sale

before the Games.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advertising, Sir, is a very expensive business,

and  we shall cut our coat according to the cloth.

If  possible, the Organising Committee will try to

produce  a  film on the Games. If there  has  been

little publicity thus far, the only excuse is lack

of finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has raised certain queries.

First,  may  I thank him for his good words  about

the  National Sports Promotion Board.  As  to  his

being  perturbed  about how the standards  of  our

sportsmen  compare internationally, I  can  assure

him  that there is no reason for him to be ashamed

of Singapore's performance in sports. With a small

population of only over two million and  the  lack

of  sufficient facilities, and the lack  of  space

among  other  things, we have not fared  badly  in

international  competitions. There  are  games  in

which other countries have done better than us but

there are games in which we shine. However, we  do

admit that with proper organisation, training  and

incentive, we can certainly raise the standard  of

Singapore in the international sporting world. But

this will necessarily take time. Surely you cannot

produce sportsmen or super-sportsmen in a day! One

of  the ways of going about the sports problem  is

to   acquire   a  broad  base  of  sportsmen   and

sportswomen  from which to select. In doing  this,

we  will  also achieve the dual object in that  we

would  at  the same time be enhancing the physical

health  and ruggedness of our youths at all levels

from primary schools to tertiary institutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member that if sports were to

flourish  there  is  a  need  for  sportsmen   and

sportswomen  to  be given adequate incentives  for

participation. In Western societies,  one  or  two

incentives  are provided in one way or the  other.

In the East European countries, the states provide

incentives  in  the  form  of  living  allowances,

housing,  and trips abroad. In our case, sportsmen

are  given  some incentives as follows: unrecorded

leave,  especially  for Government  employees,  to

enable  them to participate in the national  teams

(unrecorded leave up to a maximum of ten days  for

coaches,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>



referees  and  players, to be taken  up  with  the

Ministry   of   Finance);  subsidised  centralised

training for most sports and nominal allowance for

transport   and  nutrition  for  the  SEAP   Games

trainees;  free medical service for  all  national

sportsmen;    provision   of   scholarships    for

outstanding sportsmen who are students, and grants

of credits by the Ministry of Education for pupils

with extra-curricular activities in schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Sports Promotion Board has been

studying  the situation further and realises  that

the  present incentives are still inadequate. Some

of  the possible incentives which are being looked

into  are:  a scholarship scheme for all  national

sportsmen; free training of national sportsmen for

specific  careers  under  the  guidance   of   the

Sportsmen Welfare Council; free nutrition for  all

national  sportsmen and free transport  facilities

in connection with sports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed timely that the Member for Anson has

touched   on   the  question  of   discipline   of

sportsmen.  We instil in our sportsmen the  ideals

of  dedication, integrity and loyalty as  well  as

the  need  for proper sportsmanship. By comparison

with  other countries, it cannot be said that  our

sportsmen  and  sportswomen lack these  qualities.

However,   it   is   admitted   that   there   are

occasionally a few black sheep who stray away from

the   straight  and  narrow  path.  The   incident

mentioned  by  the Member was one  of  those  rare

instances, and the organisation concerned had  not

hesitated  to take drastic measures to  prevent  a

recurrence of such a situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also wants to know if, in addition to

soccer and basket-ball, it is intended to organise

competitions  of this nature for all other  sports

activities.  The  answer  is  that  this  is   the

ultimate  aim.  We have started  with  soccer  and

basket-ball. This year badminton, sepak takraw and

table  tennis will be added. Other games  will  be

added in the years to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the Member for River Valley,

Sir. He has made some very good observations and I

am  very glad that he has chosen to speak strongly

on the inadequacies of the National



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



Sports  Promotion  Board. His  timely  comment  is

welcomed  but it is obvious that he is unaware  of

the  background  concerning  sports  promotion  in

general, and the work of the Board, in particular.

It  is  agreed  that the NSPB should  promote  all

forms  of sports in the Republic. But I must  make

it clear that even this general philosophy must be

modified  to  suit  the  situation  obtaining   in

Singapore.  Firstly,  facilities  and   funds   at

present  are still very limited. Secondly,  people

in  Singapore  have  a  predilection  for  certain

sports and games. Thirdly, the Member is no  doubt

aware  that  there  are certain sports  and  games

which  we  are  not at a physical disadvantage  as

compared  to  others.  In this  regard  there  are

opposing  views to those expressed by the  Member:

that the approach to sports to attain standards of

excellence should be on a selection basis. In  the

Singapore  situation, we have not  really  adopted

such  a  selective  approach. We  have,  in  fact,

adhered very closely to the principle of promoting

all  sports in the Republic, although the  results

achieved  and the publicity received by them  will

depend  very  much  on  the effectiveness  of  the

organisations responsible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is certainly untrue to say that the NSPB has

been   promoting   only   one   or   two   sports,

particularly  soccer. For the information  of  the

House,  the Pesta Sukan in 1971 and 1972 had  over

30  different, sports with competitive programmes.

The NSPB has also assisted in the organisation  of

the Asian Cycling Championship and the Pan-Pacific

Karate Championship and other international sports

events, including the Grand Prix in Singapore. The

impression  that  soccer is  receiving  a  lot  of

attention  from the NSPB partly springs  from  the

fact  that  it is one of the few games which  have

been introduced into the inter-constituency sports

and  partly  because  of its popularity  with  the

sporting   public   in  Singapore.   Football   is

internationally  a  major sport.  We  cannot  deny

that,  and  the  need for it  to  be  revived  and

promoted  from  its position in the  doldrums  two

years ago was obvious. The NSPB was asked to take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



over the administration of football in a caretaker-capacity by the Football Association of Singapore,

and  the  Board  very  reluctantly  accepted  this

responsibility  because of the  critical  need  in

July  1971. The intention was that the Board would

do  this  for two to three years to set the  right

plans  and  finances for bringing  football  to  a

proper level in Singapore over the period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House may be pleased to know that the

standard  of  soccer has gone up many  times  over

since  the  NSPB became involved in its promotion.

The  national  team is now ranked  in  the  middle

order of the All-Asian national teams. It is hoped

that  in the foreseeable future, the Republic  can

emerge as one of the leading teams in Asia. It  is

also  noticeable that more and more people now  go

to   the   Jalan  Besar  stadium  to   watch   the

performance  of  our national team.  Despite  this

achievement, there is still much to be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to correct the erroneous

impression  the  Member had concerning  the  match

between   the   Football  Association  President's

Eleven  and a Japanese club team. It is  incorrect

for the Member to say that a few paying spectators

were  requested just before the match to represent

Singapore  in this match. To put the facts  right,

the  House may wish to know that the national team

was  not  involved  in this match.  Three  of  the

players  were  invited to play  for  the  Football

Association President's Eleven, and they were from

the   Farrer  Park  team,  which  was  the  inter-constituency  champion.  They  were   not   paying

spectators in any sense of the word.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On overseas trips for the soccer team, it is true

that the team did make eight trips overseas during

the past year. But this was in accordance with the

Asian football calendar. All expenses involved  in

travel were borne by the host nation which invited

us.  The NSPB did not put in a single cent. As for

the King's Cup tournament in Thailand, it is again

regretted  that  the Member was misinformed.  Only

six  officials accompanied the team. Four of them,

namely the manager, the assistant manager, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>



coach  and  the referee, were invited by Thailand,

according  to  the tournament regulations.  It  is

therefore untrue to say that the NSPB paid for the

expenses  of five of the officials. In  fact,  the

NSPB,  as I have said just now, is not financially

involved  at  all  with the  project.  The  entire

expenses  for these officials and the  17  players

were  borne  by  the  Thai  Football  Association.

Except for two officials whose expenses were  paid

by  the  FAS,  the entire expenses for  the  other

officials  and  players were  borne  by  the  Thai

Football Association. The Member should also  note

that  it  is the FAS, and not the NSPB,  which  is

planning a tour of Australia and New Zealand later

this  year for the soccer team, provided  it  does

reasonably well in the coming SEAP Games.  I  feel

that  this  is  an excellent incentive,  and  most

sports organisations should try to provide similar

incentives to their participants and endeavour  to

raise  funds  to  give Singapore's  sportsmen  the

needed experience in competition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the Member's question as to how much

money  the  NSPB had spent in promoting soccer  as

compared  to  other sports, I wish to  inform  the

House that a sum of $24,500 was spent by the Board

during the past year. Of this amount, $18,000  was

spent  on  the  organisation of inter-constituency

football tournaments which is a worthwhile project

and   one   that  helps  to  launch   the   inter-constituency  sports, which will be the  framework

for the promotion of sporting activities among the

people  at  grass-root  level.  Of  the  remaining

amount, $5,000 was given to the FAS for organising

the  Pesta  Sukan Football Tournament. The  amount

allotted to football was not unduly high  in  view

of  the popularity of the game. The Board allotted

$25,980   for  basketball,  $53,907  for  cycling,

$20,645  for  tennis, $14,500 for  school  sports,

$20,358  for  motor sports, $13,475  approximately

for  athletics  and $11,510 for  badminton.  Apart

from  these,  21  other sports, from  billiard  to

Chinese  chess, also received certain  allocations

in  varying amounts, depending of course on  their

financial position and their needs and activities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sports Medicine Unit of the NSPB was launched

in  June  1971. The Board has accepted  plans  for

development which are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stage 1 - an outpatient clinic to take care of

the national sportsmen;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stage 2 - a physiotherapy clinic to aid the

treatment of patients;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stage 3 - the provision of ancillary facilities,

such as laboratories and surgical facilities;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stage 4 - a centre for research into human

performance.



<br><br>This  format is originated because each stage will

cost  increasing sums of money. Up to-date, stages

1 and 2 are in progress. The department is limited

to   a   staff  of  two  - one  doctor   and   one

physiotherapist.  The  medical  officer  is   also

appointed   by  the  Board  to  be  the  assistant

director   in   charge  of  promotion,   research,

training, commercial development and publications.

A total of $42,893 has been spent on equipment for

the treatment of patients. Because of the lack  of

equipment and manpower, the primary purpose of the

Unit  is  to provide medical care for our national

sportsmen.  It  is  not possible  to  launch  into

sophisticated  research on  physical  performances

until more staff and equipment can be acquired. In

the  year 1972, as I said at the beginning  of  my

reply,  more  than  600  national  sportsmen  were

treated and 4,500 treatments, were prescribed  and

carried out. This does not take into consideration

the  number of patients treated during  the  Pesta

Sukan and other international games.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A research project is under-way to determine the

trend  of sports injuries in Singapore, and it  is

hoped that with added support from the Government,

the  Unit  will  in  future be  able  to  do  more

intensive physiological research to assist coaches

and  sportsmen. During the two years of existence,

the  NSPB  has found great difficulty  in  finding

senior personnel of the right calibre to run  both

the Sports Medicine and the Research, Planning and

Training units. Due to this, the present incumbent

who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>



is,   in  fact,  the  only  specialist  in  sports

medicine  in  Singapore is found to  be  the  most

suitable person to run both these units.  This  is

considered  to  be  an  ideal  arrangement  which,

besides  fitting in with the requirements  of  the

National  Sports Promotion Board,  will  also  cut

down expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to deal with the subject of inter-constituency sports in age group competitions. I

feel  that  the Board has achieved much in  inter-constituency sports which has been introduced  for

the  first  time in Singapore. From all points  of

view,  the  football  and basket-ball  tournaments

have   been   a  great  success.  The   Board   is

considering  the  implementation  of   age   group

competition to be incorporated into the concept of

inter-constituency sports. The reasons  are  many,

and some of the pertinent ones are as follows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Age group competition held in conjunction with

inter-constituency sports will bring about  social

integration. One of the shortcomings of our  urban

society  today is the wall which some of us  built

among ourselves. These artificial social walls can

be broken if children and parents are all involved

in  sports and games as a community endeavour.  ]t

is  important that the youths of Singapore  should

directly  identify themselves with the  activities

within their own constituencies. They must develop

a  sense  of identification and attachment towards

their   constituency.  Through   the   age   group

competition, it may be possible to bring  about  a

situation  in which people of all ages can  mingle

on  common ground and engage in meaningful  sports

activities.  Parents  can  play  alongside   their

children. In this way, more parents will  take  an

interest in the activities of their children. From

past  experience,  we feel that  the  standard  of

sports  is likely to improve if the youths of  our

country  are  given  added  incentives  and  added

opportunities outside the school environment. I am

sure  the Member for River Valley will agree  with

me  that his prowess in water polo goalkeeping was

developed  in  a  Pasir Panjang club  rather  than

direct training



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>



received from his school. This argument holds true

for   the   majority  of  our  top  sportsmen   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to allay the fears of the Member that

school   children  will  be  taxed  beyond   their

capacity  and that there will be a duplication  of

activities,  I  wish  to assure  him  that  future

planning  for  age  group  competitions  will   be

organised  in close liaison with the  Ministry  of

Education for the implementation of a scheme which

will   benefit  the  schools  as   well   as   the

constituency sports organisation. My Ministry  has

already   taken  note  of  the  difficulties   and

reservations expressed by a number of  Members  in

regard  to the lack of organisational capacity  in

their  constituencies in launching  this  project.

And  my  Ministry has since reviewed the  position

and  has  decided  that age group  competition  at

inter-constituency level will be implemented at  a

later stage, taking cognizance of the readiness of

the   various   constituencies  in   participating

meaningfully in this worthwhile project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the administration of the NSPB, it is

premature to prejudge its performance, since it is

only  two  years old. The staff of  the  NSPB  has

worked under terrific pressure and handicap  owing

to  the  lack of adequate manpower and finance.  I

need say nothing more about this organisation than

that   its   officials   have   shown   tremendous

dedication and initiative in their work.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  thank  the  Minister for  Social  Affairs  for

clearing away some of my erroneous statements. But

I  would  like to comment, in particular,  on  the

football  incident.  As I  said,  I  read  in  the

newspapers  about this incident and I  would  have

thought that the person in charge of the FAS,  who

is  also  an  official of the NSPB,  should  have,

without  any  hesitation,  clarified  this   point

straightaway  in the press. I keep saying  that  I

read it in the newspapers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the sporting public has read about this

incident  and  came  to  the  conclusion  as   was

reported in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>



newspapers. May I suggest that the NSPB or the FAS

should  correct  this erroneous statement  in  the

press immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to take this opportunity of

making a suggestion on the publicity for the  SEAP

Games.  My  personal view is that up  to  now  the

publicity is extremely limited. One only sees  the

SEAP  Games advertisement on the back of buses  of

one  bus  company out of the three bus  companies,

and also stickers on some official cars. Since  so

much  effort  has been put in by the various  sub-committees  to  make the Games a  success,  may  I

suggest  that without due and forceful  publicity,

the  Games may not be a success. Perhaps the  SIA,

like  other international airlines elsewhere  when

organising international games, can publicise  the

Games  by flying the SEAP Games flag on its  daily

flights  as  part of its campaign to attract  more

tourists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to suggest that it is not the

intention   of  our  exercise  here  to  criticise

unfairly the administration of the NSPB.  I  share

the  view  that the NSPB officials  may  be  under

undue  strain  and pressure. Sir, to  give  you  a

simple  illustration,  the  very  fact  that   one

medical  officer  is made to take  charge  of  two

units  is burdensome. On top of that, putting  him

in  charge of promotion, research, training and so

on,  is,  I think, humanly impossible. There  have

been a few complaints from sportsmen to the effect

that,  on arriving at the medical unit, they asked

for  the medical officer and were told that he was

entertaining  or  that  he  was  showing  somebody

around. For the good and efficient functioning  of

the  Sports Medicine Unit, and since the  Minister

has  correctly stated that the medical officer  is

the  only specialist on sports medicine,  then  he

should be strictly confined to this area of work.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all the three

suggestions  of  the Member have been  noted.  The

first   suggestion  has  been  rectified   by   my

clarification. The second suggestion is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>



being handled by the publicity subcommittee, and I

am  sure they will get in touch with SIA, to  look

into  the  details of the publicity. On the  third

suggestion, as I have said, it is so difficult  to

get  a person to take charge of the various posts.

At  the present moment, the medical officer is put

in  charge  of the various posts, as  a  temporary

measure. Later on, when we find a suitable person,

the  medical officer will then be relieved of  his

other duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now deal with the queries raised by

the  Member for Kampung Kembangan. The Member  has

expressed   the  need  for  more  facilities   for

sportsmen  in  the State. As I have said,  we  are

aware  of this. For his information, Sir,  on  the

completion  of  the  National  Sports  Complex  at

Kallang,  which  is  quite close  to  Geylang  and

Kampung   Kembangan,  swimming  pools  and   other

facilities  will be made available to the  people,

including    those    from    his    constituency.

Furthermore, the Housing and Development Board  is

planning  to build a swimming pool in  the  Katong

area  in  future, and this will be  an  additional

facility which the people in his constituency  can

enjoy.  However,  it  is  the  intention   of   my

Ministry,  in  conjunction with the Ministries  of

National  Development and Education, the  Planning

Department and the NSPB, to look into the  overall

requirements of sports facilities in Singapore  in

the near future.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the use of school facilities for

constituency  sports,  my  Ministry   is   working

closely with the Ministry of Education to see what

further  arrangements  can  be  made  for   school

facilities  to be used for this purpose.  However,

it  must  be  recognised that  there  are  certain

limitations  because of the afternoon sessions  in

most  schools,  which go on into the  evening.  In

this  regard, the Ministry of Education  has  been

most   accommodating  in  allowing   many   school

facilities  to  be  used by the constituencies  on

request. However, it is to be appreciated that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>



school facilities are now very extensively used by

the schools themselves. Therefore, it is sometimes

difficult to share such facilities since  priority

must  be  given  to school sports activities.  The

Member  can  rest  assured  that  there  is  close

liaison  between the Ministries of  Education  and

Social Affairs and the NSPB on this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many countries concerned with the promotion of

sports  for  their  entire  population  invariably

provide  large amounts of funds for the  provision

of  primary facilities which determine the success

or failure of sports programmes and activities. It

is no surprise therefore that in Singapore the top

three  teams  in  the inter-constituency  football

tournament  came from Farrer Park,  Pasir  Panjang

and   Sembawang,   where   more   facilities   are

available. The Government's involvement in  sports

promotion must be seen in relation to its  overall

effort  in  nation building, since  in  many  ways

physical fitness and sports contribute to national

wealth  and economic and material output. In  some

countries,  as much as 4 per cent of the  national

budget  is  put  aside for sports promotion.  East

Germany  is said to have spent about $900  million

over  the past four years to make the country more

sports  conscious and better equipped with  sports

facilities as a preparation for the Munich  Games,

and   the  results  spoke  for  themselves.   West

Germany,  which has a 15-year Golden Plan starting

in 1960, now spends about $1,700 million a year in

public  expenditure on only primary and  secondary

community  sports facilities. This  works  out  to

over  $40  per  capita.  In addition,  substantial

amounts of money are provided for the promotion of

leisure  and  competitive sports in  sports  clubs

throughout the federal and provincial states.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for more financial resources for the

promotion  of  sports  in Singapore  is  therefore

obvious.  I  would  like to urge  that  a  certain

percentage of the national budget be allocated for

sports promotion and for the development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>



of  primary  and  secondary  facilities  for

public  leisure  and competitive sports.  However,

despite   the   present   inadequacy   of   sports

facilities    at    constituency    level,     the

implementation  of  the inter-constituency  sports

project  could be carried out still  further  with

imaginative planning and close liaison with school

authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other Members have also raised many queries

which  are somewhat similar to those which I  have

already  explained, and I hope they are  satisfied

with what I have said.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, can I get an assurance

from  the  Minister  that he  will  look  into  my

suggestion  that SIA allows concession rates,  say

50  per  cent, for our top athletes going overseas

for international sports meets?



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> I am not in charge of SIA, but

I  will  raise the matter with those  who  are  in

charge.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Minister said in his reply that in  order  to

encourage players and representatives to represent

the  national  teams  in competitions,  permission

will  be granted to them to take unrecorded  leave

for  training in such activities. I wonder whether

the  Minister  concerned is aware that  there  are

some  national players who work in Singapore Pools

(Pte)  Ltd. When the national team requires  these

people  to  take part in centralised  training  in

preparation  for competitions, their  applications

to  the company for permission to leave the office

one  hour  earlier  were turned down  without  any

consideration. If a Government-owned  company  can

adopt  an  attitude like this, how can  we  expect

other  companies  in  the private  sector  to  co-operate by giving unrecorded leave or time off for

the promotion of sports?



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> I am afraid I am not aware of

this,  Sir, but if the Member could bring up  such

cases to me, I will certainly take action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just been informed by the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Culture, who is also

the President



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>



of the Singapore Amateur Cycling Association, that

SIA  is  already  allowing 50 per cent  concession

through  NSPB  to national teams participating  in

competitions abroad.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Minister has given a very detailed  and

clear  answer  to  the queries. He  has  taken,  I

think,  about one hour to answer all  of  them.  I

understand a lot of what he has said,  and  I  beg

leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Tay Boon Too -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 1001 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1005.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am

not moving, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1001 be

reduced  by  the whole sum in respect  of  subhead

1141.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would just like to know what progress has

been  made  by  the Muslim Religious Council  with

regard to special chartered flights to Mecca,  and

the  establishment  of  the  Pilgrimage  Fund  for

prospective pilgrims in Singapore. In his reply to

my  queries  last year the Minister  said,  and  I

quote Hansard, Vol. 31, col. 939:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I would like to thank the Member for Kampung

Kembangan  for his interest and concern  over  the

projects that he mentioned, which the Majlis Ugama

Islam  is  actively considering. The Majlis'  plan

is,  of course, intended to help Muslims in  their

pilgrimage to Mecca.'



<br><br>But,  Sir, up to-date the Muslim Religious Council

has made no progress with regard to both projects.

I read a statement in the press made by the former

President of the Muslim Religious Council that the

plan  for  chartered flights had to  be  cancelled

because  there  was no response  from  prospective

pilgrims.  I am ashamed that a statutory  body  of

the  Government  could not  carry  out  the  plan,

whereas   pilgrim   brokers   had   succeeded   in

organising    special   chartered   flights    for

prospective pilgrims in Singapore. Although these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



pilgrim   brokers  had  succeeded  in   organising

chartered  flights to Mecca, I am of  the  opinion

that  the  question of the welfare of the pilgrims

in  Singapore with regard to their trips,  whether

by sea or air, is the responsibility of the Muslim

Religious Council of Singapore because it  is  the

body  which  is  supposed to be in charge  of  the

interest  and  the  welfare  of  the  Muslims   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there are two or three pilgrim brokers

who  organise these special chartered flights  and

they  exploit the prospective pilgrims  for  their

own interest. I have received many complaints from

prospective  pilgrims on all kinds of exploitation

by  these  brokers.  I quote  the  Minister  again

[Hansard Vol. 31, col. 940]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Member will be pleased to know that the

arrangement    for    pilgrimage    through    the

establishment  of  Tabong Haji or  the  Pilgrimage

Fund  will  include the provision of  welfare  and

health   facilities  for  pilgrims  during   their

sojourn   in   Mecca,  Medina  and   Jeddah.   The

Pilgrimage Committee is considering the  provision

of medical facilities, including the services of a

doctor and a nurse for the pilgrims when they  are

in  Mecca.  The provision of a welfare officer  to

look into the welfare aspects of the pilgrims  and

the  services of a reputable pilgrim  broker,  and

matters such as the offering of special gifts  and

life insurance, etc., are also being looked into.'



<br><br>But to-date, both projects have not been heard of.

I  am  still hoping that the two projects will  be

implemented. If not, next year I will again  raise

this  matter and will continue to do so until  the

two projects are implemented.



<br><br><!-- Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to seek

clarification from the Minister for Social Affairs

with  regard  to the task and responsibilities  of

the  Muslim Religious Council and with  regard  to

the welfare of Muslims in the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, the Muslim Religious Council was set

up  to  take charge of the welfare of Singaporeans

who  are  Muslims, but I regret to note that  this

Council  has  not  performed  its  function  well,

especially  with  regard  to  the  management   of

religious schools in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>



Singapore.  The Muslim Religious Council  has  not

yet   taken  over  the  responsibility  of  giving

assistance  to  these religious schools.  Some  of

these  religious  schools  are  not  run  properly

because they are faced with all sorts of problems.

The  syllabuses are not properly planned  and  are

different,  because between one  religious  school

and  another, they teach different subjects. Since

the  Council has taken over the management of many

mosques  in Singapore, surely it can do  the  same

for  the religious schools. I understand that with

regard   to  mosques  there  are  no  difficulties

because the premises are well constructed. But  in

the  case  of religious schools, the condition  of

the building is in a sorry state. So also with the

syllabuses used by the religious schools.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Muslim Religious Council allows this

situation  to continue and is keeping quiet  about

it,  and  does not make any effort to correct  it,

then  its  standing  in  the  community  will   be

affected.  Muslims  in Singapore  will  also  lose

confidence   in   it.  Muslim   organisations   in

Singapore,   such   as   the   All-Malaya   Muslim

Missionary Society, can he considered to  be  more

active  than the Muslim Religious Council  itself.

The  tithes collected are supposed to be  used  by

the  Council  for the welfare of  the  Muslims  in

Singapore,  whereas the honoraria of  the  Council

staff  are paid by the Government. Therefore,  the

Muslim Religious Council should find it easier  to

run  its activities than the Muslim organisations.

However, it is regrettable to note that the Muslim

Religious  Council  has  failed  in  many  of  its

functions.  The Muslim voluntary organisations  in

Singapore have instead done better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampung Kembangan talked about the

pilgrims  just  now.  The failure  of  the  Muslim

Religious Council to arrange chartered flights for

pilgrims  to  Mecca  in  the  previous   year   is

something which cannot be denied. This is proof of

its weakness because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



it  was not prepared to make concerted efforts. It

was  only  prepared to stand still and watch.  The

Muslim  Religious Council should make more efforts

in  this  respect and should not keep quiet  about

this  matter. Even the rice on the plate will  not

satisfy  the  stomach if it  is  not  fed  to  the

person.  The Muslim Religious Council should  have

organised   chartered  flights   for   prospective

pilgrims   to   Mecca.  The  PKMS  (United   Malay

Organisation,  Singapore),  which   is   a   Malay

political party in Singapore, has also looked into

this matter. The Minister concerned should ask the

Muslim  Religious Council to do its part  for  the

Muslims in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to Muslim religious schools, they are

very  important  because they can  give  religious

instruction  to  our  children.  If   the   Muslim

Religious  Council also failed to make efforts  in

this  field,  people  will go  to  the  mosque  in

reduced  numbers.  Religious instruction  is  very

important.  Therefore, the syllabus for  religious

instruction in schools must be improved. It is the

responsibility of the Council to see that this  is

being done. The tithes collected from Muslims  can

be  used  for religious purposes in the  Republic,

but  the money should not be misused to the extent

that  children  studying in the religious  schools

are  looked upon as step-children by this Council.

I  know that the tithes collected are only used to

provide  scholarships for students.  But  can  the

Minister  inform this House as to how  much  money

has  been  spent  on  scholarships  for  religious

students?



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon.

Member for Kampung Kembangan may wish to know that

the   Majlis   Ugama  Islam  has   been   actively

considering  the implementation of  a  scheme  for

Haji  air  flights to assist local Muslim pilgrims

to  go  to  Jeddah.  Unfortunately,  there  is  no

provision in the Administration of Muslim Law  Act

to  empower the Majlis to operate such  a  scheme.

The Majlis has also considered the formation of  a

co-operative for this purpose, and it has  carried

out a survey among local Muslim pilgrims to find



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



out  if they would respond to special arrangements

for  chartered flights. But the call of the Majlis

for  registration  met  with  poor  response.   It

appears  that  the  present arrangements  made  by

travel  agencies  are  preferred  by  these  local

Muslim  pilgrims. These agencies handled  12  such

flights   from   Singapore  in   1971   with   827

passengers,  and  13  flights  in  1972  with  492

passengers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards complaints about the treatment

accorded to our pilgrims during their stay in  the

holy  cities  of  Mecca  and  Medina,  since   the

arrangements   overseas   are   not   handled   by

Singapore, there is not much that we can do except

to request the foreign authorities responsible for

the  pilgrimage  to improve their services.  As  I

understand it, the Shaik Hajis, or agents who take

charge  of  the  pilgrims in Mecca,  have  a  very

important  role  to  play in the  welfare  of  the

pilgrims. They are paid for their services and the

standard  of  the services is dependent  upon  the

number  of pilgrims each Shaik Hajis looks  after.

This means that the smaller the number, the better

the standard of the services rendered. We have  no

control  over  these Shaik Hajis in Mecca.  It  is

entirely left to the pilgrims themselves to select

their own Shaik Hajis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the queries raised by the Member for

Geylang  Serai, I regret to inform him, Sir,  that

the  Majlis  is  not ready yet to  take  over  the

management  of all religious schools in Singapore,

as  it  lacks  the  necessary staff  to  do  this.

However,  a  sub-committee,  with  the  Mufti   as

chairman,  has already been formed and is  charged

with    the    responsibility   of   standardising

syllabuses  for religious instruction.  This  sub-committee  has  been  functioning  for  over  five

months  now,  and  I understand  that  significant

progress has been made. It is anticipated that the

revision of the curriculum for the primary  levels

will  be completed by next year. The sub-committee

will  also  be  looking into  ways  and  means  to

improve  the  standard  of teaching  by  religious

teachers. In this regard, the hon. Member may wish

to know that the Majlis will soon be conducting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



special refresher training courses for

religious teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to scholarships, Sir, the allocation

for 1973 is as follows: -



<pre>

                              No. of   Value    Total

                              Awards    Per     Value

                                       Award   Awards



Higher School Certificate         50   $300   $15,000



Institutions of Higher Learning   24   $500   $12,000

(other than Universities)



Universities                      42   $800   $33,600

                                 ---          -------

         Total:                  116          $60,600

                                 ===          =======



</pre>



Last year, the number of scholarships awarded  for

local studies was 104, and the number awarded  for

overseas studies was 22. Of these 126 scholarships

awarded, 30 were for religious studies. The Majlis

gives  equal consideration to applicants who  wish

to  pursue religious education as well as to those

who wish to study science and technical subjects.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am  not suggesting that the Majlis  Ugama

Islam  asks an airline company to look  after  the

pilgrims.  What I said was that the Majlis  should

assist local pilgrims who wish to proceed to Mecca

by   making  arrangements  for  special  chartered

flights.  The Minister has said that there  is  no

provision in the Administration of Muslim Law Act.

Nevertheless,  Sir,  there  exists  a   Pilgrimage

Department which looks after and assists the local

pilgrims who travel by sea. If this Department can

render assistance to local pilgrims who travel  by

sea,  I  do not see any reason why this Department

cannot  render  assistance to local  pilgrims  who

wish to go to Mecca by air.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said earlier that Muslims who

wish  to  proceed  to  Mecca prefer  the  existing

arrangements  made  by  travel  agents  for  their

chartered  flights.  I  think  this  is  not  true

because   many   Muslim  pilgrims   prefer   these

chartered  flights to he organised by  the  Majlis

Ugama   Islam  on  the  grounds  that  with  their

assistance,  matters relating to their  pilgrimage

to Mecca can be smoothly implemented.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, the Majlis has done its

very  best  to  get these pilgrims registered  for

arrangements to fly them to Mecca. But, as I said,

the response has been very poor. We did everything

we  could and it appeared that they preferred  the

Shaik Hajis to handle everything for them, instead

of  the Majlis Ugama Islam. However, we will still

try again next year.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, in view of

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1001 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1171.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Legal Aid Bureau was set up to help the

great  number  of labouring class  of  workers  in

legal  matters so that they will get a fair  deal.

Recently  I received a number of complaints  about

the way the Legal Aid Bureau has been dealing with

their affairs. The Bureau seems to be very slow in

the conduct of its affairs. It sometimes takes  as

long as six months to a year before any matter can

be dealt with completely. Why is this the case? Is

it  because of the short-age of legal officers? If

this  is  so,  then  it should employ  more  legal

officers. Or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



is it because of the inefficiency of the Bureau? I

hope the Minister will investigate the matter  and

take immediate measures to remedy the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister how many

cases  were dealt with by the Legal Aid Bureau  in

1972.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1972 the

number of applicants for legal aid and advice  was

3,745.  In  effect,  the actual  number  of  cases

handled by the Legal Aid Bureau is much higher, in

view  of  the  fact  that many cases  have  to  be

followed up in the succeeding year. Normally  each

case takes a period of time to be completed. There

are many reasons for this, since it takes time for

the  Bureau  to obtain the relevant evidence  from

the  applicant  and  to obtain  replies  from  the

opposing  parties  who often do  not  give  prompt

replies. These cases also take time in view of the

need to obtain reports, notes of evidence, and  so

on,  from the various departments. For legal cases

which  are  complicated, more time is required  in

view of the involved court proceedings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bureau is doing its best to deal with the

cases as quickly as possible. T am quite satisfied

that there has been no undue delay on the part  of

the  Legal Aid Bureau in handling the cases. I  am

also  aware that the case-load is mounting, and  I

shall  not  hesitate  to recommend  the  necessary

expansion and increase of staff to meet the  needs

of  the Bureau, when the time comes for this to be

done.  But  for the moment the Bureau is  able  to

cope   with  its  commitment  and  is  functioning

smoothly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may  I be permitted to make some observations with

regard to the work of the Legal Aid Bureau? I have

no doubt that the Bureau is rendering an excellent

service.   However,  I  have  similarly   received

complaints  of  delay on the part of  the  Bureau.

Quite  apart  from the shortage  of  personnel,  I

suspect  that  the  delay might  well  be  due  to

language,  because the majority of the people  who

seek  the  help of the Legal Aid Bureau  are  non-English speaking. In fact, I know of one parti-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>



cular  case where the petitioner won the case  but

under peculiar circumstances. Somehow it seemed to

him  that it would be to his advantage to  make  a

plea on certain grounds. However, the position  of

the case was not clearly explained to him, and  he

came  grumbling to me. I am just wondering whether

the  provision of interpreters could  be  made  to

relieve  the  situation,  because  most  of  these

people speak their own dialects and not English.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, we have staff who

think  that  language difficulty  is  one  of  the

reasons for the delay in settling cases.

therefore beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the Singapore Government

Officers'  Co-operative  Housing  Society  is   in

trouble.  Most  of its members have resigned,  but

they   have  not  been  able  to  withdraw   their

deposits.  Some of those members who  have  bought

houses through the Housing Society wish to make  a

full  settlement of their housing loans,  but  the

Society  cannot accept it. Can the  Minister  look

into the matter and find a solution or rectify the

situation?



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, the Government is aware of

the difficulties of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>



Singapore Government Officers' Cooperative Housing

Society. The spate of resignations from members of

the  Society  was  sparked off  by  the  hitch  in

launching the proposed Changi Co-operative  Garden

housing project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Society had refunded deposits and

shares to a number of members who had resigned, it

still  has  not been able to refund to  the  other

resigning members who were clamouring for a refund

of their money. In fact, the Society is in need of

liquid cash to the tune of $1,150,000 to discharge

its financial obligation to the resigning members.

However,  the Society has some valuable properties

but it is reluctant to sell them at this stage  to

meet  these financial obligations. The  matter  is

now receiving the attention of the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, and it is hoped that it  will

be  put  right  in the near future. For  a  start,

certain   officials  of  the  Society  have   been

changed, and plans have been made for high calibre

civil servants to be involved in the management of

the  Society.  The Society is now already  working

under  the  guidance of the Registrar.  There  is,

therefore, no necessity for the Government to take

over the running of the Society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1001 he

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from what the Minister has told us earlier,

we  learn that for the coming SEAP Games, a number

of  existing  sports venues, in  addition  to  the

National Snorts Stadium, will be utilised for  the

various  games.  The  facilities  in  these  other

sports venues are not up to standard, and I  would

like  to  ask whether the Government is  going  to

improve  these facilities. Moreover, if  a  sports

venue is privately-owned, is it the responsibility

of the owner to improve the facilities there?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about safety measures and security

measures?  Will  they also be  considered  by  the

Government? About two years ago, during a  basket-bail  tournament at the Gay World Stadium,  a  fan

dropped  from the ceiling and its wiring  hit  the

steel  pillar  and  caused  electric  sparks.   In

another  incident, the match was so exciting  that

it  nearly  caused a riot, and the  doors  of  the

entrances  were  forcibly broken. I  am  therefore

quite  concerned about the security  measures  and

safety  measures  at these various privately-owned

venues.   I  would  like  the  Minister  to   give

consideration to this matter.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is true

that venues, other than those under the management

of  the  National Sports Promotion Board, will  be

used  for  the  SEAP Games. This includes  private

venues as, for example, the Gay World stadium.  We

have  put  up an estimate for financial allocation

to   renovate  the  stadium.  It  will  cost   the

Singapore  National Olympic Council about  $51,250

to  improve the lighting, painting and decoration,

improvement  of  toilets,  and  so  on.  We   will

certainly  give  consideration to the  safety  and

security   measures.  There  is  a   sub-committee

looking into this matter, as I have said earlier.

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1002 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

(*The same amendment also stood in the names  of Messrs Sim Boon Woo and P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has all along been paying

adequate  attention  to the welfare  of  the  poor

people.  We  have  allocated millions  of  dollars

every year in the form of welfare aid for the aged

and the destitute to ensure that they are able  to

keep  body and soul together in a comfortable way.

All these are very good measures and worthy of our

comment.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But recently I have received complaints from

certain quarters that in the administration of the

public  assistance scheme, applications  have  not

been processed quickly enough. I hope the Minister

will   look  into  this  matter  to  improve   its

administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next complaint is on the necessity for the

recipients  to  queue  up for  the  collection  of

public  assistance  allowances  every  month.  The

recipients have to wait for a very long  time  for

their  money  as the queue is very long.  This  is

because  there is only one centre for the  payment

of  public  assistance allowances.  I  think  some

administrative improvement can be made, and I hope

the   Minister  will  take  steps  to  remedy  the

situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to ask the Minister how many

public  assistance recipients were on the register

last year and what was the total amount paid out?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a

complaint that the food provided in the Homes  for

the  Aged  is  not palatable. Is  it  possible  to

improve the quality of food so that when the  aged

inmates  finally  go to the happy  hunting  ground

they  would at least be satisfied with the quality

of the food provided?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of living has risen in Singapore. May I

ask  how much pocket money is being given  to  the

old  people  in the Homes? Is there any  provision

made  for  an increase in pocket money  for  these

people?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  system of payment of public  assistance

allowance  has  already been vastly  improved  and

there  should not, under normal circumstances,  be

any   queueing   up   by  the  public   assistance

recipients to receive their allowances, nor should

there be any prolonged waiting time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at present 7,474 households on public

assistance.   Payments   of   public    assistance

allowances  to  the heads of these households  are

and  can be made at payment centres nearest  their

homes  for  the  convenience  of  the  recipients.

Places where public assistance allowances are paid

to  the  recipients include the Public  Assistance

Section  Head Office at Havelock Road, its  branch

offices  at  Joo  Chiat and  Bukit  Panjang,  four

community  centres and 39 post  offices  all  over

Singapore. Furthermore, outdoor payment  teams  of

the   Public  Assistance  Section  of  the  Social

Welfare Department make regular calls to pay those

recipients   at   some  of  the   islands   around

Singapore, in hospitals, Institutions,  Homes  and

even  at the private residence of those recipients

who,  due  to  their immobility, are not  able  to

report  to  the nearest payment centre to  collect

their allowances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these numerous decentralised payment centres

scattered  all  over Singapore and made  available

for  public assistance recipients to collect their

allowances monthly, and in view of the  fact  that

payment  date  for  each individual  household  is

allocated one month



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



in  advance, the purpose of which is to space  out

payments throughout the month, there is really  no

necessity  for  public  assistance  recipients  to

queue  up  for their allowances or to wait  for  a

long time to get their allowances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are, of course, aware that there are some

recipients who, despite the excellent arrangements

made for them to receive their allowances, are  in

the  habit of calling at their respective  payment

centres much earlier than necessary before payment

time.  These are the few persons who have  created

their  own  queueing  up and prolonged  their  own

waiting  time.  Efforts are continuously  made  to

persuade and advise these recipients who call much

earlier than necessary, to come in accordance with

their  payment  date  or  time  to  collect  their

allowances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards food for the aged, every attempt has

been  made to improve the quality of food  in  the

Home  for  the Aged people. The dietary scale  for

the old folks in the Home for the Aged is drawn up

in  consultation  with  the Department  of  Social

Medicine  and Public Health, Faculty of  Medicine,

University of Singapore, and the Medical  Officers

attached  to the Home for the Aged. The  scale  of

food  supplied  to the old folks is  adequate  and

balanced   and   includes  a  wide  selection   of

foodstuffs with essential nutrients and sufficient

variety in daily menus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation of daily meals in the Home is

undertaken by professional cooks employed  by  the

Department.  The  Social  Welfare  officials  make

regular checks on the meals in the Home to  ensure

that  they  are palatable and of a good  standard.

However,  it  must be appreciated  that  preparing

food  for 600 persons in a Home like the Woodlands

Home  for the Aged is not an easy matter  and  the

food  certainly  cannot  be  expected  to  be   as

delicious  and  palatable  as  those  prepared  in

private homes or in restaurants. All attempts have

been  made to improve the preparation of meals  to

make  them  as delicious as possible and  to  this

end,  the Department has even engaged a well-known

chef from a Chinese



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>



restaurant  in Singapore to give regular  advanced

cooking lessons to the cooks as well as to some of

the  residents in order to enable them to  improve

the   palatability  and  standard  of   the   food

prepared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every inmate of the 600 residents in the old

folks  Home  administered by  the  Social  Welfare

Department is given a basic pocket money of $2 per

month. In addition, more pocket money for them  is

being provided under a special Earning Scheme, the

scale  of which is either $10 per person for those

helping  in the farm, workshop, kitchen  or  other

duties which require some skills, or $5 for  light

duties  such as doing the household chores  or  in

keeping the dormitories clean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These payments of $10, $5 and $2 as pocket money

for  the residents in the Home for the Aged  serve

as  an  incentive  for  the  residents  to  engage

themselves in some light but productive and useful

work.  In  addition to the payment  of  allowances

provided  for,  the old folks  in  the  Home  also

participate  in other profit-sharing  projects  to

earn some pocket money for themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with the Government's policy that

nothing is for free, every resident in the Welfare

Home, subject to his or her being certified fit by

the Medical Officer, is encouraged and required to

engage in some form of work within or without  the

Home  and is paid remuneration in respect of  such

work  at  such rate as may from time  to  time  be

determined by the Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the free food, free accommodation,

free  medical treatment, free clothing and payment

of  allowances  under the Earning Scheme  and  the

supply  of other basic needs in the Home, the  old

folks   in  the  Welfare  Home  enjoy  also  other

privileges  such as occasional parties  and  gifts

given  by  well-wishers,  voluntary  workers   and

organised groups.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the reply of the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social

Affairs  is very unsatisfactory. There  are  rice,

vegetables and everything else but they should try

and  cook the food more tastily. Cooking  is  done

for  600  people,  and even if  it  is  for  1,000

people,  there should be no difference.  The  cook

must  taste the food first, and if he is satisfied

that  the  food is tasty, then it can be given  to

the old people. I am not asking for a chef from  a

restaurant to do the cooking in the Home!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

for Social Affairs would like to invite the Member

for  Anson  to taste the food for himself  to  see

food.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the Parliamentary Secretary has given  me  a

Section  will  improve on its  efficiency.  I  beg

leave to withdraw the amendment, Sir.

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 11*.

(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a provision of $620,000 in the

Development  Estimates for the construction  of  a

Home  for Destitute Persons. Under this amendment,

I have three simple questions to ask the Minister:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What type of people will be housed in the

Home for Destitute Persons? Is there any age limit

for the people to be admitted? (2) How many people

can  this Home accommodate? (3) When will the Home

be   completed,  and  what  facilities   will   be

available?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the present

plan  is  to  put up an additional  Home  for  the

Destitutes   in  order  to  ease  the   congestion

existing in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



Bushey  Park  Home,  and to  enable  the  training

programme  for destitute persons to be effectively

carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bushey Park Home which is a gazetted Home for

the  Destitutes is always overcrowded,  having  an

average daily population of 270 persons, while its

optimum  capacity is for about 250  persons.  This

population  figure of destitutes does not  include

another   100  male  destitutes  and  120   female

destitutes  who have, due to lack of accommodation

at   Bushey   Park   Home,   to   be   temporarily

accommodated in other Welfare Homes not meant  for

them. As such, it is essentially vital to build as

soon  as possible an additional Home for Destitute

Persons  to relieve the congestion at Bushey  Park

Home and to train those destitutes who are fit and

strong  enough  to  be  employable,  for  eventual

employment so that they can become useful citizens

of Singapore. Due to the compact, congested nature

of  the  Bushey Park Home, it is not possible  nor

practical  to conduct effectively any training  or

rehabilitation programme for the inmates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desired new Home will have five dormitory

blocks,   a   Medical  Block,  Recreation   Block,

Kitchen/Dining  Block, Workshops,  Staff  Quarters

and other ancillary buildings. It is hoped that  a

10-acre  piece of land will soon be made available

by  the  Government  for this project,  since  the

dormitories,  workshops and other  buildings  will

occupy  about  four acres with the  remaining  six

acres   to  be  utilised  for  farming  and  other

training  and rehabilitative activities.  The  new

Home  will  have  facilities for both  indoor  and

Outdoor  training with a view to  cultivating  and

instilling  in the able-bodied destitutes  a  work

habit  for outside employment rather than allowing

them  to  remain  a  continuing charge  on  public

funds. The able-bodied and the workable destitutes

committed  to this Home would be given  vocational

training such as carpentry, rattan craft and other

light  cottage  industries  as  well  as  farming,

vegetable  and fruit gardening, flower cultivation

and rearing of pigs and poultry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In establishing this Home, the most pressing

requirement other than funds is a piece of land of

10  acres for the purpose. If and when the land is

readily  available  from the Land  Office  or  the

Bases  Economic Conversion Department, and if  the

provision  of  public  utility  services  such  as

sewerage,  water  and  light  would  not  pose   a

difficult  problem, the construction of  the  Home

should not, in normal circumstances, take too long

and  it  is  expected that, barring any unforeseen

difficulties, the Home should be completed  within

the new financial year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1003 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 11.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I really fail to understand why the

construction  of  a fire station  in  Jurong  Town

should take such a long way and such a long  time.

In my simple reasoning, if the need is there, then

it  should be met as soon as possible. I think the

Minister will agree



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>



with me that Jurong, being an industrial town with

some   400   factories,   a   fire   station    is

indispensable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the idea of building a fire

station there was first mooted in 1966, and now it

is  1973. Seven years have elapsed, and yet  there

is  no  fire station in sight. I hope this is  not

caused   by   the   red  tape  of   the   relevant

authorities. If my memory serves me right, this is

the fourth time that I raise this same subject  in

this House. I hope that this will be the last time

so  that  we  do  not have to dwell  on  the  same

subject  next  year.  In this  connection  I  will

appreciate it if the Minister could enlighten this

House  as  to where, in what part of Jurong  Town,

and  when  will the fire station be erected.  This

time,  Sir,  I expect a definite answer  from  the

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Sir, building a fire station

is  not  like building a creche. So we  definitely

need  time to ponder and to plan over it.  Members

of  Parliament may wish to know that the  proposed

fire  station  in Jurong Town will  occupy  87,100

square  feet  of land at Residential Neighbourhood

II, Jurong Town. The building will be a two-storey

structure with a firemen's lecture room, rest room

and  recruits' dormitory at the first floor and  a

three-bay appliance room on the ground floor.  The

office  and  the  control  room  will  adjoin  the

appliance room. There will be a drill yard  and  a

97-foot drill cum hose tower. There will also be a

single storey structure within the precinct of the

fire  station to house the lecture room, the  rest

room  and  the smoke chamber for the  training  of

recruits. The fire station will be constructed  of

reinforced concrete and has been designed for  the

possible  future extension of the  appliance  room

from a three-bay to a five-bay station.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Jurong fire station will be a

district   fire  station  supported  operationally

either  by  Bukit Timah fire station or  Alexandra

fire  station,  in  the first instance.  The  fire

appliances and the ambulance for the fire  station

are  already available and will be transferred  to

the  proposed  fire station when it is  completed.

The  Public Works Department has advised that  the

construction  of  the  proposed  fire  station  is

expected to be completed by the end of July  1974.

The  fire station will be commissioned soon after.

I hope the Member will be very happy when the fire

station is completed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I heard the

Parliamentary Secretary say that the fire  station

is  expected to be completed by July 1974. I  hope

his  Ministry will keep its word. On that note,  I

beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $4,078,230 for Head 1003 ordered to

stand part of the Main Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $650,000 for Head 1003 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to a resolution of the House, Mr Speaker

thereupon left the Chair of the Committee and took

the Chair of the House.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

report  that  the  Committee of  Supply  has  made

further  progress  on  the  Main  and  Development

Estimates  of  Expenditure for the financial  year

1st April, 1973 to 31st March, 1974, and ask leave

to sit again tomorrow.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> So be it.
