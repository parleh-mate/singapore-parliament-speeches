<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have received a message from His

Excellency  the Officer Administering the Government  of

Singapore  dated 28th May, 1957, informing me  that  His

Excellency  has,  in accordance with the  provisions  of

Section 62 (2) of the Singapore Colony Order in Council,

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>TRANSFER OF CHRISTMAS ISLAND TO AUSTRALIA</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> asked the Chief Minister whether

he  will  make  a  statement regarding the  transfer  of

Christmas Island to Australia.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (for the Chief</b>

<b>Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Christmas Island

referred to lies in the Indian Ocean some 800 miles to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2024</b></font><br><br>



the  south of Singapore. This island does not belong  to

Singapore. The Singapore Government was notified of  the

decision of the United Kingdom Government to effect  the

transfer, and accordingly noted the position.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does Christmas

island not come under the definition of the "islands  of

Singapore"  and  is  it  not a fact  that  it  has  been

administered by the Singapore Government?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for administrative

reasons,  Christmas  island  was  transferred   to   the

administration of Singapore in 1900, but I  should  like

to draw the attention of the Member for Serangoon to the

fact  that  Christmas  Island  is  outside  the  present

constitution,  having  been  excluded  from  the  Rendel

Constitution Commission's Report. The hon.  Member  will

no doubt be aware that Members of the former Progressive

Party  were  represented  on this  Commission  and  were

signatories to that Report.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this island is

under the jurisdiction of Singapore, and giving it  away

to  another country is, in fact, ceding away part of the

territory. Is that not so, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said

just  now, this island does not belong to Singapore,  it

belongs to the United Kingdom Government.

<div align="center"><b>CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES IN ARMED SERVICES</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Steps to set up tripartite committee to deal with employment problem)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> asked the Chief Minister what

steps are being taken to set up the tripartite committee

to  deal  with  the  employment  problem  affecting  the

civilian  employees in the Armed Services;  and  whether

the  Government  has adopted or will adopt  measures  to

assist workers who have already been retrenched or  will

be retrenched in the immediate future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2025</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid (for the Chief Minister):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, before he left for Europe last month  the

Chief  Minister  made it known that he would,  while  in

London,  take up with the United Kingdom Government  the

question  of  the  early setting up  of  the  Tripartite

Consultative Committee which was agreed upon when he was

there  in  March  and April 1957. As these  are  matters

being  personally handled by the Chief Minister, a  full

reply  to the first part of the question must await  his

return.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second part of the question, the

Government  Employment Exchange has  done  and  will  do

everything  possible  to assist the retrenched  workers.

Lists  of  their  occupations  have  been  sent  to   29

employers  who  have been asked if they  can  offer  any

vacancies  which  would  be suitable.  The  Exchange  is

awaiting the results. The same assistance will be  given

to  other employees of the Armed Services if they should

be retrenched in the immediate future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the

Government  name  a date when this tripartite  committee

will  be  set  up?  The Government, I think,  should  be

informed on that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question of aid to those workers who

have  been  retrenched or will be  retrenched,  can  the

Government  adopt a more concrete form than the  general

form of registration of all people who are unemployed?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to the first part

of  the  supplementary question,  I  am  afraid  I  have

nothing further to add.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2026</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Shame.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> To the second part of the question,

I should say this: that Government departments have been

supplied with the lists of occupations and asked to see

whether they have any suitable vacancies.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Can the Government inform this

House, Sir, whether there are vacancies open for the

people who have been retrenched?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are in no

position to make any definite statement regarding that.

<div align="center"><b>LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM SINGAPORE OF MINISTERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Cost to Colony)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Chief Minister whether he

will  state  the number of days' leave of  absence  from

Singapore  granted,  individually and  collectively,  to

Ministers,  other  than ex-officio Ministers,  from  2nd

April,  1955, to 30th June, 1957, and the  cost  to  the

Colony in travelling and other expenses which such leave

of absence has involved.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid (for the Chief Minister):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, as the information sought involves columns

of  figures and is of some length. I will circulate  the

information requested by the hon. Member for Tanglin  in

the Official Report.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I think this is a matter of

importance to the people of Singapore and we  should  be

informed now.

<div align="center"><b>(Number affected and relief granted)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr R. Jumabhoy</b> asked the Minister for Labour

and Welfare-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) how many persons were affected by the

recent fire in Cecil Street;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) how many of them have been given

alternative accommodation and where;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) how many of them are awaiting

accommodation, and when will they be given

accommodation; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) what kind of relief has been given to the

victims, and on what dates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee (for the Minister for Labour and Welfare):</b> To question

(a) Sir, 292 persons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Accommodation at Bushey Park and Nantina

Homes offered, but the victims declined the

offer and preferred to stay with relatives and

friends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) 225 persons have registered with the

Singapore Improvement Trust for accommodation

which will be available about October 1957.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Here are the particulars:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23rd May the Singapore Welfare Donation

Chest gave out $4,960: the Silver Jubilee Fund

$1,330.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 25th May the Singapore Welfare Donation

Chest gave out $480; the Silver Jubilee Fund

$45.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 27th May the Blue Cross Association

donated rice and household goods to the value

of $2,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 8th June the Singapore Joint Relief

Organisation donated $8,520.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 11th June the Singapore Welfare Donation

Chest donated $1,990; the Silver Jubilee Fund

$40; Dr Chen Su Lan Trust $500.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 12th June the Singapore Welfare Donation

Chest donated $520: the Silver Jubilee Fund

$15.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total is $20,800.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Minister

aware that he is much



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2036</b></font><br><br>



more  accommodating in giving columns  of  figures

than the Acting Chief Minister?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2036</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4><div align="center"><b>VOTING RIGHTS FOR ALIENS AND DATE OF LEGISLATIVE</b></div></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>ASSEMBLY GENERAL ELECTIONS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> asked the Chief Secretary

what  steps have been or are being taken to  grant

citizenship or voting rights to aliens resident in

Singapore  in  accordance with the  terms  of  the

agreement  reached  at  the London  constitutional

talks   in  March/April  this  year;  and  whether

Government has fixed a target date for the holding

of the Legislative Assembly general elections.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr W. A. C. Goode:</b> Sir, good progress has been

made   in   drafting   a  Citizenship   Bill   and

consideration  has  already  been  given  to   the

arrangements   required  for  carrying   out   the

registration  of citizens under that  legislation.

The  date  for  holding general elections  to  the

Legislative  Assembly  depends  on  enacting  this

legislation, on the period for the registration of

persons  eligible for citizenship,  and  the  time

required  for  the subsequent preparation  of  new

electoral  rolls.  We  have also  to  prepare  new

electoral  rolls in order to hold local government

elections  at  the  end  of  this  year  and   the

beginning of next year. So far as can be judged at

present,  I doubt whether it is possible  to  hold

elections  to  the  Legislative  Assembly   before

August next year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the

Hon. the Chief Secretary inform the House when the

proposed  Citizenship Bill will  come  before  the

House?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> I was hoping, Sir, that we could lay

the Bill for First Reading at our next sitting  in

July. We will do that if possible, but I think  it

more probable that it will be the August sitting.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2036</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SALE OF ASSEMBLY PUBLICATIONS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Chief Secretary whether

he will make arrangements for the Assembly Hansard

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2037</b></font><br><br>



other  publications presented to this House  which

are not published in the Government Gazette to  be

made   available  to  the  public  (i)  by  annual

subscription  and (ii) at rates cheaper  than  the

existing rates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, both the size and the number of

issues of Hansard and other publications vary very

greatly  from  year  to year.  It  is  impossible,

therefore,  to  foresee  even  approximately   the

number  of  copies  involved, and  so  it  is  not

possible   to   fix  annual  subscription   rates.

However,  the Government Printer accepts  deposits

against  which  these  publications  are  supplied

immediately   on   issue  to  subscribers.   These

publications  are  sold at a  price  which  barely

covers  the  cost of the paper and other  material

used.   A   reduction  in  price  would  cause   a

considerable  loss  of  revenue,  and  I  do   not

consider  that  it  would bring any  corresponding

increase in sales.

<div align="center"><b>(Steps to exclude non bona fide voters)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Chief Secretary whether

he  will  take steps to prevent persons  who  have

registered in the Tanjong Pagar Electoral Division

at  addresses  which are not and never  have  been

Regulations, 1955.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> No, Sir. The electoral roll for the

coming by elections in Tanjong Pagar was certified

on  15th  September last year and  cannot  now  be

altered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the possibility of prosecution under

Ordinance,  any information which the hon.  Member

can give to the police, indicating that an offence

has been committed, will be investigated.

<div align="center"><b>MOSQUITO NUISANCE IN SERANGOON GARDEN ESTATE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> asked the Minister for

Local Government, Lands



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2038</b></font><br><br>



and  Housing  whether he is aware of the  mosquito

nuisance  in the vicinity of the Serangoon  Garden

Estate, and what steps will be taken to abate such

nuisance.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been

informed by the Rural Board that Serangoon  Garden

Estate  is a private housing estate and  that  the

responsibility  for maintenance  of  the  roadside

drains and other mosquito-breeding areas lies with

the  developers or the purchasers of lots  in  the

housing estate until the drains are taken over  by

the Rural Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board has taken over only part of the roads

and drains in the estate and the Board's cleansing

section has already attended to the drains in this

part.  Notices have been served on the  developers

for  the proper maintenance of the drains  in  the

remaining part of the estate. Until the roads  and

drains in this remaining part are also taken over,

action has been taken by the Board principally  in

the control of malaria transmitting mosquitoes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the

Minister  aware that mosquito-breeding also  stems

from  lands  around the estate  which  are  mostly

swamps,  and  what action has been taken  in  that

direction?



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the

Minister aware that there is mosquito nuisance  in

his own Ministry and in his own room?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am aware

of the mosquito nuisance in my own Ministry and in

my  own room, but unfortunately the mosquitoes are

not residents of Serangoon Garden Estate!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, does this not point to

the inefficiency of the service?

<div align="center"><b>REDUCED RENTS FOR NEW S.I.T. FLATS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> asked the Minister for

Local  Government, Lands, and Housing  whether  he

will consider

taking  steps  to  have  the  proposed  rents  of

$30/$35   per   month  for  the   new   Singapore

Improvement  Trust  flats in the  Albert  Street,

Prinsep  Street and Short Street area reduced  at

least to the levels of rentals of $10 to $20  per

month  now being paid by the residents of  houses

shortly to be demolished.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the reply

is  no. The White Paper on housing subsidy policy

gives  the  method of subsidising public  housing

which the Government is following. In the case of

flats now being built under S.I.T. Programme  No.

8   for   rentals  of  $30/$35  per  month,   the

Government  is  paying a rent  subsidy  of,  say,

$30/$40 on each flat each month which, in effect,

means  that, but for the subsidy, the  rents  for

these  flats would be somewhere in the region  of

$60/$75 per month.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the

<div align="center"><b>ELECTRICITY FOR BULIM VILLAGE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Goh Tong Liang</b> asked the Minister for

Local Government, Lands and Housing whether he is

aware  that  there  is  a  great  demand  by  the

inhabitants of Bulim Village in Chua Chu Kang for

electricity;   and  when  will   electricity   be

supplied to them.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am aware

of the desire of the inhabitants of Bulim Village

and  others for a supply of electricity to  their

village.  Electricity  supplies  have  not   been

possible in the past as there were no electricity

mains  in the vicinity of Bulim Village  and  the

cost  of  a  scheme  to supply electricity  to  a

comparatively small and distant village would  be

prohibitive. However, I am informed by  the  City

Council  that a scheme for supplying  the  R.A.F.

Station  at  Tengah  with  electricity  has  been

prepared and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2040</b></font><br><br>



should  be  operating by the end of the  year  or

early   in  1958.  When  this  scheme  has   been

completed, it will be possible for the Government

to  request  the  City  Council  to  consider   a

subsidiary scheme to supply a number of  villages

<div align="center"><b>(Enquiry)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government, Lands and Housing-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) how many tenants of S.I.T. shop premises

in  the  Alexandra / Queenstown  area  from

Redhill  Road  to  Strathmore  Avenue   are

being  required  to pay increases  in  rent

from 1st June, 1957, and what is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2041</b></font><br><br>



the  average percentage increase in rent for

these premises;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) why these increases are being demanded

after   approximately  one  year's   tenancy

only; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) whether he will cause an enquiry to be made

into  the justification for these increases,

and  whether, in the meantime, he will  give

an  assurance that these increases  will  be

postponed.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

informed  by  the Singapore Improvement  Trust  as

follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The number of terrace and shop premises in

the  Alexandra/Queenstown area which were required

to pay an increase in rent was 39 out of the total

number  of  66  rentals reviewed by the  Board  of

Trustees  of the Singapore Improvement  Trust.  Of

the  remaining 27 rentals, there were 25 where the

rents  remained  unaltered, and  two  cases  of  a

reduction  of  $10 and $25 per month respectively.

The  average  increase in rent was $25,  which  is

equal to a percentage increase in rent of 16.7 per

cent. The original rents were based by tender.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) It was previously the policy of the Board of

Trustees  to review all new shop rentals  after  a

minimum  of  twelve  months'  tenancy.  On   first

letting, the true market value cannot be correctly

assessed, and is therefore only an estimate. After

a  shopping  centre  has been established  for  at

least  twelve  months, a clearer  picture  can  be

obtained, and an adjustment is then made either by

decreasing  or  increasing  the  rentals,   having

regard  to  the  past experience  of  the  letting

demand  and the established market value. However,

Sir,  the  Board at its last meeting decided  that

such  a  review  should be made only  after  three

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The Board has discretion to fix rents for

the tenancies of shop premises and it is therefore

a  question for decision by the Board, but,  as  I

have  already said, the Board has now  decided  to

review rents only after a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2042</b></font><br><br>



period  of  three years. In this particular  case,

one  year has now elapsed and the review  will  be

after  another two years. This is purely a  matter

for  the Board and I do not see any necessity  for

an enquiry.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, am I to understand

from  the  Minister's statement that the increases

will not now be enforced?

be enforced, but the decreases will be enforced.

S.I.T. shop   premises   surrounding   the

Princess   Margaret  Market  off  Stratbmore

Avenue with effect from 1st June, 1957; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the total cost of construction of these

shop premises excluding the market.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> The matter of fixing rents for

shop  premises,  Sir, is purely a matter  for  the

Singapore Improvement Trust. I am informed by  the

Board, with regard to these questions, that-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) There is no direct relationship between the

rents  fixed for shop premises and their  cost  of

construction  and other overheads,  though  it  is

unlikely that such rents would give less  than  an

economic  return  on costs. They are  assessed  on

their value as business premises by the Board with

the  advice  of  the  City Assessor,  taking  into

account  locality and other such relevant factors.

In the past, except for rehousing cases,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2043</b></font><br><br>



it is usual for these shops to be let by tender at

not less than the rents assessed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The total rent being demanded from the 20

S.I.T. shop  premises  surrounding  the  Princess

Margaret Market off Strathmore Avenue, with effect

from  1st June, was $4,335 per month. However,  as

the  Board  has  agreed to defer  reassessment  of

these   rents  until  the  businesses  have   been

operating for three years, the total rent for  the

20 houses will now be $3,830 per month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The total cost of construction of these

shop  premises, excluding the market, was $90,000.

This, however, excludes the cost of roads, drains,

part  of the cost of sewers and the cost of  land,

for  which a sum of approximately $60,000 must  be

added.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, is the Minister aware that

the  retail  prices in the shops are  higher  than

those  in  the city and that Queenstown  residents

are  going to the city to get their domestic needs

instead  of buying at these shops? Is the Minister

also  not aware that this is due to the high rents

which are paid, and will he not consider a further

reduction in respect of shops other than  the  two

already referred to?

brought    in    fresh   problems    of    Chinese

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) what are the conditions which have to be

fulfilled before a licence is granted;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) what is the maximum number of licences he

is prepared to grant;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) what expenses have been incurred by

Government  in the granting of licences  up

to  a  last convenient date, and what extra

expenses  will be incurred in the  granting

of more licences; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) what is the estimated increase in the

country's food supplies consequent  on  the

granting of more licences.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> (a) Eight applications for

licences  for deep-sea fishing were received  when

Government  invited  applications  in  May   1956.

During  1957 four further applications  have  been

received.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Three licences have been granted in

accordance with Government's decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) When applications were invited in May 1956,

certain  conditions had to be fulfilled before  an

application was considered. These conditions  were

set  out  in  Press advertisements, and  the  hon.

Member can refer to them in the Straits Times  and

the  Singapore  Standard of 16th and  17th  April,

1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licences were granted to three applicants who, in

Government's  opinion, offered the best  prospects

for   rapid  training  of  local  personnel   with

greatest  participation  of  local  interests  and

increase in the supply of fish from deep-sea  off-shore fishing grounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may add that subsequently the following four

extra   conditions  were  added  to  the  licences

granted:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Fishing should not be carried out within 35

miles of the Malayan coast.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Only four vessels are to be used by each

company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The fish caught must be landed in Singapore

Port for sale and must not be landed in any

other territory.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2049</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The approved training scheme must be

implemented within six months of the  grant

of the licence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The maximum number of licences which the

Government  was  prepared to grant  initially  was

three.  It  was necessary to study the  effect  of

trawl fish landings on the price structure of fish

in  Singapore  to ensure that the  local  industry

will  not  be  upset and that Singapore  fishermen

will  not  be  unduly  affected  by  too  rapid  a

lowering of fish prices. This study takes time  as

it  involves  the  collection of price  statistics

over  at least a period of six months in order  to

take  into  account  the  seasonal  variation   in

prices.  The  position is being  reviewed  by  the

Government and a decision will be made in  respect

of the question of granting of more licences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) No expense was incurred apart from the cost

of  advertisement in the local Press  calling  for

applications. It is not envisaged that  any  great

expenditure will be incurred if it is  decided  to

grant more licences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) The increase in the country's fish landings,

if  more  licences  are granted,  depends  on  the

method  of fishing employed and the experience  of

the  Japanese  fishermen in locating good  fishing

grounds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does the

Minister not consider that increased fish supplies

would  be  welcomed  by the people  of  Singapore,

because food prices will come down even more,  and

that  the  increase of licences  would  definitely

help to bring in more food supplies?

Government  policy  in  respect  of  the   tourist

industry.  I  am now in a position  to  make  this

announcement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that the industry receives expert

attention,  Government has  decided,  as  a  first

step,  to  recruit an expert in tourist  promotion

work from overseas and appoint him as Director  of

Tourism  in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.

The  choice of a suitable candidate would be  made

from  countries  where the tourist  industry  has

been developed to a very high standard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, for the purpose of giving

advice to Government, it is proposed to appoint an

Advisory  Committee from persons in Singapore  who

have  had  experience of, and are connected  with,

the  tourist  industry, such as persons  connected

with  shipping  and  air  travel,  hotels,  travel

agencies  and  shops catering for  tourists.  This

Advisory  Committee will not only give advice  and

guidance to the Director of Tourism on the setting

up of tourist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2051</b></font><br><br>



bureaux   and  information  centres  in  Singapore   and

elsewhere, on providing and advertising attractions  for

tourists  in Singapore and on all other steps  necessary

to attract tourists, but will also be entrusted with the

special  task  of promoting the formation and  fostering

the  growth of a Local Travel Association consisting  of

those interested in and catering for the tourist trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is envisaged that, as soon as the industry is

organised  and  a  strong  travel  association   formed,

promotion  of tourism would be taken over by a statutory

board  on  which the Travel Association  would  be  well

represented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of development of tourism in the

Colony,  Government will seek approval for the provision

of  adequate  funds  which,  for  the  first  year,  are

estimated to be of the order of $300,000, as soon as the

Director of Tourism has been appointed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>10.38 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir, I move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this short Bill, Sir, is fully

explained  in  the  note appended to  it.  The  Licences

Ordinance  now  makes provision for  delegation  of  the

licensing  powers of the Deputy Commissioner of  Police,

but  it  does not make provision for delegation  of  the

licensing  powers of the Commissioner of Police.  It  is

not necessary that the Commissioner of Police should  be

burdened  with the issue of petty licences. In fact,  it

is  more  important that he should be relieved than  the

Deputy Commissioner, and the purpose of this Bill,  Sir,

is to enable the Commissioner's powers of licensing also

to be delegated to the appropriate police officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

I  beg  to  move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, this Bill is fully explained in the

Explanatory  Note.  By  substituting  the  Deputy

Commissioner   of   Police  for   the   Assistant

Commissioner  of  Police, Criminal  Investigation

Department,  it  will  be  possible,  under   the

provisions of the Licences Ordinance, to  appoint

the officer in charge of the Second-hand Dealers'

Branch  in the C.I.D. to be the licensing officer

under  this  Second-hand Dealers  Ordinance,  and

that will make for administrative convenience and

greater efficiency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should perhaps add that under section 4 (2)

of  the Ordinance, any person who is aggrieved by

the  refusal of the licensing officer to grant  a

licence  has  a right of appeal to the  Governor.

Sir, I beg to move.

<div align="center"><b>(TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>10.45 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir,

I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, section 15 of the main Ordinance requires

that the electoral register for each electoral

division be revised each



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2055</b></font><br><br>



year  not  later than the 15th September  or  such

later date as the Governor may decide. The purpose

of  this Bill is to dispense with that revision in

respect of the present year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for seeking this dispensation is that

it  is not possible to complete the preparation of

the electoral rolls for City Council elections  to

be  held  in December this year, if a revision  of

the  Legislative Assembly rolls  also  has  to  be

completed by 15th September. I am sure, Sir,  that

all members of this House will agree that it is of

over-riding importance that elections to the  City

Council should not be further delayed; whereas the

statutory  revision  of the  Legislative  Assembly

electoral rolls must become of less importance the

nearer we get to the time when the whole basis  of

the   Legislative  Assembly  franchise   will   be

changed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already said, Sir, we hope to

introduce  at  an  early date a  Citizenship  Bill

which  will  make  provision for  a  new  form  of

citizenship.  That will mean a complete  recasting

of  the Legislative Assembly electoral rolls,  and

since  it  is our intention that the next  general

elections  to this Assembly shall be held  on  the

basis  of the new franchise, then revision of  the

present  electoral  rolls  does  seem  to  be   of

secondary value. It will, however, require a  very

great  deal  of work. It is estimated  that  there

would be as many as 150,000 changes to be made  as

compared with the roll certified in September last

year and those changes would occupy the tabulating

machines  and  staff of the Statistics  Department

for  at least 30 days. Thereafter the roll has  to

be  printed and published; we have to give time to

hear  claims  and  objections,  and  recheck   and

reprint;  and all that time work on preparing  the

City Council electoral rolls would be delayed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, Sir, if the City Council

elections are to be held in December, then we must

enable those concerned with preparing those  rolls

to  give  every effort to that task alone,  and  I

therefore  ask  that  they  be  relieved  of   the

statutory  obligation  to revise  the  Legislative

Assembly electoral rolls this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2056</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>10.49 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  on  this  side  of the House are  willing,  in

principle, to support this Bill so that  the  City

Council  elections can be held not later  than  at

the  end  of  this year. Everyone in Singapore  is

anxious  that  this  state of affairs  should  not

continue  any longer. Everyone is dissatisfied.  I

am  glad  that  the Hon. the Chief  Secretary  has

given   the   assurance  that  the  City   Council

elections will be held at the end of this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as far as the Legislative Assembly

electoral  rolls are concerned, we are  very  much

worried.  We  do  agree  that  the  next   general

elections  to the Legislative Assembly  should  be

held  on  the basis of the new franchise and  when

the  new electoral rolls come into force. We  want

the   citizens  of  Singapore  to  get  themselves

registered  so  that they can  take  part  in  the

elections. This is our stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present Coalition Government is

composed of seven elected Members from the  Labour

Front   (six  from  the  Labour  Front   and   one

Independent joining them, making seven in all) and

three  Alliance  Members, giving a  total  of  ten

elected  Members on the Government side out  of  a

total   of  25  elected  Members.  Their  ex-Chief

Minister (Mr David Marshall) wanted elections  in

August  this  year, but because of  the  delay  in

holding  them,  he became disgusted and  resigned.

Now,  Sir,  may  I  ask  this  question:  Is  this

minority Government of ten-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not see how those

remarks  of  the hon. Member have any relation  to

the  Bill  before  the House, which  is  simply  a

provision to suspend the operation of a section of

the Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> What I am pointing out is that

we are being asked to give our assent to something

which  does  not state definitely  when  this  new

register  will be completed and when the elections

will be held, and the present Government, with the

aid  of its ex-officio and nominated Members,  can

continue in office. That is the point I am making,

Sir. If you are satisfied, I will continue, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2057</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am certainly not satisfied at

all.  The  hon. Member can, of course, raise  that

point in another way, either by filing a motion or

speaking on the adjournment. But at the moment  we

are  considering a Bill which merely asks for  the

suspension   of   a  certain  provision   in   the

Legislative   Assembly  Elections   Ordinance,   a

question  of  whether or not the  electoral  rolls

should be revised this year.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I bow to the Chair when it

points out that I can make all the points which  I

have   made  in  a  separate  motion  or   in   an

adjournment speech. That being so, I will take the

opportunity of doing so and show to the people  of

Singapore   that   what  is   continuing   is   an

undemocratic government and a colonial government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $205,300 for Head D12 stand part

of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir, this item shows that an amount of $205,300 is

required  for  additions as are necessary  to  the

temporary  camp  at  Ulu  Pandan.  It  is   rather

alarming  to  us  that  a  temporary  camp  should

require  such a large sum of expenditure,  and  we

would like to know the details for which this  sum

is required.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, if I may reply first of all to

the  very natural criticism of the hon. Member for

Paya  Lebar  as to why we should spend  a  further

$200,000  or so on what purports to be a temporary

camp,  I  must say that it is unlikely  that  this

camp  will not be required for a number of  years.

We  have considered the cost of building permanent

accommodation for the Singapore Battalion, and  we

shall  want a very large sum indeed if we  are  to

provide   permanent  accommodation   up   to   the

standards that are expected. It will be  a  figure

somewhere  in  the order of ten or twelve  million

dollars, which is a very big sum and will  make  a

very  big  demand on our public works capacity.  I

think  it would be prudent, therefore, to work  on

the assumption that the Battalion will occupy this

temporary  camp for at least two,  three  or  four

years,  and  that being so, we must  organise  the

camp accordingly. Hon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2060</b></font><br><br>



Members   will  remember  that  we  put  up   this

temporary camp as rapidly as we could and with the

minimum  possible accommodation. If we  could  see

our way to moving the Battalion within a matter of

months, then we could manage in the camp as it  is

today,  but as I said, it is prudent, I think,  to

provide  for  the Battalion staying there  for  at

least  two or three years, and once we posit that,

we  must  then  posit that we shall  have  a  full

Battalion in that camp for a period of a  year  or

two.  That  immediately raises one  big  question,

and  that is water supply. The site was laid  out

and  the  main  hutments  were  built  as  far  as

possible  along the lower contours of the  ground.

At the moment they are the only accommodation that

is  occupied but as the numbers increase, it  will

be essential to use the higher levels of that camp

and  that  means putting in a local  water  supply

scheme  to get water to the top level of the  camp

so  that  there is sufficient pressure to  provide

for  the  necessary washing and other  facilities,

and  that  is the expensive item in this vote  for

which  I am now seeking approval; that is an  item

of $66,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other items which go to make up the sum

of  $205,300. There is at present no proper  guard

room or armoury. These two items are essential  if

the  camp  is to continue and the weapons  of  the

whole  Battalion are to be kept in the  camp,  and

they come to another $33,500. We also must provide

an  M.T. workshop which will cost about  $17,000.

The   Battalion  has  already  got   about   eight

vehicles.  They are new vehicles.  At  the  moment

they  are  standing  in the open  and  it  is  not

economical,  hon.  Members will  agree,  to  allow

motor transport to stand indefinitely in the open.

It  is  also right and proper that the men in  the

Battalion  should learn to maintain and  do  minor

repairs on their own vehicles. For this purpose we

must have a proper M.T. shed and workshop, and the

estimate for that is $17,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another item is a 30-yard range on the camp. We

made  no  provision originally for such a  range,

hoping that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2061</b></font><br><br>



if we were only occupying it for a short period of

time, it would be satisfactory to ferry the troops

from the Battalion to other 30-yard ranges. But as

soon  as we contemplate staying longer in the camp

I  think it is essential there should be a 30-yard

range  so  that the men can go down  and  practise

shooting  without the delay and expense  of  being

ferried by lorries all over Singapore Island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of other detailed items which

I can let the hon. Member have but it will perhaps

take  too  long to detail to the Assembly  now.  I

would give this further assurance, that we do  not

propose to embark immediately on spending  of  the

whole  of this $200,000. There will be phases  and

the  first  vital requirements are the armoury  so

that  they  can  keep their weapons;  getting  the

water  supply  up to the top of the hill  so  that

they can use those huts at the top; we want to  be

able to open an officers' mess there. We have five

local   boys  who  are  going  on  officer   cadet

courses - three are already up in the Federation  at

the  Military College and two more are shortly  to

leave  for  Australia and will be back within  the

year;   and   we   want  to  start   getting   the

appurtenances of this camp so that we can build up

a spirit in the Battalion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that other Members of this House as

well  as  I got considerable satisfaction  out  of

seeing  the  small  squad on the Queen's  Birthday

Parade  last  week  which  was  the  first  formal

occasion  on which the Singapore Infantry Regiment

appeared before the public. If I am not ruled  out

of  order, I would mention one further point, that

two  more squads will be passing out after recruit

training  on  27th July and if any Member  of  the

House  would care to come and see it, I  would  be

very happy to arrange it.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Chairman, it does

seem  to  us that there is considerable danger  of

the  Government falling between two stools in this

matter.  Once  you  decide to  stay  in  temporary

premises for three or four years, it is inevitable

that you will have to put more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2062</b></font><br><br>



money into the venture, into something which later

you   propose  to  abandon.  Therefore  there  may

eventually  be  a  considerable  waste  of  public

money.  Once you put money into a particular  site

which you intend to be temporary and then you hold

it  longer than you at first intended, at the same

time   planning  something  which  will  make   it

necessary to build a permanent camp somewhere else

later,  there is wastage; that seems to me  to  be

the  danger which the Government is running  into.

Of course we are entirely in favour of comfortable

quarters for the Singapore Battalion in every kind

of  way  but I think it is only right that  we  on

this side of the House should point out the danger

that the Government is running into in respect  of

the use of public money.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, I do not think I can accept the

suggestion  that  there is a danger  of  waste  on

this.  We  have decided to raise a battalion;  you

cannot  do  it  without  getting  some  place   to

accommodate it. I think we are all agreed  and  we

all  fully support the immediate raising  of  this

Battalion.  I  have already said if  you  wish  to

build  permanent  accommodation it  will  probably

take at least two years to do so and the cost will

be  someting like twelve million dollars.  In  the

meantime  we  must have accommodation  into  which

this  Battalion can be placed and if  we  spend  a

total  sum  of  just under $1,000,000  which  will

provide  us  with accommodation for our  Battalion

for the next three or four years and for which  no

doubt  we  shall be able to find a useful  purpose

thereafter, I do not for one minute think that  we

are wasting any money at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One further comment, Sir, I would like to make,

is  on  the suggestion - which I fully support - that

the   members   of  the  Battalion   should   have

comfortable  quarters. I do not think  that  their

present  accommodation can be said to come  up  to

that  standard. They are living in temporary metal

huts and while these are adequate they are not yet

comfortable.

are  incorporated in the Bill itself and  are  set

out  as  recitals. Briefly, they are  as  follows:

that   the   Little  Sisters  of  the   Poor   was

constituted  in  France in the  year  1893;  these

Sisters



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2064</b></font><br><br>



of   the   Poor  have  done  very  good  work   in

Singapore - this  I think is well known  to  all  of

us - and  they  have established a home  in  Thomson

Road; after these years of work in Singapore  they

have  managed  to receive certain funds  and  they

wish  now  to  extend  their  activities  to   the

Federation of Malaya; they have some buildings and

land, and funds to invest, and for the purpose  of

investment and owning of property they wish  their

charitable concern to be incorporated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,I think this is a deserving cause and there

is not much need for me to say anything more. Sir,

I beg to move.

<div align="center"><b>RADIO BROADCASTS FOR POLITICAL PARTIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FOR BY-ELECTIONS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, political Parties have been  refused

permission  to  use  Radio  Malaya  for  political

broadcasts in the by-elections that will  soon  be

held  in  Tanjong  Pagar and Cairnhill.  These  by-elections, Sir, are not ordinary ones.  They  were

occasioned  by the resignations of  Mr  Lee  Kuan

Yew, Secretary of the People's Action Party, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2065</b></font><br><br>



Mr  David  Saul Marshall (who had challenged  Mr

Lee)    when   the   All-Party   stand   on    the

constitutional agreement was debated in this House

in April.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues involved, Sir, are of great public

importance,  important enough to  be  put  to  the

public  of Singapore through the medium  of  Radio

Malaya.  All political Parties have subscribed  to

the  All-Party stand on the constitutional  issue.

Why should we not have the use of Radio Malaya  to

expose  the  shameless  opportunist  move  of  the

Liberal-Socialists in trying to get two more seats

in  the by-elections which will be held to justify

the stand they are supposed to be supporting? Even

whilst these by-elections are about to take place,

the Liberal-Socialists have come under the control

of a merchant who describes himself-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think I can allow

electioneering speeches in this Assembly.  We  are

now  discussing  radio  broadcasts  for  political

Parties,  that  is radio broadcasts for  political

Parties in general.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> I am sorry, Sir. The so-called

Liberals and their Party are therefore now  openly

playing-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member must realise

I have ruled that out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Sir, there is no better medium

by  which  the public of Singapore can be informed

of these shameless gambles than through the medium

of Radio Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member will not

keep to order then I must ask him to sit down. The

hon.  Member must on this adjournment motion speak

only  about radio broadcasts for political Parties

in general.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Sir, it is the duty of Radio

Malaya to serve the public of Singapore and it can

do   this  best  simply  if  it  permits  election

broadcasts by all political Parties including  the

capitalist  interests  of the  Liberal-Socialists.

Surely the Government cannot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2066</b></font><br><br>



deny  political Parties the right  to  make  their

stand through the medium of the radio?



<br><br>11.21 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the only media of mass propaganda in  Malaya

today which is not controlled by capitalist vested

interests is Radio Malaya. At election time,  Sir,

it is unrealistic to expect newspapers to give the

Parties  enough  publicity.  We  understand  these

newspapers   are   mostly  owned   by   capitalist

interests  and we cannot expect them to give  fair

and unbiased reports of the stand of the competing

political Parties. But we have the right, Sir,  to

expect  a  Government-controlled radio station  to

give  all political Parties the chance to  express

their  ideas  and ideals. It is the job  of  Radio

Malaya,  whether  in a general election  or  a  by-election,  to  help the working of the  democratic

system.  What harm can there be in giving  legally

constituted  political Parties the opportunity  to

place their stand thoroughly before the people  of

Malaya  and  to  persuade  them  to  vote  for   a

particular Party?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that all political Parties are

now gearing up for the general elections under the

new  Constitution. These by-elections, Sir, are  a

test   of   the   strength   of   the   respective

organisations and policies. Surely  it  will  help

the  Parties to put over their policies and  Party

stands  to  the public. The public can  understand

what  the issues are if all Parties are given  the

opportunity  during election time of  broadcasting

their programmes and stands over Radio Malaya.



<br><br>11.23 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, the best reason for the

Government  not  granting  permission  for   Radio

Malaya to be used has been furnished by the  mover

of  the  motion,  the Member for Ponggol-Tampenis,

this morning.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Member

has moved any motion at all.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2067</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> I mean the speech of the Member for

Ponggol-Tampenis. It is quite clear that if the radio is

to  be used, it will be used as a means of exciting  the

emotions  of  the people not only in the  constituencies

where  the by-elections are to be fought, but  over  the

Island  as a whole. I am quite certain it was never  the

intention that such means of reaching the public as  the

radio  should  be  used  in that  way,  as  a  means  of

attacking  the Parties and possibly also the candidates.

I  am  quite sure that other Members of this House  will

agree with me that the manner in which the speech of the

Member  for Ponggol-Tampenis was made has precluded  any

sympathy for him.



<br><br>11.25 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair) (Seletar):</b> Sir, Government has given its

earnest  and most careful consideration to the  question

of   allowing   broadcast   facilities   to   candidates

contesting  the  coming Assembly  by-elections  as  were

given  to  the  candidates in the general  elections  in

1955.  The  questions were whether or  not  broadcasting

facilities  should be offered to candidates in  the  by-elections  generally or to those representing  political

Parties  alone. These are the first by-elections  to  be

held  since the general elections in 1955. The  question

is  should  the procedure in a by-election  differ  from

that  in  a  general election? The Government  considers

that the procedure must differ since in this by-election

an  electorate of only about 24,000 in number in the two

constituencies, namely, Cairnhill and Tanjong Pagar,  is

concerned.  The  policy followed  in  the  1955  general

election was that representatives of recognised  Parties

should be allowed to broadcast and the time was allotted

to  the different Parties in proportion to the number of

candidates  contesting. Only candidates were allowed  to

give  those  Party  broadcasts and  they  spoke  not  as

individual  candidates to their own constituencies,  but

on  behalf  of their Parties, for all the candidates  of

their  own  Party, throughout Singapore. Their  speeches

were  therefore  of  direct  interest  to  all  electors

throughout the Island. Independent candidates  were  not

allowed to broadcast



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2068</b></font><br><br>



in  the  1955 general election because they  would  have

been  speaking only to their own constituencies and thus

have had an unfair advantage over Party candidates,  and

because  they were so numerous that it was impracticable

to  find  time  for  all of them.  Sir,  the  forum-type

broadcast was also limited to Party representatives  for

the same reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present by-elections, Sir, only the voters in

two  constituencies are concerned and on general grounds

there  is  no  justification  to  allow  candidates   to

broadcast  to  the  whole of Singapore.  If  only  Party

candidates are allowed to broadcast they will  be  given

much  advantage  over Independents, who will  have  good

reason  to protest at this unfair discrimination against

them:  but  if Independents are allowed to broadcast  in

this  by-election,  it  would be a  departure  from  the

Government's policy and might create a precedent leading

to  a fantastic state of affairs, especially at the next

general elections when hundreds of candidates, including

Independents,   might   be   contesting   in   the    51

constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration, Sir, was also given to the question of

whether a forum, in which all candidates contesting  the

by-elections  could be invited to take  part,  could  be

allowed.  This, Sir, is in fact no different  to  giving

such candidates time for broadcasting by himself and  is

again   a   departure  from  the  principles, mentioned

earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, requests were made by the Labour Front and the

People's  Action Party for broadcasting  facilities  for

their candidates contesting these two divisions. As  far

as  I  am aware, Sir, the other candidates have not made

similar   requests  for  broadcasting  facilities.   The

Government  is convinced that to agree to any suggestion

that   candidates  in  by-elections  should   be   given

broadcasting facilities would conflict with  the  policy

concerning  election broadcasts which is  based  on  the

principle that government is by the Party and not by the

individual.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, Radio Malaya provides a pan-Malayan

service  common  to  Singapore  and  the  Federation  of

Malaya. We have consulted the Federation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2069</b></font><br><br>



Government,  which  is strongly  against  allowing

broadcasts  for  by-elections. This  confirms  the

view   that   it  is  not  desirable  to   provide

broadcasting facilities to any candidate  for  the

coming by-elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member for Sembawang referred to

democracy  in  these broadcast  facilities.  I  do

think, Sir, that it is not a question of democracy

at  all,  nor  has this anything to  do  with  the

democratic rights of candidates. To my view, it is

more  a question of the proper use of radio  to  a

justifiable degree.



<br><br>11.31 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I should be most happy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2070</b></font><br><br>



if  Radio Malaya would give time for broadcasts by

political  Parties for by-elections  if  only  the

political  Parties concerned will, as a  quid  pro

quo,  give  up their loudspeaker vans  from  which

every night there comes an appalling cacophony. If

they give up these vans as a quid pro quo, I shall

be very happy to support this idea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.

<div align="center"><b>HAWKER PROBLEMS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government, Lands and Housing whether he will appoint  a

Committee  to  examine  the  hawker  problems  and  make

recommendations thereon.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Government has

decided that it would be desirable in principle  to  set

up  a  Hawkers'  Advisory Committee  consisting  of  the

following members : -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) two nominees of the Government;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) two nominees of the City Council;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) two representatives of hawkers to be chosen in

consultation   with   the   appropriate   hawkers

associations; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) an independent Chairman, who may be a housewife.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee would advise the appropriate authorities

on   problems   relating   to  hawkers,   generally   or

specifically.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Council is intimately concerned with the

hawkers  problem,  and  its views and  co-operation  are

therefore being sought before the Committee is  formally

constituted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not intended that this Committee should usurp the

functions  of  the City Council in its handling  of  the

hawker  problem, but as this problem has  assumed  major

proportions recently, Government is of the opinion  that

a   purely   advisory  body  representing  all   parties

concerned in this matter should now be established.

<div align="center"><b>OFFER THRIFT, MEDICAL SERVICE AND BENEVOLENT BENEFITS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> asked the Minister for Commerce

and Industry to state-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the number of business organisations in Singapore

which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2072</b></font><br><br>



claim to offer to the general public a thrift  and

medical service and benevolent benefit;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the activities of such organisations;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) how many complaints against them have been lodged

with the Police; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) what steps he will take to protect the interest

of the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) So far as is known, there are about 21 business

organisations which claim to offer to the general public

thrift,  medical service and benevolent benefits.  There

are also many insurance companies which offer to policy-holders, some of the same types of benefit but I am  not

certain  whether  this  type  of  business  activity  is

referred  to  in  this question. I have  assumed  in  my

answer  that it is not intended to include the insurance

business within the scope of this question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The 21 or so organisations to which I have

referred offer to their clients or subscribers a variety

of  benefits, including medical attention from,  doctors

appointed   by   the  organisation.  They   offer   also

confinement and death benefits and in some cases a  form

of  legal  aid.  A  few organisations  offer  unemployed

clients assistance in finding employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) There have been about 71 complaints received since

the end of 1956 against 7 organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Following the investigation of these complaints,

criminal  proceedings are pending in one  case.  Of  the

remainder,  no  final  decision has  been  taken  on  12

complaints  and  in 58 complaints no  offence  has  been

disclosed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2073</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent that criminal proceedings are pending

and  the  matter is accordingly sub judice, it would  be

improper for me to go into any further detail. In so far

as  the activities of these organisations are within the

existing law, it is Government's intention to take such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2074</b></font><br><br>



action  as may be necessary to regulate their activities

with a view to safeguarding the interests of members  of

the  public who participate in their schemes. With  this

in  view,  an  inter-departmental committee has  already

been constituted to consider the question.
