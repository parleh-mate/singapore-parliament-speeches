will  indicate how many persons were hanged in 1998 and  whether

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>SECRET SOCIETY MOVEMENT IN SINGAPORE</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs what

steps are being taken by the Singapore Police Force to check the

revival of the secret society movement in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, there is no revival of any secret society

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>

movement in Singapore.  Police has successfully broken up  the

hardcore  secret  societies  of the  50s  and  60s,  which  were

responsible  for violent gang fights, protection  and  extortion

rackets, through our tough laws and enforcement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current gang situation in Singapore has taken on a

different form, dominated by loosely organised street gangs with

a  fluid  membership.  The majority of their  members  are  male

Chinese youths aged between 13 and 19.  Although they are not as

vicious  as  the traditional secret society gangsters,  they  do

pose   law   and  order  problems  by  rioting  and   assembling

unlawfully.   Some street gang fights have resulted  in  serious

injuries and even deaths.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police recognises this problem and has taken steps to

address  it.  In 1998, Police conducted 906 anti-gang operations

covering entertainment outlets, shopping centres and known `hot-spots'.   Tough action will continue this year.  Police is  also

taking proactive measures to nip the problem in the bud.  Police

reaches  out  to the youths directly.  For example, it  conducts

preventive education programmes, such as school talks and visits

to  the  prisons,  to educate youths on the  evils  and  adverse

consequences of joining gangs.  In 1998, such Police  programmes

reached  over  9,000  youths.   This  twin  approach  of   tough

enforcement  and  preventive education has  been  successful  in

lowering the number of street gang related rioting from 39 cases

in 1996 to 16 in 1998.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, to what extent are

these  gang fights influenced by the presence of foreigners  and

also due to the current economic recession?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, Police has been very careful

in keeping out foreign triads.  They will continue to do this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> To what extent are gang fights as a

consequence of the current economic conditions?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, gang fights take place not

purely because of economic conditions.  Like I said, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>

majority  of  these are street gang type members.  So  they  can

fight  out of staring incidents, sometimes keeping to turf,  and

sometimes because of disagreements over certain matters.  So  it

is not essentially linked to the economic situation.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Is the Minister of State

aware  that there are still instances of extortion of protection

money  by  members of either secret societies or what  he  terms

"street  gangs"?   Is  he aware that when  such  instances  were

brought to the attention of the Police, the Police has asked the

victim  to  come  out  and identify those gang  members?   As  a

result, I am sure he is aware that most of these instances  were

not reported to the police.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Yes, Sir, police is aware of

this.  As I have said, about 70% are street gang types, and  the

30%,  which  are the more traditional type of secret  societies,

have extortion activities.  In fact, a few gangs were broken  up

in  the Woodlands area just last year.  That is why we have  the

Criminal  Law  (Temporary Provisions) Act to act against  people

who  are operating such activities where it is difficult to  get

people to testify.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of Supply [lst

Allotted Day].



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Estimates of Expenditure of Singapore for the

financial  year 1st April 1999 to 31st March 2000, contained  in

Paper Cmd. No. 2 of 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall take the totals for each head of expenditure in the Main

and  Development Estimates appearing in the last columns of  the

Main Estimates and Development Outlays for FY99 on pages 37  and

38 respectively of the Command Paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the "guillotine" times for heads of expenditure, which I

have  fixed under Standing Order 89(7)(a), I have also  allotted

the  time for the discussion of each amendment in the Estimates.

The time allotted for a discussion includes the replies from the

Front bench.  I shall announce these times as we go along.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the sitting time of the Committee of Supply has

been extended to 6.15 pm each day, we will still be hard-pressed

for  time.  The time we have available falls short of the  times

Members have indicated would be required for discussion of their

amendments.  Members will therefore not necessarily be given the

amount of time they have requested.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Members who would like to join in the debate on a

particular amendment will be allowed to do so only if  there  is

sufficient time left on the amendment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have received a total of 440 notices of amendments.

Because of the limited time, there may be occasions where I will

have  to  "guillotine" Members.  However, if speeches  are  kept

short  and  sweet, I am sure Members can avoid such  pain  being

inflicted  on them.  As in previous years, with the  cooperation

of Members, I will endeavour to keep the debate going at a brisk

pace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall deal first with the heads of expenditure in respect

of which amendments stand on the Order Paper Supplement.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head V -

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head V - Prime Minister's Office. Mr

Shanmugam is not here.  Mr Simon Tay.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head V of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this cut on the Prime Minister's Office, I

am  concerned  about  our policies regarding  development  of  a

harmonious  multi-racial society.  May I begin, first,  Sir,  by

saying  that I believe we have had and enjoyed a good record  to

date.   I  think Singaporeans have matured in time to  accept  a

multi-racial society as a cornerstone of Singapore.  My  concern

is that this should not be taken for granted, especially in this

time of crisis.  In this regard, I wish to raise two points  for

the Prime Minister's Office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that it should be our policy to monitor

discrimination  in  all matters, especially in  terms  of  jobs.

This  is  an  issue that has arisen recently in  private  sector

hiring,  not in the Government.   But if this is not  addressed,

the  economic crisis would indeed test our social cohesion.  The

Government  to-date  has  responded  by  saying  that  it  would

discourage discrimination and offer advice and moral leadership.

I  think  this is correct, as a first step, and that legislation

is  not  presently warranted.  However, I would urge  the  Prime

Minister's Office and the Government to monitor the situation as

it unfolds and, if necessary, look to legislation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to make on this cut is that I hope

the  Prime Minister's Office would foster collaboration  between

various  self-help  groups.   In  a  previous  speech  in   this

Parliament, I have given my thoughts on possible but  unintended

consequences  of  having separate ethnic  self-help  groups.   I

shall  not  repeat  myself, but I do hope the  Prime  Minister's

Office  would  consider ways to encourage greater  collaboration

between these different self-help groups.  In particular,  I  am

thinking of budgets that are culled from each individual  budget

to create a pool of resources.  Say, take 20% off each self-help

group's  budget as Government support, and put it  to  a  common

pool.   Where  there are collaborative projects between  two  or

more of these groups, this pool can be called on, but not if the

projects  involve  only  to  one  ethnic  group.   Additionally,

another step that might help is to have a multi-cultural day  to

promote  understanding and awareness of the important  value  of

multi-culturalism   in  our  multi-racial   and   multi-cultural

society.

<br><br><!-- Mr K. Shanmugam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. Shanmugam (Sembawang):</b> Sir, could I take both my

amendments together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shanmugam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanmugam:</b> The question of race and racial harmony in

Singapore has been the subject of much attention recently.   The

debate   has   been   spurred  partly  by  President   Habibie's

misinformed and unfortunate remarks.  Clearly, President Habibie

was  wrong  to  have  expressed his views  and  his  views  have

received a robust rebuff from Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while we take pride in our genuine multi-racialism, it is also time for some reflection and

introspection.   In  the years after independence,  meritocracy,

multi-racialism, racial harmony and equal opportunity  were  the

articles of faith on which our society and its component  racial

groups  sought to forge a new nationhood.  We wore our  equality

of  opportunity to all on our sleeves.  That is why we were able

to rebut President Habibie's remarks.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, we have to now look forward to the next

30  years  or  so  and  ask  if  the present  social  structure,

education  system and environment would provide for one  of  the

principles,  namely, multi-racialism, to endure in  the  way  we

understand it now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I say that? Let us look at the four principles I

mentioned.  Meritocracy is a means to an end.  It helps  achieve

a  stable  and prosperous society.  The other three  principles,

namely,  equality  of  opportunity, multi-racialism  and  racial

harmony  are  both a means to an end, namely our survival  as  a

nation  as well as being an end in themselves - they are  ideals

which a society should seek to achieve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These principles were constantly drummed into us.

Communities,  based  on  race, were changed  to  racially  mixed

neighbourhoods.  The same happened in schools and  wherever  the

Government had a say.  As a result, we are where we are today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: where are we going from here? It is quite

clear that looking at the future, no rational person doubts  the

Government's  commitment to any of the  four  principles.   That

much  is certain, and I believe it.  However, I have to say that

there is some concern among the minority communities about  some

of  the  Government  policies  and  their  possible  impact,  in

particular,  on  the principle of multi-racialism  and  possibly

equality  of opportunities as we now understand them.  This  may

be  sensitive, but we have never shrunk from a frank  debate  on

Government  policies and their impact.  So since there  is  some

concern, it is time for a frank debate.

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the concern? It is this. The post-independence

generation,  who  are  now in their 30s and  early  40s,  had  a

certain  understanding of what multi-racialism meant.  It  meant

that the Government would consciously promote togetherness among

the races, throw everyone together in schools, in the SAF and at

the work place.  We will live together, have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>

friends  across  racial  divides, form  deep  friendships,  work

together  and in time, perhaps, forge a deep sense  of  national

consciousness  based on those shared memories.   The  Government

was  seen as the key to avoiding any sort of development of  our

society along communal lines.  In fact, the Government was  seen

at  the  forefront  of  breaking up development  along  communal

lines.   I  do not say that multi-racialism can only mean  that.

However,  that was how the practical application of the  concept

was  understood,  at least by some, and was  backed  by  a  high

degree of symbolism on the unity among the races.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that in mind, let us see the changes that have been

taking  place over the last few years, and their possible impact

on  our  existing  understanding of multi-racialism.   Take  the

school  system.  The structure of the school system now is  such

that  it  is  possible for very bright Chinese students  not  to

really mix, on a daily basis, in schools with students from  the

minority communities.  They could go through 12 years of  formal

education like that.  By the time they get to National  Service,

their  views would have been relatively formed.  They are  going

to  be  among the policy formulator of the future - the men  and

the women who are going to make this place tick.  What would  be

their  understanding of multi-racialism if they did not have  an

adequate opportunity to mix on a daily basis, as students,  with

members  of  other  races?  Whatever  we  say,  I  think  it  is

undeniable  that  their  empathy,  their  understanding  of  the

minority   communities  would  be  less  than  that   of   their

predecessors  who grew up in schools with members of  the  other

races.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us also consider the policy to create cultural elites

along   communal  lines.   It  will  succeed  with  the  Chinese

community.  However, let us be frank.  Is it really going to  be

possible to create such elites among, say, the Indian community?

Its  small  size would mean no significant cultural elite  would

emerge   and  even  if  it  did  emerge,  the  Singapore  Indian

population  base  would  be too small to support  that  cultural

elite.  That is easy enough to predict.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when we talk about developing cultural elites, in

practical  terms,  we  are  really talking  about  developing  a

Chinese  cultural  elite  as  a matter  of  official  Government

policy.  That is not to say that because there can be no  Indian

cultural  elite,  there should also not be  a  Chinese  cultural

elite.  That is nonsense.  What I am saying is that whenever  we

talk  about developing cultural elites, everyone should be clear

about  what it really means, so that we can again have  a  frank

debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the impact of these two polices and others like

them?   They  would not suggest any change to the commitment  to

multi-racialism as a concept.  However, over time, in  practical

terms,  there  could be a development of elites  along  communal

lines.   It could also lead to a situation where the top 30%  of

the  Chinese  population, the people who will  run  this  place,

having  a  lesser  empathy with the minority races.   That  will

represent  a  significant  change  in  how  the  minority  races

understand   multi-racialism  and  the  Government's   role   in

fostering  it.   Should we go down that path?   Since  any  such

change would be seen as deep lasting, there should be a thorough

debate on it so that everyone understands that position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can see the rationale for such policies. It is

possible  to  argue that for Singapore to survive, it  would  be

necessary  for  the  society to have deep cultural  roots.   The

onslaught   of   different   cultural   values   is   increasing

tremendously,  and it can be argued that the Chinese,  who  form

the  overwhelming  majority, have to  anchor  this  country  and

provide the bulwark against disintegration.  If that is so, then

it  is best to have that articulated clearly.  It must mean that

we  redefine the debate in terms of national survival.  We  will

have  to  say  that  it is necessary now to pursue  policies  in

education   and  culture  which  may  result  in   creating   an

environment  which is more communal at least  among  the  middle

classes, and we will have to say that that is necessary  because

the  very  survival of our society, as a society, is  at  stake.

That is an argument that rational members of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>

minority  communities can understand, whether or not they  agree

with it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it should be a debate which leads to an

understanding  of what is needed for our survival.   Without  an

understanding, you will have a situation where the policy makers

proceed   on  the  basis  of  overriding  concern  for  national

survival,  whereas the minority communities, and  in  particular

the  middle  classes, will be perplexed because those Government

policies which are being introduced, appear at variance with the

understanding of what multi-racialism, and the Government's role

in  fostering it, really is.  There will be no meeting of  minds

because  the parties will be arguing from different standpoints.

The letter by AMP in today's papers is one such example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any redefinition of the social compact would have a deep

lasting  impact.   It  must be a matter for any  Singaporean  to

think  carefully about, because what we are really talking about

is the social framework within which our children will live.  In

that  context,  if we are prepared to see a development  of  our

society,  along more communal lines, while we will still  adhere

to  the principle of multi-racialism, then so be it.  But let us

talk  frankly about it and whether such a development is  really

necessary for national survival.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I am calling again

for the abolition or, if the Government is not willing, then the

suspension  of  the Internal Security Act (ISA).   The  ISA  was

introduced  by  the British first as an emergency 1measure  when

there  was  a communist armed uprising in Malaysia in  or  about

1948, and then it was enacted as a formal law in the 1960s.  The

ISA was targeted against the communists and their supporters who

advocated  overthrowing  the legitimate  government  by  violent

means.  There was a justification in maintaining the ISA in  the

1950s,  the  1960s  and even the 1970s.  But in  the  1980s  the

social,  political  and  economic  situation  in  Singapore  was

markedly  changed.  In the 1980s onwards, the Singapore  society

was  more  settled.   The problem of race,  language,  religion,

unemployment and housing had been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>

basically  solved.  There was full employment and Singapore  had

become  a property-owning nation.  Under the circumstances,  the

ISA  stands out like a sore thumb, especially today.  It  is  an

anomaly  in a civil society where the Government is vested  with

such  draconian  powers.  The ISA gives the power  of  arbitrary

arrests to the Government without the necessity of charging  the

person arrested or bringing him to a court to be tried.  It is a

blatant violation of human rights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we mention the ISA in Singapore, one name comes to mind,

and  he  is Chia Thye Poh, who has been imprisoned for 23  years

under  the  ISA from 1966.  Chia was never formally  charged  or

brought to a court for trial.  There is only an allegation  that

he  was a communist and that he called for violent overthrow  of

the elected government of the day, which he persistently denied.

Even  up  till today, I believe Chia has not signed a confession

or  any  statement admitting that he is a communist or advocated

violence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a pity that the Government, when it releases detainees

under  the  ISA,  still attaches conditions and restrictions  on

them,  which make it difficult for them to seek employment.   As

an  Opposition Member, I am particularly concerned that the  ISA

should  still  be  strongly entrenched.  The very  fact  of  its

existence and mere threat of its possible implementation by  the

Government make very well-meaning professionals from joining the

Opposition  and take part in the elections on the  side  of  the

Opposition.   This  is  a  pity,  because  it  will  impede  the

constitutional  progress  of Singapore.   Singapore  shall  then

forever  remain  a paternalistic authoritarian state  where  the

possibility  of stagnation, rather than progress, shall  be  the

order of the day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that Singapore, being an urban society endowed with

widespread education and lack of illiteracy and a thick layer of

property-owning middle class, perhaps has the greatest chance of

succeeding  in  transforming our society  into  a  western  type

democratic country with modifications, of course, to suit our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>

local  conditions.  In such an environment, if it should happen,

people  can  work and live peacefully in a more  open  political

condition  where  the  arts  and  culture  could  flourish,  and

Singaporeans are given opportunities to become more creative and

innovative  and  where  our  economy  would  produce  goods  and

services with more value-added due to the added creative element

to  bring greater profits and income to our people, so  that  we

can  maintain  a  higher standard of living as compared  to  our

neighbours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government's aim is to achieve such a democratic society

for  Singapore, then it must make up its mind to  dismantle  the

ISA.   If the Government wants to be cautious and is not willing

to  take such a bold step, then I call on the Government  to  at

least  suspend the ISA, say, for a period of two years,  and  if

nothing untoward happens in those two years, to suspend it for a

further  two  years  and so on, until the day  when  it  can  be

totally  taken  off our statute books.  On the  other  hand,  if

something  bad does happen, the Government can easily  lift  the

suspension  and  make the ISA in force once again.   If  such  a

situation  does arise, I myself do not think it shall be  caused

from within but rather from without.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the feeling of Singaporeans towards the ISA, I believe

that  the  majority of them want the ISA removed.   Singaporeans

want  this troublesome baggage manifested in the ISA be a  relic

of  times  gone  by,  to be left behind  as  we  enter  the  new

millennium.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, women are under-represented in this House would, I think, be an understatement.

In  many  countries,  the  women  are  clamouring  for  adequate

representation in Parliament.  In India, there is a cry for  30%

representation, although it has not come into the  statute  book

as yet.  Political parties are vying with each other and, sadly,

we  have, in the case in India, where women who are elected  can

neither read nor write.  I do not want this situation to  happen

in  Singapore.  But I am appealing to the Prime Minister to  try

to  persuade more women to be in this House.  I will go one step

further and ask

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>

the  women MPs to persuade at least one MP to stand for the next

election.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, women are today in the forefront of every discipline and

every  aspect of life in Singapore and it should be so.  I  urge

the  successful  women to come forward and  serve  the  country,

maybe  as  an attraction, Sir.  In each GRC, we should  have  at

least  one woman MP.  And may I suggest to the male MPs  in  the

GRC  to give extra help to these women MPs.  I will go one  step

further to urge the Prime Minister to appoint in each GRC a full-time  MP who could be a mayor in the GRC and he could look after

the local needs of the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said earlier that women have climbed the ladder

of  success  and nowhere is this example more shining  than  the

Judiciary.  When I started in 1971, there was not a single  lady

member  on  the bench.  Now we have Justice Judith  Prakash  and

Justice   Lai   Siew  Choo.   Can  we  hope  to   have   similar

representation in this House, Sir?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your leave, could I move to the next cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, the integrity of the civil service

is  guaranteed under the Constitution.  An honest Government has

set  the  tone for the civil service.  The political  leadership

and  the  civil service work hand-in-hand to run the  Government

and  to  deliver  the goods to the people.  It is  an  important

value which has made our civil service an example to emulate for

other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, meritocracy is a fundamental philosophy and we should

adhere to it at all costs.  Never allow foreign or local element

to  endanger this basic philosophy.  If we allow quotas for  the

civil service, we are finished.  The best men must come in, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that there should be GRCs and multi-racial

representation in Parliament.  By the very nature of society, we

will  choose the best from each community.  But to say that  you

must be in the civil

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>

service and promoted because of your race is a dangerous trend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have set a very high standard for the civil service

and  it must be so.  As I said earlier, the political leadership

and  the  civil service work hand-in-hand.  I have two proposals

for the Government.  First, we should try to attract some of the

best  brains from the private sector for a short-term  stint  in

the  Administrative  Service.  Similarly, we  should  allow  our

civil  servants, not just in the statutory board and Government-linked  companies, to go for a short stint in the private sector

as  well.  I think this process will benefit both the economy as

well as the Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, in

moving  this amendment, I am of course pursuing what I  said  in

the  Budget  speech yesterday, and it was the cost of  governing

us,  which I said the budget estimated at about $14 billion.   I

raised  the  question of the money spent in the Prime Minister's

Office  last year.  But I do not think I got any answer.   So  I

wonder whether we can get an answer this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see from the estimates that the expenditure on political

manpower  has  increased  by some $428,400.   That  is  possibly

because,  last year, there was no provision for Senior  Minister

of  State  and Minister of State.  At least the posts  were  not

filled.   I suppose, this year, it looks as though there  is  an

intention to fill these posts.  The result is that we would have

about   five  Ministers,  two  Ministers  of  State,  a   Senior

Parliamentary Secretary and two Political Secretaries.  I do not

intend  to  read  the  work programme of  the  Prime  Minister's

Office.  But if one reads it, one is led to ask the question: do

we  really  need four Ministers and two Ministers  of  State  to

administer this programme?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would ask the Prime Minister if he would be good enough to

tell  us  exactly  the  functions and duties  of  these  various

Ministers  in  his  Department.   What  is  it  that  they   are

overseeing?   What  is it that they are doing that  deserve  the

salaries that they are paid?  The public has a right

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>

to  know  what  is it that they are getting for  what  they  are

paying.   So  I  hope we will hear from the Prime  Minister  the

functions and duties of the Ministers in his office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, if you will permit me and if there is time, say a

little bit on the amendment moved by Mr Simon Tay?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, under the rule of debate in

the  Committee  of Supply, could you restrict  yourself  to  the

topic that you have indicated you are speaking on?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I see. Can I not just say one or two words

on that amendment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is provided everybody has finished

speaking.  There are other Members who have indicated that  they

want to speak.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If there is time, you can come back to join

the debate.  Dr Tan Boon Wan.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, the Public Service

Commission  administers  the stable of Government  scholarships.

To  get a feel of the requirements of these scholarships let  me

read   out,  that  of  the  most  prestigious,  the  President's

Scholarship:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be Singapore citizens or children of Singapore citizens;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have offered four `A' level subjects and two `S' papers, if

they are in the Science/Commerce Stream;  and at least three `A'

level  subjects, an `AO' subject and one `S' paper, if they  are

in the Arts Stream, at the GCE `A' level examination;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have outstanding GCE `O' level and `A' level results with at

least three `A' level distinctions or equivalent qualification;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have taken SAT1;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have very good extra-curricular activities record; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have strong leadership qualities and impeccable character."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is very strong emphasis on academic excellence and this is

how  the  public  perceives PSC to award the scholarships.   You

will find the same

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>

emphasis  in the requirements of the other scholarships  in  the

stable.  The difference lies in the required number of subjects,

papers  or  distinctions.   Many  scholarships  offered  by  the

statutory boards and companies use these Government scholarships

as the base to formulate their own.  These scholarships are very

much  sought  after.   Parents  glamorise  the  scholarships  to

interest  and motivate their children to strive for them.   Each

year, I believe, thousands of students, especially the brightest

in the land, apply for them.  Many more thousands aspire for the

scholarships but do not do well enough to apply.  These students

prepare  themselves for years to meet these requirements,  their

attitude rubbing off on their fellow students in schools.  These

scholarship requirements thus profoundly affect what and how our

children, especially our brightest, learn in school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last two days, much has been said in this House about our

knowledge-based  future,  the  importance  of   creativity   and

innovation  to such a future and the need for a mindset  change.

We  tell our parents that we are preparing for such a future  by

making  changes to our schools to encourage more creativity  and

innovative spirit.  Some parents are sceptical, pointing to  the

mismatch  between this over-emphasis on academic  excellence  in

the scholarship and the call to our children to be more creative

and  innovative.  Since the Government scholarships have such  a

strong  influence on the mindsets of our young, may I  urge  the

PSC  to  review our scholarship policies to reflect the  growing

importance of creativity and innovation.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Sir, let me

take the points raised by the MPs one by one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Mr Simon Tay suggested that the Government should

monitor  discrimination and make sure that it does not become  a

problem, especially discrimination in jobs.  We are doing  this.

I  agree  with him that the correct approach is not  legislation

because  you  cannot legislate preference.   Personal  contracts

and  jobs are very much personal choices; whom you want to hire,

whom you do not want to hire.  You cannot cause a person to hire

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>

somebody else whom he does not want.  But we can set the  social

climate  so  as to encourage people to look at them  objectively

and not go on race or ethnic prejudices or biases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member may be interested to know that in fact we are working

out  some  tripartite guidelines on recruitment practices.   The

Ministry  of  Manpower has been discussing  this  together  with

SNEF, the employers' federation, and NTUC, the trade unions, and

they will be publishing their guidelines within a few days.   It

is  not  a  matter  which can be resolved by  publication  of  a

document.  But I think a cumulative series of gestures and moves

like  this  over a period of time will help to shape the  social

climate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Simon Tay asked about self-help groups and whether

they  could be encouraged to do more joint activities.  In fact,

they  do.   For example, CDAC, Mendaki, the Eurasian Association

and  SINDA run a joint social service centre in Toa Payoh, which

used  to be a community centre.  The community centre has  moved

and they have renovated the old building.  They jointly run this

social   service  centre.   And  they  also  have  other   joint

activities  regularly, for example, when we have community  days

or  multi-cultural days, the self-help groups get  together.   I

think they can do somewhat more because there will be times when

you  will have economies of scale, for example, running  tuition

classes or providing services, and we will encourage them to  do

so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shanmugam raised a basic question about our multi-racial

policies  and  whether our emphasis on SAP schools and  cultural

elites  runs  against  this and may cause  us  problems  in  the

future, and he gave the example of how people who grow up in SAP

schools now will be different from the earlier post-independence

generation who grew up in fully integrated schools.  I think  we

should cast our discussion in the framework of the situation  in

Singapore.  Where did we come from?  Where are we today?  We did

not  start  off a homogeneous society.  We are not a homogeneous

society.   In  fact, our starting point was schools  which  were

very substantially differentiated and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>

segregated, because many of the Chinese were in Chinese schools,

many  of  the  Malay  children were in Malay  schools,  and  the

English schools catered to a minority of the population.

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diversity can be a problem. But in our case, as we have brought

these  communities  closer together it  has  been  a  source  of

strength.   And  as I have explained during the debate  here  in

January  on  Chinese language, the fact that we have people  who

have come from Chinese school backgrounds like Hwa Chong, people

who  have come from English school backgrounds like RI and  ACS,

people with strong Malay roots or strong Indian roots, makes  us

a  diverse society with different strengths which are useful  in

different situations and the whole together is stronger than any

single one of the parts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diversity is a major factor for our national survival.

If we were all homogenized together, not only do the communities

not  want  it, because actually each community wants  to  retain

some  of  its own identity, but we would be the weaker  for  it.

Therefore,  what we are trying to do is to retain  some  of  the

strengths  of  these different ethnic groups and these  cultural

traditions,  while  at  the  same time  building  a  Singaporean

identity.  Not all of the top 30% of Chinese students attend SAP

schools.  For a start, RI and ACS would claim that they are  any

time  as good as Hwa Chong, and even apart from that, if we take

all  the  SAP schools as a whole, perhaps about 15%  of  Chinese

students  will be there.  Many good Chinese students do  not  go

into  SAP  schools; but we want some of them to go  through  SAP

schools,  because we think that there is something  valuable  in

the tradition of the SAP schools which we should try our best to

preserve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are really preserving in a new situation, something which

grew  out  of  specific historical circumstances of  the  period

after  the  war  in a different Singapore.  We  are  not  really

advancing  the  margins.  We are just trying to  maintain  in  a

transmuted form part of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>

what  was  good of the previous generation.  So, our society  is

not  becoming more and more segregated.  It is society  actually

becoming  more  and more unified but yet in unity,  we  want  to

preserve some of these strengths.  Between what we are doing and

the  extreme  possibility which Mr Shanmugam  has  presented,  I

think  there  is  a considerable difference which  is  not  just

quantitative but becomes qualitative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a trade-off, of course. It is not the same, learning

about  other  cultures vicarously, as it is having  a  class  of

mixed  students  -  Malays, Chinese, Indians and  Eurasians  all

together, having to accommodate one another.  But given that SAP

schools are something which we want to maintain, there are  ways

we  can work to minimise the disadvantages.  For example, we are

pressing  national education in the schools, both in the  formal

as  well  as  in  the  informal curriculum, to  bring  home  the

importance  of multi-racial harmony, and to organise  activities

and  programmes which register this message not just  on  paper,

but   through   actual  participation  and   experience,   joint

activities  with  other  schools,  opportunities  to  mix   with

students  of other schools, so that they could get to  know  one

another.   And  some of the SAP schools have regular  activities

which   involve  the  minority  cultural  groups.  For  example,

Catholic High School regularly invites Malay and Indian cultural

groups  to  perform or give talks during appropriate  festivals.

And  as  I  also  mentioned in January, Nanyang Junior  College,

which  is  going  to  have  a second Chinese  language  elective

programme, hosts annually a Tamil Drama Festival and it also has

a  very active dikir barat group.  It is a junior college  which

has   multi-racial  students  and  even  with  the  Chinese  LEP

programme  there,  I  hope  that  Nanyang  Junior  College  will

continue to promote the Malay and Indian cultural activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the SAP schools are now using English as the medium of

instruction.  They are teaching Chinese at a higher  level  than

other schools, and with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>

greater cultural content, but the main medium of instruction  is

English.   The  difference between a SAP school  student  and  a

student  who went to Hwa Chong and Chung Cheng or Catholic  High

30  years  ago, is that, now they speak the language  using  the

same textbooks as students who go to SCGS or RGS, or any of  the

other English schools.  So the gap is much less.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, MOE is clustering the schools. We are going to group

seven  or  nine  schools together in one  cluster  for  all  the

schools  in  Singapore  so that there  is  greater  sharing  and

interaction  between them.  SAP schools will be  part  of  these

clusters  and these clusters will have other non-SAP schools  in

them. There will be frequent joint activities with other schools

in the same cluster.  So, you are within the same family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, SAP schools are not the end of a person's formative

experience.  They go on to junior college, to national  service,

to  work and to university, and there they will learn to mix and

work  together  and  to relate to Singaporeans,  whatever  their

ethnic  group.  And feedback from our junior college  principals

has  confirmed that in fact the SAP school students have not had

a  problem  mixing with other non-SAP school students.   But  we

will  continue to keep the situation under close review and help

create  more  opportunities,  and we  welcome  suggestions  from

Members as to how we can do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong advocated abolishing or suspending the ISA.

He  says that we should become a western style of democracy with

modifications,   then   arts   and   culture,   innovation   and

entrepreneurship will bloom.  I do not believe that  anybody  is

restrained from trying to make a fortune in Singapore  for  fear

that  if he does so, he will be arrested under the ISA.  If only

it  was so simple to cause arts and culture to bloom.  There are

many  countries  without any internal security type  legislation

who would now be flowering in every direction today.  But it  is

not  so.  The ISA is a safeguard which we have had and which  we

have  kept  for  many years now and used very lightly  and  been

accepted

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>

by  Singaporeans as something which is necessary as part of  our

political landscape.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam said that Singaporeans want this removed, but he did

not  make it an election issue in the General Elections.   Other

people  who have made it an issue in the General Elections  have

lost.   One of them who made it an issue was Mr Francis Seow  in

1988,  after he had been arrested under the ISA and released  in

time  to  take part in the elections.  And when he  went  around

Eunos making speeches, it was quite instructive.  He did not say

that  we  should abolish the ISA.  He said, "I do not object  to

the  ISA but the PAP Government has misused it." He did  not  do

that  to  support the PAP Government or to support the ISA.   He

did  that  because he thought that that  was  the  best  way  to

collect  as many votes as possible.  I do not think anybody  can

say that the ISA has no political support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Chia Thye Poh who was under detention for many years, Mr

Chiam  See Tong said that he has never been charged and that  he

is  an  innocent man.  Mr Chiam should read the statements which

we  have put out which had explained how communist cadres in  Mr

Chia's chain of command, direct line of authority over Mr  Chia,

have  told  us  that,  "Yes, he was my subordinate."   And  much

later, a very senior communist cadre, who came back and whom ISD

debriefed, confirmed, that "Yes, he was one of our men."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allegations of Mr Chia inciting violence are not matters of

opinion.   He  made these speeches and one of the  speeches  was

published in a left wing trade union journal.  He was  not  just

an  anti-Vietnam  war  peacenik.  He was saying,  "Do  like  the

Vietnamese.   They  have armed revolution.  Our  conditions  are

similar."  Let  us  also  have armed revolution.  That  was  the

implication. These facts have not been rebutted.   He  said,  "I

have  not  been charged in court."  But he did not say  that  he

never said that, because it was published.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chia Thye Poh, you might say that was many years ago. The

problem of the communists or the marxists is much less

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>

now  because  communism has collapsed in Russia, in  the  former

Soviet Union, and China does not present the same sort of threat

as  before.  But there remain problems.  In 1987, Mr  Chiam  may

remember,  we arrested under the ISA four people, a Silat  group

who  had been stockpiling weapons, headbands, and they had  come

in  and  were  preparing to mount a riot.   If  I  have  such  a

situation, do I want to go through the motions of activating the

ISA which is suspended before I arrest them?  Can I wait till  I

get  enough  evidence in order to be able to prove the  case  in

court?   Or  do  I  want to act immediately and  deal  with  the

problem before it has gone out of hand?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1987 is not very long ago, but it was not the last case. When

Mr  Simon  Tay asked the question of how many people  have  been

arrested under the ISA, year by year over the last few years, he

expected  us  to say zero after 1987/1988.  And I think  he  was

surprised  to  discover that there were  cases  in  1997  -  two

persons  in 1998 - four persons, who were arrested and  detained

for  espionage.  We have not published a lot of details on these

espionage cases because we do not want to unnecessarily  inflame

relations and cause a public problem with countries or  agencies

which might have been involved.  But these are real cases and  I

have  consulted the Minister for Home Affairs just  now,  and  I

would  like to say that any MP who does not take my word for  it

but  would  like  to know more about these cases,  whether  PAP,

Opposition,  NMP  or  NCMP, could come  and  sign  the  Official

Secrets Act, and we will give you a fuller briefing of what  the

1997 and 1998 cases were about, and you will know that these are

real  cases.   They happen today.  We are not in  toyland  where

everybody can be taken at face value and all is well.  While you

maintain the smiles and a certain facade of normalcy, a  certain

amount  of cloak and dagger skulduggery continues all the  time.

And  that is one of the reasons, not the only one, why we  still

continue to need the ISA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai asked whether we are not under-represented with

women and whether we could not have some more in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>

the  House.   I heartily support his sentiments.   We  have  six

women in Parliament now including two Nominated MPs.  I wish  we

could  find more.  But it is not very easy.  If you compare  our

experience  with other countries, we have about  6.5-7%  of  our

legislature  who are women.  Most other countries, even  in  the

West,  only  managed 10-15% of women in their legislatures.  For

example, in the United States and most of Europe, except Britain

which, this time with the Labour Party, has brought in many  new

women  MPs.  The only exceptions are the Scandinavian countries,

Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland which have 30-40% - plus women,

but they are a totally different sort of society than we are.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty of getting women into Parliament reflects

something quite deeply structured within our society.  We should

try  to overcome this problem but I would be doubtful if  it  is

wise  or  possible to turn our society upside down  and  try  to

emulate the Scandinavian model.  Various countries have tried to

legislate  to overcome this problem.  He mentioned  India.   The

French are also thinking about 1this matter and in fact they are

thinking  about a constitutional amendment, a parity  amendment,

which  will  favour  equal access by men and  women  to  elected

office.  It is very vague, but if they have that amendment, then

they may have laws with quotas and rules and require parties  to

fill  40%  women,  and so on.  But it is quite instructive  that

some  feminists in France are against this idea.  You would have

thought  that  feminists  want to be upfront  and  demand  their

rights and have their percentage, and one per GRC.  But this  is

not  so.   And  one  of them, I quote from International  Herald

Tribune, March 3rd by Elisabeth Badinter, is against this.   She

said,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Parity is not a political matter, it is above all a matter of

principle,  of philosophy. The ideology of quotas breeds  sordid

and  humiliating  calculations.  Does  it  need  repeating  that

politics is above all an ideological choice that has nothing  to

do with sexual specificity?"

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is speaking about the French situation but I think what she

says is correct, and we have to accept this.  We cannot overcome

this  problem  with  quotas or by a forced arrangement.  As  our

society evolves gradually, it may become easier.  There are more

women  professionals  now  and  perhaps,  as  men  become   more

enlightened  and  play  a greater role in  looking  after  their

children and families and do their shopping, cooking and washing

up,  a few more women will be found in Parliament.  We will  try

our  best to find a few more by the next elections, and  I  hope

Members will help us.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Mr Shriniwas Rai's other question on the civil

service  where he strongly opposed ethnic quotas, and I  presume

also  sex quotas as well, I agree with his views.  We also place

great  store   on  the independence of the public  service,  and

therefore  the  key  role of the Public  Service  Commission  in

ensuring this.  And we have entrenched the position of  the  PSC

in  our  system  by  requiring  Presidential  approval  for  the

appointment  of  the Chairman and members of the Public  Service

Commission,  and  making  sure  that  however  we  devolve   the

authority and responsibility for personnel management within the

civil  service,  finally, the authority runs back  to  the  PSC.

There  is  an appeal to the PSC and there is a safeguard  there.

These  checks and balances will continue to ensure the integrity

of  the  civil  service, recruitment, appointment and  promotion

practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member's two specific suggestions to improve the

quality  of  the civil service: (1) to recruit from the  private

sector  on short-term contracts; and (2) to allow civil servants

to  be posted out to the private sector; I agree with both.   In

fact,  we  are  trying to do both, but it is  not  easy  to  do,

because there is a cultural difference between the civil service

and  the private sector, and it is not quite easy to bridge that

gap.   We  have to try, but we have had a small number  of  mid-career entrants; currently, two from the private sector, and  we

will  also  be sending out civil servants to the private  sector

for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>

attachments and secondment.  We have done a few but we  will  do

more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should point out, however, that the Permanent Secretary

in  charge of personnel visited the New Zealanders who are  also

trying  to  grapple with this problem, and they  also  have  not

found it easy to cross over this way and bring people in.   They

told  him  something very interesting, which is  that  when  you

bring  people in, for the first two years, they are very useful,

because they still retain their private sector mindsets.   After

two  years, they begin to think like civil servants and they are

not  unique  any  more.  So, these are matters of organisational

culture which we gradually have to overcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam asked about running costs of the Government,

which  is  $14  billion.  He asked why is it  so  much.   It  is

actually very little because $14 billion is less than 10% of our

GDP.   Our total budget expenditure is about 16-17% of our  GDP,

even  including  development expenditure, and it  compares  with

countries spending 30% of their GDP on the public sector in  the

West.  In Europe, it is probably 50%.  In Scandinavia, maybe 55-60%.   I  think  at 16-17% of the GDP, we are really  not  doing

badly.   I  am  not  saying that we cannot do better  and  every

dollar  is  spent optimally.  As Mr Lim Swee Say  said,  we  can

always squeeze a bit harder and make some savings and do better.

We will try.  But I would say that, overall, we are not absurdly

out of line.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of percentage of the labour force which the Government

accounts for, we are one of the lowest in the world.  I  have  a

table which shows that only 31/2% of the labour force is in  the

civil  service  in  Singapore.  The only country  with  a  lower

percentage  is Japan, which is 3.2%, but they have  130  million

people as a denominator.  Even Hong Kong, which you have thought

would  have a small civil service, has 5.6% of the labour  force

in  the civil service.  Malaysia has 10% and the UK has  9%.   I

think  that,  overall, we are not bloated.  There  are  specific

areas  to focus on and these are matters which we will  have  to

look  into.  The details of where we spend this $14 billion  are

fully given in the Budget book.  I do not understand why the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>

Member  said he does not know where the money is spent.   If  he

looks there, he will see who has been allocated how much and for

which Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked about the Ministers in the Prime

Minister's  Office  and why there are so  many.   If  I  may  be

allowed to list them, first, the Prime Minister himself, who,  I

presume,  the Member does not question.  Second, is  the  Senior

Minister who gives general advice to the Prime Minister and  the

rest of the Cabinet on many matters.  Thirdly, there is me, whom

the  Prime Minister has tasked with looking after MAS  and  also

inter-Ministerial  coordination, and  also  answering  questions

from  the Member.  Then there is Mr Lim Boon Heng who is elected

as  Secretary-General of the NTUC, and the  Prime  Minister  has

appointed  him  into the Cabinet, because we want  the  NTUC  to

understand  the national picture and we also want  the  NTUC  to

have a voice in the Cabinet.  Then there is Mr Chan Soo Sen  who

is  looking  after  CDCs.  He is in the  Ministry  of  Community

Development  and he also has half an appointment  in  the  Prime

Minister's  Office,  because  the Prime  Minister  is  taking  a

personal  interest in CDCs, because it is his project  which  he

launched.   Then there is Mr Zulkifli Mohamed who  is  Political

Secretary in NTUC and helps to keep the Prime Minister posted on

what  is happening on the ground in the NTUC.  So, I think  that

everybody does have a role to play.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Boon Wan asked about scholarship selection and

whether  we  are  over emphasising school results  in  selecting

scholars.   I do not believe so.  It is necessary to  have  good

school   results  to  be  considered  as  a  scholar,   because,

particularly   for   the  top  scholarships   like   President's

scholarship, SAF scholarship or the OMS scholars, we are  really

looking  for the most promising kids of the generation,  and  to

invest  our  hopes  on.  To start off, they need  to  have  good

school   results,  but  many  kids  have  good  school  results.

Nowadays,  4As will be 1,000 students; 3As maybe 2,000 students,

some phenomenal number.  So, the fact that you have As does  not

mean  that you will get a scholarship.  The scholarship  depends

on something extra.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1988, the Public Service Commission has been

sponsoring JC students to sit for the SAT1 and then those who do

well  are further sponsored by the PSC to sit for SAT2, as  well

as  TOEFL.  These are all standardised tests which are  required

for  entry into American universities,  and these are additional

information when the PSC assesses the students.  So  it  is  not

just  your book learning, but also the SAT results which measure

your  aptitude,  your  IQ, in a way, whether  you  are  able  to

reason, to argue, whether you have command of the language,  how

well  you  can  make sense of numerical and spatial information.

But  even  IQ  is not enough.  Because to win a PSC scholarship,

especially  the top ones, we are looking not just for intellect,

we are also looking for leadership qualities, character, values,

inter-personal  and  communication  skills,  and  commitment  to

Singapore.  It is a subject we had a long discussion on  in  the

last Budget debate, as Members will remember.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we want scholars to be adaptable, open to change,

handle stress well, and so forth.  It is a very demanding  list.

So,  to  select such scholars, PSC will look at the  candidate's

school  reports,  his ECA records, and the school  reports,  the

rating  by  his  principal  and his  teachers  of  his  personal

attributes, including his leadership ability, his integrity, his

inter-personal  and communication skills, and  creativity.   PSC

also  reviews his ECA records and pays attention to  whether  he

has  held leadership positions or made significant contributions

in   his   extracurricular  activities.   This  is  school-based

information.   But apart from this, the PSC also  requires  each

candidate to complete an essay about himself, his values and his

beliefs.  And then for the top scholarships, we require them  to

undergo  an  in-depth  psychological interview,  what  motivates

them,  what do they consider important, what are they interested

in,  what do they want to achieve in life, what has their family

background been, how have they coped with stresses and problems,

up to that point.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for the males, we check their national service records

to determine their attitude and performance in national service.

Of course, if he is going for an SAF or an SPF scholarship, then

we must assess the candidate's command and leadership ability as

well.   And  after  assembling all this data, the  PSC  requires

every  candidate  to  undergo  a  selection  interview  and  the

selection board has nine members and is chaired by the  Chairman

of  the  PSC himself and the other PSC members are on the board,

plus people from the private sector, plus academicians from  NUS

and  NTU,  or in the case of SAF and SPF, people from MINDEF  or

the  Ministry of Home Affairs.  I think we are quite rounded  in

our assessments.  We cannot be absolutely certain because we are

after  all  talking about somebody 18 years old and  we  do  not

quite  know  how  he will develop.  He goes to university,  four

years  overseas,  he  gets  new ideas,  his  views  change,  his

perspective  may change.  Sometimes they come back more  mature,

sometimes they come back different and we are disappointed.  But

these are risks we have to take.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are absolutely careful and we only want to take people who

are definitely going to do well, then I think we are going to be

too  risk averse, and we would not find high risk cases,  people

who could do well but, on the other hand, who might possibly not

succeed.    So what we want to do is to have a system  where  we

bring in people who are obviously good and, at the same time, we

take  reasonable  chance on people who have  a  good  chance  of

succeeding, and we also take a chance on people who are  not  in

the   conventional  mould  but  have  something  extra  in  some

directions, because we would like to include even mavericks into

our  system.  We are continually refining the process.  We  have

not  completed it.  We will probably never complete it,  but  we

hope  that year by year, we will be able to bring in more talent

and more people to contribute to the system.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, may I seek clarification on the answers

given  by the Deputy Prime Minister?  He speaks of each Minister

having  a role to play.  But my question was: would he  try  and

tell us

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>

exactly what duties are being performed by these Ministers?   He

mentions Mr Lim Boon Heng, NTUC Secretary-General.  Is he  doing

trade union work in the Prime Minister's Office?  Or is he doing

work  in  the administration?  I think the public would want  to

know that.  Why is he being paid by the administration for trade

union work?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, he mentions about the Senior Minister giving advice to

Ministers.   Do  Ministers still need a nanny  after  all  these

years?   And  do  we  still  have to pay  that  amount  for  the

occasional advice that is given?  Could we have clear answers to

these questions?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Lim Boon Heng is a full member of the

Cabinet.   His  views  on  matters reflect  not  just  his  NTUC

perspective  but his judgment on the issues, and we  have  found

this entirely valuable, and he makes a full contribution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Senior Minister, the Member clearly believes that he

is  not  worth his salary.  I am not sure how many other Members

in  this House or how many other persons in Singapore would take

that view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I return, Mr Speaker, to a point which Mr Shanmugam raised

which I did not address, which is whether we are only interested

in  the  Chinese elite, or we also would like Malay  and  Indian

elites   as   well.   As  a  practical  matter,   it   is   most

straightforward  to  maintain or to  build  up   Chinese  elite,

because  the  numbers are there.  But as a matter of  principle,

and  I  think  even  in practice, we want people  from  all  the

communities who master their cultural heritage, who  are  fluent

in  their own language as well as English, and who will be  able

to  maintain  that  community  in  Singapore,  not  just  as   a

Singaporean but perhaps with different ethnic features, but as a

Singaporean  who  has  got  the heritage  alive  and  continuing

through him.

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am afraid we have reached the

"guillotine"  on  this  Ministry.  Mr Tay,  would  you  like  to

withdraw your amendment?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay: Sir, I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for

his reply and I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $132,312,300 for Head V ordered to stand part of the

Main Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $41,968,700 for Head V ordered to stand part of

the Development Estimates.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head K -



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head K of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the total defence budget allocation amounts to 5.1% of

the GDP, still way below the cap of 6% of GDP set earlier by the

Government.  No sensible or rational Singaporean will quarrel or

object to such allocation for defence.  All one has to do is  to

consider  and  survey  the Asia-Pacific region  since  the  last

budget  debate we have in this House.  It is a region beset  and

riddled by economic and political crisis of one kind or another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now too familiar with such terms as economic

meltdown,  political upheaval, street riots,  currency  turmoil,

and collapse or near-collapse of governments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primordial forces have been unleashed. Fault lines have

surfaced.   There  is  concern over possible  waves  of  illegal

immigrants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Common-sense dictates that we must have a strong defence

capability.  Otherwise, we would be vulnerable.  We would be  at

the  mercy or whim and fancy of others, and then posterity would

judge  us:  that  we  have  failed in our  duty  to  our  fellow

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember that without a strong defence, there would

not be a Singapore.  We would not be able to uphold and preserve

our  Singaporean  way of life.  The time of regional  crisis,  I

believe,  is  also a time of reflection, a time of  bonding  and

indeed  a time of commitment.  I am sure our national servicemen

will  train even harder; that there is bonding across all ranks;

and there is a greater sense of camaraderie

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>

and  purpose.   We  can  also use this  period  to  sharpen  our

competitive edge in defence technology and operational skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If what is around us in the region is not obvious, we can

learn from Machiavelli, the 16th  Century strategist from Italy,

who studied the unfortunate fate of unprepared city states.  His

conclusion:  "The  foundation of a  state  is  a  good  military

organisation."  Or we can borrow a leaf from Sun  Tzu's  Art  of

War,  which  emphasises defence preparedness and readiness,  and

the  use  of  strategic planning and strategies to overwhelm  or

outwit  the  opposing side, with the help of balance  of  power,

deterrence and deployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 15th February this year, Total Defence Day was observed.

This  reminded us of 15th February 1942.  On that infamous  day,

the  British surrendered to the Japanese at the Ford Factory  in

Bukit  Timah.  We trusted the British to defend Singapore.   But

the  British instead surrendered.  The lesson of history is that

we  must  defend  ourselves.  Hence,  we  must  ensure  adequate

defence budget every year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is whether the Minister considers the defence

allocations  for defence adequate, whether the  budget  will  be

used  prudently  and cost-effectively, and whether  the  SAF  is

operationally ready to defend Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, Sir, I wish to ask the Minister to give us

his  reading  of  the  strategic situation in  the  region,  and

outline the possible scenarios that will face us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the measures that Mindef is taking to ensure that

the  SAF  is  operationally capable and ready to deal  with  any

contingencies that might arise?

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, in this year of recession, our

defence  budget for FY99, standing at $7.27 billion, is  roughly

the  same as that for FY98.  As the GDP is projected to  shrink,

in  terms  of  percentage of GDP, the expenditure  has  in  fact

increased to 5.1%, instead of 4.6% in FY98.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>

Both FY98 and FY99 expenditures are higher than those in FY97 of

$6.12 billion, ie, 4.17% of GDP.  Yet, FY97 was a year of budget

surplus while FY98 and FY99 are both deficit years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is quite natural that some among us might ask: what

is  the need to maintain or increase our defence expenditure  in

this time of tight budget?  It is also quite natural to ask what

is  so  urgent about our defence such that we must maintain  our

defence  expenditure.  Why should MINDEF be exempted from  belt-tightening as required by other Ministries?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the expenditure policy of the Ministry. If

we  look  at  the  expenditure pattern of a  defence  capability

comprising  a  weapon  system  and trained  personnel,  we  will

realise that it would consist of an initial purchase expenditure

plus  a  series of annual expenditures over its life  time.   In

other  words, it does have a long tail of expenditure.  So  even

if  we  stop  acquiring  new weapon systems  today,  it  is  not

equivalent  to an immediate reduction of our defence expenditure

because  much  of the annual expenditure has already  been  pre-established.   We  could  only  reduce  expenditure  if  we  are

prepared to let these functioning capabilities go to waste.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, often times, a steady stream of expenditure for

defence capabilities is indeed cheaper in the long run versus  a

feast  or  famine  approach.  In the  latter  case,  the  weapon

systems will fall into disrepair, personnel would be reallocated

or  lost  their  readiness due to lack of  training.   In  those

cases, the cost of refurbishing to bring those capabilities back

on line might even be higher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some might question why not defer the purchase of new

weapon  systems  like  the Apache Attack helicopters  until  the

finance of the nation improves.  I think it will depend  on  the

lead  time  of  putting  such  a defence  capability  in  place.

Typically, a sophisticated system like Apache needs a long  lead

time  to  place the order, for the machines to be delivered  and

the pilots and maintenance crew to be trained.  The elapsed time

is  typically three to four years.  Therefore, we should look at

the need of those weapon systems rather

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>

than  to  be  too  constrained by our decision based  on  budget

consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP, Mr Jeyaretnam, has asked who are our enemies in

his  speech yesterday.  He further said that instead of building

up our strong and credible defence capability, why not we depend

on  international  peace-keeping forces.  He  even  pointed  out

Kuwait  as  a  good  example  of international  intervention  in

aggression.  I think perhaps he has forgotten that by  the  time

Kuwait  was  liberated by the international forces,  it  was  in

total  ruin.   In asking to identify our enemies, the  NCMP  has

violated a taboo of international relationship.  Singapore wants

to maintain friendly relationship with every nation.  Hopefully,

we  will  never have an enemy.  I think the NCMP knew this  very

well because he has been told previously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, last year I suggested that he look up the origin

of  the Chinese proverb chian un tse wei to understand the  need

for  a  strong  defence  in peace time.   Perhaps,  he  has  not

bothered  to  look it up.  Therefore, he asks the same  question

again  and again.  Perhaps, he has also other motives in  asking

this question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in supporting our defence policy, the

Nominated  Member, Mr Simon Tay, suggested that we should  carry

out  dialogues to explain our defence expenditure so as  not  to

project an aggressive image.  This is so, especially at  a  time

when  the countries in the region could not even maintain  their

previous expenditures because of their economic difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we should remember that it takes time and

money to maintain a constant level of competence, expertise  and

readiness in our armed forces.  It would be unwise to reduce our

expenditure just because we are concerned about being  perceived

as  being  aggressive.  May I borrow another saying  from  Chuge

Liang, the famous military strategist from the Three Kingdoms in

ancient  China,  chiong ku tze ping pai how  tung.   This  could

roughly  be  translated as since the old time, those who  master

the   skills  on  the  use  of  arms  are  not  necessarily  the

aggressors.  Perhaps, those who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>

are  concerned  that  we are adopting a very aggressive  defence

posture should also read the ancient literature as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the budget allocated to the Ministry.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Zulkifli is not here. Mr Hawazi.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, all countries in the

region in Southeast Asia and East Asia, in general, have taken a

beating  as  a result of the economic crisis that we are  facing

now.  Some even face social and political turmoil and crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some of these countries turn inward to overcome their

own  political, social and economic problems, relations  between

neighbours  could become even more sensitive and, to  a  certain

extent, some even more strained than before.  Have all these had

any effect on the strategic situation in Southeast Asia and East

Asia   as  the  region  becomes more unstable  than  before  the

recession  began?  I could only assume so and therefore  support

our  defence  expenditure in order to enhance  our  own  defence

capability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could the Minister give his assessment of the

strategic and security situation in our region?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore is a small island amidst

the  seas of Southeast Asia.  Small as it is, Singapore  is  the

strategic hub or pivot, straddling the sea lanes from the Indian

Ocean  and the Straits of Malacca on the one side, and the South

China  Sea  in the east, and the Indonesian archipelago  to  our

south.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a port and a trading nation. We import and export

by  sea.   The security of the sea lanes and access to  the  sea

lanes  are  of vital concern to all of us.  The sea  lanes  must

therefore  be kept open at all times for food and  trade.   They

must  not  be  closed  off or controlled or  prevailed  over  by

unfriendly forces.  The sea lanes should also be protected  from

piracy  of all kinds. There has been a reported increase in  sea

robberies in the Straits of Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related to the security of the sea lanes are the claims and

counter-claims by various powers over strategic islands  in  the

seas,  for  example,  the Spratly Islands, Paracel  Islands  and

Mischief  Reef. There is much mischief, much to our dismay,  and

which does not bode well for the security of the sea lanes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore wish to ask the Minister for Mindef's

assessment  of the security of the sea lanes and  what  are  our

strategies for ensuring that the sea lanes are kept open for our

vital food supplies for trade, and also on the measures to  deal

with sea robberies in the waters near Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, in the course of recent

years, we have seen reports of rising incidence of piracy,  both

in  the  territorial and international waters around  Singapore.

Recently, a maritime report stated that piracy on the high  seas

remains  high with seven ship crew members killed in 79  attacks

in six months to June, with 36 violent cases reported.  This was

for 1997.  According to a report from the International Maritime

Bureau,  the number of casualties for 1997 had not changed  from

the  previous  year.  In fact, it is known that  Southeast  Asia

remains  the most vulnerable region for piracy attacks, with  31

attacks  in  1997, out of which 13 were violent.   On  30th  May

1997,  armed pirates injured an officer and shot dead a  captain

of the Singapore registered "M.V. Sinfa" off Batam island.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the economic crisis beginning to bite into the region,

one would expect the incidence of piracy to continue to rise for

the  year.  Such activities of buccaneering of the high seas are

unacceptable to us here in Singapore who traditionally  rely  on

the  safe  passage  of ships to ensure the  continuance  of  our

trading  activities.  Besides, the taint of having pirates  rule

the  high seas in the waters surrounding Singapore does not  add

much confidence to our desire to make Singapore a leading marina

in the region.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Police Coast Guard and the Republic of Singapore

Navy  carry the responsibility for the safety of our territorial

and international waters.  We are a maritime nation and it is in

our  interest to ensure that we are in a position to ensure  the

safety  of the ships' passage.  We should ensure that the  armed

services, whether it be the Police or the SAF, are in a position

to carry out that duty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether it is true that

there  has been an increase in the incidence of sea piracies  in

the  territorial and international waters around  Singapore  and

whether more measures can be taken to ensure the safety  of  the

ships' passage through Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, the use of smart bombs and cruise

missiles  by  the US Armed Forces in the conflicts in  Iraq  has

demonstrated the superiority of these weapon systems.  In  fact,

the  threat of air superiority and precision bombing has  forced

many  combatants to come to the negotiating tables.  The  latest

example is Kosova, the Albanian enclave which is trying to break

away from Serbia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, these weapon systems are very expensive. I

understand that each cruise missile costs $1 million.  But  they

are  effective force multipliers and could minimise the exposure

of  our troops to casualties.  Furthermore, they are also weapon

systems of tomorrow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to find out from the Minister how MINDEF

intends to take advantage of these technologies and whether  our

defence  doctrine takes into consideration such weapon  systems,

both on our side as well as on the other side.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, in view of the

prevailing   economic  and  political  uncertainties   and   the

possibility  of further deterioration in the security  situation

in  this region, as already mentioned by several speakers before

me,  could the Minister provide Singaporeans with some assurance

on  the capabilities and the operational readiness of the SAF in

addressing  any possible scenario in the security  situation  in

the region?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, there is a saying that old

generals always fought the last war.  They were not prepared for

the  next  war.   Drilled  in the old  methods  of  warfare  and

schooled  in the old doctrines of war, they could not grasp  the

impact of the new dimension of technological warfare.  They were

like ostriches with their heads stuck in the sand of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In World War I, for example, thousands lost their lives in the

Western  Front  as the generals could not fully  understand  the

deadly impact of the rapid-fire machine gun, nor thought of ways

to overcome it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In World War II, the tanks made its greatest impact, as the

Germans   demonstrated   in   the   Blitzking   campaigns   very

successfully.   The  Germans of all people realised  the  power,

shock effect and mobility of the tanks and fully exploited their

potential.   In  contrast, some armies were still training  with

horse calvaries on the eve of World War II.  At the start of the

war,  the  Polish  Army, for example, sent its  horse  calvaries

against the German tanks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, technology is indeed our friend. I am sure our

highly-skilled and technologically competent SAF  officers  will

maximise  to the fullest the use of technology in the selection,

purchase and application of military hardware.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, being small and with limited manpower and resources, we

have  all the more to focus on and to harness technology to  our

advantage.   Such  technology can also be  used  as  a  tool  in

training and simulation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our purchasing power, and highly skilled-technical

manpower,  we  can have the competitive edge through  technology

and  the use of IT.  It is not just muscle and brawn in warfare.

It is the age of electronic warfare, and the IT battlefield.  It

is indeed a technological contest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we lack in numbers, we can more than make up for in terms

of  technology, IT, firepower and mobility, whether it  is  air,

sea or land operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IT is being actively promoted in our schools and Singapore is

moving rapidly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>

towards a knowledge-based economy.  Our National Servicemen  are

now more prepared than ever to use IT.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore wish to ask the Minister whether we have done our

utmost  to maximise our cutting edge in technology and  IT,  and

whether  we  are  leveraging to the fullest  the  IT  skills  of

younger Singaporeans in enhancing our defence capability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, safety in training is of great concern to both parents and

National Servicemen.  Indeed, it is of vital importance  to  all

Singaporeans  as  each National Serviceman is  precious  to  us.

After  the artillery bomb explosion in New Zealand and the anti-tank  round explosion in the combing of blinds in the Pasir Laba

area,  MINDEF has reviewed and revamped the safety measures  and

procedures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore wish to ask the Minister to update this House on the

steps  taken to ensure safety in training, to promote a  culture

of safety consciousness, to ingrain safety in all aspects of our

training,  so  that  safety becomes second  nature  to  all  our

servicemen.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, the Minister for Defence had previously

informed this House that MINDEF takes training safety in the SAF

very  seriously and has implemented measures to further  enhance

safety.   Could the Minister provide figures on training related

injuries  in  the  SAF to indicate whether these  measures  have

indeed  been effective in reducing such injuries? And  what  has

been  done  in  the  area of search and disposal  of  unexploded

ordnance  at  our  live firing areas to enhance  safety  of  our

servicemen?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your kind permission, I would like to speak on my next

cut.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, during this period of economic downturn,

many  employers and employees, who are National Servicemen,  are

facing economic difficulties in their business earnings as  well

as   their  job  security.   Their  situation  may  be   further

exacerbated by the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>

untimely call up for in-camp training.  Could the Minister  tell

us  whether  there  has  been  an  increase  in  the  number  of

applications  for  deferment  from in-camp  training,  and  what

measures  are  being implemented to reduce the inconvenience  of

our NSmen without compromising our operational readiness?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also be grateful if the Minister could give us details

on  the  current MINDEF's policy on granting deferment from  in-camp training to our NSmen.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I am gratified that our Armed Forces

have trained in other countries and I would urge the Minister to

explore  further possibilities for two reasons: we have  limited

land space and airspace.  Also, it would allow our personnel  to

benchmark  against some of the best armies, as well as airforces

and navies in other parts of the world.  I think it is important

that  our personnel are well equipped, and by training in  other

countries,  they learn some of the areas which we  do  not  have

here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your permission, may I just touch on the question of

national defence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Government's move to allocate higher expenditure

on  defence.  We are a peace-loving people but we must always be

prepared for the worst.  Any suggestion that the United  Nations

will  come  to  help  is  a  wishful dream  and  an  unrealistic

expectation.   If our aggressors were to know and  realise  that

our  defence  is  intact, they will have second  thoughts  about

taking  us on.  Every citizen, and I repeat, every citizen  must

feel that our defence is our just cause.  We must be vigilant at

all   times.    It   is  no  use  building  all   the   economic

infrastructure  and  economic growth  if  we  do  not  have  the

capability to defend ourselves.  And I am glad that the majority

of  Members  in  this  House  have  agreed  wholeheartedly  that

national defence must occupy priority at all times.  It must  be

so,  Sir.  It is, of course, a substantial part of our GDP,  but

it must be so.  Other countries spend much higher than us.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>, we want to live peacefully with our

neighbours  and  we  have  no  ill  will  towards  any  of   our

neighbours, but we must try to defend ourselves and be  prepared

at all times.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, every year, we only have so many able-bodied men in each cohort for enlistment into National Service.

Available  manpower is thereby limited.  This is  compounded  by

the  low rate of birth in our population, and the fact that  the

SAF  has to depend on and recruit from Singaporean male citizens

and second-generation PRs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, with so many competing demands for the national pool of

talents,  the SAF has to fight for its share of top  talents  in

the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question for the Minister is whether the SAF is able to meet

all its manpower requirements, and what measures are being taken

to  ensure  that the requirements are met, and whether  the  SAF

scholarship schemes, the SAF Study Awards and the other  schemes

are  successful in attracting and retaining a fair share of  top

talents in the SAF.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, the SAF has over the years evolved itself

into an institution that is committed not only to the defence of

the   territorial  integrity  of  Singapore  but  also   as   an

institution  of  nation  building  which  fosters  a  sense   of

commitment and belonging to our own country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of the Malays in the SAF is not new, and it was

previously  debated  extensively in this  House.   At  a  Budget

debate 10 years ago, several Members spoke on the issue of Malay

participation  in  the SAF and had asked  whether  or  not  more

Malays  could  be drafted into such other services  as  the  Air

Force  and  the  Navy.   At that time, there  was  much  concern

expressed  by some Malay Members on the question of  whether  or

not  the  Malays can enjoy a higher profile in the  SAF  over  a

period of time.  Specifically, the hon. Member, Encik Othman bin

Haron  Eusofe,  asked the Minister to sketch a scenario  in  the

next five to 10 years on how multi-racial the SAF would be.   In

his reply, the then Second Minister for Defence, BG Lee

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>

Hsien  Loong,  said  that the SAF had made significant  progress

since  the 70s.  He said then that increasingly, more  and  more

Malays in the SAF doing national service had doubled since 1977,

and  were posted more widely in the SAF.  We were told then that

an  increasing number of Malays were also serving  in  sensitive

units like the commando battalion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, as more and more Malays were doing `A' levels and

getting on to university, there was also an increasing number of

Malays  who  were  qualified for Officer  Cadet  School  and  as

scholars.   Indeed, as early as 10 years ago,  there  were  even

Malay SAF scholars who were on local training awards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was 10 years ago, and indeed, 10 years on, I believe it has

changed  for  the  better.  Over the years, I believe  that  the

character and composition of the SAF has changed to reflect  the

character  and  composition of the population in Singapore.   We

have moved on and the issue at present is not whether the Malays

are  doing  National Service in the SAF but whether more  Malays

are  senior  officers  in the SAF.  In a recent  report  in  the

newspaper,  it  was reported that there are many senior  ranking

Malay  officers in the SAF, the most senior of whom  is  a  full

Colonel.  Indeed, there is also now a Malay pilot in the RSAF in

the  person of Captain Mohamed Zakir Hamid who earned his  pilot

wings in 1992.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the situation in the SAF with regard to Malay

participation  has  changed over the  years,  one  constant  has

remained,  and that is, the promotion into the higher  ranks  of

the  SAF  must  be  made  on  the basis  of  meritocracy.   This

principle  was reiterated by our DPM Dr Tony Tan in  his  recent

address,  wherein  he said that "for the SAF, meritocracy  means

that  so long as the person is committed to Singapore, dedicated

to  the SAF, and capable of doing the job, his appointment would

be based on performance and merit, and not by race".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support our DPM's statement on meritocracy for the SAF. It is

important  to bear in mind that the SAF is not only an important

institution for nation building

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>

but  it also has an operational role to defend Singapore against

armed  attack  in case of war.  It is imperative therefore  that

the  SAF  must be run purely on the ability of the  soldiers  to

bear  arms  and  to  use it effectively against  the  enemy.   I

believe that an organisation which promotes its officers on  the

basis  of  race would very seriously compromise its  operational

ability.

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very clear therefore that for the SAF today, where

promotion  is based purely on merits, the sky is the  limit  for

good  Malay  SAF  officers.  I can say that 34 years  since  its

independence,  Singapore  has  become  a  much  more  integrated

society.   In  the coming years, it is likely that we  will  see

more and more senior Malay officers in the SAF.  If there is any

doubt as to the prospect of Malay officers in the SAF, let it be

put to rest in this House.  We are not racists and do not intend

to be one.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, in recent weeks, there have been

some  discussions about the position of Malays in the  Singapore

Armed  Forces.  Certainly, this subject has caught the attention

of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was recalled by Mr Sin Boon Ann, Malays are known to

have  made  progress in the SAF.  It is noted  that  the  Deputy

Prime Minister and Defence Minister, Dr Tony Tan, has said  that

it makes no sense for the SAF not to appoint or promote officers

simply  because  they  are Malays.  Like in  other  professions,

meritocracy  is  the  basis  for appointment  and  promotion  of

officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a principle which Malays, like others, have

accepted  and lived with.  Bearing that in mind, Sir, could  the

Minister  enlighten  the House on how much progress  have  Malay

soldiers  made in the SAF?  For example, how many Malay soldiers

have  risen  through the senior ranks and won  scholarships  and

study awards given by the SAF?

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the

position  of  Malays in the SAF is now a widely discussed  issue

amongst members of the Malay

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>

community.  I think this is a good development because it  shows

that  we  can  discuss this matter quite openly and objectively.

In  the past many thought that this is a sensitive matter not to

be discussed.  But this is also an internal matter.  I think the

Malay  community has demonstrated their strong views  about  the

need to maintain this as an internal matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate also highlighted a number of important points

which I wish to raise here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Malays see their participation in the SAF as

crucial in reflecting their role in Singapore.  They want to  be

called up for National Service and prefer in fact to be enlisted

in the SAF than even in the Police or Civil Defence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Malays see the SAF as a key institution and have a

strong  desire  to  see sufficient number  of  Malays  occupying

positions in the highest level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are some who believe that to recognise the vital

role  the  Malays play in the SAF, there may be a need  to  help

them   accelerate  the  process  by  giving  them  some  special

positions to occupy top positions in the SAF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally have a similar wish to see suitably qualified

Malays  holding high positions in the SAF, not because he  is  a

Malay, but because he is good and who happens to be a Malay.   I

want to see a Malay General because he is a good General who has

earned  his  stripes.  I would like to see a  Malay  President's

Scholar  prepared to serve full time in the SAF.  Therefore,  we

must  make  sure that, while this remains our desire, they  must

earn  it  and  meritocracy must be the main determinant  of  the

selection process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, there are others who are also unaware of the progress

Malays  have  made  in  the SAF over the years.   Unfortunately,

whenever  this  issue  is being discussed and  featured  in  the

media, the same prominent commanders and pilots are highlighted,

perhaps giving the false

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>

impression  that  the  Malays have not made sufficient  progress

over this period of time.  Perhaps, the Minister could elaborate

this  and  hopefully enlighten the House on some of the progress

Malays have made and to allay some of their fears that there are

peculiar  policies  applied to the Malays  with  regard  to  the

enlistment,  recruitment and deployment of Malays  in  the  SAF.

Some still feel that there are many Malays who are exempted from

National  Service  and  the  various  high  training  programmes

available to them in the SAF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Sir, in connection with the other policies,

especially defence expenditure policies, I wish to highlight the

fact  that  we  cannot go on expanding our defence policies  and

putting  more  effort into it if racial issues  are  allowed  to

divide us.  I think it should not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that there was an earlier suggestion in the

House  that perhaps UN intervention could be one alternative  to

preserve peace and security with us.  I pray safe that they will

not  come  because when that happens, this is  the  end  of  the

country.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir,  Members have brought up many pertinent points relevant  to

our  defence  effort.   I will comment on  four  areas:  defence

relations, defence spending, people in the SAF and technology in

defence.  My colleagues in the Defence Ministry will address the

other  points  which  have  been  brought  up  by  Members  this

afternoon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the economic and political uncertainties which have beset

our  region  will continue into 1999.  Although there  are  some

positive  indicators on the economic front, we are  not  in  the

clear  yet.   We  cannot  be sure how the  global  economy  will

perform  this year.  The last two years have shown  clearly  how

events   can   take   sudden  unexpected  turns   with   serious

consequences for political and social stability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, questions of defence relations have been brought up in

different forms by Dr Ong Chit Chung and Mr Shriniwas Rai.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>

This  climate of uncertainty which prevails in the region  today

requires  more  focused efforts by countries in  the  region  to

ensure  regional peace and security.  Singapore's policy  is  to

build   a  security  architecture  comprising  strong  bilateral

relationships    interwoven    with    multilateral     security

arrangements.   We  believe that such an architecture  helps  to

develop  understanding  and trust and to foster  an  environment

which  allows difficult issues to be discussed and disagreements

to be resolved peacefully.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) is an example of

a  multilateral arrangement which has served its  members  well.

The  FPDA  has  been in place for 27 years and its members  have

found  it  to  be  of  value.  Over the  past  few  years,  FPDA

exercises  and  activities  have  been  progressively  enhancing

professional value.  The FPDA can be as useful and  relevant  as

its members want it to be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the bilateral front, our defence relations with a host

of countries both in South East Asia and outside the region have

been  expanding  in the scope and depth of the interactions  and

cooperative  activities.   These  include  SAF  access  to   the

training  facilities of our friends which is  valuable  both  to

make  up for our own lack of training land and airspace as  well

as  to  allow  the SAF to benchmark itself against  other  armed

forces.   The SAF has valuable training facilities in  countries

such  as Indonesia, Brunei, Thailand, Australia, France,  Sweden

and the United States.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the US, we also believe that the US military

presence  in  our  region  contributes  to  regional  peace  and

security.  For that reason, we have opened some of our  military

facilities   for   use   by  US  armed  forces.    Our   defence

relationships  are  valuable  relationships  from   which   both

Singapore and our partners derive benefit.  In most cases, there

is  keen  interest  on both sides to see how  we  can  build  on

interactions and cooperation for even greater mutual benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on defence spending, a topic touched on by Dr Ong Chit

Chung  and  Dr  Wang Kai Yuen, we must have a  credible  defence

capability to ensure

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>

Singapore's continued security and success and in order that  we

can  also contribute to regional peace and security.  Our policy

on  defence spending is to cap it at 6% of the GDP regardless of

whether  the  economic situation is good  or  bad,  although  in

practice  we  have  usually spent less.  We  take  a  long-term,

steady  approach because defence planning is a long-term process

which  requires prudent and steady investment over  many  years,

both  in  people  and money.  In this way, we  ensure  that  the

development of the SAF proceeds smoothly and efficiently.  In  a

way,  we  ensure that our defence requirements are well met  and

that foreign investors have the confidence to invest their money

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this policy has served us well. Today, we have an armed

forces,  the  SAF,  which has helped to  make  it  possible  for

Singapore  to  remain an oasis of calm amidst  the  turmoil  and

uncertainty in the region.  The SAF safeguards our security.  It

gives  Singapore  more room to adopt policies and  take  actions

which  best serve our interest.  Hence, no one is tempted,  just

because Singapore is a small country, to have aggressive designs

on us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the topic of people in the SAF, particularly some aspects

of  Malays in the SAF, and the recruitment of manpower  for  the

SAF  were touched on by Dr Ong Chit Chung, Mr Sin Boon  Ann,  Mr

Hawazi  Daipi  and Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin.  Sir,  the  highly

capable  SAF that we have today is the result of many  years  of

investment,  not  only  in  equipment  and  hardware,  but  more

importantly in people.  As Dr Ong has said, we must continue  to

attract and retain good people to join the SAF.  And it was with

this objective in mind that last year MINDEF launched a Manpower

Management  Initiative "The New Partnership Programme"  for  the

uniformed  officers corps.  The objective of the New Partnership

Programme  is  to provide a first-class career to  our  officers

that  is  both  challenging and rewarding.  The New  Partnership

Programme includes changes to the career structure, remuneration

package,  career  management and performance management  of  our

officers.  MINDEF has implemented most of the measures  in  this

initiative last year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, it is not enough only to make changes to the

career  structure  and  remuneration benefits  of  its  officers

corps.  The SAF needs good people at every level to ensure  that

it  can  continue to perform its role effectively.  The  Warrant

Officers  and Specialists corps is just as important,  as  WOSEs

form the backbone of the SAF.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having reviewed and revamped the management of the officers

corps,  MINDEF  has  embarked on a total review  of  the  career

structure  and remuneration benefits of the WOSEs  corps.   This

review  will  take an equally in-depth look as for the  officers

into  the  career structures and the aspirations of  WOSEs,  and

will  make  recommendations on how the manpower systems,  career

management,  and  performance management of  the  WOSEs  can  be

improved.  The study is in progress and the recommendations will

be  implemented starting in April next year.  When the  measures

are  in place, we will enhance the SAF's ability to attract  and

retain quality men and women at all levels, and better equip the

SAF to meet the challenges of the 21st century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF has always emphasised quality manpower. To that end,

the  SAF,  like all sectors of Singapore society, works  on  the

principle of meritocracy.  This means that so long as  a  person

is  committed to Singapore, dedicated to the SAF, and capable of

doing the job, his appointment and advancement will be based  on

performance  and merit.  Regardless of whether  he  is  Chinese,

Indian  or  Malay,  regardless of  what  his  religion  may  be.

Meritocracy  is  an  important ingredient in  the  cohesive  and

operationally  ready SAF that we have today.   I  have  said  on

another  occasion, and I will say it again this afternoon,  that

it  makes  no  sense  for the SAF to deny an  appointment  or  a

promotion to an officer simply because of the officer's race  or

religion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some Members have asked about the opportunities available

for  Malays to progress in the SAF.  There are today many  Malay

commanders - officers, warrant

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>

officers  and  specialists - in the  SAF.   They  serve  in  the

various arms just like their non-Malay counterparts.  As  Malays

progress  up the educational ladder, they will also qualify  for

more and higher appointments in the SAF.  A higher proportion of

each  cohort  of  Malay enlistees now possesses the  educational

qualifications  for selection for training to be  commanders  in

the  SAF.   There has been a corresponding upward trend  in  the

proportion of Malay enlistees selected for Officer Cadet School,

and  in  the  number of Malays serving their full-time  national

service as officers and section leaders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of Malay commanders in the SAF today reflects the

educational attainments of the community and compares favourably

with  the proportion of Malay managers and professionals in  the

economy.   About half the Malay regular officers are  graduates.

The SAF encourages promising young Malay officers who intend  to

make  a career in the SAF to further themselves.  They are given

scholarships to go to university, like other deserving  officers

in  the SAF.  Malay officers have been consistently getting such

awards since the early 1980s.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on technology in defence, a point brought up by Dr Ong

Chit  Chung, besides good and committed people, it is also vital

that  the  SAF  makes use of technology to  give  us  the  edge.

Technology  is  a  strategic tool for  the  SAF.   Manpower  and

resource   limitations  dictate  that  the  SAF   must   harness

technology  as  a  force multiplier to enhance  its  operational

capabilities.   In  the  modern  battlefield,  technology  is  a

critical  factor.  The odds favour the side that makes best  use

of   technology.   Therefore,  we  have  to  be  proactive   and

innovative in exploiting technology for our defence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, the Defence Technology Group (DTG), which is the

engineering  and scientific arm of MINDEF, has  built  a  strong

technological  base.  We have invested in facilities,  equipment

and,  most  importantly,  in some of the  best  engineering  and

scientific  brains in Singapore to handle advanced  technologies

needed  by the SAF.  Today, the DTG is a smart defence equipment

buyer

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>

as  well  as  a  technology application leader with  world-class

capabilities  in systems engineering and integration.   DTG  not

only  buys  the best equipment off the shelf, but  develops  in-house  expertise  to  modify, customise and upgrade  systems  to

maintain the SAF's technological edge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we approach the 21st century, the challenge for MINDEF

will  be  to maintain and sharpen this strategic edge.  In  this

regard,  there are two key driving forces in technology that  we

cannot ignore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, technology advances at a phenomenal rate. New technology

and systems emerge, then become obsolete at an exponential pace.

The  modern battlefield is rapidly evolving.  We must  therefore

ensure  that we will not have to fight today or tomorrow's  wars

with yesterday's technology.  Hence, we must be able to keep  up

with the rapid technological changes and continue to stay ahead.

However,   rapid  technological  advancement  will  mean   ever-increasing  demands on Singapore's limited pool  of  engineering

and scientific talent.  Yet it will be impractical for MINDEF to

simply  continue to expand its engineering talent pool, as  this

would   distort  the  deployment  of  the  national  engineering

resource.   Instead  of simply growing larger,  we  have  to  do

things  smarter.  DTG needs to be nimble enough  to  effectively

tap  on external engineering expertise to transcend our manpower

limitations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, unlike in the past, today's defence applications no

longer  lead technology advancement.  Some of the most  advanced

technologies are developed by commercial companies.  We must  be

able  to  quickly  seize  opportunities for  collaboration  with

external   organisations  to  stay  at  the  cutting   edge   of

technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is imperative that we find new ways of repositioning and

re-organising  ourselves to ensure that we are  well  placed  to

meet  these challenges.  At present, the DTG in MINDEF  provides

the whole range of technology functions, from policy formulation

to  acquisition, maintenance and development.  This  arrangement

has  helped MINDEF to build up our defence capabilities quickly.

But it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>

may  not  be  nimble  enough for us to meet  future  challenges.

MINDEF  has therefore decided to restructure the DTG  to  better

meet  the  future  challenges.  The  core  policy  and  resource

allocation   functions   will   be   retained   within    MINDEF

Headquarters,  while the executive and implementation  functions

of DTG will be undertaken by a separate entity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF will set up a new statutory board, to be called the

Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) by 1st April  2000.

The  DSTA  will  serve  as  the  Ministry's  executive  arm   in

implementing defence technology plans while the Ministry retains

the  policy  planning  and resource allocation  functions.   The

DSTA's key roles will be to conduct defence R&D, acquire defence

material, and develop military infrastructure.  It will also act

on  behalf  of  MINDEF  to  promote and foster  the  development

capability among the defence science and technology community in

Singapore.  The statutory board will continue to provide  inputs

and  advice to assist MINDEF in policy formulation.   In  short,

the  fundamental organising principle for technology in  defence

is  that  MINDEF  will determine what should be done  while  the

statutory board is free to determine how best to do it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transforming the DTG into a statutory board is the most

optimal  framework  as it offers operational  flexibility  while

ensuring  MINDEF's  overall control.  Under the  new  structure,

MINDEF  will  be  able to maintain a balanced  focus  on  policy

issues.    We  will  not  be  overly  influenced  by  technology

implementation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, DSTA will have the autonomy to operate in a

fast   changing  environment  for  the  development  of  defence

technology.  It will have flexibility in personnel management so

that  it  can  gear itself to meet the competition  for  quality

engineering  manpower.  DSTA will also have more flexibility  to

strike  up  strategic  alliances  with  strategic  partners  and

leverage  on  the  expertise  and  resources  of  others.    The

restructuring  will allow DSTA more space to be more  innovative

and responsive to emerging

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>

technologies  and  to  try out best practices.   DSTA  can  also

operate   more   efficiently  using  market  and   world   class

organisations  as performance benchmarks.  And because  DSTA  is

given  the  autonomy  to form partnerships, MINDEF's  technology

needs  will  be  met  through the increased  use  of  commercial

technologies  and collaborations with research institutions  and

companies.   This  will  alleviate  the  strain  on  Singapore's

engineering and R&D manpower resource, and help us transcend the

limits of growth imposed by our limited manpower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members will remember that MINDEF had corporatised the

Defence  Science Organisation (DSO) two years ago  in  order  to

give  it  more flexibility to manage its people, and to  subject

its  R&D  efforts  to  the discipline of  the  market-place  for

greater efficiency and responsiveness.  That was only the  first

step  in  the strategic shift in how MINDEF positions itself  to

meet  the  challenge  of defence science  and  technology.   The

restructuring of the DTG will allow us to complete  the  process

of building high performance organisations to better anticipate,

respond to and exploit the future trends and challenges  in  the

technology sector, so that the SAF can continue to receive world-class technology support to help it maintain its strategic  edge

into  the  next millennium.  MINDEF will table a  Bill  to  seek

Parliament's approval to set up the DSTA in due course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with the setting up of DSTA, MINDEF is

reviewing  whether  the  rest  of  MINDEF  Headquarters  can  be

restructured  so  that MINDEF can carry out its  core  functions

optimally.   At  the  time  of  our independence  in  1965,  our

immediate   priority  was  to  quickly  build  up  our   defence

capability.  We did that very well by having a MINDEF  that  was

self-contained and hence able to respond quickly and effectively

to the nation's defence needs.  However, MINDEF and the SAF have

grown in maturity and size since those early days.  It is timely

to   examine   whether  a  leaner  Ministry  headquarters   that

concentrates on anticipating and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>

exploiting  defence trends and challenges can  better  meet  our

defence  needs.  This concept is akin to the practice of 'right-sizing' in the world of business.

<br>2.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have decided to set up a task force to be led by

Minister  of  State  Mr  David Lim to  conduct  a  comprehensive

organisational  review of MINDEF.  The task force  will  examine

the  organisational  structure  of  the  Ministry  headquarters,

MINDEF's  relationships with the SAF, the DSTA and  the  defence

industry, and its decision-making support infrastructure.   When

the  task force has delivered its recommendations and these have

been implemented, the result will be a Defence Ministry that  is

correctly  geared  to  define  problems,  formulate  strategies,

establish   policies   and  allocate   resources   for   maximum

effectiveness in developing Singapore's capability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a credible defence force does not depend only on

hardware  and capable people.  A credible defence force  depends

ultimately  on "heartware".  At the core of Singapore's  defence

capability  must  be the will of each and every  Singaporean  to

defend our nation.  The economic crisis has brought home  to  us

the  importance  of  Total Defence.  We have seen  how  critical

strong social cohesion is when countries are faced with a severe

crisis.  As new challenges emerge, our cohesiveness and unity as

a  people will be further put to the test.  We must continue  to

remain united and face these challenges together.  We must leave

others  with  no doubt that Singaporeans are a cohesive  people,

united  not  only  in  good times but also in  facing  difficult

times.  That we are a people who will not allow ourselves to  be

exploited  by  those  who  may try to  play  on  our  fears  and

vulnerabilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why MINDEF makes it a point to remind our people,

especially young Singaporeans, of the need for a strong national

defence, as well as of the important contributions that each and

every  Singaporean  can  and must make to  enhance  our  defence

capability.  In the SAF, we have had for many years a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>

National  Education  programme  which  reaches  out  to   NSmen,

regulars and non-uniformed personnel.  MINDEF also works closely

with  the  Ministry of Education, and conducts its own  national

education   programmes  for  school  children,  so  that   young

Singaporeans  have a greater awareness and better  understanding

of  defence  and  security  issues. Sir,  Singaporeans  have  to

understand why we cannot take our security for granted  and  why

each  and  every  one of us has an important  role  to  play  in

ensuring the security of our nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to end my remarks this afternoon by quoting

from  a letter which was published in the New Paper last Friday,

5th  March  1999.  The letter is from 3rd  Sergeant  (Reservist)

Chong Yu Meng on his experience during national service and what

the SAF means to him.  I quote from 3rd Sergeant Chong's letter:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I remembered being really terrified of going into the Army

when  I  was 17  -   right up to the day I turned up at the  old

CMPB near Holland Village.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was scared because I was unfit (I couldn't even do one chin-up back then, and my running time for 2.4 km was 13 minutes and

35 seconds), and I didn't know what to expect at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The training was tough and sometimes I felt really miserable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to moan about feeling cold, wet, tired, hungry, thirsty,

sleepy and sometimes nervous  -   all at the same time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time I "turned operational", the Army had turned me

from a 69 kg weakling into someone who could do at least 18 chin-ups,  run 2.4 km at the speed of 9 minutes and 15 seconds (which

was pretty fast for me then).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in a Junior College before entering the Army. I

lived  in  a nice cosy world where everyone I knew came  from  a

nice  family  and is reasonably well off, and University  was  a

natural progression.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the Army, I began to see that the world is a lot more

diverse than I could ever imagine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met people who came from broken homes and some who were thrown

out by their own families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, people who have had a much, much harder life than I.

But  I remember these men as loyal, faithful and honourable  men

who will not abandon you if things got rough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that if the need ever arises, and we have to

fight, these men will not let us down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever I go back for Reservist training, I try to keep

that in mind.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their sacrifice is greater because they have no other

recourse   -   they  can't simply emigrate and it  is  extremely

difficult for them to go to university.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 3rd Sergeant Chong concludes his letter by stating

that the lesson which he learned from his experience in the army

is  a  simple one, and I quote again from his letter.   This  is

what he says about what he learnt from his army experience:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whatever you can't defend, doesn't belong to you.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last sentence of 3rd Sergeant Chong's letter, to me,

sums  up  more  eloquently than any words which  I  can  say  to

explain why defence is important to Singapore and why we need  a

strong SAF.  "Whatever you can't defend, doesn't belong to you."

In  this time of uncertainty, Sir, a sustained and steady effort

to  maintain and enhance our defence capability is our guarantee

that  all  that we have built up in Singapore over the  last  35

years  will  belong  to  us.  A strong  SAF,  supported  by  all

Singaporeans  through  their commitment to  Total  Defence  will

ensure  that we will not only emerge from these difficult  times

unscathed  but continue to enjoy peace, stability and prosperity

into the next century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much obliged, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I propose to take the break now.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Second Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Defence (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b>

Thank you, Mr Speaker,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>

Sir,  for allowing me to respond to points raised by Members  on

operational readiness and safety in training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the SAF we have today is the result of years of

investment  in people, equipment and doctrine.  It is  a  modern

and  well-integrated fighting force, operationally ready to deal

with  any contingency that involves our national interest.   The

SAF's  operational  readiness  is  maintained  through  frequent

mobilisation  exercises and realistic training.  The  string  of

missions  which  the SAF has successfully executed  when  called

upon   to  do  so,  at  short  notice,  testifies  to  the  high

operational  readiness state of the SAF.  As a  recent  example,

the SAF was called upon to help evacuate Singaporeans caught  in

the  midst of factional fighting in Cambodia.  Sir, not only  is

our  equipment ready and our men trained, but our servicemen are

ready  to do their duty.  Surveys conducted regularly by  MINDEF

indicate  that our full-time national servicemen and  NSmen  are

highly committed to defend Singapore.  98% feel that they have a

part to play in defending Singapore while 90% say that they  are

ready and prepared to risk their lives to defend Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Results from our mobilisation exercises have also been

consistently  very  high.  The  percentage  of  NSmen  who  have

deferred  their  in-camp training has also been  very  low.   In

addition  to  this  data, anecdotal evidence and  feedback  from

visits to units by members of the MINDEF headquarters and senior

commanders,  show  that our NSmen take their training  seriously

and  are  convinced that we should have a strong and ready  SAF.

MINDEF  and the SAF have also put in place programmes  to  brief

and  update  our people regularly on recent developments.   This

will  help our servicemen to understand the continuing  need  to

play their part in ensuring that we have a strong defence.   The

Government will continue to ensure that the SAF is operationally

ready  to  deal with any contingency.  Sir, I am sure that  when

the "green man" flashes, our soldiers will be there.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safety management is taken very seriously in the SAF, and

is  supervised  personally by the Chief  of  Defence  Force  who

chairs  the  Committee for the Promotion of  Safety  Efforts  in

MINDEF.   Down  the  line, every division  or  formation  has  a

formation safety officer whose role is to ensure that the  units

in their division or formation train safely.  I mentioned at the

last  Committee  of Supply  the measures taken  by  the  SAF  to

enhance  safety.  Since then, new measures have been  introduced

to  further  strengthen safety consciousness.   Apart  from  the

mandated   safety   courses,  briefings  and  procedures,   unit

commanders  are  encouraged  to hold safety-related  activities,

such   as  seminars  and  many  exhibitions  to  promote  safety

consciousness  in their units and among their  men.   They  have

also   been  given  the  authority  to  purchase  safety-related

equipment or material not found in the SAF inventory should they

decide that this is needed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since November 1997, we have also engaged the Southern

California  Safety  Institute  (SCSI),  which  is  a  leader  in

aviation  safety since 1987.  The SCSI provides safety  training

to  the  United States Air Force.  The SCSI has been engaged  to

run  four  Risk  Management Courses for our army officers.   Two

more  SCSI  courses have been planned for the coming work  year.

These  courses  will  supplement the many  in-house  courses  on

safety.   The  SAF also has links with other safety  institutes,

including  the US Army Safety Centre to tap their  expertise  in

risk management.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before carrying out any training or administrative task,

commanders  are required to go through a structured  process  to

assess   the  potential  risks.   This  enables  commanders   to

systematically  identify potential hazards  that  require  extra

precautionary measures or commanders may decide to modify or  to

go  ahead  with the activity, after considering all the  various

factors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safety briefings are also carried out before every exercise.

Safety information and lessons learnt from past training

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>

accidents  are now disseminated through the Army Safety  Website

in  the  Army Intranet which was launched in January this  year.

One  of the major causes of injuries in the SAF is road accident

and  several  measures have been taken to enhance  road  safety.

These are: before a driver is allowed to drive on his own during

an  overseas  exercise, he is required to undergo a  minimum  of

four  hours  of  day driving and two hours of night  driving  to

orientate him to driving in that country and in those conditions

under supervision so that the driver would know the terrain, the

road  condition and the traffic condition so as to minimise  the

risk  of  accidents.  Driving simulators are being  acquired  to

better  prepare our drivers to cope with the complete  range  of

hazardous  traffic conditions and terrain which they are  likely

to encounter locally and overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also concerned about road safety when our servicemen are

not  training  or  on official duty.  To reduce  the  number  of

motorcycle  accidents  involving  our  regular  servicemen,   we

subsidise  half the cost of a defensive riding course  conducted

by  any  of  the  professional driving schools.  The  number  of

fatalities  that occurred during training has fallen from  three

in  1997  to one in 1998, while the number of injuries requiring

hospitalisation fell from 72 in 1997 to 50 in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, any training injury or death is one injury or death too

many  for  the  SAF.   We  will  continue  to  inculcate  safety

consciousness and find ways to reduce training injuries  through

improving training safety.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked about the clearing of unexploded oddment

or  blinds at our live firing ranges to ensure the safety of our

servicemen.  A blind clearing contractor has been engaged by the

SAF  to  clear blinds in the SAFTI live firing areas once  every

three  months.  And blinds found during the search are destroyed

on the spot by the contractor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Defence (Mr Matthias Yao Chih):

Sir,  may  I  respond to the question from Mr Charles  Chong  on

deferment from in-camp training.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our NSmen form the bulk of our defence force. They

are  our  frontline troop and have to be kept at high  state  of

operational  readiness  to  respond  to  any  contingency  at  a

moment's notice.  The training and military proficiency  of  our

NSmen should not be compromised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NSmen need to train together to be an effective fighting

force.   The  absence of a single NSman can  affect  his  unit's

cohesion,  morale  and operational readiness, especially  if  he

holds  a  critical appointment.  Deferment should  therefore  be

granted only in exceptional circumstances beyond the control  of

NSmen and their employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our NSmen and employers understand the need for NS call ups

and  have been supportive of their employees' attendance of  in-camp  training.   The  NSmen deferment rate  has  not  increased

despite the current economic downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison, in 1995, of the 87,000 NS call ups, 4,500

(or  about  5%) were deferred on the grounds of work commitment.

In  1998,  of the 98,200 call ups, 5,100 were granted deferment.

The deferment rate remains stable at about 5% of total call ups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, MINDEF is mindful of the need to minimise the

demands imposed on NSmen and the inconvenience to their work and

other  commitments, especially during this period.  In  general,

NSmen  are given at least six months of advance notice  so  that

they and their employers can make the necessary arrangements  to

cover their jobs during their in-camp training period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we are constantly reviewing and streamlining

our NS training system to ensure that the duration and frequency

of  call  ups are kept to the minimum.  For example, MINDEF  has

shortened  the  duration  of  the basic  combat  training  (BCT)

programme  from three days to two days, and the  number  of  BCT

sessions in the 13-year NS training cycle has also been  reduced

from seven times during the cycle to five times.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF has also restricted the number of times an NSman can

be  called up for NS duties during a year to a maximum of  three

times  per  work  year.  Where possible, units are  required  to

bundle  together all the units' activities to coincide  with  an

ICT to minimise the number of call ups for NSmen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, commanders have also been given the

flexibility  to grant time-off of up to two days  for  NSmen  to

attend to urgent business matters which crop up during their in-camp  training.  If necessary, deferment will also be considered

and  priority  would  be given to NSmen  who  have  a  good  ICT

attendance record.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Defence (Mr David T.E. Lim): Sir,

I  am responding to Dr Ong Chit Chung and Mr Sin Boon Ann on the

concerns  of the security of sea lanes and piracy in the  waters

near Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong pointed out the importance of the security of our

sea  lanes for food and trade.  That is one reason why  we  have

put  strenuous efforts into developing the capabilities  of  the

Republic  of  Singapore Navy over these years.  The security  of

the  sea  lanes in our region is also of concern,  not  only  to

Singapore, but of the many other countries in the region,  which

depend on the sea for their trade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than half of the world's merchant shipping fleet use

the  sea lanes passing through Southeast Asia.  In this context,

Singapore  shares the view of many other countries that  freedom

of  navigation in the sea lanes in our region must  be  ensured.

As  Members  know, we are not a party in any of the  territorial

disputes  in  the  South China Sea and we have always  advocated

that they be settled by peaceful means and not by force.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closer home, I am happy to note that the incidence of

piracy and sea robberies in the Singapore Straits  has gone down

substantially since 1992.  This is in  large part because of the

effectiveness  of  a  long  standing arrangement  we  have  with

Indonesia.  Called the Indonesia-Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>

Coordinated Patrols (ISCP), this arrangement involves  our  navy

and  our Police Coast Guards and the Indonesian Navy and police.

Through  this  arrangement, the two countries  have  established

effective  channels  of  communication.  The  arrangements  also

allow  us to exchange information on sea robbery activities  and

to facilitate cross-border pursuits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ISCP has worked very well in that there were no

incidents of sea robbery in its area of operations from the time

the arrangement was implemented in September 1992 until December

last  year.  There were some incidents in December and  January,

but  there  have  been no reported incidents  since  mid-January

after the ISCP stepped up surveillance and patrols.

<br>3.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to assure Members that the Republic of Singapore

Navy and the Police Coast Guard are ready to step up the efforts

to  deal with the problem of piracy, should there be any need to

do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I also now respond to the question by Dr Wang Kai

Yuen  on  smart bombs.  Dr Wang asked if the SAF would  consider

the  use of these weapons.  The SAF is always on the lookout for

better technology to improve its capabilities and effectiveness.

Advances in electronics, optics, ordnance have thrown up a  wide

array  of  new  weapon systems.  Smart weapon is  one  of  these

areas,  and the SAF is pursuing it.  Being a small country  with

limited   resources,  smart  weapons  can  enhance   the   SAF's

capabilities  and  enable it to better  utilise  its  resources.

But,  as  Dr Wang has pointed out, these are costly investments.

We must also evaluate new weapon systems, not only as standalone

capabilities but as components of a larger fighting system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF will continue to invest in technology to ensure that

we maintain our technological edge.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, performing National Service is an

event which is seen by many as an opportunity to serve the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>

country and its people.  It should also be an occasion marked by

families with pride because society recognises the contributions

made  by  the  families in sending their sons to  the  uniformed

service  of  the country.  After more than 30 years of  National

Service, boys leaving home and going to camps are treated  as  a

matter of routine by many families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some families, however, the prospect of their loved ones

enlisting  for  National Service can be met with  a  measure  of

anxiety.  I am not referring to those families who are reluctant

to send their sons for National Service because of the perceived

hardship  which  their sons would suffer.   I  am  referring  to

families whose income depend, either wholly or substantially  on

the  income of those brought in by their sons who are due to  be

enlisted  for  National Service.  There are  many  Singaporeans,

especially  those in the lower income families,  who  choose  to

leave school early to help support the family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many of them, working prior to enlistment is a means of

supplementing the family income and would therefore be  a  means

of  subsistence for the rest of the family members.  To  require

these   males  to  perform  National  Service,  while  a   noble

sacrifice,  would  mean  severe financial  dislocation  for  the

family concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the SAF recognises the possible dislocation that

such  requirements  may impose, and has put in  place  financial

schemes  to help alleviate financial hardships that arise  as  a

consequence  of  the  registrants performing  National  Service.

Such  schemes  range from supplementary allowances  to  outright

loans  which are repayable within a short period of  time  after

the   NSman  finishes  his  National  Service.   The  additional

allowance  is  not  much.  I understand it stands  at  $200  per

month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this current crisis, I envisage that there will be a greater

number  of  NS  registrants  who  will  be  caught  in  such   a

predicament.  If the family were to depend on the salary of  the

NS  registrant for subsistence, the allowance given by  the  SAF

would not be enough to help the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>

families financially.  Additionally, the loan repayment within a

short  period of time will also impose an additional  burden  on

the serviceman concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for Defence whether more

assistance  can be given to full-time National Servicemen  whose

families  face  financial hardship as a result  of  their  doing

National Service.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, I too echo Mr Sin Boon Ann's concern

about  the possibility that some National Servicemen who  happen

to  be  the  sole  breadwinners of the family may  be  suffering

hardship at this time of economic downturn.  It is possible that

even with the various financial schemes provided by MINDEF, some

of  which  Mr  Sin has also touched upon, these  families  would

still  endure  hardship.  So, therefore, I too  would  like  the

Minister to consider enhancing the MINDEF hardship allowance  by

providing a bigger monthly cash pay-out in the first instance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, I always believe that MINDEF should pay a fair

salary  to  our full-time National Servicemen, and  this  amount

should  be  roughly equivalent to the market rate in the  labour

market.  Last year, when I spoke on the same subject, I  pointed

out  that other than having more cash in the pockets, paying our

NSF a fair wage would also increase the CPF savings of these NSF

after their two-and-a-half to three years in the service of  the

nation.  We all know that CPF savings today are not just for old

age  but  for  a  whole host of commitments  such  as  Medisave,

housing,  and so on.  For instance, their Medisave contributions

could be used to pay for the medical care of their aged parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, paying NSF their market rate would truly reflect

the  value  of  using  these young men as a  precious  resource.

Perhaps  by  pegging it to the right value, this would  minimise

wastage  of  their  time  through poor planning,  waiting  time,

misallocation, and so forth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope the Minister would consider some of my suggestions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Hawazi is not speaking. Mr Gerard Ee.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I am advocating the

introduction of compulsory National Service for women.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would like to put at ease the minds of all parents

who equate National Service with serving in the Armed Forces.  I

have  no  doubt that many parents would object to  having  their

daughters  charging  uphill with guns, blowing  up  things  with

explosives  and,  worse of all, getting muscular.   Mothers  and

fathers would freak out at the image of their daughters'  lovely

complexion  being  burnt by the sun and  pimples  sprouting  all

over.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, National Service is service to the nation. All of us

citizens of Singapore should spend some time serving our nation.

It  should  not be the prerogative of the guys.  Our ladies  can

play  an  equally important role and make as much a contribution

to  the nation.  I have in mind a Nurses Corps.  All young women

should  be  called  up to serve the nation in the  Nurses  Corps

where  they will learn nursing skills which can be put to  great

use  in an emergency.  For the period of their service, they can

be  trained in our hospitals and thus help ease the shortage  of

nurses.   Those found suitable for the task can then be attached

to  the various services as Medics.  The remainder will learn to

operate  in field hospitals.  During peacetime, members  of  our

Nurses  Corps can be sent on goodwill missions to  help  out  in

medical  situations  in the villages in the region  and  further

away.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest the system is seen as being chauvinistic, the enlisted

ladies,  after a period of basic training, should be allowed  to

opt  to  serve  in the SAF.  There are both combative  and  non-combative  roles  that can be considered.  With warfare  getting

more  high-tech,  it  is not always muscle  power  that  ensures

effectiveness.   In certain situations, women's intuition  could

well be the extra edge to combat effectiveness.  I have no doubt

that  women  can excel in the Armed Forces and could  outperform

some of the men.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of National Service for men, the men have

had  to  face a disadvantage in their career.  By the time  they

complete their term of service, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>

girls  of  their  cohort would have had at least  two  years  of

employment.  Compulsory two years of National Service for  girls

will set this matter back to an even keel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the social side, National Service requiring people to train

and live together in groups has the desirable effect of being  a

social equaliser.  Women from all walks of life, every level  of

educational  experience, social status, will live and  learn  to

cooperate  with each other.  They will learn to appreciate  each

other as fellow citizens of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the home front, every family will have a member who can

handle basic medical emergencies.  Perhaps this will lessen  the

queues  at  the  A&E Department.  Certainly ill members  of  the

family, young and old, would be better cared for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an NSman myself, I have benefited greatly from the

experience.   During the term of service, I learned  about  team

work,  perseverance,  leadership and many other  qualities  that

have  helped me.  Why should the women of Singapore not be given

the  same opportunity?  And why should Singapore not be provided

with  the  benefit of their service?  With the current  economic

slowdown  and growing pressure on job vacancies, this  would  be

the  best  time  to  seriously  consider  the  introduction   of

compulsory  National  Service for  women.   It  will  delay  the

release  into the job market of a significant number  of  school

leavers and graduates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Minister directs this issue to the Ministry of

Health,  I  hasten  to add that whilst the  establishment  of  a

Nurses Corps would require input from the Ministry of Health,  I

am  not  thinking of merely generating a large number of nurses.

Apart  from nursing skills, members of the Nurses Corps must  be

trained  in  discipline and organisation  and  be  ready  to  be

mobilised.  It is the training of the SAF that can achieve this.

They will have to live in dormitories and conduct field camps in

different  terrains.   They  must  learn  to  operate   in   all

conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, just as National Service for men cannot be done on a

voluntary basis, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>

establishment  of  a Nurses Corps can only be  achieved  through

compulsory service.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, I would not be wrong in saying that the

public  perceives  the  SAF  as an institution  which  is  male-dominated.   This is true of the combat vocations  of  the  SAF.

Whether it be the Army, Navy or the Air Force, we will not  find

any women performing any function in a combat capacity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I note that there are many women serving the

SAF  today  as  full-time  regulars.  Over  the  years,  we  are

increasingly  seeing women in the SAF moving away  from  service

vocations,  like  performing clerical  functions  and  parachute

rigging, to being weapon or machinery instructors or technicians

working side by side with their male counterparts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, we note that a growing number of armies are

beginning to engage the services of women in active combat duty.

In  the US, for instance, the US Army has had women operating in

the  frontline for some time.  Similarly, in Britain,  they  too

have women performing combat duties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a tiny island nation state with limited

resources.  We are not only constrained by the physical size  of

our  country, but also by the relatively small population  base.

As  a consequence, the sharing of our human resource between the

private  and the public sectors plays an important part  in  the

distribution of talents in this country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The armed forces today, Sir, is a complex fighting organisation.

We   have  over  the  years  acquired  complex  weapon  systems.

However,  with  sophisticated weapon systems, we  would  require

sophisticated  people  to  operate and maintain  these  weapons.

Take the F16 Fighting Falcon, for instance.  The F16 fighter jet

is  a  very advanced fighter jet.  The technical skills required

to fly the plane are so demanding and exacting that I understand

only  a  small percentage of the cohort of those who  enter  the

RSAF  flying school would ever end up flying the F16 jet.   Sir,

if the selection of F16 pilots is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>

so  demanding, would it not be in our interest to start  looking

at  the  fairer sex in order to widen the talent  pool  that  is

available for our selection?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our womenfolk have in our nation's short history made

significant contributions to the readiness and effectiveness  of

the  SAF.   Because they are restricted on the role  with  which

they  are  allowed  to  serve, they are  excluded  from  certain

positions and are limited in promotion opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, in Singapore, we have a limited talent pool. In some

critical and key combat positions, limiting recruitment  to  the

male  gender  would only serve to restrict our pool of  talents.

These  would include senior staff appointments, and even fighter

pilots for the RSAF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our women can meet the same high standards set for the men,

there is really no reason why they should not be allowed to play

a  greater combat role.  This is a natural progression from what

our women in the SAF are accustomed to doing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my question, simply put, is whether the SAF would consider

allowing women to take up combat duties in the future.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, the declared policy of the SAF is to

keep the SAF young and fighting fit.  Towards this end, there is

a  cap  on  the  length  of service, and  regular  officers  and

servicemen  retire at a younger age.  Thereafter,  the  officers

and servicemen would start their second careers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all officers and servicemen would start second careers as

life  spans have increased and the national retirement  age  has

been  raised  progressively.   Furthermore,  such  officers  and

servicemen have very good skills indeed, which can be  harnessed

in civvy streets.

<br>3.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is the policy to keep the SAF young, MINDEF also has

the  obligation  to prepare and assist the servicemen  in  their

transit to second careers, especially now

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>

that the economy is not doing well and jobs are hard to come by.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore wish to ask the Minister what measures has

MINDEF taken to assist our servicemen in their transit to second

careers, and whether our servicemen leaving the SAF are able  to

find jobs or have meaningful and rewarding second careers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I go on to the next cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Thank you. Sir, in its report

presented  to  Parliament  on 30th  November  1998,  the  Public

Accounts  Committee  highlighted that in  recent  years,  and  I

quote,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Report of the Auditor-General disclosed many instances

of  non-compliance with prescribed financial control  procedures

and  other  lapses in the Ministry of Defence.   The  number  of

instances   taken  together  and  their  recurrence   convey   a

disturbing picture of the lack of control-consciousness  in  the

Ministry.  This is dangerous as it increases exposure  to  fraud

and corruption."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of particular concern is the laxity in tender and

procurement   procedures  at  MINDEF.   For  example,   officers

involved  in  procurement should know that placing fax  machines

designated  for  receiving competitive bids in  the  open  areas

could  lead  to  leakage of price sensitive information.   There

were  also  instances of wrong payment for in-camp  training  to

National  Servicemen  and lack of proper  accounting  for  fund-raising activities for charities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor-General, in his Report for the Financial Year

1996/97, has also pointed out that the MINDEF tender boxes  were

opened  before the closing date of the tender and the 13 tenders

submitted  after  the closing date were considered  even  though

they  did  not  fall  within the special cases  allowed  by  the

Ministry of Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MINDEF receives the largest budget allocation every

year.  This we fully support and endorse.  At the same time,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>

MINDEF  must ensure that it is money well spent.  There must  be

strict budgetary control and full compliance with all Government

procurement procedures and tender procedures.  Anything short of

this  would  not  be acceptable.  I therefore wish  to  ask  the

Minister  what  steps  have MINDEF taken  to  ensure  such  full

compliance  and  whether any progress  has  been  made  in  this

matter.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, at last year's Budget

debate,  I  raised the issue of MINDEF's tender  procedures  and

weakness  in  financial  control based on the  Auditor-General's

Report for the Financial Year 1996/97, the details of which were

mentioned by Dr Ong just now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Auditor-General's Report for Financial Year 1997/98, the

issue  of MINDEF's financial control remains glaring, especially

on  the  question  of  accuracy of accounts being  confirmed  as

correct by the Permanent Secretary.  The Report pointed out that

the  two  deposit accounts which were confirmed by the Permanent

Secretary  as  correct, and I quote, "found to  agree  with  the

records kept by my Ministry" turned out to have a discrepancy of

more  than  $100,000.  Furthermore, Audit could not  verify  the

third  account as the individual account listings were not ready

for  the audit then.  MINDEF owes an explanation to this  House.

How did the above happen and whether the third account mentioned

in the report has been audited, and if so, what is the result of

the audit?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is time MINDEF woke up to the call for prudent

financial control and the need to follow financial procedures.

<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, let me respond to Mr Sin Boon

Ann  and  Dr  Wang  Kai  Yuen  about  allowances  and  financial

assistance for National Servicemen.  Sir, MINDEF has a financial

assistance  scheme to help needy full-time National  Servicemen.

Under the scheme, the needy full-time National Servicemen may be

given  a  grant  of  up  to $200 per  month.   If  this  sum  is

insufficient, he can apply for further assistance in the form of

an interest-free loan through his unit's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>

manpower   officer.   The  loan  is  repayable  by  instalments,

starting three months after his operationally ready date (ORD).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1975, a total of 1,636 servicemen have benefited from

this.   In addition, MINDEF also offers one-off grant and  loans

to  servicemen in need.  For example, unit commanders  have  the

authority to extend emergency grants and loans of up to $500  to

servicemen  facing  financial hardship arising  from  unforeseen

circumstances.   Sir, the applications have  been  few.   MINDEF

will  continue  to review and revise the grants,  if  necessary.

But at this moment, there is no revision in sight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang also appeals for more allowances to be given to NSFs.

Sir,  full-time  National Servicemen are not  salaried  workers.

They  perform  National Service and they  are  paid  a  National

Service  allowance.   Most NSmen stay in  camp  where  food  and

accommodation are provided free of charge.  The allowance  given

to them is meant to cover incidental daily expenses, such as for

transportation.  The NS allowance is reviewed regularly to  keep

pace  with the cost of basic daily expenses.  The allowance  was

increased  in 1994 and, again, in 1996.  Our ongoing  monitoring

shows that the allowance is still adequate and there is no  need

for  a  revision  now.    MINDEF will  continue  to  review  the

allowance from time to time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for paying the market value for NSFs to ensure efficient

utilisation,  may I assure the Member that this is MINDEF's  top

concern  -  which is that the NSFs are properly and  efficiently

utilised.  And to this end, MINDEF and the SAF conduct stringent

checks  and tests to ensure that operational training is carried

out efficiently and productively so that, at the end of the day,

we  turn  out  operational units which are ready to  defend  our

country at the moment's notice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr David T. E. Lim: Sir, Mr Gerard Ee has made a very spirited

speech about providing Singapore women with the same opportunity

to  serve National Service as the men, and he suggested that  we

train them to be nurses and deploy

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>

them both in war-time and for peace-time purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, his comments are noted. However, the purpose of National

Service  is to ensure that we have an operational capability  to

defend  Singapore.   As far as the military duties  and  defence

needs  are  concerned, MINDEF has no immediate  need  to  enlist

women  for  National Service.  Through measures such as  use  of

technology   and  commercialisation  of  non-essential   support

functions,   MINDEF  has  been  able  to  maintain   operational

readiness effectively although the number of males enlisted  for

National Service has declined because of falling birth rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's point about the benefits of National Service for

women is well taken.  However, it is a decision that should  not

be taken lightly.  National Service is costly both to the nation

and  to those who are called to serve.  Based on the operational

needs, there is no requirement for enlisting women in the SAF at

this  time.  Nevertheless, MINDEF will continue to evaluate  the

suggestion from time to time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I turn now to the question raised by Mr Sin Boon Ann who

has also spoken out for women and suggested that they should  be

allowed  to  perform  combat duties in the  SAF.   Sir,  we  are

already  taking an increasing number of women into the  SAF  and

indeed  there are at present some 4,000 women serving in  MINDEF

and  the  SAF.  Most of them are in service, combat  support  or

instructional jobs.  A small number have applied to be in combat

jobs.  Those who have been found suitable and have been able  to

meet the requirements have been deployed in combat roles.  While

the  male  servicemen will continue to form the  mainstay  of  a

fighting capability, we will continue to recruit women  to  meet

our manpower needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I turn now to the issue raised by Dr Ong Chit Chung

regarding  second  careers  for SAF personnel.   As  this  House

knows,  the  SAF  adopts a policy to keep the  SAF  young.   For

officers, a full career with the SAF spans about 23 to 25  years

and most officers will leave the SAF in their mid or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>

early  40s.   Most  of our Warrant Officers and Specialists  who

stay  beyond the first contract will also leave around this age.

This is an optimal length to ensure that officers and servicemen

can  make  meaningful contributions to the SAF and, at the  same

time,  there is a healthy turnover of leadership at every level.

Therefore,  most  officers and servicemen  will  have  a  second

career  after they leave the SAF.  The responsibility to prepare

and equip oneself with relevant skills for a second career must,

however,  continue  to  remain with the  officer  or  serviceman

himself.   But  we  recognise that it can be very  daunting  for

somebody  to start a new career in his mid-40s, especially  when

he  may  have  housing  commitments and  the  education  of  his

children to worry about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can never remove all the concerns associated with the

transition to a second career but we can make it less  daunting.

We  do  it  in  two ways.  First, we introduce the  Savings  and

Employee  Retirement  (SAVER) Plan scheme for  the  SAF  officer

corps  in place of the civil service pension scheme.  The  SAVER

plan  is designed to give officers a lump sum of money when they

transit into second career and through this, we hope that we can

reduce  their  concerns on financial security so that  they  can

concentrate on their professional duties while in the SAF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, MINDEF provides second career preparation for all our

servicemen,   officers   and   non-officers.    The    Personnel

Development  and Services Office (PDSO) was set up, among  other

things,  to  better prepare our servicemen for transition  to  a

second  career.  This preparation starts from the  beginning  of

the serviceman's career.  We develop the servicemen by providing

them  with  adequate training for their jobs  during  the  early

stages  of  their  career  and, wherever  possible,  appropriate

accreditation is obtained for their training so that the  skills

can   be  relevant  in  their  second  careers.   Depending   on

individual  merits,  servicemen can also obtain  assistance  for

academic upgrading.  Towards the end of the servicemen's career,

specific programmes are available

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>

to  help  them build up necessary skills to facilitate a  smooth

transition.   Such preparation activities include  briefing  and

counselling,  psychological preparation to help  servicemen  and

their  families prepare for the changes, career talks and career

facilitation to link our servicemen with potential employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we have assistance schemes to help servicemen adapt to

the  employment environment outside the SAF.  In particular,  we

offer  the Pre-Release Employment Programme (PREP) and the  Pre-Release  Training Programme (PRTP).  PREP grants half pay  leave

for  six  months to allow servicemen to work in a civilian  firm

prior  to their ORD.  PRTP allows the servicemen to go  on  half

pay leave, also for six months, to attend a full-time course.

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feedback from our officers and servicemen is that these

career  facilitation programmes have been  useful.   The  SAVERS

Plan  and  our  career facilitation programmes  are  part  of  a

package   of  benefits  which  SAF  provides  to  our  committed

servicemen.  With these measures, servicemen can concentrate  on

the  primary mission of serving SAF with minimum distraction and

the  need  to  worry about financial security and  their  second

careers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on now to the questions about budgetary

controls  raised  by Dr Ong as well as Mr Low  Thia  Khiang.   I

would  like  to  firstly assure the House that  MINDEF  takes  a

serious  view  of  the  observations reported  by  the  Auditor-General's  Office  and  which were subsequently  raised  in  the

Public  Accounts Committee's Report.  MINDEF has taken steps  to

further  strengthen the respective systems to minimise the  kind

of problems highlighted by the Auditor-General.  I would like to

emphasise that when these breaches were observed by the Auditor-General,  there was no loss or misuse of public  funds,  and  no

fraud.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of non-compliance with procurement procedures,

this has been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>

raised  and debated in this House in detail in the parliamentary

debate on the 1997/1998 Budget.  What I would like to add  today

are  the  further measures that have been implemented to further

enhance compliance with established procedures.  The Ministry of

Finance has revised the Instruction Manual to allow tender boxes

to  be  opened  not more than once in five days.  On  our  part,

MINDEF has further streamlined our tender process such that each

tender box is opened not more than once in four weeks.  This  is

more stringent than the new provision in the Instruction Manual.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised IM also allows for retention of late tenders. I

would  like to stress that MINDEF considers such late offers  as

invalid offers.  However, we will continue with the practice  of

using  these  offers  as  price  comparisons  to  evaluate   the

reasonableness  of other offers.  To further enhance  compliance

with  procurement procedures, in the coming procurement seminar,

we will be emphasising accountability and transparency in public

procurement  by highlighting the lapses that have  occurred  and

the  steps  taken to tighten controls. In line with Ministry  of

Finance's  requirement, agencies handling procurement will  also

be  required  to  provide  annual declarations  that  they  have

complied with all procurement policies and procedures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of breakdown on budgetary control, I would

like to assure the House that there was no improper transfer  of

funds,  nor  was  there  any  loss of  public  funds.   MINDEF's

previous  practice was to update each of the  transfers  in  the

computer  system after it was approved by the relevant approving

authority.  The various transfers were then consolidated  and  a

transfer warrant raised for them.  This practice, although  more

efficient, was not in conformance with the prescribed procedure.

MINDEF  has  stopped this practice.  A transfer warrant  is  now

issued  before  a  transfer fund is updated  into  the  computer

system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interest of time, I would also like to inform the

House that the other cases of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>

wrong  payments and in-camp training pay have been  investigated

and  over-payments have been recovered.  Monies raised by MINDEF

for  charity, National Day celebrations and other projects  have

also been accounted for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move to Mr Low's concern about the discrepancies in the

confirmation of balances between Auditor-General's  records  and

MINDEF's  records.   The Auditor-General's audit  revealed  that

MINDEF  records for two deposit accounts did not reconcile  with

the Accountant-General's balances, although MINDEF has submitted

a  confirmation  certificate stating  that  their  records  were

balanced.  The discrepancies between these accounts were due  to

errors  during the migration to a new financial system from  the

old  one.  MINDEF is taking action to clean up the data  in  the

new  financial system.  I would emphasise that in this  process,

there has not been any loss of public funds.  The new system has

stabilised  and  we  have  since been able  to  reconcile  these

records monthly with the Accountant-General's Department.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the incorrect confirmation of balances in

advance  accounts,  this  came about as  follows:   65  receipts

collected  by  MINDEF were temporarily posted  to  miscellaneous

receipt revenue account in the Accountant-General's Department's

system  as  the nature of these receipts could not be determined

at  the  time  of  posting. When the details of the  collections

became  known,  adjustments which should  have  been  raised  to

adjust the accounts were made accordingly.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I want to the thank the DPM and the

Ministers  for their comprehensive replies and we are  reassured

that  the defence of Singapore is in good hands.  Sir, I beg  to

withdraw the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $6,650,000,000 for Head K ordered to stand part

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $620,000,000 for Head K ordered to stand part of

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head S - Ministry of Law. Amendment No.

(1), Mr Chng.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head S of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology and the Internet have opened up a new world of

opportunities for business.  There is a growing recognition that

we need to promote home-grown industries and, of late, there are

exhortations to groom more entrepreneurs.  Whilst we improve the

economic   environment  and  make  entrepreneurship  a   welcome

development   in   Singapore,  I  wonder  if   the   legal   and

administrative framework is moving fast enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Bankruptcy Act has been amended to raise

the  cap  of the amount owed to $250,000/- for a discharge  from

bankruptcy.   But since the last amendments, are we implementing

the  law fast enough? Anecdotal evidence suggests that bankrupts

have  difficulties  getting  discharge  from  bankruptcies.    I

understand  that  they must show good faith in making  repayment

before they can be discharged.  The question to raise is: are we

discharging many more bankrupts than before and has the pool  of

entrepreneurs  been correspondingly enlarged?  Have  there  been

cases  of  relapse after discharge?  Or was the law ineffective?

One  may  assume  that  the regional economic  crisis  may  have

worsened  the  situation and the number of  bankrupts  may  have

risen  and,  further, precious business manpower  resources  are

lost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest buzzword is technopreneurship. With the setting

up  of  a  national broadband network, we are ideally poised  to

promote   electronic   commerce,  or  e-commerce.    Hence   the

Government's  pre-occupation with encouraging the  growth  of  a

knowledge  economy and e-commerce is timely.   With  e-commerce,

one  can  work  from  home, or even from  a  car.   If  more  is

encouraged  to  work  from  the home in  e-commerce,  the  legal

framework must make this possible.  In this respect, I  wish  to

know if the Land

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>

Titles  Act,  the  Conveyancing and Law  of  Property  Act,  the

Planning Act or the Housing and Development Act will be  amended

soon  so  that they are in tandem with the Government's call  to

quicken the pace of e-commerce activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related to the fast-changing world of e-commerce, an area of

concern  is the protection of intellectual property rights.   My

question to the Minister is: is technology changing faster  than

what the current law has anticipated and is able to control?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Land Titles Act, the requirement for

leases  of  over  7  years must be in the  prescribed  form  and

registered should also be looked into.  I understand  that  this

does  not  help  entrepreneurs in setting up  businesses  as  it

prohibits  the longer-term leases.  Under the Land  Titles  Act,

unless the commercial property is already subdivided, the  owner

who may be an entrepreneur cannot give the tenants longer leases

of  more  than  7  years.  On the other side  of  the  coin,  an

entrepreneur may not be able to sub-lease a factory space unless

it  is  already  sub-divided for more than 7 years.   Sometimes,

capital investments need time to have a pay-back and 7 years  is

an  unnecessary  impediment to entrepreneurship  which  I  think

should be done away with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area which requires attention and soon is the

prohibition  of  registering  homes  for  business.   For  those

involved  in  e-commerce and working from their HDB homes,  they

should  not  be  prohibited from using their home  addresses  as

their  business  addresses where they  can  be  contacted.   The

Internet  is  blind as to the people and the physical  structure

behind  the  business. As far as the Internet is concerned,  the

person  behind the business is not known and sometimes an office

is not particularly important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calls to our people to change our way of doing business

should  always  be accompanied by corresponding changes  in  the

relevant statutes and carried out fast enough so that they  will

facilitate  rather  than impede initiatives or entrepreneurship.

If  the laws are inadequate or cannot move fast enough with  the

times,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>

then  it is difficult to focus on the bigger picture of our long

term  economic strategy.  This is especially so when Singapore's

economy is plugged into the global economy and a slower start up

may  mean  loss  of  time and money and also  opportunities  for

growth.   It  will  also  blunt  the  competitive  edge  of  our

entrepreneurs  and, moreover, lower their morale and  make  them

feel  that  the  Government is not supportive or  responsive  to

their needs and efforts to bring wealth to the nation.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, we are a nation that

prides ourselves as one that is ruled by the rule of law and  we

have  been praised by the international organisations like  BERI

and  PERC  that we have a highly efficient and very high-quality

judicial system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the fundamental pillars of our society is also that

ignorance  of  the law is no excuse.  It is therefore  important

that  we  put access to the laws as a very high priority.   With

the  onset of the Internet, the Internet is one of the best ways

to  make  information  available to all and  sundry.   Currently

LawNet has got a database of the laws and statutes of Singapore.

We also have handy references published, for example, by the Law

Society  of  Singapore on the different laws and  the  summaries

thereof.   All this is fine and good, but if we could also  have

Internet  access  for members of the public to on-line  statutes

and  case  laws, it will indeed help us promote this  idea  that

ignorance of the law is no excuse and you can find it freely  or

at a low cost on the Internet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could, at the very least, put on the common statutes that

affect  the  man-in-the-street, perhaps like  the  Small  Claims

Tribunal  Act, Hire Purchase Act, Road Traffic Act, Penal  Code,

HDB  Regulations, LTA Regulations, etc.  It would also  be  good

for  us to have hyperlinks on this Internet site to other  areas

and  other  websites where summaries can be  obtained  and  this

would  help the man-in-the-street to know his rights and  duties

and the responsibilities he has under our law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I move on to my next cut?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> All sorts of personal information today that

is  captured  involves  Government and private  databases.   The

Government databases of course contain all the information  that

have been given to the Government agencies from cradle to grave.

The  banks  and  other  private sector organisations  will  have

information   on   your  wealth  or  the  lack   thereof,   your

investments,  the debts that you have, your credit card  number,

your  NETs  and  ATM transactions, and perhaps even  information

that  has  no  relation to your banking account,  such  as  your

mother's  maiden name, and the occupations of your siblings.   A

record of your ATM or ERP transactions, for example, could  lead

to information on where you go shopping, and if the system is on-line,  it  could  even, theoretically, be  used  to  track  your

movements  wherever you go.  There have, of course, been  enough

Hollywood  movies to drive home this point, almost to the  point

of paranoia and hysteria.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, Government systems are very secure, they are

secured technically and also because incursions and leakages are

governed by penalty prohibitions of the law such as the Official

Secrets Act, the Computer Misuse Act and other Acts such as  the

Banking  Act  and the Income Tax Act.  There is  a  very  strong

protection of personal data.

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the private sector, there are laws which govern

confidentiality,  the banking secrecy laws and  contracts  which

prevent  the  dissemination  of personal  information,  if  such

contracts  exist.   But very often, these contracts  are  biased

against the small consumer who almost signs his whole life away,

just  for  a service.  Here, I am not being paranoid, because  I

think these things, even if the protection is in place, the best

laid plans of men and mice go awry.  We have seen recently,  for

example, incursions on SingNet which led to the "SickNet"  case,

so to speak, where passwords were given on the Internet.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, Singapore is building itself as an e-commerce hub, and one of the things that will happen is that

data would be transferred from country to country.  The European

Union  has,  in  fact,  come out with a  directive  -  Directive

95/46/EC - which deals with cross-border transfers of data.  And

in  Article  25, paragraph 1, it allows the European nations  to

prevent  the transfer of personal data which would be  inclusive

of  data  used  in  e-commerce.  It  prevents  the  transfer  to

countries  which do not ensure an adequate level of  protection.

And  adequate  level of protection is seen in the light  of  the

rules of law, both general and sectoral, that are in force,  and

the  professional rules and security measures which are complied

with in that country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge that we review our laws to ensure

that we can comply with these provisions so that we can continue

to  trade with Europe and we can continue to trade with the rest

of  the  world that would require us to perhaps have  laws  and,

amongst  other things, also to have industry codes  of  privacy,

such  as  perhaps the Association of Banks in Singapore, perhaps

even  CASE or the NIAC.   These codes of privacy that are  being

promulgated  could  be  given the force  of  law  and  then  the

provisions  can  be enforced so that we can indeed  be  able  to

answer charges if ever we are prohibited from trading with  data

with the European nations and with other jurisdictions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Davinder Singh (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, we have all read

reports in the media about the competition between Singapore and

Hong  Kong.  And Hong Kong officials, we have read,   have  been

criticised for not being sufficiently proactive in improving the

economic competitiveness of Hong Kong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hong Kong official who recently said that we have been

able  to  easily  adjust to make ourselves more competitive  was

right  about one thing: that one of the advantages we  enjoy  in

Singapore is the Government's control of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>

Parliament.   The Singapore Government rebutted  the  official's

allegations  to put him right.  But, in my view,  that  official

was not misinformed or inaccurate about our legislature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to be defensive about it. The Government

is  in  control here not by sleight of hand or deceit, it is  in

control  because  this is what the people want,  election  after

election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our consistent message to Singaporeans has been that

investors will take fright if they sense that the Government  is

losing  its  grip over the legislative process.  The  Hong  Kong

official  has now confirmed what we have been saying all  along.

He  has  effectively conceded that our ability  to  control  the

passage of legislation has given us a decisive edge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any government can make promises or offer incentives to

investors.   But  not many can quickly craft and  construct  the

legislative  framework  within which  these  incentives  are  to

operate,  without  being distracted or delayed  by  politics  or

lobbying.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We enjoy one substantial advantage over other countries,

ie,  our  ability  to legislate quickly and with  minimum  fuss.

Given   the   mind-boggling  speed  with  which  new   financial

instruments are created, it is a distinct advantage for us to be

able  to  tell the investors that we can immediately enact  laws

and reshape our regulations to keep pace with the changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore crucial that we take advantage of this rare

ability to make ourselves more competitive.  We must demonstrate

that we can quickly settle the laws that we need to draft, enact

and  implement to complement the changes in the financial world.

The  faster  we  update our laws, the greater the confidence  we

inspire.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors need to know that there are people in the

Ministry  of Law and the Attorney-General's Chambers whose  sole

pre-occupation is to keep updated on and to monitor  changes  in

the  financial  arena,  so as to give them legislative  backing.

One example was highlighted in the press

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>

recently relating to the need to review our banking secrecy laws

in   the  light  of  the  changes  to  the  practice  of   asset

securitisation, which involves the sale by a bank of loans to  a

special purpose vehicle.  That sale cannot take place unless the

buyer  knows  the details of the customers whose  loans  are  on

sale,  and  the buyers cannot know the details of the  customers

because of our banking secrecy laws.  That immediately calls for

a  need  to review the laws to see whether we can amend them  to

make   them  consistent  with  these  new  financial  practices,

without,  on the other hand, compromising the integrity  of  the

secrecy of the accounts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we also need to quickly demonstrate that we

have  developed the self-confidence to decide on  what  our  own

laws  should  be.   That after 33 years of independence,  we  no

longer  need  to have an umbilical cord to English  legislation.

Remarkably, we still look to the United Kingdom to fill gaps  in

local  legislation.  For many years, there was  a  debate  about

what  English laws apply in Singapore, and that debate has  been

partly  resolved by the enactment of the Application of  English

Laws  Act.  But I do not think that solves the problem,  because

these are English Acts which we are applying so many years after

independence  and there is really no reason why we cannot  apply

our  own  minds to decide whether these Acts or parts  of  these

Acts  should  be  borrowed and modified for our  purposes.   One

example is the Criminal Procedure Code.  It has been with us for

almost  a  hundred years and that Code continues to  maintain  a

lifeline  to English law to fill gaps in the Code.  We  have  to

demonstrate  to  the  world that we have the self-confidence  to

decide,  once  and  for  all,  what the  criminal  procedure  in

Singapore  is, and that we really do not need the English  fall-back anymore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what steps are being taken

to keep pace with the changes in the financial arena and whether

the   Ministry  is  reviewing  our  legislation,  including  the

Criminal Procedure Code.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing we need to do is to show the world that our

public officials are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>

commercially  savvy and can and do respond to the needs  of  the

situation.  Often times, the laws we enact in this House vest  a

great  deal of discretion in our public servants.  And depending

on  how  they  act,  they can make or break  the  perception  of

nimbleness  and  flexibility.  Some of our officials  have  done

well, but not many people know that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give Members an example. These days, before an

Initial  Public  Offering is done, it  often  happens  that  the

issuing   company  prepares  what  is  called  a  "red   herring

prospectus",  without full details of the size of the  issue  or

the  details  of  the pricing.  The purpose of the  red  herring

prospectus is really to distribute it to institutional investors

so  as  to  gauge  the  depth of the  demand.   Previously,  the

response of the public service would have been that since you do

not  have all the details in the prospectus, you cannot have  it

registered.   And if you cannot have it registered,  you  cannot

have  it  distributed.   But  the  Registrar  of  Companies  has

recently  waived the requirement, because he or she  understands

the  need  for  this  document to  be  circulated.   That  is  a

tremendous  advance.  But my point really is that if  discretion

is  being  exercised  in this manner, which is  consistent  with

commercial good sense, why not publish it to the world at large?

The  financial  community should know that these  decisions  are

being  made and if they know about it, they will come to realise

that  not  only  do  they have in Singapore a  Government  which

adjusts  and is flexible, but a legislature and a public service

which are equally responsive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two more points, Sir. First, on the question of the supply

of  lawyers.   In November 1993, the Minister for Law  moved  an

amendment   to  the  Legal  Profession  Act  to  implement   the

recommendations of the Committee for the Supply of Lawyers.  One

of   the  major  recommendations  which  was  accepted  was  the

redefinition of the term "qualified persons".  In essence,  what

that  means was to control the flow of graduates into the  legal

profession  from the United Kingdom.  A list of 15  universities

was settled on and put in a schedule to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>

relevant  rules.  The Minister then said that the list would  be

reviewed from time to time.  And my question is: have steps been

taken   to  review  the  performance  and  standards  of   these

universities and is it the intention to revise the list?

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.25 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the issue of corporatisation in respect of which I

declare  my  interest.   In  October  last  year,  the  Minister

informed  the House that the Law Reform Committee  and  the  Law

Society would be putting up a proposal to the Attorney-General's

Chambers   and   the  Ministry  of  Law  on  the   question   of

corporatisation of the legal profession.  Has the proposal  been

submitted  to  the Ministry and, if so, what is  the  Minister's

position?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Law (Prof S. Jayakumar): Sir, I wish to thank

the Members who have spoken and let me respond.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will first take Mr Davinder Singh's broader question

about the need to review our laws in the light of enhancing  our

competitiveness.  Sir, I do not think there is  any  doubt  that

the  legal  infrastructure  - and  by  that  I  mean  our  legal

institutions,  our  laws,  procedures  and  regulations  -  will

increasingly play an important role in our economic development.

Our  policy  therefore should be to take  a  proactive  role  in

ensuring  that our laws, legal institutions and legal  framework

are constantly updated to support national objectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Davinder Singh's specific question on our laws to

support  reform in the financial sector, the Monetary  Authority

of Singapore and the Attorney-General's Chambers are in fact now

reviewing the necessity to amend legislation such as the Banking

Act,  which was referred to by Mr Davinder Singh, the Securities

Industry  Act, the Futures Trading Act, the Insurance  Act,  the

MAS  Act  and the Companies Act.  This may need to  be  done  in

phases as we will have to consult the various agencies as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>

well  as  the  industry  and  professions  involved.   The  AG's

Chambers has in fact expanded its Legislation Division  to  cope

with  the  increasing drafting work.  Together with the Ministry

of  Finance,  the Attorney-General has also undertaken  a  major

review  of  the  Companies Act, which began last year  with  the

share buy-back scheme.  I believe this review will bring the Act

up to date with international developments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point raised by Mr Chng Hee Kok and, to some extent, by

Mr    Davinder   Singh   is   that   in   order   to   encourage

technopreneurship  and  business  enterprise,  we  should   also

increase our efforts to promote and develop intellectual  assets

and to make our people understand the importance of intellectual

property  rights.  In fact, as far as legislation is  concerned,

in  the past year, considerable progress has been made.  And  Mr

Chng  Hee Kok will remember that we have made amendments to  the

Patents  Act, the Copyright Act, the new Trade Marks  Act  which

was  passed  last  year,  which  has  not  only  modernised  and

simplified  our  Trade  Marks  law in  line  with  international

trends,  but also enables us to comply with the TRIPS Agreement.

More  recently, of course, we have also passed the  Geographical

Indications Act 1998, the Layout-Designs Integrated Circuits Act

1999,  which  will  further improve our laws  on  protection  of

intellectual  property  rights.   These  laws  will   create   a

conducive  environment for innovation and  commercialisation  of

technologies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also say that a draft Designs Bill is also under

consideration.   And when passed, Singaporean enterprises  would

no  longer need to rely on the United Kingdom to seek protection

of  their  industrial  designs.  It will  also  encourage  local

innovations and new ideas in industrial designs.

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Davinder Singh, Dr Toh See Kiat and Mr Chng Kee Kok made a

common  point  that  we must constantly update  and  review  our

various   laws  to  enable  the  competitiveness  edge   to   be

maintained.  Let me say that we support this objective.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>

We are also looking into the following areas of law:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A new proposed regime for the creation and registration

of personal property securities;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) We are reviewing the law on the formalities required

for the execution of deeds by individuals and corporations;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) We are reviewing the application of consumer protection

laws in cyber space; the point made by Dr Toh See Kiat;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) We are also monitoring international developments in e-commerce and reviewing the Electronic Transactions Act in the

light of experience gained in implementing such legislation;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) We will also review the Arbitration Act to update it

and  make it consistent with the International Arbitration  Act;

and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The laws of evidence, including the hearsay evidence

rule,  will  also  be  looked at with a view  to  reforming  and

modernising these rules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Davinder Singh made a valid point about the Criminal

Procedure Code.  The Criminal Procedure Code, together with  the

Penal Code, are legislation which has been in our books for many

years.   They  have  quite a history behind them,  borrowing  on

provisions in India and elsewhere.  We have not left it  on  the

shelf   without  further  review  and  there  are   inter-agency

committees reviewing both the Penal Code as well as the Criminal

Procedure Code, and the point made by Mr Davinder Singh will  be

taken  into account.  I expect that the recommendations  on  the

Penal  Code  may enable us to come out with legislation  in  the

course of the middle of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Davinder Singh talked about corporatisation and whether

the  Report has come in.  Indeed, the Sub-Committee of  the  Law

Reform  Commission  has  submitted its  report.   Amongst  other

things,  it  recommends that law firms be allowed to corporatise

in  order  to  encourage  growth and to enable  our  lawyers  to

compete more efficiently.  Their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>

proposal  will  allow  eventually for the  formation  of  multi-disciplinary  "one-stop" professional corporations  as  well  as

encourage  acquisition by our local law corporations of  foreign

law  expertise.  In order to protect the interests  of  clients,

the report also recommends that it should be made compulsory for

law   corporations  to  take  out  a  minimum  of   $2   million

professional  indemnity insurance.  Other safeguards  have  also

been  proposed  to  ensure that high standards  of  professional

competence and integrity are maintained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that I have asked the Attorney-General

and  the  officials in the Ministry of Law to study  the  report

with a view to implementing its provisions and, where necessary,

to enact the necessary legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Davinder Singh asked about the list of scheduled

universities.   Members will recall, when I last spoke  on  this

subject,  I said that the list of universities is not fixed  for

all  time.  We will have to review it from time to time  because

standards  and curriculum will change, and I gave an undertaking

that we will constantly review it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now in the process of looking at the list of 15

universities  in the light of our experience in  the  past  five

years.   But,  in  addition, we will also  consider  whether  to

include   additional   universities  and  whether   well-reputed

universities  in  other  Commonwealth  universities  and   other

jurisdictions should also be considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might also mention here that the Attorney-General has

informed  me that the Board of Legal Education will  review  the

curriculum  for  the  Practical  Law  Course  as  well  as   the

institution of the pupilage and the need for a formal system  of

Continuing Legal Education for those in practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Sir, in reply to Mr Davinder Singh and

other  Members  who have spoken, we will constantly  update  our

laws  and  develop our legal expertise to ensure that our  legal

infrastructure  would  be better placed to  support  Singapore's

drive  towards  a  knowledge-based  economy  and  to  meet   new

challenges.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on bankruptcy legislation, let me say that Singapore

laws  and  policies,  in  fact,  have  received  high  marks  in

international ratings.  But we constantly review our  bankruptcy

laws   and  practices.   When  moving  the  amendments  to   the

Bankruptcy legislation in 1994, I informed this House  that  our

main   objective   was   to  encourage  entrepreneurship   where

bankrupts,  who  have become so through misfortune  rather  than

malpractice, will be subjected to a more practical and pragmatic

regime  of  bankruptcy.  This approach, in our  view,  helps  to

encourage  entrepreneurship.  But even this area of the  law  is

under  review,  and I am glad to say that the Official  Assignee

has  proposed, and I have approved, that the cap of $250,000  to

discharge bankrupts will be increased to $500,000 and will  take

effect on 1st May 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, under the current drive to promote

technopreneurship, the Ministry of Law is also leading  a  study

to  see what else can be done to improve not only our insolvency

laws,  but  other  rules  and regulations governing  businesses.

This includes the many points which Mr Chng Hee Kok referred to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the specific point that Mr Chng Hee Kok referred to the

provision  of  7-year  leases,  in  fact,  in  1998  we  further

liberalised it, from seven years to 14 years.  But his point was

whether  such  requirements  are an  unnecessary  impediment  to

businessmen.   I take his point.  The Ministry of  Law  and  the

Registrar  of Land Titles, will have another look at  this  area

and to see if indeed it is a hindrance to businessmen, and if so

whether we can review it to make it less onerous.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh See Kiat's point, firstly, was on putting our

statutes  and information on-line.  I believe he knows  that  we

have  the LawNet Legal Workbench Seminar where we announced that

Internet statutes would now be on-line.  His point was  that  we

should also make this available, free of charge, or at low cost,

to  members  of  the public.  He will be glad to know  that,  in

fact, LawNet was among

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>

some of the more popular statutes on the website for free access

by  members of the public.  What these specifically will  be,  I

will   have  to  inform  him  separately.   But  he  gave   some

suggestions  as to what these statutes will be.   This  will  be

taken into account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether it can be completely free of charge, I should

say  that the Government has actually invested substantial funds

to develop LawNet.  The maintenance and recurrent expenditure of

LawNet is undertaken by the Singapore Academy of Law on a  self-financing  basis.   Therefore, law firms  have  to  pay  monthly

subscriptions  for LawNet to gain timely access to  these  laws,

including  statutes  and  subsidiary  legislation.   So  it   is

necessary  to charge a subscription fee to maintain and  support

the system.  But having said that, let me add that the Attorney-General and the LawNet Management Committee will explore ways to

see  how free access to our statutes can be given to members  of

the public without jeopardising the viability of LawNet, whether

we could have specific databases at the National Library, in the

university  and elsewhere.  If implemented, it could  mean  that

members of the public will be able to browse through any Act  at

the  nearest branch of the National Library.  Another option  we

are  considering is whether the information kiosk  (Nets  kiosk)

which  is  currently  stationed at  the  Supreme  Court  can  be

upgraded  to  provide  free  access  to  statutes  database  for

visiting members of the public.  Being a lawyer, Dr Toh See Kiat

will  know that reading a statute on its own will not provide  a

full understanding of the law for non-lawyers.  So I should make

that  note  of caution here.  It may be necessary to read  books

and  other  materials such as the Law Society's and  CASE's  own

brochures explaining the law to non-lawyers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. "Guillotine" time. Mr Chng, do you

wish to withdraw your amendment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> I am reassured by the Minister and beg

leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

The  sum of $121,452,240 for Head S ordered to stand part of the

Main Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $461,068,300 for Head S ordered to stand part of

the Development Estimates.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head E -



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head E of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two amendments here and, with your leave, I propose

to  take them together.  But may I say that the second amendment

that I sent in has been re-worded.  What I sent in was "Speeding

up  of time for hearing of cases".  I suppose I should have said

"Speeding  the hearing of cases".  Reduction of time would  seem

to suggest something quite different.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now come to the amendment. First of all, the

Appellate  System.  I have, as Members are aware in this  House,

more  than once raised the question of the appeals that are  now

available  to our citizens from the decisions of a single  judge

or  magistrate.  I do not have to inform this House that for the

average  citizen  to be totally satisfied that he  has  obtained

justice  in  any court, it will be necessary that he  should  be

allowed  an appeal from that decision to a higher court and,  if

necessary,  to a further court.  At the moment, we  seem  to  be

restricting these appeals that are available to our citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not very long ago, we restricted very drastically the appeals in

civil  cases,  those heard in the Subordinate Courts.   I  think

several  Members, including myself, have expressed  our  concern

and  our  unhappiness at this restriction.   I  would  urge  the

Government  to reconsider again the availability of  appeals  in

Singapore.   I  am  particularly concerned  about  the  criminal

appeals.  A greater portion of the criminal cases, almost 90% of

the  criminal  cases,  are  now heard  and  dealt  with  in  the

Subordinate  Courts.  The District Courts have the  jurisdiction

to  pass  very heavy sentences.  I stand corrected,  I  think  a

District Court in some cases can pass a sentence up to 20  years

of imprisonment.  That is a very stiff heavy sentence.  From

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>

that, an accused person, if he is not satisfied, not happy  with

the decision, has at the moment, for all practical purposes,  an

appeal only to a single judge.  He has no further appeals  after

that.

<br>4.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the single Judge who hears the appeal may not be

someone who has practised or sat in the criminal courts,  and  a

number  of  lawyers  have felt that there should  be  a  further

appeal  given as of right in the more serious criminal cases  to

the  Court  of  Criminal Appeal.  It may be felt that  to  allow

every  accused person who is convicted a right of appeal to  the

Court  of  Criminal Appeal would overload the Court of  Criminal

Appeal.   But if that is the concern, some restriction could  be

placed on it by limiting appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal

to the more serious cases, where the sentence of imprisonment is

quite  heavy,  and the man is incarcerated as a  result  of  his

conviction for a very long period of time in the prison.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also urge the consideration of a separate panel in

the  Court of Criminal Appeal to hear criminal appeals.  In  the

United Kingdom, there is the Court of Criminal Appeal, and  then

there  is  the  Court of Appeal.  The Court of  Criminal  Appeal

hears  purely appeals in criminal cases.  If it is felt that  we

cannot  have  two separate panels permanently, can consideration

not  be  given to appointing ad hoc Judges to the panel  of  the

Court  hearing criminal appeals, so that they can deal with  the

appeal, and be paid on an ad hoc basis?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justice is a very important factor for the cohesion of the

society  and for the stability in the society.  The citizen  has

to  be,  as  I said, given complete and full confidence  in  our

system  of  justice  that  is administered  in  Singapore.   The

Ministers  have trotted out the praise given by rating  agencies

outside of the justice that is meted out in Singapore.  But what

is   forgotten  is  that  these  agencies  are  concerned   with

commercial  cases and how disputes in the commercial sector  are

dealt with.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, you have used up the

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I have got another amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You have used up all the time. You have asked to

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have given you all the time. Mr Rai.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I am continuing with Mr Jeyaretnam's

question  on  the  Court  of Appeal.  I  have  got  a  different

proposition, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am one of those who have been very supportive, and I still

support, that we have done away with the Privy Council.  We have

got  our  own Court of Appeal.  It has come of age.  I have  one

complaint.   We still have got only three permanent  Judges  for

the Court of Appeal.  I would urge that we should increase it to

at  least five.  In important cases, the quorum should be  five.

I  know  of  the present practice.  The Chief Justice could  ask

other Judges to sit in the Court of Appeal, but that is not very

satisfactory.   Hong Kong has got more permanent  Supreme  Court

Judges of Appeal, and the Court of Appeal in UK as well.   So  I

suggest to the Government to reconsider the position.  It is not

going  to be a tremendous financial burden on the coffer  if  we

have two more Judges of Appeal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of community mediation, I applaud the Ministry,

and I think the work is well received by the public.  We are  an

Asian  society.  We are not a litigious society and  we  do  not

believe in getting involved in litigation.  Litigation should be

a last resort.  I have in mind two proposals for the Government.

First,  take  away  all private summonses, ie,  those  summonses

which  are  instituted by the citizens against  other  citizens.

Also,  small summonses involving family members should be  dealt

by  the  mediation centre rather than by the court.  Because  in

the court, the parties engage lawyers, there is publicity, there

is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>

this   situation  sometimes,  through  cross-examination,  where

people  come  to very bitter ends.  If it is through  mediation,

people  sit  in  closed  door.  I suggest  the  people  who  are

appointed  mediators should be people with experience  in  life,

retired civil servants, and lawyers in active practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the role of the community mediation centre should be

enhanced.   It  has  been in operation for some  time,  and  the

community is very grateful to this organisation.  Sir,  I  would

urge the Government to give a second thought.  I have spoken  on

it earlier.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> The Family Court

has  counselled and mediated many divorce, custody,  maintenance

and family violence cases.  I would like to add to the effort of

the  Subordinate Courts in enhancing its mission  to  administer

justice by making a few suggestions on mediation principles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is to adopt a very cautious policy on pre-mediation

screening of all clients by trained officers in family  disputes

before  a  decision  is taken to proceed  with  mediation.   The

second  is  to  adopt  a  careful balance in  engaging  parallel

counselling  and  mediation procedures  in  managing  a  complex

relationship  by  giving  priority to client  protection,  child

protection  and  mediator safety.  A protocol of best  practices

must  be  drawn up and followed.  The third is to  be  ready  to

terminate mediation in an apparent marital dispute over property

and children, once domestic violence emerges as an issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I raise these concerns because mediation is effective and

just  only  when  contending parties could  negotiate  on  equal

terms.   If  any  one  contending  party  perceives  threat   or

violence,  and domestic violence is still a "live"  issue,  this

observation  must be taken into account in any arrangement  made

by  the mediator.  Otherwise, we may subject the weaker party to

continued violence at home, away from the eyes of the public.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intake Counselling Unit set up by the Family Court is a

positive  initiative.  I was told that six  more  vacancies  are

available but there are no takers.  Do we lack the skills in the

area  of administering restorative and therapeutic justice?   Or

is  there  a shortage of social workers?  Would the Courts  then

consider  foreign recruitment, if we cannot find  local  skills?

Sir,  we need appropriate skills, forecast and stronger resource

allocation  in planning the social work curriculum  and  student

intake  at our tertiary institutions to strengthen the  manpower

needs of various Ministries.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Sir,

let  me  first  take Mr Jeyaretnam's point.  As he  himself  has

said,  he has made this point many times before.  Therefore,  it

is  an old story.  In fact, as recently as the last time when we

took  the amendment on the Supreme Court of Judicature Act,  the

Minister has already replied in full as to why there is  nothing

wrong with the appellate system and why there is no need to  add

tiers to this system.  I think that is basically Mr Jeyaretnam's

point - that there should be more tiers to our appellate system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to put the situation in context. As Dr Toh

alluded  to,  and in fact Mr Jeyaretnam himself also  said,  our

judicial  system has been praised.  We have received  very  good

ratings  from  international agencies not just in terms  of  the

business aspect but also in terms of the courts and the  police,

both from the Institute of Management and Development as well as

from  PERC  (Political  and Economic  Risks  Consultancy).   And

indeed  even Singaporeans in surveys and foreigners living  here

have expressed confidence in our judicial system.  Why?  Because

they  know  of all the innovations that have been  made  by  the

Courts,  innovations that started when the current Chief Justice

took up his position as Chief Justice, which now spans seven  to

eight years.  I think all of us know that the Chief Justice  and

the Courts are very proactive.  In other words, what needs to be

done  to  improve the administration of justice as well  as  the

quality of justice will be done.  That is the first point.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if Mr Jeyaretnam said that we should have more tiers of

appeal  to  increase the quality of justice, the  point  is,  if

indeed  that  will increase the quality of justice,  that  would

have  been done.  The question is, would it necessarily  improve

the quality of justice?  Further tiers do not necessarily result

in  that.   What is important, as I have stressed many times  in

this House before, is the quality of the Judges - quality of the

Judges both at the hearing stage as well as the appeal stage.  I

am  sure  that lawyers in this House as well as lawyers  out  of

this  House will agree that the quality of our Judges and  their

judgements have gone up consistently over the years.  And  this,

in  fact,  has  resulted in the low number of appeals  that  are

being lodged from the Subordinate Courts to the High Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is how seriously appeals are taken. The fact

that  the Chief Justice hears all magistrates' appeals indicates

that  they are very seriously taken.  Because he hears all these

appeals,  he ensures that there is consistency in the sentencing

as well as set benchmark sentences.  Hence, it is not necessary,

as Mr Jeyaretnam has suggested, for there to be a further appeal

for  what  he  calls  the more serious cases or  cases  carrying

higher  penalties, magistrates' appeals going  up  to  the  High

Court  and  then to the Court of Appeal.  Because  we  must  not

forget  that  finality  and certainty of  proceedings  are  also

important features of a sound legal infrastructure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that he makes is the institution of a separate

panel of Judges to hear criminal appeals, or the appointment  of

ad  hoc Judges, to hear these appeals.  This in a way is related

to  Mr  Rai's point, even though it is not quite the same.   But

the  suggestion  is  to change the structure  of  the  Court  of

Appeal.   I  think Mr Rai's suggestion is in the  numbers,  that

there  should be more Judges of appeals to be appointed  to  the

Court of Appeal.  My reply to that would be, in terms of how the

Courts are structured, especially in terms of the Judges to  man

the Courts, it would be better to leave it to the Chief Justice,

because  he  is  the man on the spot.  He is in  charge  of  the

administration of the courts

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>

and  he  knows  the situation best.  So I am confident  that  he

would  take  into account matters such as the present  workload,

case  load  and demands of the Court of Appeal as  well  as  the

current  crop of Judges and Judicial Commissioners in  the  High

Court  when he makes decisions as to whether or not there  is  a

need  to  restructure or increase the number of  Judges  in  the

Court  of Appeal.  That is my response to Mr Jeyaretnam  and  Mr

Rai.

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai also knows that as and when there is a need to

constitute  a larger Court of Appeal, that has been  done.   The

Supreme  Court  of Judicature Act provides that  the  civil  and

criminal jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal can be exercised by

three or any greater uneven number of Judges of Appeal.  So even

if  the  norm is three Judges, the point is that the CJ has  the

discretion,  which he has exercised before,  to  have  a  larger

Court  of  Appeal.  So I think this works best because there  is

flexibility.   Let us not disturb that.  The best  thing  is  to

leave  it  to  the judgement of the Chief Justice to  decide  on

matters like this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai also asked about private summonses involving family

members or neighbours and whether these should be handled by the

community  mediation centres.  The first point to note  is  that

the  CMC,  currently structured, is set up not  to  replace  the

Subordinate  Courts in handling these neighbourly or  relational

disputes  arising  from private summonses.   Here,  there  is  a

flexibility  whereby if the parties agree,  the  magistrate  can

refer  these  disputes which come before him  to  the  community

mediation centres.  Indeed, this has been done.  There have been

62  referrals  so  far.  The Crime Registry of  the  Subordinate

Courts,  I  think Mr Rai also knows, also undertakes  mediation.

When parties come before it to file a private summons, they will

look  at it and in fact they also actively utilise mediation  to

assist  disputants  in  relational  disputes  to  resolve  their

disputes amicably, instead

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>

of just issuing private summonses immediately.  I am told that a

summons is issued only if there is absolutely no prospect of  an

amicable  resolution  and  the  parties  insist  on  proceeding.

Indeed,  over  the years, the Subordinate Courts  have  formally

institutionalised   mediation   to   deal   with    magistrates'

complaints.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is important. The concept of mediation, in the

context of these relational dispute cases which come before  the

Subordinate Courts, is being used.  But the point now is, should

we  go  a  step  further so as to bring these  disputes  to  the

ground,  to be mediated by the CMCs.  My reply is that  we  have

made a good start.  The CMC is about a year now, and so far,  62

referrals have taken place.  I am sure that when more  CMCs  are

set  up  on  the  ground,  so  that  it  is  better  distributed

geographically  and more accessible to residents,  more  can  be

done.  Indeed to encourage this, what we will do is the Ministry

is considering a computer link-up between the Subordinate Courts

and  the  CMCs so that the details of the parties and the  dates

for  mediation can be worked out whilst the parties are  at  the

Subordinate Courts.  This will facilitate mediation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community mediation on a national basis is still evolving.

The  Government  has made mediation voluntary to  encourage  its

wider  use.   In  due  course, when mediation  has  become  more

acceptable  and  is more widely used to resolve  such  community

relational  disputes, we may consider making  it  mandatory  for

these relational and neighbourly disputes to be mediated at CMCs

before a private summons will be issued.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang made some very useful suggestions which I

am grateful for and which I will relay to the Subordinate Courts

to  consider.  Her main point is that she is concerned about the

use  of  mediation, particularly in family violence  cases,  and

asked  whether that would be effective.  I understand  from  the

Subordinate  Courts  that  there is  a  difference  between  the

intervening  process which has been established  in  the  Family

Court and mediation per se.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counselling, not mediation, is the main intervention

process employed in family violence cases.  Even before deciding

whether  to counsel a family violence case, I am told  that  the

Family    Court's   professional   counsellor   evaluates    the

relationship between the two parties and the merits and value of

counselling.   Any  imbalance in power and control  between  the

parties is considered in the evaluation which, I think,  is  Mdm

Claire   Chiang's   point,  particularly  in   family   violence

situation.   It  is an important consideration  because  if  the

abused  party  is a spouse and, in particular,  a  female,  this

point about power and control should be considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Family Court's practice with regard to counselling and

mediation in cases where family violence has occurred takes  the

following   into  account.   Firstly,  parties   can   terminate

counselling  or mediation at any time, and they are  told  about

this  at  the  outset.   Secondly, the  applicant's  safety  and

ongoing protection is a paramount consideration.  Thirdly, court

counsellors and the Judges are fully aware of the possible power

and  balance between the parties.  And finally, the  court  does

not condone the use of violence.  Nevertheless, the Family Court

is  aware  that  not  all cases are suitable  for  mediation  or

counselling.   Professional counsellors make this assessment  at

the  intake session.  For example, counselling or mediation will

not be conducted if either party does not agree to it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, mediation is seldom conducted in cases involving

applications  for protection orders where the key  consideration

is the applicant's safety.  This is a valid point because if the

party  is seeking a protection order, that means she is  at  her

wit's  end,  she  wants  protection, not mediation.   The  court

recognises the plight of the spouse, in particular, if she is  a

woman  in  this situation.  To further assist the  applicant  in

such  cases where protection orders are issued, they are  served

to  the  parties within one day.  She will also  be  aware  that

breaches  of  protection orders are regarded  seriously  by  the

courts.   The party against whom the order is served is given  a

notice to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>

let  him  know  what  he  ought  not  to  do,  clear  sentencing

principles have been pronounced by the criminal courts  in  such

cases.    All  this  underscores  the  court's  awareness   that

mediation  should  not  be undertaken  at  the  expense  of  the

applicant's, normally the wife's, sense of safety.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude this part by assuring her that the Family

Court  takes its task very seriously.  It draws on all resources

and  I  understand that it has also engaged consultants to  give

seminars  on  how  to utilise mediation effectively.   So  every

measure is constantly and carefully evaluated over time and fine-tuned  and that is where Mdm Chiang's suggestions will  come  in

useful.  The system is not perfect but the resolve of the courts

is  to use mediation effectively so that the problem can also be

addressed effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, I just want to mention one point because

Mr  Jeyaretnam  earlier on in his speech  also  alluded  to  the

earlier  debate when we amended the Supreme Court of  Judicature

Act.   I  want to say that the Chief Justice, in his Opening  of

the  Legal  Year  speech,  gave the assurance  that  the  recent

amendments  are not to prevent access to justice  and  that  the

right  of  appeal is not lost.  He also said that he would  keep

the  matter  under review and, if necessary, would recommend  to

the President to vary the limits.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> As Mr Jeyaretnam is not around to tell us

what he wants to do with this amendment, I will therefore put it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I urge the Attorney-General's Chambers to use

plain  language  in  its  legislation.   It  is  important  that

legislation  should  be clearly understood  by  the  man-in-the-street.   This point was raised in an earlier debate  concerning

another Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I move on to the next topic, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I have a plea to the Government. It

will  be  in the interest of both the legal profession  and  the

Attorney-General's Chambers if some work were farmed out to  the

private  sector lawyers who have more expertise  in  this  area.

Similarly,  I would also urge that promising State Counsels  and

DPPs be attached to legal firms for a short stint from three  to

six  months.   I  have  in  mind  people  who  are  involved  in

legislation  and  who  are dealing with corporate  matters.   It

would be good for them to be attached to some of these big firms

where they have good exposure.  I must declare my interest as  a

lawyer, Sir.  But I am thinking in the long-term interest of the

legal profession as well as the administration of justice, and I

would urge the Minister to give this his consideration.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, on Mr Rai's first point on the

use  of plain English, I am sure Mr Rai would be pleased to know

that  the AG's Chambers have indeed been using the plain English

approach to legal drafting for some time.  In fact, the  AG  has

been  concerned  with  this.   As early  as  January  1996,  the

Singapore  Academy of Law (OSAL) held a series of  workshops  to

promote the use of plain English in legal drafting conducted  by

experts  from Australia.  In his keynote address at the Opening,

the AG emphasised the importance of plain English drafting.   He

mentioned  that he had instructed the legislative  draftsmen  to

adopt  plain English in legislative drafting without sacrificing

precision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chambers have also adopted the policy of drafting

legislation in plain English whenever it is feasible to  do  so.

One initiative is the redrafting of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>

prescribed  forms for the sale and purchase of  residential  and

commercial properties under the Housing Developers (Control  and

Licensing) Act and the Sale of Commercial Properties Act.  These

forms in plain English have been in use since October 1997.  The

Chambers were also involved in 1998 in assisting the Law Society

in  redrafting the Law Society's standard Conditions of Sale  of

Real   Property  in  plain  English.   This  is   an   important

development of plain English in legal drafting in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Law Revision Commission, chaired by the AG, has in its

revision of statutes and subsidiary legislation, also taken  the

opportunity to weed out archaic and obsolete terms used  in  the

existing  legislation.  The Commission has also simplified  such

legislation  by  breaking down long and complex  sentences  into

shorter  paragraphs and subsections.  Headings  have  also  been

used  instead  of side notes for easier reading.   In  addition,

Members would find it easier to understand a Bill by reading its

Explanatory Statement first.  The purpose of the Statement is to

explain   in  plain  English  the  intention  of  each  proposed

provision  in the Bill in a precise manner.  I understand  that,

to further facilitate the understanding of the provisions of the

Bill,  the  Chambers is considering in future preparing  a  more

elaborate  Explanatory  Statement to a  Bill  so  that  it  will

facilitate easier reading and understanding of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point Mr Rai made is with regard to assigning of

cases by the AG's Chambers to civil firms.  The position is that

the  AG's  Chambers  will assign cases to legal  firms  whenever

there is a need to do so.  However, Mr Rai also knows that  most

of  the  civil  cases that AG currently handles involve  matters

like  debt  collection and motor accidents involving Government-owned vehicles.  It is uneconomical to assign these cases to the

private sector.  However, the point is that whenever there is  a

need to do so, the AG's Chambers will do it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is that, because there is little litigation on

private matters, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>

AG  is  considering sending Legal Officers for  attachment  with

private law firms to gain experience in civil work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore dollar has been declining in comparison to

the American dollar although it has risen against the basket  of

currencies.  My concern is that if the dollar declines  further,

and  the  speculated  element sets  in,  what  steps  would  the

Government take to see that the dollar is protected.  Of course,

there  are  some people who feel that the dollar should  decline

further.  But I leave it to the Minister's judgement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, can I take the second cut as well, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I have been supportive from the very beginning

about  the  merger of the local banks.  I have filed a  Question

for  Oral Answer and the DPM has replied.  I again plead to both

the banks and the Government to take steps because it will be in

the long-term interest of the financial market in Singapore that

the banks are consolidated.  Perhaps, the Government may take  a

lead  by  telling the banks.  At least, those in the  UOB  Group

should  merge together. Similarly, other banks which have  other

subsidiaries in the stable should do so.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every other country, even in India, is thinking of a

similar  move to merge, and if we are to succeed in this sector,

I  think  it would be in the long-term interest for the  banking

sector to have fewer banks. I would urge the Government to  take

the lead in persuading the local banks to do so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, last year, I made a

similar  call for the Minister to review the listing  rules  for

high technology companies and I believe when the Second Minister

for  Trade and Industry, BG George Yeo, responded on this issue,

he  did  indicate  that this is one of the areas  that  will  be

looked  into in order to encourage technopreneurship to flourish

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, technological companies require substantial funds and

capital investments as well as on-going spending on research and

development to keep up with the fast changing technology.  Funds

invested  in  such projects can be tied up for long  periods  of

time.   Technopreneurs  typically have  many  ideas  and,  as  I

mentioned  during  the debate on the Budget  Statement,  getting

funds is a big challenge in the current Singapore environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an entrepreneur is successful in attracting venture

capitalists, typically because of the large investments  needed,

the entrepreneur's share of the company could be grossly diluted

if  he  does  not have a significant amount of his own  cash  to

invest, which is typically the case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Taiwan, there is a vibrant environment of many new

companies,  especially in the Hsin Chu Science-based  Industrial

Park.   Technopreneurs are able to source  funds  easily  either

through  venture capitalists or by quickly turning around  their

investments  in  companies.   There is such a thing  as  a  grey

market where shares can be traded the day the company is formed.

The  buy  and  sell prices for such company shares are  in  fact

published in local newspapers for the public to trade  in  these

shares.  The end result is that they have a quick turnaround and

availability  of  funds  for new start-ups.   Entrepreneurs  can

therefore multiply their funds for use in new projects.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In USA, for such high-tech companies, the fast track

initial  public offering channel was created some years  ago  by

setting  up the Nasdaq Board. This Board does not have stringent

requirements of a track record of revenue, profit or  size.   As

long  as there is a good portfolio of technology and ideas  with

possible future growth potential, companies are allowed to raise

funds through the Nasdaq.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, listing of companies to raise funds takes a

very  long time and hence the cycle time of new companies to  be

started up is much longer, since the funds are tied up for  long

periods of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have the following suggestions for the Ministry:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Make it easier to list technological start-up companies

where intellectual property and a potential business plan become

the deciding criteria.  Of course, the public must be made aware

of  the high risk nature of such companies and leave it to  them

to  decide  if they want to invest.  In fact, I suggest,  for  a

start,  we  use  our  second  Board,  Sesdaq,  by  allowing  two

categories of companies to raise funds on this Board - one group

following  existing  rules and the other that  allows  the  fast

track criteria that I have talked about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Make it easier for private venture capitalists to raise

funds  from  the  public.  We should allow open fund-raising  of

such high risk funds, once again by making it known to potential

investors the high risk nature of such funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many rich individuals in Singapore who may

not have the ideas but who may be willing to participate in such

funds.   So  I  hope  that the Ministry would  look  into  these

suggestions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, last year, I

spoke  on  the need to promote high-tech industry to  bring  our

economy  up  the value ladder.  I also asked the  Government  to

consider providing more incentives for the private equity funds,

including those for boutique

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>

funds.   I  am truly glad that the Government has acted  swiftly

and put this in place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I have one more item on my wish list, which is the

same  as  what  Mr  Inderjit Singh has asked for  and  that  is,

Singapore  should have a stock exchange for high-tech  industry.

Let  me  explain  why I wish there was one.   In  the  midst  of

promoting technopreneurship, Singapore set up the basic physical

infrastructure such as a high-tech park near NUS, it pumps money

into  R&D,  the use of network with world renowned universities.

But for those who are familiar and who could embrace technology,

all  these are wonderful things.  But our society has  not  been

oriented this way.  Many of us still do not know or simply  fear

technology.   Quite many of us cannot even define  a  knowledge-based economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, there is a need to systematically educate our people.

I  know  the  schools  are teaching the  kids  to  be  computer-literate.  Our younger workforce also learns about IT in schools

or  on  the job.  But there is a large pool of people out  there

who  may not be comfortable with technology and many of them  do

not  even  know  how to log on to a user-friendly computer,  let

alone  convincing  them to learn about cyber transactions,  gene

splicing  and  growing artificial human organs.  This  group  of

people in our society, however, represents the wealthy.  Many of

them  belong  to  the  baby  boom  generation  or  even  earlier

generations.  They have made and accumulated substantial  wealth

during the good years in our nation building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Taiwan, 40% of the economy is high-tech. Many companies

were  started  by returning scientists who came  up  with  their

peers  who  succeeded in other businesses.  In Israel, high-tech

businesses also boom due to their Jewish connections in USA.  In

Singapore, we probably lack all these connections.  Therefore, I

think a stock exchange for high-tech industry would be useful to

raise  funds  for promising start-ups to expedite  the  flow  of

information   between   the  technologists   and   the   wealthy

businessmen to attract talents from overseas and who hope to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>

raise  funds  here  and to position ourselves  for  the  venture

capitalists to operate here.  And, hopefully, we can modify  the

risk-averse culture of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know we are now too early and too small to have a full-fledged high-tech exchange, let alone to challenge Nasdaq. But,

like  all financial centres, there can be more than one in  this

world.   Singapore can well be such a centre  for  Asia  in  the

future.   Without  getting started, we  probably  would  not  be

there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I suggest that Government look into the possibility of

setting  up  facilities similar to bulletin boards or  over-the-counter  in America, and these details have been covered  by  Mr

Singh  earlier.   This may not form part of the existing  Sesdaq

and it is up to the Ministry to structure it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, please allow me to quote a few figures to let the

House have a feel of how much wealth such exchange can create in

the future.  As at yesterday, I called up a stockbroker at 5  pm

-  Yahoo! had a market capitialistaion of US$33 billion; America

On-line  had a market capitalisation of US$85 billion.   Another

highflying bio-tech company, the Human Genome Science  is  worth

US$715 billion and, of course, our Creative Technology is  worth

about US$1.2 billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have $100 billion in reserves, which is equivalent to

two  Yahoos!   We  took 33 years to build up  $100  billion  and

Yahoo!  took  four  years to get half of  it.   Of  course,  the

Internet  stocks  are  now very high  and  there  is  a  lot  of

speculation on it.  So, this comparison may not be fair but  the

contrast  is very stark and makes one feel that besides building

our  physical infrastructure, we should find ways to  churn  out

our national resources and to combine with outside resources  so

that  this exchange can expedite the growth of our wealth.  With

good  planning and some good luck, we may be able to double  our

wealth in a shorter period.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If what Mr Chuang said

is  correct, then I think the PAP Government is not  up  to  the

standard.  Yahoo! took 2 years and we took more than 30 years!

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Government encouraged the people of Singapore to

invest  in  shares, Singaporeans from all walks of life  happily

jumped  on  the  band wagon, with the hope that  the  Government

would create wealth for them through the share market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many loyal Singaporeans believed that all activities they were

encouraged  by  the  Government to participate  in  would  bring

benefits to them. This time round, they have their fingers, some

even have their hands, burnt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most innocent ones are those who bought Malaysian shares

from  the  CLOB  share  market.  Since  the  Stock  Exchange  of

Singapore  (SES) announced in September last year to close  down

the CLOB market which had made lots of money for the SES and the

Government  for  the  past 8 years, those investors  who  bought

Malaysian  shares could only lament their bitterness before  the

heaven.  All their investments are stuck, and they have  no  way

of knowing when they will see the light of day again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP Government who has all along self-proclaimed to be

brilliant and capable, pushed the blame to the people  and  said

that  the people should  have recognised the risk of investment.

What  I want to point out is that the situation here is not  one

of  the  usual risks involved in investment.  The fact  here  is

that,  this CLOB market, as set up by the SES, has the  inherent

risk  of  collapse of the whole market system itself.   This  is

not  the type of risk which people describe as the risk of being

eaten  up  by  the crocodile as one enters the "crocodile  pit".

Now, the whole crocodile pit is disintegrated.  Everything is in

a quandary and heaven knows when it is going to settle down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government did not care about the super-risk the investors

were  facing,  neither did they heed the Malaysian  Government's

repeated  warning that this market was illegal, and went  on  to

operate  it  for  8 years.  It was only when the Government  was

forced  into  an impasse that it was thrown into  confusion  and

left  it  to run its own course.  As a result, the fate  of  the

investors'  share capital is now left entirely in the  hands  of

the Malaysian

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>

Government.  You call this a responsible Government?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 31st August 1998, approximately 200,000 investors were

affected and most of them were Singaporeans.  Since the collapse

of this CLOB market some half a year ago, apart from apologising

hastily  to  the  investors, the SES took  no  further  positive

action.  The Government also seems to have washed its hands  off

the  matter,  and it leaves the Singapore investors  who  bought

Malaysian shares at the mercy of the Malaysian Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know what measures this self-proclaimed

brilliant,   capable,  far-sighted  and  highly  efficient   PAP

Government  is  going  to  adopt  to  protect  the  interest  of

Singaporean investors who invested in Malaysian shares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the PAP Government has been advocating Total Defence

all the time.  But, have we done enough in our economic defence?

Why is it that all of a sudden, the investment by the people  of

Singapore  in  their homeland has become the  sacrifice  in  the

political wrestle between Singapore and Malaysia, and  even  the

control  of  capital  has  gone into  the  hands  of  a  foreign

government?

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, there are two buzzwords today in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>

money into their systems.  Some of these systems are, of course,

increasingly  getting  obsolete because  of  the  fast  pace  of

technology development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NETS has done a good job in helping Singapore to be placed

in the world of e-banking and e-commerce, but I think it is fast

losing  its  competitiveness.  We do not want it to  become  the

hare that  lost the race to the tortoise.  When its services are

high  cost, it means that a  lot of SMEs that we want to develop

into  e-commerce players have got this problem of not being able

to  pay  the  cost.  For example, banks would charge transaction

charges   of  4-6%  per  transaction  and  require   a   minimum

transaction  of $50,000 per month, and there are lots  of  other

sums  involved  too  with the software and  acquisition  of  the

hardware and so on.  These are sums that no businessman would go

into  if he wants to do e-commerce and then have to pay for  the

Internet payment services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides the fact that obsolete technology can leave us

behind,  there is also this problem of being isolated  from  the

world,  because if we are intent on only developing  one  system

that  does not want to move forward, then we would end up  being

isolated from the world.  And this would mean that the lead that

we  have  achieved would be lost.  As an example, NETS  was  the

first  smart  card  in  the payment  world.   It  has  now  been

overtaken by quite a few other international services  like  the

Belgian  Proton, like Mondex, Maestro and there  is  the  CIRRUS

network  and  other  systems all over the world  that  may  soon

overtake  some of the things that NETS has developed a lead  in.

I  would therefore call for a re-thinking of this monopoly  that

is currently present and allowing perhaps for non-bank clearers.

In the Internet, everything is equal.  All small and big players

would be on a playing field that is level and therefore it might

be  possible to have a small, agile payment provider that is not

a  bank, or perhaps even a foreign bank provider or a consortium

of  foreign banks that could give NETS competition and a run for

its money.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, Mr Shriniwas Rai asked about the

Singapore dollar, its value is declining, how do we protect  the

value  of  the  Singapore dollar.  The  Singapore  dollar  is  a

floating  currency.  It is a managed float, but, basically,  its

value  is  determined by the market supply and demand.   Against

the US dollar, it has depreciated maybe 20-odd percent since the

crisis  began in July 1997.  But on a trade weighted  basis,  if

you  take  an  average of a basket of all our trading  partners'

currencies,  in  fact, the exchange rate has remained,  more  or

less,  stable.  It went up somewhat over a period of a  year  or

so, and it has gradually come down and it is now more or less at

the  starting  point.  So I do not think that the exchange  rate

has  depreciated  sharply.  The best guarantee of  the  exchange

rate  is  a  strong economy, high domestic savings, no excessive

foreign  borrowings,  confidence  by  foreign  parties  and   by

Singaporeans in the economy and in the currency.  If people lose

confidence in your currency, then you are finished.  And if your

domestic  population lose confidence in your currency,  you  are

even  more finished, because you will never have enough reserves

to  stump  up  when  Singaporeans come and  say,  "Here  are  my

Singapore dollars, I want to swop them for US dollars, Yen, Euro

or whatever."  I think that the best protection of the Singapore

dollar   value  is  confidence  and  a  sound  set  of  economic

principles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for protection from speculators, we have never

encouraged  speculation in the Singapore dollar.   We  watch  it

quite  carefully, and if it deviates too far from what we  judge

to  be  the fundamentals, MAS does not hesitate to intervene  in

order  to  bring  it  back.  We have  not  had  to  do  so  very

frequently  and  I  think we have a good  credibility  with  the

market.   If  we want to do something, we are not without  means

altogether, and I think I do not have to say very much more than

that on this subject.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai also asked about mergers of banks and what more we

can  do.  First of all, it is not within the Government's  power

to compel local banks to merge.  They will assess for themselves

whether mergers are desirable for them, attractive

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>

as  a strategy to stay competitive, or whether they prefer to go

on their own.  The most important incentive for rationalising is

the  fact  that  we  are embarked irrevocably  on  a  course  of

liberalising our domestic banking sector.  We have said that  we

are  going  to do it over five years.  We have been working  out

the  specific  schemes, and MAS will be announcing  a  plan  and

steps to accomplish this next month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once this is in motion, the dynamics will look after

themselves.  Because as the environment becomes more  open,  the

competitive pressures will grow and there will be incentives for

the banks to rationalise, to get their own acts in order, to get

plans  for  the  medium  and  long  term,  and  to  shift  their

strategies and approaches and rationalise things, which  perhaps

they  would  have  left be had they not been  under  such  great

pressure.   And if you were to look at what the banks have  been

doing  over the last few months, you will know that in fact  the

ice  has broken, and they are already taking steps.  It  is  not

just  DBS  which has merged with POSBank, and is making business

plans domestically and in the region.  OCBC has recruited a  new

CEO from Hong Kong and explained to its staff its plans to raise

returns  on  its equity and service to customers, and  to  focus

their business on retail banking.  OUB also has, I believe  they

call it OUB 21 plan, to improve their performance.  And all  the

other  banks, I am sure, are making their calculations  on  what

they  should do in this new situation.  So there has to be  free

play.   On the one hand, people want us to encourage the private

sector  to bloom.  On the other hand, they want us to  make  the

private sector do things.  We find a judicious balance.  We have

set  the  forces in motion and must now let them play themselves

out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chuang Shaw Peng and Mr Inderjit Singh asked about

raising  money for start-ups and whether we need to  change  the

rules  and  have  a  special exchange for  high-tech  start-ups.

Currently,  Sesdaq,  which  is SES's  second  board,  caters  to

listings  by  small and medium sized enterprises  which  include

technological

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>

start-ups.    Contrary   to   popular   impressions,    Sesdaq's

requirements  for  listing  are in  fact  very  basic  and  very

flexible.  You do not need any minimum profit.  You do not  need

any  issued  capital or operating history to seek a  listing  on

Sesdaq.   These requirements are simpler and less  onerous  than

those of other markets.  But the fact is that when people go  on

to  Sesdaq,  they  do tend to try to have some  issued  capital,

operating  history and so forth, because they find it easier  to

get  investors  to  buy  shares in their company  if  they  have

something to show, rather than just promises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SES does not normally take very long to accept or reject a

listing  application, not more than 4-6 weeks.  But, of  course,

the  issue  manager may need time to perform due  diligence  and

prepare  the  company  for  the listing  before  submitting  the

application to SES.  How long the issue manager takes depends on

the  complexity of the case and whether any major  restructuring

needs to be done before the listing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a Corporate Finance Committee last year to review

these issues amongst others, and they identified two impediments

for  start-up companies wishing to obtain a listing.   First  of

all,  start-ups  find  it  difficult to  find  investment  banks

willing  to  manage and underwrite their share  issues,  because

there  is a perception that investors will not be interested  in

buying shares of start-up companies.  And when they are prepared

to  underwrite, their fees are quite high, and higher than those

paid by companies with track records.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, compliance and due diligence costs, preparing the

prospectus  and financial reports for an IPO, are expensive  and

prohibitive,  unless you are raising a fairly  large  amount  of

money.   If  you  look at companies which list on  Nasdaq,  they

raise  at  least US$50 million for the national market or  US$20

million for the small capital market.  And this is quite  a  lot

more than the amounts raised by many companies here, even on the

main board.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Corporate Finance Committee has recommended

that  the  needs  of start-up companies be met  not  by  further

relaxing  compliance and due diligence standards on Sesdaq,  but

by  establishing an Internet-based bulletin board to  facilitate

matching  the  needs  of  start-ups and those  of  sophisticated

investors  and venture capitalists who register as  subscribers.

These investors are better able to understand the risks and  the

potential  for  losses  of  investing  in  start-ups,  and  will

contractually acknowledge the risks involved.  In  other  words,

you  sign, you know what you are doing.  If the money  is  lost,

this  was a gamble which you were prepared to take and are  able

to stomach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Start-ups may raise funds by selling their shares to small

groups of subscriber investors without having to comply with the

usual  prospectus  requirements, and  so  lower  the  compliance

costs.  The bulletin board will cater to start-ups and companies

that  find  listing on Sesdaq uneconomical.  The Government  has

agreed   with  this  recommendation  of  the  Corporate  Finance

Committee, and SES will study the feasibility of setting  up  an

Internet-based bulletin board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides addressing the financing concerns of high-tech

start-ups,  the Government has also set up the Technopreneurship 21

Committee,  to  look  into  the  creation  of  a  conducive

environment  that  would allow nimble knowledge-based  high-tech

enterprises to flourish.  And their initial recommendations  are

expected to be announced by the middle of the year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should say, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that while funding needs

are  a  significant  issue to consider,  the  basic  problem  in

technological start-ups is that you need entrepreneurs, you need

ideas,  you  need  the technology and the talent,  in  order  to

launch  a  company.  In other words, you need the  primary  pre-conditions  before all the supporting paraphernalia will  be  of

help  to  you.  Otherwise, you will just be throwing money  away

and  getting  no returns.  Many governments have tried  spending

money  and  have  got no returns.  The fact that  we  have  $100

billion in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>

official  reserves, it is not an argument for throwing it  away,

but  a  demonstration of how not throwing money away leaves  you

with good savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the high value of Internet stocks and the phenomenal

success  of  Amazon.com, I agree with what Mr  Low  Thia  Khiang

said,   ie,  if  that  is  the  yardstick,  then  the  Singapore

Government  must admit to have done very badly.  But  I  do  not

think  that  is a yardstick and I am not sure what is  going  to

happen with Internet stocks.  I would advise Singaporeans not to

look for quick schemes to double their wealth.

<br>5.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang has asked about Clob. Firstly, he said the

Government encourages share ownership and people have  now  been

burnt.  I should point out that we have never asked people to go

and buy shares.  What we have done is to arrange share ownership

through  Government  divestments through  an  asset  enhancement

scheme through Singapore Telecom, later on Singapore Power,  PSA

and others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you buy other shares on the SES, then you have to make your

decisions  whether to go in or not, and whether the  shares  are

worth  it or not, and when to sell.  If you buy shares on  Clob,

then  you  go in on the clear understanding that these  are  not

Singapore  shares  subject  to Singapore  rules,  but  over-the-counter  shares bought and sold subject to rules which apply  in

other  countries.  In this case, we are talking about  Malaysian

shares  and  therefore subject to a different set of risks,  and

not  just  market  risks,  but the risk  of  the  market  itself

breaking  down  or  closing down, or  running  into  some  other

problems.   In  fact, every transaction slip which  Clob  issued

when  it  was operating had a disclaimer at the bottom that  you

are  taking  the risk and you have to know what you  are  doing.

Unfortunately,  a significant number of Singaporeans,  including

some  who  really could not afford it, thought that Clob  was  a

good punt and found it more exciting that Singapore stocks,  but

there were risks.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low said we ignored warnings that Clob was illegal and

therefore  we  were  irresponsible.  In  fact,  Clob  was  never

illegal.   Clob  was an off-shore stock market  regulated  under

Singapore   law  and  therefore  outside  the  jurisdiction   of

Malaysian   law.    Therefore,  Clob  did  not   require   legal

recognition  and authorisation of the Malaysian  authorities  to

operate.    That  Clob  was  not  recognised  by  the  Malaysian

authorities  did not make it illegal for any investor,  in  fact

even  for  Malaysian investors, to trade shares on  Clob.   Clob

operated  like  any  other off-shore securities  market  in  the

world, and there were also Malaysian shares traded in other off-shore markets, for example, in London.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On its part, the SES has always ensured that Clob complied fully

with  Malaysian  law  where applicable.   All  Malaysian  shares

traded  on  Clob  were properly registered  and  deposited  with

Malaysian Central Depository (MCD) in accordance with its  rules

and  regulations.  The  CDP,  which  is  the  Singapore  Central

Depository  of shares, complied fully with applicable  Malaysian

law  in  its  relationship with MCD.   Otherwise, the  Malaysian

authorities   would  doubtless  have  promptly   rectified   the

situation  during  the  nine years when  Malaysian  shares  were

traded on Clob.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Malaysians imposed new rules on 1st September and

then shortly thereafter imposed exchange controls, they actually

changed  the  rules and changed the scheme.  After  which,  Clob

reassessed  the situation and found that it was  not  viable  to

continue,  and suspended trading, and reached an agreement  with

the  KLSE  in September 1998 to expedite the migration  of  Clob

investors' shares to the investors' own securities accounts with

the   Malaysian  Central  Depository  in  accordance  with   the

procedures set out by the KL Stock Exchange at that time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDP signed an agreement with the Malaysian Securities

Clearing Automated Networks Services Sendiran Berhad (SCANS) for

this purpose.  The intention was that once the migration was

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>

completed  an  investor could trade his Clob shares  on  the  KL

Stock Exchange.  In other words, the SES signed an agreement  in

writing  with  the  KLSE  to facilitate the  migration  of  Clob

shares,  the opening of accounts in Malaysia on the MCD and  the

transfer  of their shares to these individual accounts  so  that

individual  Clob shareholders can trade them in accordance  with

the new Malaysian rules through Malaysian brokers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SES and CDP have done everything expected of them under

this agreement and they have been waiting for the Malaysians  to

do  their part.  We have asked SES to clarify the legal position

and  their legal advice is that there is no ambiguity about  the

legal  position of Clob shareholders.  Clob investors are  legal

owners of their Malaysian shares and they cannot be deprived  of

their rights, including the rights to trade their shares on  the

KL Stock Exchange eventually, subject to the same rules that the

KLSE  imposes  on  foreign investors.   So  that  is  where  the

position  is.   Obviously  it  is an  unresolved  issue  between

Singapore and Malaysia, which will be discussed further  at  the

appropriate channels and forums.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Total Defence and whether we are paying enough

attention  to economic defence, I think the Member has  a  valid

point.   On  the one hand, we want to encourage inter-dependence

with  our  trading partners, particularly with  our  neighbours.

Because  through  inter-dependence,  it  gives  both  sides   an

incentive  to  work for mutual benefit.  On the other  hand,  we

also  have  to  reserve  our position and  have  some  fall-back

position in case inter-dependence does not work, so that we have

some  means to do it and go it alone.  We do this in many areas.

The  Stock Exchange is one where an issue has arisen, but  there

are  also  other  areas.  Water is a good example  where  inter-dependence  is our preferred choice but, if necessary,  we  will

not be left helpless.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the question from Dr Toh See Kiat on competition

for   Nets   and  also  Internet  banking.   As  part   of   the

liberalisation of our domestic banking market, MAS  is  studying

foreign  banks'  access  to front and  back  end  infrastructure

necessary  to  support multi-purpose stored  value  cards  being

issued  by foreign institutions.  We are studying this and  when

we announce our overall liberalisation package, this will be one

of the items.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign banks are already allowed to compete freely in the

Internet  banking.   We have no restrictions  on  foreign  banks

setting  up  websites to market their services and Citibank  and

StanChart,  for example, among others,  have their own  websites

already,  which offer Internet bill payment services for  retail

and  corporate customers through inter-bank Giro system and also

provide credit card facilities for Internet merchants.   So  the

banks  already  do  some.   Non-banks  participate  in  Internet

commerce   either  as  merchants  or  infrastructure  providers.

Merchants,  for example, FairPrice, National Computer  Services,

Singapore Press Holdings or Golden Village, have access to their

present credit card and the cash card payment system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-bank infrastructure providers, which only provide back-end

Internet payment processing are not regulated by MAS.  They  are

not  banks, so they are not allowed to issue stored value  cards

because  these cards are really a form of deposits to the  banks

and  we want to make quite sure that there is a good institution

there, properly regulated, so the institution would not fold up,

taking  the value of the cards with them.  We are not  going  to

review  this  part  of  the  policy  because  the  security  and

financial  risks of Internet payments are still  not  yet  fully

understood.   But  we  are monitoring it  closely,  particularly

international developments in this area, to make  sure  that  if

other  countries  have fresh developments in Internet  commerce,

our laws stay up to date.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I have your permission to seek

one clarification from the Deputy Prime Minister?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, make it short.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> It seems to me that Singaporeans who

hold  Malaysian shares now are being deprived of their right  to

trade  on the market by the Malaysian authorities.  How  is  the

Government of Singapore going to help them?  Or are we going  to

leave it as it is with no end to it?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The shares remain the shares of the

Clob  shareholders.  As I have explained, there is an  agreement

between  Clob and the KL Stock Exchange to make the arrangements

for  the shares to be traded.  The Singapore Stock Exchange  has

done its part. We are now awaiting for the KL Stock Exchange  to

do  their  part.  The Member would have noticed  that  when  the

Prime Minister met Prime Minister Mahathir in Hanoi in December,

they  talked  about the package of issues to  be  discussed  and

resolved together as one bundle.   Clob was one of the items.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, earlier Mr Low Thia

Khiang  mentioned  that  if  we were to  compare  the  Singapore

economy  with  the  Internet  stocks,  then  Singapore  has   no

standard.   Personally, I agree with what DPM said.  It  is  not

appropriate to compare a company with a national economy.   This

afternoon,  I  would  like to touch on the topic  of  long  term

competitiveness because there is really a difference  between  a

national economy and a company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A company basically goes into business to make money. When

the  business  is good, the money is good, they move  into  that

business sector to make money.  When the situation changes, when

the  business is no good, the climate changes, they can get  out

of  the  business and move on to somewhere else.  Many companies

that were around 20 years ago are not around today.  But in  the

case  of a country, a country cannot be opportunistic, a country

cannot go into business just because things are good and get out

of  business  and say that these are no longer  good.   This  is

because,  at  the end of the day, the Singapore economy  has  to

continue for many more years to come.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another difference is that in the case of a company, when

it  moves  from one business to another business, it can  always

downsize the company and retrench all their workers.  But in the

case of a national economy, as we restructure, as we upgrade our

economy,  we would have to continue to live with the  same  work

force, the younger ones and the older ones.  As long as they are

Singaporeans,  we  will have to travel the journey  of  economic

progress together with them as one united team.  In this regard,

my  concern is this:  as we move into a knowledge-based  economy

in  the future, we have to help as many Singaporeans as possible

to upgrade and to be transformed into knowledge workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, I agreed fully with what the Minister mentioned,

that  the  Singapore Government is doing a lot  to  upgrade  and

retrain  the workers through the SDF, SRP, ETF and INTECH.   But

my  concern is that whatever we are doing up till now may not be

enough  to help our Singaporean workforce to upgrade fast enough

to  keep  in  pace with this evolution towards a knowledge-based

economy.   If  we  are not able to upgrade our entire  workforce

fast  enough,  in  five  to ten years  from  now,  many  of  the

Singaporean  workers  are going to become  a  liability  in  our

economy  and a liability in our society.  But if we are able  to

act  fast enough and transform as many of them as possible  into

knowledge  workers,  they can turn into  a  national  asset  and

become  the source of driving force to push our economy  further

in a knowledge-based economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This afternoon I just want to put up a very simple request.

In  the  past,  we  granted  pioneer  status,  for  example,  to

companies for job creation when we had high unemployment.  Later

on,  we  granted pioneer status to companies for  their  capital

investment  when  we  moved  into a  capital-intensive  economy.

Later  on, we granted pioneer status to companies based on total

business spending (TBS) because we wanted to capitalise  on  the

regional market.  We want to encourage companies to set up  OHQ.

In the future, as we move into a knowledge-based

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>

economy,  since  one of our key challenges is to  transform  our

workers  into  knowledge workers, can we not  consider  granting

pioneer  status and investment allowance to companies  based  on

their    investment   in   manpower   redevelopment,   in    the

transformation of workers into knowledge workers?

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I would like to declare my interest

in the trading business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, traders big and small, have contributed significantly

to  our  economy.  Smaller traders have been successful in  non-traditional  markets and have developed interesting niche  areas

where OEM or big suppliers have not been able to get into.   One

of  the issues is that such companies in Singapore usually trade

or  operate  in  risky  but profitable  second  or  third  world

countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banks treat such small businesses like small "sampans"

in  rough and choppy waters who are likely to be rocked or sunk.

The  banks  prefer to support big companies that  are  like  big

boats or ships.  They rather prefer to support an ocean liner or

super tanker sized big business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little do these banks realise that many of these sampans

have  very  strong jet engines that allow them to steer  out  of

troubled waters.  They are flexible and can move fast.   On  the

other  hand, even the Titanic could not get out of trouble  fast

enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the recent financial crisis, banks have become very

conservative.  A lot of us have talked about this many times and

many  local companies, especially the smaller traders, have been

badly  hit  by cash flow problems.  Many have viable  businesses

and  business  opportunities but lack the credit facilities  and

cannot take advantage of the opportunities available to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that the Minister look into the

following two areas:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, a Government-funded trade financing scheme where

the  Government  can  provide  an LEFS-equivalent  scheme  using

traded  goods  as  security,  if necessary.  Alternatively,  the

Government could arrange for some local and international  banks

to undertake a minimum of, say, 3% to 5% of their loan portfolio

to  such  traders  and, if loss is incurred, the  banks  can  be

allowed to write off such bad debts with a double tax deduction.

<br>6.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, currently, countries like Hong Kong provide tax

exemption  for third country trades done outside the country  by

local  companies.  Can Singapore provide a similar incentive  so

that  we can encourage traders to remain in Singapore while they

manage such third country trades from here?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has come to my attention that in the last two

years,  many traders who operated out of Singapore have  decided

to  relocate to countries like Dubai and Hong Kong for a  number

of  reasons:  firstly, the cost of doing business  in  Singapore

where  our cost is between two and four times higher than  these

countries;  secondly, the inability to raise funds in Singapore;

and thirdly, the restrictive tax practices in Singapore.  I hope

we can reverse this move by doing more for traders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I move on to my next cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Many Members have spoken about the need

to  change our tax laws in this House for the last two days.  We

have  to  consider  these  changes to be  competitive  with  tax

practices  of countries around the world, with whom we  are  now

competing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past 30 years, the focus of our economy was largely

to   bring  in  foreign  direct  investments  of  mainly   large

multinational corporations and on an industrialisation programme

that  brought  Singapore from an under-developed  to  an  almost

developed economy status.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, as we look into the future, we know that we have to

change  the  direction  and the approach  needed  to  bring  our

economy to the next stage of growth to sustain another 30  years

of economic prosperity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I talked about the three areas in the Budget debate,

and  I  believe  that  we should focus on these  three,  namely,

promoting  growth  through globalisation and searching  for  new

markets through either greenfield investments or through mergers

and acquisitions in the region or around the world; secondly, to

promote  entrepreneurship or technopreneurship and  a  knowledge

based  economy; and thirdly, by encouraging a vibrant small  and

medium enterprises sector to emerge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve these, our tax laws have to be revamped to be

more  future  orientated.  Today, our system tries  to  be  very

comprehensive  so as to plug any loopholes, as  Mr  Heng  Chiang

Meng  mentioned  yesterday.  In doing so, our laws  become  very

restrictive  just  because  we want  to  capture  a  handful  of

occurrences of companies trying to benefit from these loopholes.

These restrictive rules then discourage and become obstacles for

companies who genuinely need to grow and who can compete  around

the  world.  We should put in place rules that allow flexibility

and  facilitate  the growth of these three  areas  that  I  have

mentioned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a number of suggestions for the Ministry of

Finance  that will help in developing the areas of  our  economy

that   we  have  an  excellent  potential  for  growth.    These

suggestions  include  ideas  to facilitate  innovation  and  the

entrepreneurial spirit, globalisation and the future  growth  of

industries where we have core competencies.  They are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To promote entrepreneurship and to develop employee

loyalty,  can the capital gain from stock options  be  made  tax

exempt?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Similarly, many start-up companies emulating the examples in

Taiwan are offering free shares, in fact, that are valued at par

to employees,  Can these too be tax exempt?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Some Members have talked about this. Currently income

brought   back  from  overseas  operations  is  fully   taxable,

resulting  in  companies leaving their funds outside  Singapore.

Can  we  make  it attractive for companies to bring these  funds

back  for  use locally?  I suggest a tax equivalent to at  least

50%  or less of the current corporate tax to encourage companies

to  bring  their funds back into Singapore which could  then  be

used for further investments.  Some revenue to the Government is

better  than  zero  revenue, in the case where  income  is  left

outside Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Group tax consolidation - where we allow the

offsetting  of losses made within the group of a company.   This

will  help ease cash flow and will encourage regionalisation  by

breaking  value chains of operations rather than  by  completely

moving  the  whole operations out of Singapore.  In  the  second

case,  we  will actually have a loss to our economy  where  jobs

will  be  lost and all the value activities happen  outside  the

country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, we can encourage many more new ventures which

typically  are  loss making at an early stage  by  allowing  the

following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Double tax deduction for the cost of regionalisation

or  globalisation to encourage more companies to take  advantage

of the good opportunities available in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Double tax deduction for cost of hiring from overseas

to  encourage  foreign talent to be brought into  Singapore  who

could then be used for their global operations in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To exempt the value-added component from GST for

contract  manufacturers.   Such  businesses  enjoy  very   small

margins  of around 2%-4%, I believe, and the 3% GST can  make  a

big difference in pricing competitiveness if we compare them  to

similar  companies in the region, like in Malaysia and Thailand.

Sir,  when  you have to pay for GST upfront and you  price  your

goods, you have to add the 3% in your pricing mechanism.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Can we extend the bonded warehouse concept to

manufacturers, making them `bonded manufacturing  sites'?   This

will  help export orientated manufacturers.  In this way,  these

companies  will be exempted from GST and the benefits  are  two-fold.  First of all, it helps to improve their cash flow because

currently  the  time  taken to claim GST results  in  funds  not

usable  as  working capital or for new investments.  The  amount

can  be quite substantial for large manufacturers.  For example,

an  operation  that  does about $30 million of  purchases  in  a

month, will have about $1 million taken off the system, and this

is a substantial amount that could be invested for other things.

Secondly,  it will encourage such manufacturers to  buy  locally

without  paying  GST  if  they are bonded  manufacturing  sites.

This, in turn, will help our local companies or distributors who

now  lose out to foreign suppliers who are the preferred sources

for such contract manufacturers because of the GST payment.   If

they  purchase  locally, they have to add the 3%  GST  on  their

purchases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a concept exists in both Malaysia and Indonesia where

they  are  called  free  trade zone  or  licensed  manufacturing

warehouses.   I suggest we adopt the same approach  for  certain

industries, especially the contract manufacturing industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to give tax incentives to small venture

capitalists  that  can  help  fuel our  entrepreneurship  drive.

Current incentives are only for big funds and I suggest that  we

give tax breaks for smaller funds that are willing to locate  in

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, a few years ago, Government

introduced  tax provisions for property purchased  within  three

years.  If you sell the property, you have to pay tax.  This was

to  check  speculation in the property market.  I think  it  was

timely.   But  the  time has come for the Minister  to  consider

whether  this arrangement should still exist.  I would urge  him

to  take away this legislative process or reduce it to less than

30%.  I leave it to the Minister's discretion, Sir.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, allow me to add on

to Mr Singh's comments on GST.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administration of the Goods and Services Tax has been a

challenge  to  cash  flow management for  many  SMEs.   This  is

particularly so for those who manufacture or trade a combination

of   domestic  and  imported  inputs  for  export  market.   The

different   treatments  frequently  mean  that  such   companies

indirectly  bear  the cost of financing the GST payments  before

the  eventual reconciliation.  To illustrate, GST  is  paid  for

inputs  and value-added whilst the offsetting comes only at  the

point of export.  With sluggish demand, the time difference  can

sometimes stretch for months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with intensifying competition, margins are already

being sliced very thin.  The administration of GST can therefore

become a huge burden and sometimes mean the difference between a

small profit and a loss.  Can the Minister therefore review  and

streamline the procedures for GST administration, especially for

SMEs?   Can a greater grace period be allowed for such cases  so

as  to  ease  cash  flow for companies, especially  during  this

difficult period?

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, in October 1998, we amended the

Companies Act extensively to bring changes to our company law in

an  attempt to keep it in line with developments of company  law

taking   place  elsewhere.   In  that  exercise,  we  took   the

opportunity to, among other things, introduce the share buy-back

scheme and to clarify the status of franchise for the purpose of

section 107 of the Companies Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment in October was part of a series of four

amendments in the last two years.  These amendments have brought

about  piecemeal changes but would appear to fall  short  of  an

overhaul  of  our  Companies  Act  which  is  long  overdue   in

Singapore.  The UK, Australia and New Zealand are among some  of

the jurisdictions that have undertaken an extensive overhaul  of

their company legislation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These jurisdictions appear to be ahead of us in company law

reforms.   For instance, the United Kingdom now allows companies

to  dispense  with  the obligation to provide the  common  seal.

Similarly,  in  Australia,  the  government  has  in  place  the

Corporate Law Economic Reform Programme (CLERP) which constantly

examines  the state of corporations law in Australia  and  makes

proposals  for  reforms and refinements.   Some  of  the  recent

proposals  made  by  CLERP include small business  fund  raising

reforms  to  reduce  the  level of  disclosure  requirement  for

capital   raising   by   smaller  enterprises   and   also   the

rationalisation  of  prospectus  requirements   and   liability,

especially with respect to small capital raising.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear that the reform in Australia has taken the

direction  of  making  it  easier  for  the  small  and   medium

enterprises to raise limited funds.  In Singapore, we are trying

to  establish ourselves as a financial centre in the region.  It

is  imperative therefore that changes to the company law must at

the  same  time be kept in tandem with our plans to promote  the

financial services in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has agreed to adopt most of the

recommendations  made  by  the Finance Committee  regarding  the

regulation of our securities industry.  A consistent move  in  a

similar direction is also necessary in the area of company law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, the following areas may be considered for

reform:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) consideration of relaxing or removing the prohibition

of  companies  from  providing financial assistance  in  certain

cases;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) simplifying the registration process;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) reviewing the capital maintenance rule;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) simplification of amalgamation of companies;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) treatment of group companies; and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) a reduction of the need for court approvals for

various corporate decisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister, in his reply to me in October, has indicated

that the Ministry is engaging in a massive exercise in which the

Companies  Act  will be amended over a period of  time.   Rather

than carrying out piecemeal amendments, I would like to ask  the

Minister  whether a comprehensive overhaul of the Companies  Act

may be carried out and, if so, whether this can be completed  in

the next few years, in order that the new Companies Act can take

us  well into the next millennium and help set the stage for  us

to be a leading financial centre in this region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I continue?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, the 1998 amendment has clarified

that  franchises are excluded from the ambit of section  107  of

the  Companies Act.  While this amendment seeks to  clarify  the

definition  of interest under section 107 of the Act,  I  submit

that the amendment has not gone far enough to clarify the proper

ambit of the section.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of division 6 of the Companies Act of which

section  107 is a part would appear to be to protect members  of

the public from being misled into participating in any interest;

which for the purposes of the Act means any right to participate

in  any  profits,  assets or realisation  of  any  financial  or

business   undertaking  or  scheme,  whether  in  Singapore   or

elsewhere.  There is more in the definition but for the purposes

of my remarks, this is just the gist of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 113 of the Act mandates that if an investment

scheme falls within the definition of interest under the Act and

an  offer is made to the public for subscription or purchase  of

that  interest, the company making such an offer  must  issue  a

prospectus.   If  one looks at section 107,  the  definition  of

"interest" is very broad and is capable of a wide import.   This

means  that  there  could potentially  be  a  lot  of  financial

arrangements which would require the issuance of a prospectus.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the ambiguity of the section, we are not

certain  that some of the other investment schemes  fall  within

the  regulatory  ambit  of the Companies Act,  and  these  would

include,  for  instance,  investment in  real  estate  overseas,

buying  of  time-share  interest  in  overseas  properties   and

participation in ostrich farming in Australia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it turns out, real estate developers promoting foreign

properties in Singapore do not appear to be required by the  Act

to  issue any statement in relation to the developments.   As  a

consequence,  many Singaporeans have found out  that  they  have

made  a  lemon of their investments in overseas properties  when

they discovered that the properties that they bought were either

not built or were shabbily constructed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, it also seems strange to me that we see regularly in

newspapers,  invitations to members of the public to participate

in   investments   in  ostrich  eggs.   Sir,  there   are   many

Singaporeans who do not know the difference between a turkey and

an  ostrich, or are they in a position to know the nature of the

company they are investing in.  On the other hand, even a  well-established local company cannot begin to sell a share  publicly

in  Singapore  without  having to  comply  with  the  prospectus

requirement under the Act.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>

This  is  indeed a serious anomaly and I would urge the Ministry

to  regularise this anomaly by seeking to regulate  the  various

investment schemes that are now in place in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask the Minister for Finance whether

more  stringent  measures will be imposed on  those  seeking  to

promote  investment  opportunities in  Singapore  which  are  at

present,  not  regulated  by  the Companies  Act  or  the  other

statutes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have a few seconds left. I think we will stop
