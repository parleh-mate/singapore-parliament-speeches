<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question [11th March, 1999],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head W of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100."  -  [Mr Lim Swee Say].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you

for  allowing  me  to speak.  I was not in the  House  when  the

Minister  questioned my message on foreign talent.  In  fact,  I

was  surprised that the Minister chose to misinterpret  my  call

for  the  toning down of the foreign talent message, as  a  call

against foreign talent.  I think this is not fair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always subscribed to the open system of recruiting

the  best  into our service.  And where there are  gaps  in  our

recruitment exercise, we should allow foreign talent to come and

fill those gaps.  But I said that in this crisis, charity begins

at  home.  Did I ask that we should stop them from coming?   No.

Did  I  ask  that  we sack them and replace the  vacancies  with

Singaporeans?   No.  All that I asked is for the  Government  to

play down this message in this crisis.  Is that wrong?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it wrong, Sir, for me to ask that Singaporeans should

take  priority in the Government's plans to tackle the  economic

crisis?  Is it wrong?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan, I have allowed you to make a brief

clarification.  Could you round up quickly?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Yes. The Minister is worried that I may

send  the  wrong message to foreigners.  I think  we  should  be

worried   that  we  might  be  sending  the  wrong  message   to

Singaporeans.   I  was only sending a message  of  assurance  to

Singaporeans.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan, you have made the point. I think you

are  embarking on a new speech.  Please resume your  seat.   The

point has been made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> General George Yeo, you may continue with

your speech.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Second Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Thank you, Sir. Yesterday, a number of MPs spoke

about  the  importance of the knowledge economy to Singapore  in

the next century.  This is a crucial area and we should be clear

about  what  we  are  referring to.  We are  not  talking  about

particular  industries or particular companies.   The  knowledge

economy is not an add-on.  What we are talking about is a  total

national  orientation towards brain work, as opposed  to  manual

labour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You take the example of Internet and e-commerce. A few

nights  ago, the US Ambassador in Singapore invited me to dinner

to  meet Raymond Lane, the President and Chief Operating Officer

of  Oracle.   Oracle is a software company whose  capitalisation

has  now  overtaken  General Motors, the  world's  biggest  auto

company.   Raymond  Lane said that in the next  five  years,  e-commerce  will  cause  a  major change in global  manufacturing,

distribution  and consumption.  He thinks that  the  changes  in

the next five years

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>

will  be  as great as the changes that have taken place  in  the

last  60  years.   I do not know whether he is right  or  he  is

wrong, but even if he is out by five years, I think the point is

very  clear.   Unless we gear ourselves for that new  world,  we

will be left behind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same dinner, the US Ambassador cited some statistics

which I thought were very interesting.  America On-Line has also

surpassed General Motors in capitalisation.  Amazon.com  already

has  a capitalisation greater than that of Boeing Aircraft.  One

produces 777s and the most advanced aeroplanes in the world  and

the  other  sells  books, which he does not own.   Microsoft,  a

giant,  has a capitalisation greater than that of all the  stock

markets of the South East Asian countries combined.  And  little

Yahoo  has  a  capitalisation greater than that of  the  Jakarta

stock exchange.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether some of these valuations are exaggerated

or  whether  they reflect underlying realities,  but  these  are

facts.   And  we have got to ask ourselves what is happening  in

the  world.   Why  is it, when we study Fortune  500  companies,

there  is  such a drastic shift, away from those who dig  things

from  the  ground, who bend metals, who do repetitive  work,  to

those which produce creative outputs from the human brain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the balance sheets of AOL or Microsoft, we are

hard  put to figure out what their assets are, because it is  no

longer  machines,  factories or land.  It  is  human  knowledge,

human network, the culture of a company. When you acquire such a

company,  you  ascribe  the difference  to  goodwill.   So  even

general accounting principles have not quite caught up with  the

knowledge economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore crucial that despite the Asian crisis, we keep

our  eyes  on  what is coming on the horizon.  Internet  and  e-commerce  will shake every industry to its foundations,  and  it

affects all sectors.  Dr Wang Kai Yuen was absolutely right.  It

is not just computers and IT.  He talked about Viagra, and asked

rather mischievously whether it is part of the knowledge

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>

economy.  Well, Viagra is a very interesting drug.  It works the

same  way  that nitroglycerine works when you put it  under  the

tongue  for heart patients.  Recently, Nobel prizes were awarded

to  the  scientists  who  discovered the biochemistry  of  these

drugs.   These  are  extremely  knowledge-intensive  industries,

which we should become a part of.  What Zantac, which is an anti-ulcer drug, has done for Glaxo, Viagra will do for Pfizer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of trade have changed. If we are just drawers of

water  and hewers of wood, machines will take over our work  and

we will draw only a pittance.  The key is working with the human

brain,  which  means  educating  the  young,  teaching  them  to

network,  not  just  within Singapore but in  the  whole  world,

understanding  where the value added is the greatest,  and  then

getting the maximum return from the effort that we put in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, not everyone can be a high-tech hot shot, but we must

have  a  significant high-tech sector in Singapore  to  pull  us

along.   And  a  knowledge economy applies as  much  to  mundane

things  like  clothing  and food.  When I  go  jogging,  I  wear

Chinese singlets which cost me $3.  If you buy Calvin Klein,  it

may cost you 10-20 times the amount, but it is real value Calvin

Klein  has  added, which the Chinese have not quite  understood.

Singapore's  Bodyknits  understands this  with  their  range  of

products  and  they  are now trying to break into  the  American

market.   Our  poh piah king has recently launched  frozen  roti

prata, and I am told by Singaporeans in Germany that if you  put

them  in  a  toaster, they come out as good as Jalan  Kayu  roti

prata.   Maybe  Germany is cold and it is  far  away,  but  that

really  caught  my  attention.  This is part  of  the  knowledge

economy, how you turn an existing product and add value  to  it,

enlarge your market and make profits from it, creating jobs  and

employment  for Singaporeans. The key for us is a  new  kind  of

entrepreneurship in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Rai talked about the Marwaris in India. The

Marwaris  are  a  small tribe from Rajasthan who are  incredibly

entrepreneurial.  If you look at

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>

the  Indian stock market, they own many of the companies  there.

In  Calcutta, the Bengalis are great poets, writers,  musicians,

but the industrialists are almost all Marwaris.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurship is in the culture of a people. I do not

believe  that you can easily teach it.  I think you either  have

it  as  a  culture or you do not have it as a  culture.   And  I

believe   that   we  have  it  as  a  people,  because   without

entrepreneurship  in  Singapore,  the  entrepreneurship  of  our

forefathers,  the  entrepreneurship in the  public  and  private

sectors in Singapore, there would not be the Singapore of today.

What  we  need to do is to learn a new kind of entrepreneurship,

which is an entrepreneurship which is not evident on the balance

sheet, not things you can see and touch, not real estate  -  and

our  people  are big real estate entrepreneurs  -  not  just  in

Singapore,  but  all  over South East Asia, Australia,  even  in

Europe  and  America  -  but in high-tech, where we are  dealing

with  intangibles, and that requires a new set of skills, a  new

set  of  rules  and regulations, maybe new laws,  new  kinds  of

financing.   And  this  is precisely what the  Technopreneurship

Committee,  chaired by Dr Tony Tan, is trying to  do.   We  have

entrepreneurship, but we must migrate it progressively  so  that

our  younger  people will be able to deal and  have  skills  and

knowledge in different industries and products.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talk about venture capital. The issue is not money. That

are  lots  of money in Singapore.  Venture money is  not  stupid

money, which you throw at things or projects.  Venture money  is

some  of  the  smartest money around.  They are making  bets  on

individuals,  on companies, on market trends.   To  build  up  a

venture capital financial market in Singapore will take us  many

years.   We  are getting consultants to help us.  We  have  many

advisers from Silicon Valley and from elsewhere, but this  is  a

new  area for us.  Our banks have got to get used to it,  credit

officers  have got to get used to it.  Eventually, we  will  get

there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must show to high-tech players in the world that we are fully

committed to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>

this  area and we also intend to be a player in this  area.   We

will  do  everything which is necessary, building up the science

park,  incubator units, one-stop centres, the whole  list  which

many MPs have talked about and which we will seriously consider.

But  in  the  end,  what we need is a solid national  commitment

involving  both  the  public  and private  sectors,  the  school

system,  the  universities, a keen determination, a strong  will

power,  to  get there, to transfer our value added  increasingly

from  repetitive work to brain work, whether this be in the life

sciences,  in  computers, in fashion,  in  food,  in  trade,  in

logistics,  in whatever.  It is not something which is  abstract

for Singaporeans.  It is something which all of us can do in our

own  little  circle.   And if we can achieve  that,  change  the

culture of Singapore, then we will succeed.  We have no choice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Inderjit Singh said yesterday, he thought of migrating to

America, and many of his friends have done so, because they have

this  glint  in their eyes that there is a prospect of  becoming

wealthy in a short period of time, and they have left.  If we do

not  have this sector in Singapore and develop technopreneurship

in Singapore, and show commitment to it in the way we adjust our

rules  and  regulations, my fear is our own best  and  brightest

will  leave, not to talk about the foreigners that we would  not

be able to attract into Singapore, and our most enterprising and

creative may find greener pastures elsewhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As time is short, I think I should end here and give the rest of

the time to my colleague, Mr Tang Guan Seng.

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Tang Guan Seng):</b> Sir, I will reply to some of the

points  raised by MPs yesterday.  Mr Inderjit Singh and  Dr  Toh

See  Kiat made some comments on our attractions on Sentosa.   Dr

Toh  said that the Merlion Tower is fiction.  But I think  there

is nothing wrong in it.  The Merlion symbol was

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>

created  more than 30 years ago by the Tourism Promotion  Board.

It  has become a globally recognised tourist icon for Singapore.

When  tourists come to Singapore, they like to take  photographs

with   the   Merlion.   Because  of  this,  Sentosa  Development

Corporation (SDC) built the Merlion Tower.  Since its completion

in  1996,  about  half a million tourists visited  this  Merlion

every year.  We must thank the Merlion which has contributed  to

the tourism industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sentosa is our top attraction. Despite the economic

downturn  and  the  drop  in  tourist  arrivals,  last  year  it

attracted  3.3  million tourists.  So credit  must  go  to  SDC.

There are many attractions on Sentosa.  Some are privately owned

and  some  are  owned by SDC.  SDC is constantly  reviewing  and

renewing its attractions on Sentosa.   For example, Siloso Beach

has  become  a  major  attraction now.  The Musical  Foundation,

which  changes its shows regularly to attract visitors, and  the

Images of Singapore are also popular with tourists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the private attractions on Sentosa, they have their

own  product life cycle.  SDC is encouraging them to  renew  the

attractions  and put in new investments by offering  incentives.

If they apply, SDC will consider them favourably.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from providing incentives, SDC is also implementing

various  measures to attract visitors to Sentosa.  For  example,

the  Mega Savers Scheme is quite successful.  As stated  by  the

Minister  yesterday,  we are going to do a strategic  review  of

Sentosa to reposition it as a world class tourist attraction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also commented on the performance of our

tourism  sector.   Last  year, there was a  decline  in  tourist

arrivals  by  12%.   Because of this, STB has stepped  up  their

promotion  efforts.   There is a $30 million marketing  campaign

called  "Once in a Millennium Offer".  This will run  from  June

this  year  to August next year and there will be  a  series  of

activities and events to attract visitors to Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as visa procedures are concerned, STB is working

closely  with  the Ministry of Home Affairs.  In  fact,  leisure

groups from China can now apply for double-entry visas.  As  for

group  tourists from China, it is easier now for them  to  apply

for  visas.   For  tourists from India, Myanmar and  Blangadesh,

they can now apply for a 2-year or 5-year multiple journey visas

if   they  are  businessmen  or  staff  of  the  tourism-related

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STB is also considering the possibility of developing sports

tourism.  STB is trying to anchor strategic world-class sporting

events  in  Singapore.  It  will explore  financial  and  fiscal

incentives to achieve this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Rai that we should capitalise on our multi-cultural richness. One example is the Chinatown project. We

will  do  more in this area so that we can attract  tourists  to

stay in Singapore a little longer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For companies in the tourism industry which want to upgrade and

improve  their services, they can, in fact, apply for incentives

under the Tourism Development Assistance Scheme.  This year  STB

has  projected that tourist arrivals to Singapore will  increase

by 1% to 3%.  We have to put in more efforts in order to achieve

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok and Dr Toh See Kiat brought up cases involving

trading  of  soft commodities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently only rubber and

coffee  futures  are  gazetted under the Commodity  Futures  Act

(CFA).  My Ministry is considering whether extending the CFA  to

cover  futures trading in other commodities will  help  to  deal

with  the  "bucket-shop"  problem.  We are  also  examining  the

regulatory regimes of other countries such as the US and  UK  to

see  if  they  work  and are appropriate for  us.   We  will  be

discussing with the relevant Ministries and agencies on possible

approaches to deal with this problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say this is a very complicated subject. An important

principle is that we should not over-regulate.  When we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>

regulate, the regulations must be effective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No regulatory system can protect investors from fraud if they

make foolish decisions or enter into one-sided contracts without

due  diligence.   They should be discerning when  responding  to

advertising claims and stay away from dubious investment schemes

that  promise unrealistically high returns.  They must  be  more

vigilant   when   contemplating   unfamiliar   and   risky   new

investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Toh See Kiat also raised the issue of retail price

maintenance.   My  Ministry replied to a similar  question  some

time  ago  and the position remains unchanged. The best  way  to

prevent price fixing behaviour is to promote competition in  the

market  place, and to maintain a free and open economy  so  that

there  are  no  barriers to the flow of  goods  in  and  out  of

Singapore.   This allows retailers, producers and  consumers  to

buy  from all sources at the most competitive prices, even  from

abroad.   Retailers who face pressure from their usual suppliers

to  sell  their goods at set prices can, and should, source  for

alternative suppliers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry administers the Price Control Act. If necessary, we

can  use this Act to deal with the problem.  Meanwhile,  we  are

monitoring  the  situation closely.  We are  also  studying  the

experiences of other countries in this respect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo is concerned over the presence of toxic chemicals in

toys.   There  were  also  reports in the newspapers  expressing

similar  concerns.   In  view  of  this,  the  Ministry  of  the

Environment  recently  has  made analysis  on  some  samples  of

Teletubby toys and infant feeding devices and found the  results

to  be  satisfactory.  There were no phthalates  detected.   The

Ministry  of  the Environment said that they would  continue  to

make checks whenever they receive reports of toxic substances in

toys.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Members that we are monitoring this

closely.    Should  there  be  an  assessment  that  there   are

substances in toys or other products that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>

render  them  unsafe for the public, the Government  would  take

necessary  actions.   It  is not necessary  to  set  up  another

regulatory body just for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min has commented on our efforts to attract world

class exhibitions and conferences to Singapore.  We have managed

to  achieve  quite  a  lot  in this  area.   For  example,  mega

exhibitions  like  Asian  Aerospace, Food  and  Hotel  Asia  and

Communic Asia have come to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of infrastructure and exhibition space, we have enough

to  cater  to  our needs.  With the completion of the  Singapore

Expo  which provides 60,000 sq metres of space, we are  able  to

accommodate world-class events.  If there is a need, we can  add

another 40,000 sq metres to a site nearer to the Singapore Expo.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen has urged the Government to use more recycled

water  and sea water.  We are doing this.  For example, we  work

closely  with  industries and encourage  them  to  use  recycled

water.   Industries  like  electronics  and  electroplating  use

recycled  water.  For example, wafer fabrication plants  recycle

their  water up to 50% per day, which is equivalent to the  size

of 11 swimming pools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for sea water, I can inform the Member that those industries

located  near the seafront such as power stations and refineries

are using sea water.   In fact, the volume of sea water they use

everyday  can  fill  five  MacRitchie reservoirs.   So  we  have

achieved  a  lot  in  this area and we are trying  to  encourage

industries to use more sea water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay and Mr Chuang Shaw Peng touched on the subject of

energy  efficiency.  I must inform the House that the Government

has  implemented  various  incentive schemes  to  encourage  our

companies and industries to use energy more efficiently.  On the

part of PUB, it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>

conducts  regular  energy audits and it also organises  seminars

and workshops so that the latest information can be disseminated

to  the industries and companies.  Singapore Power, in fact,  is

also  very  keen to promote energy efficiency.  For example,  it

receives  students from schools to their power  plants  so  that

they know how important it is to use energy efficiently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the Department of Statistics has used

administrative data from various Government agencies to set up a

household  registration  database.    A  national  database   on

dwellings  has  also  been  set up.   With  this  detailed  data

available to the Government, it would be very convenient for the

Government to know the details of individual households or  even

individual citizens just by a few strokes on the keyboard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know whether the Government has plans to expand

the  database  further by including also, for  instance,  income

expenditure  and  other  personal  information  available   from

Government  agencies,  such as the Inland Revenue  Authority  of

Singapore,   CID,  MINDEF,  Immigration,  LTA,  CPF,   Elections

Department or even the commercial banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the electronic world today, and especially in Singapore,

where   the   Government  advocates  the   use   of   electronic

transactions  in almost every aspect of payment and transaction,

every

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>

citizen  is  fast losing his privacy without even realising  it.

Instead  of having a more transparent Government, what  we  will

have  in  Singapore will be a transparent population with  every

citizen like a sotong in the sea.  Singaporeans must be aware of

what all these databases mean for them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Low, are you expecting a reply? Or you want to

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> What I would like to know from the

prohibited  from  release  to anybody other  than  for  official

statistical purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the actual details of the data, I cannot give him

the  information now.  But I take his point that it is important

that the data should not be wrongly made use of.  Basically,  it

is to facilitate our planning purposes to know what is happening

to the population. For example, there is no way that we can find

out from this data how people have voted in the elections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Statistics Act, no particulars or information

pertaining  to any individual person shall be disclosed  to  any

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head Q of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recent report of the rise in crime by 5.2% to

48,260  cases  in  1998 is cause for concern.  Another  worrying

trend is that juvenile crime is also on the rise.  Although  the

Commissioner for Police has taken pains to explain that the rise

in  crime is no cause for alarm, rising crime is always a  cause

for concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rising crime statistics, especially when Singapore is

perceived  to be relatively crime free, always unsettle  people.

Our crime free and disciplined society is very often touted as a

very  strong plus point for foreign investors and visitors.   It

is  not  likely that we shall lose this overnight, but  over  an

extended  period, if the trend continues, we may just lose  this

competitive  edge.   We just cannot afford  to  lose  this  plus

factor, especially one that I feel is within our control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several reasons were advanced for the increase in crime

rates  ranging  from the economic slowdown to  the  presence  of

foreign  workers and illegal immigrants.  The increase in  crime

coincided with the advent of the economic crisis.  It appears to

be a given that during tough economic conditions, more resort to

crime.   I wonder if this is true of disciplined societies  like

South  Korea.  Will an ordinarily law abiding citizen resort  to

crime  when that person loses a job?  If these offenders  resort

to crime because they cannot make ends meet and not because they

are  greedy  or bad per se, this is indeed a sign  of  desperate

times.  Perhaps we must do

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>

more to help these people cope with their hardships, which is  a

perfectly good crime preventive measure.  With retrenchments  on

the  rise  this  year,  it must mean that our  crime  rate  will

worsen.   Something  has  to be done to  arrest  the  situation.

Perhaps the Minister will like to highlight to the House how the

Home Team is planning to cope with the worsening situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides the reasons advanced for the declining crime

situation,  a  rise in crime rate may indicate that insufficient

focus  was  placed  on  policing  activities  due  to  declining

manpower  or  manpower  cuts.  As part of our  restructuring  in

making   our  police  officers  more  effective  and  justifying

reducing  our manpower needs, one must wonder if the setting  up

of   the  NPCs  has  resulted  in  the  lower  presence  of  our

neighbourhood  policemen.  It could be  due  to  the  change  in

policing  that has given criminals a wrong signal and encouraged

them to try their luck now that less policemen are patrolling by

foot or on bicycles.  It is an undeniable fact that the presence

of the police does deter crime just as the presence of a traffic

police officer would deter speeding.  I raised this concern  two

years ago on the structural changes in our policing methods  and

a  drop in police presence.  Could the Minister please enlighten

us  on  whether  the crime rates in areas that  previously  have

neighbourhood  police posts have increased after the  NPPs  were

closed, and is there any drop in the number of crime reports  in

areas after the NPCs were set up?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also worried by the apparent increase in crimes

being  committed by teenagers and youths, especially those  that

resulted  in injury during robbery attempts.  We have just  been

confronted by the most recent case of murder allegedly committed

by  three young children.  Our young criminals appear to be much

younger,  more  fearless and increasingly  more  violent.   What

could  possibly have happened that have caused them to be beyond

parental control?  Will the Minister highlight to this House the

efficacy of his Ministry's efforts in working

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>

with  other Ministries on crime prevention work amongst students

and the youths that have dropped out of schools?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, youth offenders under 16 cannot be named to

protect  their  identity.  With widespread public education  and

access  to  media  anti-crime messages, I am not  sure  if  this

should  be changed.  Are these youths or the masterminds  behind

them making use of this legal loophole to persuade our young  to

commit  crimes  because  even  if  they  should  be  caught   or

apprehended, they can hide behind the mask given to them by  the

law.   It  is indeed a contradiction in terms to want to protect

them  after they have committed hideous crimes that children  of

their  age  should  not have done.  Moreover, parents  of  these

offenders  may  not  realise or feel the  seriousness  of  their

children's  criminal acts because they have  not  been  publicly

shamed   by  the  disclosure  of  their  children's   names   or

photographs.  As such, it will be a better deterrent if this law

of  not  naming  offenders under 16 years old  be  repealed  and

parents be made responsible as well for their children's crimes.

I seek the Minister's views on whether he will consider a repeal

of this law.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would

like  to  take  this opportunity to urge the  Ministry  of  Home

Affairs   to  conduct  open-house  sessions  for  teenagers   in

Singapore  to  visit  the prisons and feel  for  themselves  the

misery of lives behind bars, to serve as a deterrent to  teenage

crime.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of teenage crime is something which is of great

concern   to  our  people.   According  to  a  survey   on   the

psychological  qualities  of  our  teenagers  today,   in  1996,

teenagers nowadays are generally very emotional.  They live in a

materialistically rich environment, and they  lack  a  sense  of

responsibility   to  society.   This  is  unlike   their   older

generations  where they worked very hard for the  society.   Our

young  people are more egoistic.  They are asking for more  from

the  nation,  from  society and from the family.   They  do  not

understand what they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>

can do for the nation, for the society and for the family.  They

only ask what can the nation and society do for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This type of mentality is wrong. More importantly, they do

not have the courage and confidence to deal with failures.  With

just a little setback, they will become very upset and start  to

blame  others.  They blame the family members,  society and  the

Government, but never themselves.  They even harbour the feeling

that  everybody has failed them, and they want to  get  back  on

them. Thus, they begin to develop an anti-social behaviour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many parents nowadays do not know how to discipline their

children.   They allow them all the liberty to do as they  wish.

As  a  result, they are not properly guided.   They do not  have

the will power to resist what is wrong and would often yield  to

temptation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I urge the Ministry of Home Affairs to carry out

more   educational activities for the benefit of  our  teenagers

and   steer  them  away from crime.  Therefore,  I  ask  MHA  to

consider  opening  the prisons, the drug rehabilitation  centres

and  the detention homes for visits by young Singaporeans.   Let

the  secondary and primary students visit these places  so  that

they  could  understand what would be the consequences  if  they

were  to do something wrong or to commit a crime, with the  hope

that  these visits would have  some deterrent effects  on  them.

At  the  same  time,  we would also let our  students  know  how

effective our Police is in solving all the crimes, to drive home

the message that "Crime does not pay"!

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, despite heavy penalties that have

been meted out by the courts on road bullies, recent reports  of

the  recurrence  of  road  bullying tactics  indicate  that  the

problem is still a very real and difficult one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Road bullying seems to come in different forms, that of

finger gestures interpreted to be demeaning and degrading and an

insult  to  outright violence.  A finger gesture may  result  in

lost honour and pride and the insulted

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>

motorist must avenge himself and a road chase begins.   We  have

read  of  a taxi driver dying from a weak heart whilst  pursuing

the  motorist who had shown him a finger gesture.  I  have  also

been told of one unreported incident, which I wish to relate  to

the  House.   A  driver  of  a Mercedes  Benz  car  was  driving

leisurely on the road.  Along came a driver in an old Toyota who

beamed his headlights and then overtook him.  The Mercedes  Benz

driver  then picked up speed to chase the latter and caused  the

driver of the Toyota and his family to fear for their lives when

the  Mercedes  Benz  overtook the Toyota  and  the  driver  made

deliberate  stops  intermittently.   He  stopped  his  car  when

signalled  by  the Toyota driver to do so.  He sat  quietly  and

refused  to  respond to the other driver's angry questions.   He

let  the Toyota driver take off and then drove dangerously close

to  him,  used his right side mirror to tear off the left  outer

mirror  of the Toyota and then sped off.  This incident was  not

reported  to the Police because the driver of the Toyota  feared

retaliation.  One wonders how many such incidents go unreported.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing legislation is insufficient to deal with these

varying  forms  of road bullying.  The penalties prescribed  for

causing  hurt  or  grievous hurt are not  deterrent  enough.   I

propose  that separate and specific sections be created  in  the

Road Traffic Act with enhanced penalties to punish road bullying

in  various  forms.   In the more aggravated  instance  of  road

bullying  where  injury of life or property is caused  to  other

road  users, the vehicle should be confiscated.  We must  strike

where  it  hurts most.  If confiscation of lorries  for  illegal

dumping  of waste is permitted under the law, there are stronger

reasons   to   confiscate  vehicles  involved  in   frightening,

jeopardising or injuring road users.  Just like sections in  the

Road  Traffic  Act on drunken driving and use of  handphones,  a

clearly defined section on road bullying will give the Police  a

more effective law to deal with this problem.  A proper schedule

of  offences  and  the  corresponding  penalties  will  be  more

effective.   Stiffer  penalties for illegal parking  at  zig-zag

lines, speeding

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>

in excess of defined limits, use of handphones while driving and

drunken  driving have yielded much desired results in  arresting

the rise of these menaces.  It is a worthwhile and timely effort

to  consider amending the Road Traffic Act to incorporate  these

stiffer penalties to make our roads safer for our users.  I urge

the  Minister to consider a review of the law to stamp out  road

bully offences.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, the fact that

Singapore  is considered one of the safest cities to  live  does

not happen by chance.  It is through the hard work and vision of

the  Home  Team,  especially our Police  Force,  who  constantly

upgrade themselves and implement new initiatives to fight  crime

and  ensure that our citizens are well protected and  our  homes

and properties secure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the major successes in the philosophy of our police work

is  community policing.  The Ministry has scored a great success

in  the  introduction  of  Neighbourhood  Police  Post  and  the

Neighbourhood   Watch  programme.   The  introduction   of   the

Community Focus Plan (CFP) has brought community policing to yet

another  dimension.  The primary objective of the CFP initiative

is  to mobilise the community to play an active part in ensuring

their  own safety and security.  The CFP has been initiated  for

slightly  more than a year ago and already it has  enjoyed  some

successes.   One example is the problem Little India faced  with

the  weekend  congregation of foreign  workers  which  had  been

resolved  with  the  combined  effort  of  the  Tanglin   Police

Division,  the Moulmein/Teck Kah Committee and the Moulmein/Teck

Kah CCC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, a seminar was organised by the Singapore Police

Force  and the People's Association on Community Focus  Plan  in

which the Police and the various grassroots leaders examine  the

progress  of the Community Focus Plan and see what is  the  next

step  to make the plan more effective.  Many aspects of the plan

have been discussed in detail.  Some

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>

examples  are  the  care  and support programme  for  offenders'

families,  schemes  extended to victims  of  serious  and  fatal

traffic accidents, juvenile delinquency, drug prevention,  civil

defence,  reintegrating of offenders and mediation of  disputes,

etc.  I understand that the seminar was a great success and many

grassroots  organisations  in  the various  constituencies  have

actually  implemented some of these plans.   I  would  therefore

like the Minister to give us a brief account of the progress  of

the CFP and what is going to be its future direction.

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the concerns from some of the grassroots leaders,

ironically,  is  because of the success of this plan,  they  are

worried  that  some of the responsibilities of the Police  Force

will  be transferred to the CDC or the grassroots organisations.

I  hope the Minister would give an assurance that this is  never

the intention and will never be so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other point is that although the CFP is well understood

and  received  by the grassroots organisations,  the  public  at

large  may  not be so well informed.  For the plan to  work,  we

need  every Singaporean to work together towards this objective.

Therefore, I request that the Police should conduct more  public

talks and publicity so that the intention and objectives of  the

plan  can  reach  out to every one.  May I have  the  Minister's

comments?

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, since the implementation

of  the  Community  Focus  Plan, many residents  and  grassroots

leaders have come to realise that everyone has a role in  making

our  neighbourhood  safer  and  more  secure.   The  partnership

between  the  Home  Team  and  residents  has  also  helped   to

revitalise the "kampung spirit" of our community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me quote two examples illustrating the exemplary

partnership  between  the residents and  police  to  effectively

tackle  community-based safety and security  problems.   Between

1996 and June last year, there was a spate of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>

vandalism to over 50 vehicles at a multi-storey carpark in  Chua

Chu  Kang.   Recognising  the need to address  the  problem  and

preserve the community's trust, the Yew Tee Neighbourhood Police

Post  and  Yew Tee RC proposed to set up a Vehicles Watch  Group

compromising  50  volunteer vehicle owners to look  after  their

vehicles.   The plan was a resounding success and the  spree  of

vandalism was effectively curbed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another project was that undertaken by the Bukit Panjang

South  NPP and Bukit Panjang grassroots leaders.  They  together

with  the  Police  decided to curb the  problem  of  teen  gangs

prevalent  in  the area.  Hence, they organised  visits  to  the

Jurong  Police  Station  for  problematic  students  where   the

students were shown the Police lock-up and viewed video shows on

the grave consequences of joining teen gangs.  This was followed

by  visits  to  the  homes of these students by  the  grassroots

leaders,  Police  and their teachers so as to  understand  their

home  background  and get their family support  to  prevent  the

youths  from  going wayward.  Favourable feedback revealed  that

the   programme  had  benefited  both  the  students  and  their

families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above examples clearly demonstrate a stronger sense of

community involvement, belonging and care.  It is this  internal

resilience  that  will  see us through in  good  and  bad  times

together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make a few suggestions to the Home

Team  on how we can build on a good start made by CFP and  bring

it to the next level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Publicity. More articles or success stories of community

safety  and  security  programmes  could  be  featured  in   the

newspapers and media so as to further increase participation  by

residents in CFP activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Training. The Home Team can provide more support to train

volunteers  so  as to instil confidence in them to  conduct  CFP

activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Funding. More funding and resources should be given to the

Home Team and CDC to support CFP activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Recognition. CFP should be recognised as a grassroots

organisation and its members should be given due recognition.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, in my constituency

visits,  I  have come across requests from many of my  residents

asking  for  more police presence in the estate  to  ensure  the

safety and security of the residents.  The sight of men in  blue

uniform  has always given  residents the assurance that  all  is

well,  knowing that there is somebody to watch over them.   This

is  especially  true  in the new estates  where  residents  have

either not moved in or where strangers are not easily identified

because residents have yet to know one another.  In some  cases,

the  design of HDB flats is such that it makes these flats  more

prone to break-in by burglars either because the windows provide

easy  access or because the apartment blocks face an open  space

opposite  it.  Whatever it is, these apartment blocks  are  very

prone to break-ins as indeed is the case of Neighbourhood  7  in

my constituency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very concerned about the break-ins and have on

many occasions asked the police to see what further measures can

be  taken  to help crime prevention in the estate.  I know  that

Police  resources are limited and I have often told my residents

that policemen are not jagas for the estate.  The residents  are

being told that crime prevention is as much their duty as it  is

the responsibility of the state.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have requested for a Neighbourhood Police Post and I hope

that it will be granted in the near future.  At the same time, I

am  aware  that the Police are constrained by limited  resources

and are constantly looking at more effective ways to improve its

monitoring system of the estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my grassroots leaders have suggested the use of camera

surveillance as a means of crime prevention.  I thought it was a

good  suggestion principally for two reasons.   First,  it  cuts

down the demand for more manpower requirements if 24-hour camera

surveillance can be deployed at strategic locations in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>

housing  estates.  This will not only serve to deter  crime  but

also serve to record the necessary evidence for prosecution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as part of the Community Focus Plan, residents

can  be  roped  in  together to raise funds to  build  a  camera

surveillance system to help play a part in ensuring  the  safety

and  security  in the estate.  I have instructed  my  grassroots

leaders  to look into this possibility because, as I have  said,

it is a good plan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether the Ministry would

consider  supporting both financially or otherwise  the  use  of

camera  surveillance in housing estates as  a  means  to  combat

crimes in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, Lianhe

Zaobao earlier this month reported that the first two months  of

1999,  compared to the similar period in 1998, showed an overall

decline  in  crimes,  such  as theft,  car  theft,  robbery  and

housebreaking.   The  police  must  be  commended   for   making

Singapore a safe place to live despite this difficult period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the police can do more if grassroots leaders, residents

in  housing estates as well as social service centres  cooperate

with  the  police  and  find new ways  to  combat  neighbourhood

crimes.  This capability in maintaining "law and order"  in  the

neighbourhood  by different community agencies working  together

to support the police is what I mean by "community policing".  I

believe  the  Community Focus Plan (CFP) is  set  up  with  this

objective in mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest a few working ideas to add to this

Police effort in enhancing community policing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Mindsetting frontline junior police officers the

significance of their role as a lead collaborative agent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Offer joint training programmes with other community leaders

to   enhance  cross-boundary  learning  capability   and   cross

pollination of ideas and reflections.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>

We  need  to  remove institutional turfs and promote on-our-feet

solutions  to community problems.  This way it will address  the

lower  awareness in the community about CFP that  was  mentioned

earlier by Mr Kenneth Chen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Set clear ethos of cooperation between groups to avoid this

"passing the buck" when a crisis situation arises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Establish clear guidelines and protocols for all concerned

on  how to go about tackling a crime in combined effort.  Let us

say  a  neighbour spotted a burglar breaking in  a  house,  what

action  must follow?  Or an alcoholic neighbour is heard beating

up  the  wife,  what  can the witness do?   The  guidelines  and

protocols must be made simple.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Furnish residents in the neighbourhood with the relevant key

telephone numbers for assistance and information on what actions

to adopt.  The language in the brochures must be made simple.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Establish a recognition scheme of "Friend of the Police" for

residents who have done something that is effective in combating

crime  in  the  neighbourhood.  If we highlight  this  publicity

event,  as  suggested by Dr Teo Ho Pin, it  will  help  to  reap

awareness and participation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Carry out neighbourhood focus groups from youth to elderly

ones  to make "alive" this spirit of CFP.  Working with National

Youth  Council  or  forming  local  volunteer  youth  "vigilante

groups"  can be one possible initiative.  This will  absorb  the

excessive restless energy of teenagers and direct them away from

crime   and  self-indulgent  activities  that  were  highlighted

earlier by Mr Peh Chin Hua and Mr Chng Hee Kok.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one may think that all these are simple enough suggestions

to  propose, the difficulty we all know is in implementing  even

such  a  simple plan of inter-agency cooperation and action.   A

significant amount of time and energy and resources have  to  be

spent on collaborative formation.  It is in my view a worthwhile

investment for the police to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>

commit  to a training process in a continuous annual cycle  with

other  agencies.  People do not become self-organising  networks

without  spending time together to learn and do things together.

I  hope  my  preliminary reflections are helpful to  the  Police

Force to seriously look into ways of linking people to carry out

policing  responsibility.  Otherwise, cooperation will  only  be

conceptual on paper.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, last year, it was reported that some

23,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended.  This is a very high

number  and  works  out  to no less than 60  illegal  immigrants

apprehended  every day.  One must wonder at the numbers  roaming

in   our  midst.   The  worsening  economic  situation  in   our

neighbouring countries could well be a contributing  factor  and

the driving force behind the waves of illegal entries.  Will the

Minister highlight to the House the number of illegal immigrants

from  Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand and other countries?   If

they  are attracted to Singapore by the hope of a better  living

here,  have  they come here knowing full well that we  are  very

strict  in  enforcing  the  law against  them?   Perhaps  it  is

worthwhile being arrested and imprisoned here because then,  the

illegal  immigrants would be assured of good food,  shelter  and

medical care in our prisons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, around this time last year, there was frequent publicity of

reports  of  police raids and arrests of big numbers of  illegal

immigrants.   Since then such media publicity  appears  to  have

been  muted.  If the publicity drops, does it signal a  decrease

in the number of raids or does it mean that the problem is under

control?  The danger of doing less and less publicity is that it

may send a wrong signal that the Government is now less vigilant

or  strict in its enforcement.  Alternatively, did the publicity

force  the  illegal immigrants to go into hiding at  less  well-known places such that the police have become less successful in

their raids?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite the occasional arrests and the attendant media

publicity,  there are still people willing to risk being  caught

by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>

hiding  illegal immigrants in the car boots or lorries  carrying

goods  coming into Singapore through the Causeway.  Their reward

is  usually  just a few hundred dollars.  For them to  take  the

risk  means that it is lucrative business if they are not caught

and  that  is  why there are still people who want to  take  the

chance  of being caught.  Perhaps, the Government has still  not

done  enough  publicity in countries from  where  these  illegal

immigrants  come from to let them know that our  laws  are  very

tough  and  the  efforts  of  our law enforcement  officers  are

relentless  and  thorough.   All  airlines  announce  to   their

passengers  before  they  alight that Singapore  has  the  death

penalty  for  drug traffickers.  Can we also not let  them  know

that  our  immigration laws are equally unrelenting for  illegal

immigrants?   I  therefore suggest that the Government  consider

taking  up  more  publicity or in certain  cases,  if  possible,

advertisements in these foreign countries periodically to  drive

home this message.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand, Sir, that publicity of our efforts has in fact

reduced  the  number  of illegal immigrants coming  from  Batam.

Illegal  immigrants should not be locked up for long periods  of

time  because  that  would be a drain of taxpayers'  money.   We

should  publicise how we deal with illegal immigrants   who  are

caught.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the region's economic problems far from being over, we must

be  prepared  for  further  influx of illegal  immigrants.   Our

rising  crime  rate  has also been partially blamed  on  illegal

immigrants.  Will the Minister assure Singaporeans that we  have

the problem under control?

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, the turmoil in neighbouring

countries  resulting  from the economic crisis,  especially  the

deteriorating  situation  in  Indonesia,  has  given   rise   to

Singaporeans worrying whether there would be a great  influx  of

illegal   immigrants   coming  to  Singapore.    These   illegal

immigrants  not  only  disrupt our social  stability,  but  also

threaten  the security of our country.  From time  to  time,  we

learn from the newspapers that the Police have managed to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>

detect  and repatriate these illegal immigrants coming into  our

shores.   But how many have successfully slipped through despite

our  tight  security?   As these illegal  immigrants  and  their

syndicates will come up with more and more ingenious methods  to

get  into  our  country, perhaps it is time to deal  with  these

syndicates caught in the act more severely.  There is a  Chinese

saying  that  "without the head, the snake cannot move".   So  I

think it is only right to disable the head of this syndicate  so

that  these illegal immigrants would not have an avenue to  come

into Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would appreciate it if the Minister can give us an update of

the  situation.   Firstly, where is the bulk  of  these  illegal

immigrants from?  Secondly, which are the most vulnerable points

of  entry?   Thirdly,  which are the likely places  where  these

illegal  immigrants  hide when they enter  Singapore,  and  what

plans  have been formulated to ensure that our borders be closed

to these intrusions?

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the figure

quoted  by  Mr  Chng Hee Kok is really alarming.   We  must  not

welcome  these unwelcomed visitors.  The point, as  pointed  out

earlier  by  speakers, is to tackle the problem  at  source.   I

would like to ask the Minister's response as to what steps  have

been taken to prevent these illegal immigrants from coming.  Can

we  launch advertisements in newspapers and the media  in  these

countries  to  warn  them of the consequences  that  if  illegal

immigrants are arrested, they face severe punishment.  It  would

appear   that  despite  a  very  stringent  law,  these  illegal

immigrants  still come to Singapore.  The reason  could  be  the

economic situation in this country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two aspects which I want the Minister to consider.

Firstly, Singaporeans have a duty to see that they do not in any

way  help  these illegal immigrants.  The moment that they  know

that  somebody  is  a suspected illegal immigrant,  they  should

report to the authority.  And if every Singaporean takes this as

a national concern, I think we can succeed.  Secondly,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>

I  have another suggestion for the Minister.  For those national

servicemen  who  serve  the  Singapore  Police  Force,  can   we

authorise  them to act as Special Police?  We could  train  them

and  they could be empowered to arrest.  I think this is another

aspect  of  community policing which the Minister  may  want  to

consider

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, an English woman,

Miss  Leigton,  took two half tablets of Ecstasy,  in  a  London

night club, over an interval of three hours and when she woke up

later  that  day, she collapsed because she had  suffered  brain

damage  due to a lack of oxygen to the brain.  How many  of  our

Singaporean youths know about the hazards of Ecstasy?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ecstasy is an illegal synthetic so-called designer drug. A

designer  drug  mimics  an  already  illegal  drug  by  slightly

altering the chemical composition.  Ecstasy is also called  MDMA

(methylene-dioxy-meth-amphetamine).  The amount of  MDMA  needed

to  get  "high" is close to the toxic dose.  Ecstasy acts  as  a

stimulant  to  the  central nervous system.   Immediate  effects

include  feelings  of  detachment,  feelings  of  euphoria   and

increase  in  heart  rate.  Immediate side-effects  are  nausea,

fainting  and  even  death. Long-term  effects  are  high  blood

pressure, psychotic episodes, kidney failure, stroke and death.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now "killer drugs" which may have 33 times the

potency  of  Ecstasy  flooding night clubs  in  Britain.   Those

buying  them have no idea of their strength and often  find  out

too  late.   We  in  Singapore have  to  be  extra  vigilant  in

preventing their entry into our market.  New variations  in  the

pharmacological make-up of these drugs may allow drug pushers to

escape  detection and punishment.  One of these drugs, so-called

"Flatliners", has killed several people, while another, known as

"DOB",   makes   Ecstasy   seem  like  aspirin.    Dealers   and

manufacturers are pushing any substance that they  are  able  to

sell  in a buyer's market.  The market has been greedy both  for

new  drugs and for the vast sums of money that can be made  from

these drugs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Ministry of Home Affairs to be

vigilant  and  to be mindful of the variants of Ecstasy  in  the

local  scene.  May I also ask for redoubled efforts in combating

the  drug  abuse  from  all angles, including  increased  public

education,  concerning  the  risks  of  drug  use,  targeted  at

children and parents?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, Mr

Chng  Hee Kok is concerned about the rising crime rate and asked

for  an  assurance that the Police would do something to  ensure

that  it  does  not go up.  We must put the 1998 crime  data  in

perspective.  Although crime rate went up by 5.2% last year,  if

we  compare that with 1997, excluding the immigration offenders,

crime rate only went up by 4.4%,  There is still no comfort that

crime  rate has gone up.  If we take into account the population

growth   and  we  measure  crime  rate  by,  say,  per   100,000

population,  the crime rate actually only went up by 1%, because

there  was  a  population  growth in  1998.   Despite  that,  an

increase in crime rate is still a cause for concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the 1998 data, we are actually going back to the

situation  in  1995 or 1996 and that is about the same  rate  of

crime that happened during the two years that I mentioned.  This

is  against a backdrop of nine consecutive years of decrease  in

crime.   From the measures that the Police have taken  plus  the

publicity  and  crime preventive programmes, we seem  to  see  a

slight decline in the last few months of 1998 and the first  two

months of 1999.  We hope this trend will continue and we hope to

be able to return to the normal low crime rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police will continue to step up anti-crime patrols and

enforcement  actions  in  crime-prone  areas.   With   the   new

Neighbourhood Police Centre concept, residents in the  community

can  be  assured  of  faster Police response and  more  frequent

patrols and better quality on-the-scene investigations.  We will

set up 32 Neighbourhood Police Centres in the whole of Singapore

and,  so  far,  four  NPCs  have been set  up  in  Jurong  East,

Queenstown, Clementi and Bukit Merah West.  Feedback so far from

the residents is that these NPCs are doing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>

well  in  ensuring the safety and the security of our residents.

28 more NPCs will be implemented over the next three years, with

six coming on stream this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although crime has increased, when we look at the figures, we

know that the increase in crime mainly related to property crime

and  a lot of these crimes can be prevented had precautions been

taken.    For  example,  the  number  of  thefts  from  vehicles

increased  sharply from 3,470 cases in 1997 to  5,620  cases  in

1998,  and that is a very sharp increase of 62%.  In most cases,

it  is because the Cashcards and the handphones were left in the

car,  exposed, unattended, and therefore, inviting  opportunists

and  criminals to take advantage of breaking into  the  car  and

stealing  the  item.   If vehicle owners take  precaution,  they

would  save themselves a lot of trouble in having to go  through

the  process  of  reporting the crime and suffering  losses  and

damage to the car.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address this, the Police will focus on public education

on  crime  prevention measures and also through crime prevention

exhibitions and public media such as the Crime Watch series.  It

will  highlight the common modus operandi used by the  criminals

and give advice on how to prevent the crime.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just give some examples of these measures that the Police

would  take.  For example, to deter motor vehicle thefts,  crime

prevention  signboards will be put up in multi-storey  carparks.

A  notice  of  advice will also be placed on the  windscreen  to

remind owners not to leave valuables unattended and exposed.  In

addition,  the  motor vehicle importers will  be  approached  to

install  security features in the vehicles at the point of  sale

such  as  vehicle  number  engraving,  installation  of  burglar

alarms, etc.  Insurance companies are also encouraged to  reduce

the insurance premium to vehicle owners who take steps to secure

their own vehicles.  The Police will also work closely with  the

Manpower  Ministry,  URA,  the developers,  town  councils,  the

Singapore  Retailers' Association and various grassroots  bodies

in the implementation of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>

neighbourhood  watch  zone schemes.  These  coordinated  efforts

have  proven to be effective in curtailing the rise of crime  in

the last quarter of 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards illegal immigrants who come to Singapore to seek

employment and can pose a danger to our social security,  Police

have also stepped up their patrols in our territorial waters  to

detect  their entries.  On land, the Police have conducted  many

major   operations  against  immigration  offenders,   including

against the employers and harbourers of these people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are right that it is important that Singaporeans

should  play  a  proactive role in ensuring a  safe  and  secure

Singapore.  The Community Focus Plan (CFP) was crafted to enable

local  community organisations and the residents to tackle these

security  and safety issues in their own areas.  The Police  are

confident  that  with the shared ownership of these  programmes,

the  sense  of  safety  and security in the  community  will  be

enhanced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng also asked how we can educate our people,

particularly  the  youths,  on crime  and  the  consequences  of

committing  crime.   MHA  has several programmes  involving  the

youths, to educate them that they should not commit crime.   For

example, we have got a formal crime prevention programme in  the

school  curriculum.   This is being taught  as  part  of  social

studies.    The  programme  seeks  to  impart  crime  prevention

measures  and  to  impress upon the students the  importance  of

respecting the law.  A set of textbooks called "Mr Policeman  is

my  friend"  for  kindergartens and  "Mr  Policeman"  for  upper

primary  and  lower  secondary students are now  being  used  by

schools.  The Police and CNB officers also conduct joint  school

talks   on  the  consequences  of  being  involved  in  juvenile

delinquency, secret societies and drug abuse.  These  talks  are

given to small groups of high risk students comprising not  more

than  50 students a group.  This will enable officers to counsel

the students more effectively.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a programme called the Caution and Visit Programme

which is part of the rehabilitative programme for youths.   They

are  either  students  or out-of-school  youths  who  have  been

identified  as  gang members or were involved in  gangs.   These

youths  are  first  cautioned  by the  officers  of  the  Secret

Societies  Branch  of the CID against future  gang  involvement.

Besides attending talks conducted by the CID, these youths  will

also  take part in the prison visit programme so as to let  them

experience  the  harsh  realities of  prison  life.   This  tour

includes a live mock caning session.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On drug rehabilitation or preventive-drug education, we also

have  a  Drug Rehabilitation Centre Visit Programme which  is  a

joint effort in preventive drug education by CNB and the Prisons

Department.  This programme was initiated in 1990, and up to now

more  than  50,000 students and youths have taken  part  in  the

programme.   Anti-drug  lectures  and  tours  of  the  DRCs  are

conducted for these students or youths during each DRC visit.

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh Chin Hua's concern about sending youths to visit

these  institutions is already being carried out.   We  have  an

Inter-Ministry  Committee on Youth Crime which  coordinates  the

efforts  of  the  various  agencies to  tackle  the  problem  of

juvenile delinquency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng is concerned about road bully incidents reported in

the  press where motorists resorted to violence over the use  of

the road, and he suggested enhanced punishment for road bullies.

The  Police  take a very serious view of road bullies  and  have

taken  very tough measures against them.  Over the years,  tough

police enforcement action plus deterrent sentence handed down by

the  courts  have  helped to keep the problem  in  check.   Road

bullying  incidents have actually declined from 14  in  1994  to

only  3  in 1998.  Mr Chng said that many cases were unreported.

I  would  advise these people to report them so that the  Police

can look into their problem.  If they do not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>

report, then what Police have in hand are reported cases, and it

shows that there is a decline.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain the deterrent effect, in fact, I amended the Road

Traffic  Act  just recently to empower the courts to  disqualify

road  bullies  from driving.  With effect from  1st  March  this

year, the court can disqualify drivers who are road bullies from

holding  licences  if they are convicted of certain  Penal  Code

offences,  including  voluntarily causing hurt  and  voluntarily

causing   grievous  hurt  to  other drivers  or  the  passengers

arising   from  road  accidents  or  disputes.   Motorists   who

therefore resort to violence on the road will risk losing  their

right to drive, in addition to being charged for the act of road

bullying.   I  do  not  see  a need right  now  to  enhance  the

penalties,  as  suggested by Mr Chng.  But we will  continue  to

monitor  this and if there is a real cause for concern  that  we

have  to  do something more than what we are now doing, we  will

certainly look into it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members talked about the Community Focus Plan (CFP) that

the  Home  Team agencies, not just the Police,  and the People's

Association  have  implemented.  The  Community  Focus  Plan  is

indeed a new initiative launched by the CDCs in partnership with

MHA agencies.  Each CFP is simply a series of action plans drawn

up  jointly  by  the  CDC,  the  grassroots  organisations,  the

residents  and  the  Home Team agencies to tackle  the  specific

safety  and  security  issues in a particular  community.   This

approach  draws  on the residents' own knowledge  of  their  own

community's safety and security issues to work out solutions  to

the  problems that they face.  Each CFP is therefore tailor made

to  address  the unique needs of each community.  This  targeted

approach would therefore yield better results than one-size-fits-all approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to assure Members that this CFP is not a disguised

attempt  by  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  to  transfer  its

responsibilities   to   residents   or   to    the    grassroots

organisations.  MHA will continue to be responsible for ensuring

the safety and security of all Singaporeans, but the CFP

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>

initiative will promote self-help and mutual support to build up

a  more cohesive and caring community.  This is something  which

the MHA cannot do without the community's involvement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank several Members for citing examples of the CFP

initiative   and   how  they  have  succeeded   in   their   own

constituencies, and we ought to do more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann asked about getting residents work with the Home

Team  and have a CFP programme to install cameras within certain

places.   Let  me  give an example where this has  already  been

done.  Vagrants and displaced workers were found sleeping in the

food court in Chander Road at night.  After some discussion with

the  Tek  Kah RC Chairman and the Police, the owner of the  food

court  actually  installed and managed six  CCTVs  in  the  food

court.   He  also  lit  up the place.  The situation  has  since

improved.  So the proposal to install security cameras or  CCTVs

in  strategic  locations is not new, and has been  found  to  be

effective.    The   Police   will   encourage   the   grassroots

organisations  and  the community to install  these  cameras  in

crime-prone  areas to supplement the Police presence  and  deter

crime.  We are happy to work with the community organisations to

implement this local initiative if they find the need to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members also asked about how the CFP initiative has

progressed  so  far.  As I said, quite a few of  our  CDCs  have

already implemented the CFP programme, eg, Tanjong Pagar,  Bukit

Timah,  Sembawang  and Hong Kah CDCs have  implemented  the  CFP

programme since 1998.   By the end of this year or so,  all  the

CDCs would have implemented the CFP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with some Members that this term "CFP" may not be easily

understood,  and  we need to do a bit more  publicity.   I  have

asked  the People's Association and the Police to look into  how

we  can find a new term to better explain what CFP really  means

to the residents, and they are now brainstorming for a new term,

and this will be announced later when they have found a new word

or term.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need indeed to communicate the CFP initiative to the

public,  so  that we can raise the awareness of this  programme.

The  PA  and  the  Home  Team agencies will  mount  a  sustained

publicity  programme to educate the public on  the  benefits  of

taking part in the CFP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Claire Chiang talked about changing mindsets and training

the people.  Indeed, that is the case.  CFP involves a shift  in

mindset, not just of the officers taking part or doing the  CFP,

but  mindset of the people in general, that safety and  security

is  the concern of only the Government.  It is not.  Safety  and

security  is  the  concern of everyone who lives  in  Singapore.

Like  Mr Rai said, every citizen should be concerned about their

own  security,  when  they  deal with  illegal  immigrants,  for

example.   So  we want everyone to share in this responsibility.

But,   of  course,  MHA  would  not  run  away  from  its   main

responsibility of ensuring safety and security.  The PA and  MHA

have conducted a number of courses/programmes for the grassroots

leaders  and  the Home Team officers to change the  mindsets  of

these  people who are involved in the CFP.  If there  are  other

organisations  that  need to be involved in  the  CFP,  eg,  the

voluntary  social  workers and the voluntary  organisations,  we

will  also  involve  them.   It is  not  just  CDCs,  grassroots

organisations  and the Home Team, but if there  are  others  who

need  to  be  involved, we will certainly include them  in  this

project.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training of officers therefore is important in changing the

mindset of the people, and the various suggestions put forth  by

Mdm  Chiang, such as the joint training with the staff, with the

community  leaders and so on, are already being done.   We  will

consider  the other suggestions and implement them if  they  are

practicable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for funding, the PA and the MHA are committed in providing

the necessary resources to ensure that the CFP implementation is

effective  and  successful.   In  general,  we  will  adopt  the

principle of co-funding in the implementation of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>

CFP  activities.   Then there is ownership  and  there  is  also

shared responsibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have asked how we can recognise the grassroots leaders

and  organisations and others taking part in the CFP.  For those

organisations  under  the PA, we will take  into  account  their

participation in CFP by  awarding them points when  we  consider

awards  for  PA  organisations like the CCC, RC  and  the  CCMC.

There could be a new category like Friends of the Police, as Mdm

Claire Chiang has suggested, and indeed if there are such  other

categories  which will contribute to the CFP, we will  think  of

new ways of recognising them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members also spoke on the illegal immigrant situation which

I  briefly touched earlier on.  Let me now elaborate a bit  more

on  the illegal immigration offender situation.  I said that  in

1998,  about  23,000  immigration offenders were  arrested,  and

immigration    offenders   include   illegal   immigrants    and

overstayers.   Mr  Chng  earlier on gave the  figure  of  23,000

illegal  immigrants.  That is not correct.  We only  had  14,000

illegal immigrants arrested last year.  But the total number  of

immigration offenders arrested last year was 23,000.   In  other

words,  9,000  of  them  were  overstayers.   This  is  a   very

significant increase over the figure that we had in 1997.  Where

do they come from?  These immigration offenders come mainly from

the region, ie, Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar and

Thailand.   These are the major contributors to our  immigration

offender problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do they come? They came through our checkpoints or they

smuggled themselves in by boats, cars, lorries, motorcycles  and

other  means.  9,000 of them came in legally with proper  social

visit  pass,  but they overstayed in Singapore, and they  became

overstayers  and  therefore  also  fall  into  the  category  of

immigration offender.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we do? We stepped up enforcement action since March

last  year against all these immigration offenders.  The  Police

have raided the various immigration offenders' haunts, including

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>

construction sites, workplaces, forested areas.  The Police have

also   targeted  the  harbourers  and  the  employers  of  these

immigration offenders at their residential premises, such as HDB

flats and lodging houses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police also conduct routine checks on the roads, set up road

blocks,  at MRT stations and open areas to check on people  whom

they  suspect to be an immigration offender.  So the Police have

stepped up their efforts in this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On enforcement at sea, we have deployed our patrol boats to

check  on motorised sampans which smuggle in illegal immigrants.

And  we have also used our radar system to detect any boats that

come  to  our shore and which are suspected to be boats bringing

in  illegal immigrants.  We have also set up border patrols  and

observation  points  and  ambushes along  the  coastline,  where

illegal immigrants tend to land in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the checkpoints, the Singapore Immigration and Registration

(SIR) has also intensified the checks of people who come by air,

sea  or  land, and those who are suspected to be illegal workers

will  not  be  allowed to come in.  Last year, SIR  turned  away

23,000 such people who were suspected to be illegal  workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also mobilised other Home Team agencies' resources to

deal with this problem.  For example, we have deployed the Civil

Defence dogs to sniff out the illegal immigrants who hide in car

boots  or  in secret compartments of coaches, buses and  so  on.

And those buses or vehicles which convey such illegal immigrants

will  be  confiscated, and those who smuggle illegal  immigrants

into  Singapore  will be heavily punished.   For  instance,  one

person  who smuggled in 15 illegal immigrants a few months  ago,

was  given a 10-year jail term and 24 strokes of the cane by the

court.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law was amended last year to impose stiffer penalties on the

abetment of immigration offences.  We have also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>

built  in  a presumption clause and introduced the onus  on  the

suspected illegal immigrant to satisfy the court that he was not

attempting  to  enter Singapore illegally.  We will  review  our

legislation  from time to time to make sure that it  serves  the

need  to  protect  our  shores as well as to  deter  immigration

offenders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On publicity and the suggestion on advertising in TV and

newspapers in other countries, we have thought about  that.   We

are not sure how effective that will be because to advertise  in

China,  India,  Thailand, Indonesia, and to make sure  that  the

advertisements reach every of their citizens is  not  easy.   So

what  SIR  does is that for every one of these illegal immigrant

or  overstayers who is repatriated, he will be given  a  set  of

press  cuttings, a set of newspaper reports, on what happens  to

these people, the police raids and the sentences that they  get.

On  the ferry boats that ply between Singapore and Indonesia, we

also  have video shows on them to show the stiff penalties  that

illegal immigrants will face if they come into Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we try as much as we can to deter people by telling them

not to come illegally.  The main message to all these people is:

do not even think about coming in illegally.

Singaporeans  can certainly help us to deal with  this  problem.

For  example, if they suspect anybody to be an illegal immigrant

or  overstayer,  they can report them to the police  and  action

will  be taken.  For those who harbour or employ them, they will

also be dealt with accordingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members that although there is a large number

of  arrests  of  immigration offenders, the situation  is  under

control.   The  Police,  the  SIR, and  the  various  Home  Team

agencies  have  got the situation under control  and  they  will

continue  to  raid the various places to flush out such  people.

All we need also is the cooperation of the press to publicise it

so that every Singaporean is aware of it.  But they get tired of

reporting  on the raids from time to time.   Because when  there

are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>

too many raids, the press say it is the same old thing again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo is concerned about Ecstasy and other kinds of

psychotropic  drugs.  Let me assure Dr Neo that the  problem  of

Ecstasy  and  its  variants are also well   under  control.   We

anticipated this problem in 1996 and have taken prompt action to

nip  the problem in the bud.  Ecstasy only emerged on our  local

scene  in  1996.  CNB arrested 661 abusers and seized more  than

39,000  Ecstasy pills in 1996.  The number of abusers fell  from

661  in  1996  to  403 in 1997 and only to 180 last  year.   The

number of Ecstasy pills seized also fell from 54,000 in 1997  to

about  2,200 in 1998. In any case, most of these pills that  are

seized were actually intended for other countries rather than to

be  sold in Singapore.  Abuse of Ecstasy was controlled  by  the

unrelenting  enforcement,  deterrent  custodial  sentences   and

intensive  preventive educational efforts plus the tighter  laws

targeting at Ecstasy traffickers.  Like other countries, ecstasy

abuse  is closely associated with night clubbing scenes and,  in

particular,  with rave dance parties.  Most of our abusers  were

arrested in discos or night entertainment outlets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1996, CNB has been working very closely with the night

entertainment operators and owners to prevent Ecstasy  abuse  in

their  premises.  CNB conducts regular raids at these places  to

flush  the  abusers and the pushers.  Those found  not  to  have

taken  enough  measures,  their operating  hours  will  also  be

curtailed.    The  courts  have  also  meted  out  very   severe

imprisonment  terms of between 12 and 18 months  to  an  Ecstasy

abuser.  To deter smugglers and traffickers, the Misuse of Drugs

Act  was  amended  last year to introduce a presumption  clause,

which means that anyone arrested in possession of 10 grammes  or

more of Ecstasy would be deemed to be trafficking in that drug.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo was concerned about the variants of the Ecstasy. So

far  we  have  not  detected any abuse or  presence  of  DOB  or

flatliners, but CNB remains vigilant and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>

will not hesitate to take action to stamp out the problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would

like  to  urge  the  Ministry of Home Affairs to  exercise  more

control on discotheques and lounges.  Many  parents and teachers

are  expressing  regrets  that the Government  has  relaxed  the

control over discotheques and lounges.  In particular, they  are

greatly  concerned and unhappy with the "Foam Party" at  Sentosa

and the ladies-only discotheques.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August last year, a novel "Foam Party" at Sentosa attracted

about 500 participants, mainly teenagers.  Scantily dressed boys

and  girls squeezed into a pool of thick foam and were in bodily

contact  with one another. Many openly embraced members  of  the

opposite sex, even when they did not even know each other.  Some

brought  their own liquor, and some were under-aged.   According

to  a  newspaper report, a 16 year-old student was seen  wearing

only brassiere and short skirts and fooling around with her  boy

friend  in  the  foam.   Many elderly Singaporeans  were  really

surprised by the degree of openness of these young people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also one discotheque in Singapore which catered only

for  teenage girls. Among the patrons in the discotheque,   half

of them were dressed as girls and the other half were dressed as

boys.   Those  who  played the part of  boys  wore  T-shirt  and

trousers  with  men's  shoes.  They spotted  short  and  heavily

gelled  hair.  At a glance, they looked like boys.  If  they  do

not open their mouth and talk, it is very difficult to tell that

they  were actually  girls.  Worse still, they were kissing each

other.  Girls and girls were hugging each other.  Some even  sat

on the laps of the others.  It is very hard to believe that such

things can actually happen in this  decent  island of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These happenings have caused great concern among parents and

teachers.   If  this  phenomenon  is  allowed  to  carry  on  in

Singapore,  I believe the Minister for Education, the principals

and teachers will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>

all  lament the wasted efforts they have put in over the  years,

and what have become of our young people.   In order to  prevent

our  young boys and girls from going astray, I hope the Ministry

of Home Affairs will exercise stricter control over discotheques

and  lounges, especially those which allow hanky-panky  business

to  be conducted within their premises,  so that the parents and

teachers can feel at ease.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, Members

have been listening to speeches about keeping the community safe

from  the  offenders in our midst.  May I make a  plea  for  the

offenders,  those who are arrested by the police.   Fortunately,

it is still the cornerstone of our legal system that everyone is

presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty.  Was it  last

year  that  I  gave  the  instance of  three  persons  who  were

completely  innocent but were arrested on a  murder  charge  and

only  to  be acquitted some 39 months later?  I spoke about  the

long, long hours of questioning and denial of food to them.   It

is not just them.  It is their families who also suffer.  At the

moment,  the  police rule is that members of  families  may  not

visit persons who are arrested until the police have carried out

their investigations.  This may stretch to several days, if  not

weeks.   This shows a complete lack of empathy for the  families

of those who have been arrested.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask whether any steps are being considered by the Ministry

to  lay  down  guidelines for the questioning and  treatment  of

offenders  in police custody and, particularly, on the  question

of allowing visits from members of families to see these persons

who have been arrested.  They suffer very much when they are not

told  even  on  what  charge a member of  the  family  has  been

arrested  and they are not allowed to see the member.   I  asked

this  last  year  after I mentioned the case of the  three  men.

They  are  not the only ones who confessed to crimes which  were

never  committed.   So  may  we know  whether  the  Ministry  is

contemplating   laying  down  guidelines  for   the   treatment,

particularly  questioning of and visits  by  family  members  to

persons under police custody.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, I was not able to catch your eye when

the  Minister  has  replied.  May I  take  this  opportunity  of

seeking  your  indulgence just to question the Minister  on  two

points he has not answered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point relates to my asking the Minister to review

whether he will repeal the Act against naming offenders who  are

below  16  years old.  The second point I raised was a sentiment

shared  by Mr Sin Boon Ann, ie, we would like to see more police

presence.   It is granted that the  NPC would allow  for  better

quality  investigation, but my question is: are we getting  more

police presence and has NPC resulted in less crime cases than in

the old Neighbourhood Police Post system?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, before we continue, maybe I just

respond to these two points.  Right now, we do not see a need to

reveal the names of under 16 offenders.  If there is a need  to,

we  will  do so.  We will have to consult the various  agencies,

including the Attorney-General's Chambers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the presence of police with the new Neighbourhood Police

Centre  system, there is a greater number of patrols on the road

than  in  the  previous system where NPP officers sit  in  their

centre at certain times and wait for the public to see them  for

services  or to receive complaints from them.  Sir, actually  we

do see slightly more police on the roads on vehicles than in the

past.   But  it  will take a while for this  NPC  system  to  be

implemented throughout the whole of Singapore.  It will be  done

by the year 2001.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I just remind hon. Members that we are

running  out  of time on this amendment and they  should  be  as

brief as possible?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, in the last two years I have been

asking  for  the Ministry to look into privatising some  of  the

services.   I  think the Minister did indicate  last  year  that

something  will  be  done  about it.   I  am  referring  to  our

declining  workforce and manpower problems  and  we  should  not

deploy well-trained police

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>

officers  to  do the work of looking after car parking  offences

and so on.  Private individuals or corporations can be empowered

to  issue  summonses to vehicle owners who flout public  parking

rules  and I wonder whether the Minister will implement, if  and

when he implements, the privatisation of such services.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, Singapore has advanced as a country

over  the last 30 years.  Our Government has given our people  a

quality of life that is unsurpassed in Asia.  We live in a clean

environment.  Our children go to good schools.  There is law and

order  in  this country.  And the sky is the limit  if  you  are

good.   Quite  naturally  there are many more  Singaporeans  who

would  like to make Singapore their home.  However, it is  still

not  possible  for  us  to  take in the huddled  masses  because

Singapore is just simply too small a country to do that.   I  am

sure  the  immigration authority is inundated with  applications

from  non-Singaporeans to be Singapore permanent residents.   Up

until recently, the process of granting permanent residence  has

been shrouded in secrecy.  Not everyone knows how decisions  are

arrived   at,  although  everyone  can  understand   that   age,

educational  level,  family background, are  some  of  the  main

factors taken into consideration when granting such requests.

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present process has resulted in much frustration in

some applicants who sometimes are at a loss when in one case the

application  was  successful, but in another  similar  case  the

application was not.  Therefore, I was pleased to learn recently

that  the  immigration  authority in its  bid  to  have  greater

transparency  within  the bureaucracy has decided  to  publicise

those  criteria  on  which applications for permanent  residence

would  be  considered.  However, the announcement fell short  of

telling  members of the public what weightage would be given  to

the  various  criteria  listed and  how  many  points  one  must

accumulate  before the applicant can succeed in its  application

or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>

have  a  reasonable chance to be considered in relation  to  his

application.   I  know  that immigration  authorities  in  other

countries, such as Canada, for example, are very open about  the

point  system that is used to assess the applicant's  chance  of

success in applying for permanent residence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the advantage of disclosing the weightage in advance

is  that it would let the applicants know first whether they are

even  qualified to apply and, secondly, it would encourage those

who  qualify  for permanent residence to apply and in  turn  can

then contribute to this country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask the Minister whether the

Ministry will reconsider disclosing the weightage to be given to

the  various criteria in a foreigner's application for permanent

residence  in  Singapore so as to make the  application  process

more transparent.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I am just as concerned about the

new criteria as Mr Sin Boon Ann.  I believe the new point system

is  in  line with the Government's policy of attracting  foreign

talent.   While I understand the need, in principle, to  attract

foreign  talent,  I am concerned whether our  citizens  will  be

disadvantaged  by the policy or, worse, suffer  because  of  the

policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think priority for approval of PR should be given to

those  whose spouses or parents are Singapore citizens.  I  came

across a case where a Singapore citizen mother, applying for her

two  children to become PRs since 1987, was rejected.  I am also

of  the  view that the criteria for this category of  applicants

should be made more transparent so that the applicants know what

are  expected  of them.  Otherwise, they would be just  guessing

why their applications are rejected while others are approved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also would like to know whether there is a quota system

under  which  applications are approved based on the  number  of

quotas  for  each  category.  If so, how does the  quota  system

work?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rai is not here. Mr Chng.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, until more recently, civil defence

shelters were built in the void decks of HDB flats.  The  latest

developments are in Woodlands and Sengkang.  CD shelters are now

located  in all flats, that means, every flat will have its  own

individual  civil  defence shelter.  However, Sir,  these  civil

defence  shelters take up some 10% of the space  in  the  flats.

Moreover,  the CD shelters are also made of reinforced  concrete

and the owner of the flat is not allowed to puncture or drill  a

hole  into the wall.  Therefore, these CD shelters are  in  fact

very  hot and humid and no air-conditioners can be installed  in

these  shelters.  Also, in the case of a major mishap,  we  will

have  a  whole stack of CD shelters, one sitting on top  of  the

other, and I think the rescue efforts will be very difficult.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister why there is a need for

the design of CD shelters to be located in each individual flat,

and  whether  they  will go back to the older design  which  the

owners of flats find more favourable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second question for the Minister is: are these design

criteria   also   applicable  to  the  private  apartments   and

condominiums?

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, my question is also

similar to Mr Chng's.  At the beginning when we developed our CD

shelters programme, we started with the CD shelters at the  void

deck.   The  Government bore those costs and continues  to  bear

those  costs  whereas, as at today, there is  a  requirement  to

build a CD shelter in every new HDB flat.  When this matter  was

debated  in  the House, the Minister indicated that  Government,

and  not  the  purchasers of the new HDB flats, would  bear  the

costs  of  those  shelters.  I understand that for  new  private

condominiums  and landed property, it is also a  requirement  to

build  CD  shelters in those dwelling units.  But in the  latter

cases,  the individual owners are required to bear those  costs.

May I ask the Minister why is there a discrepancy in funding  CD

shelters?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Sir, let me first address Mr Peh's question. The

Ministry  has  not relaxed its control over discos and  lounges.

Discos  and  lounges  are still subject to licensing  conditions

which  aim  to  prevent law and order problems such  as  fights,

overcrowding  and  social problems, like  immoral  and  indecent

activities and under-aged drinking.  There is no change  to  the

licensing  conditions.   In enforcing the licensing  conditions,

Police  conducts regular and random spot checks  at  discos  and

lounges.   If  the  operator  is  found  to  have  violated  the

licensing  conditions,  his licence can  be  suspended  or  even

forfeited,  or  his  operating hours  curtailed.   His  security

deposit  can also be forfeited.  For serious cases,  the  Police

would  prosecute the licensee in court who then faces a fine  of

up to $5,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh mentioned foam parties. Police has advised the

organisers  of such foam parties against violating  the  law  or

allowing  immoral  or offensive activities  on  their  premises.

Police  will closely monitor any of them organising such events.

These parties, in fact, have toned down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as for 'all-girls' night parties, Police has been

monitoring  the  entertainment joints  organising  such  parties

since  1997,  to ensure that immoral or offensive activities  do

not  take  place.  There was only one disco that organised  such

events.   The operator was found to have infringed the licensing

conditions by staging a dance performance by transvestites.   He

was charged in court and fined $2,000.  His operating hours were

also  curtailed  from  3.00 am to 1.00  am.   The  disco  ceased

operation in October 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me assure Mr Peh that Police will continue to

monitor  these  activities and will not hesitate to  take  tough

action to preserve public law and order and public morals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok's point is on privatisation of police

services.   Police  has  hitherto been the  sole  agency  taking

action against illegal parking on public

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>

roads.    This  is  not  an  efficient  use  of  limited  police

resources, as Mr Chng has said.  Issuing illegal parking summons

is  a fairly straightforward task which does not require a fully

trained  police  officer  to perform.   Police  will  look  into

getting  suitable  companies in the private  sector  to  enforce

illegal   parking.   This  will  free  up  scarce  manpower   to

concentrate  on  critical functions such as attending  to  crime

cases.   Police will call for tender in the middle of this  year

inviting  private sector companies to apply.  For a  start,  the

successful private agency will be tried out at certain locations

where  illegal  parking  is rampant.  The company's  performance

will be evaluated and reviewed regularly both to ensure that  it

meets  standards  set by Traffic Police before privatising  this

task of enforcing illegal parking island wide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chng also asked about CD shelters, together with Dr

Wang  Kai  Yuen.   I  will take the points  together.   Communal

residential  shelters  were first built in  HDB  void  decks  or

basements in 1987.  A 1994 review found that household  shelters

had  significant  advantages.  Household  shelters  would  offer

immediate protection to each household whereas it may  take  too

long a time for everyone in the home to make their way to a void

deck   or   basement  shelter.   Household  shelters  would   be

especially  vital  to  families  with  young  children,   senior

citizens or infirm members.  Household shelters would also allow

the  daily  living routine to continue as normally  as  possible

during an emergency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because its feasibility has to be tested, Government

initially bore the construction cost.  With the enactment of the

Civil  Defence  Shelter Act requiring all new  HDB  and  private

dwellings to provide shelters in 1997, HDB and private dwellings

will now bear the construction cost of their household shelters.

So  it  is  now borne by the owners, which I think  makes  sense

because  after all, it concerns their own safety.   This  ruling

applies  to  all  HDB flats open for public selection  from  1st

April last year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Chng and Dr Wang Kai Yuen have made comments about

the  construction, the technical specifications  and  design  of

these shelters.  Let me assure them that from the beginning,  my

Ministry  was mindful of home owners' concerns about  the  space

taken  up by the shelter, its uses and its aesthetic value.   In

order  to optimise the space and functionality of the HDB flats,

the storeroom in a HDB unit was chosen and fortified so that  it

could  double  up  as a shelter.  HDB owners can  also  use  the

shelter  for other purposes such as a study. Of course,  certain

restrictions  will  be  necessary, for example,  non-hacking  of

doors, thickness of the walls, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, SCDF has helped house owners by issuing a list of do's

and  dont's  guidelines on shelter renovation.  Members  of  the

public  can  approach  SCDF with their  queries,  including  any

innovative  proposals to use the shelters.   SCDF  continues  to

work  with the respective agencies to ensure that the design  of

the  shelter remains cost-effective and meets the public  needs,

functionality and aesthetics.  Improvements made include surface

wiring   of   earlier  design  to  concealed  wiring   and   the

introduction  of a lighter design protective shelter  door.   So

whatever suggestions Mr Chng and Dr Wang would like to  make  on

the  design of the shelters will be welcome, and they  can  make

them to SCDF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, certain Members have asked about PR. We have got Mr Sin

Boon  Ann.   His point is why do we not make it more transparent

by  letting the public know the weightage.  Our PR policies  are

intended  to attract foreigners who can contribute to Singapore.

As  the  needs  of our economy and society change from  time  to

time,  we  will have to adjust our PR criteria and the  relative

weightage accordingly.  Hence, the criteria and weightage  would

also  have  to be changed, depending on the number of foreigners

we   attract.   Apart  from  avoiding  possible  abuse,  letting

applicants  know what the broad criteria are is sufficient,  and

gives  Government the flexibility to fine-tune policies promptly

and effectively in response to changes.  Mr Sin can rest assured

that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>

Singapore   Immigration  and  Registration  would  consider   PR

applications   objectively  in  the   best   interest   of   all

Singaporeans.  So I think it is best not to let them  know  also

of the weightage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang made a point and asked whether or not the

requirement where a Singaporean sponsors his foreign  spouse  is

too  stringent.   I  think  we  all  know  that  marriage  to  a

Singaporean  does not automatically qualify a foreigner  for  PR

status.   The  Singaporean sponsoring his foreign  spouse  would

need  to show that he is able to support his spouse financially;

in other words, the level of his income as well as the fact that

he  must  have a steady income.  The foreign spouse  would  also

have  to fulfil a residential requirement after marriage  before

the  PR is granted.  So these two are the basic conditions which

are  known to Singaporeans.  Here again, the cut-off should  not

be  known because otherwise they will find ways to overcome  the

cut-off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me assure Mr Low that all applications are again

considered  carefully and in the interest  of  Singaporeans  and

Singapore  at  heart.   It  could  be  that  the  case  that  he

mentioned, ie, since 1987, could be a matter of whether  or  not

his  income has been steady all this while.  His other point  is

whether  we  have quotas.  The answer is no.  We have  no  fixed

quotas to the categories of PRs coming in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Jeyaretnam once again brings up this issue of rights

of  accused  persons.  He wants to speak up for  the  offenders.

Let  me  once  again assure him that Police is very diligent  in

doing  its job.  It must be so.  That is why we have got a  high

reputation  not  only in Singapore but world-wide.   And  Police

will not do anything that will jeopardise this reputation.   The

Commissioner of Police, as the man in charge, has sent a  strong

message  down to the ground.  Indeed the fact that  some  Police

Officers,  the  numbers are very small, have been prosecuted  in

court  for  abusing their powers, shows that this is taken  very

seriously.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked this point about when and whether offenders can inform

and  contact family members.  The principle is that the offender

will  be  allowed to contact family members, or indeed have  the

family  members visit him, when it does not hinder or  undermine

police  investigation.  It must be so.  Otherwise  if  there  is

hard  evidence outside, not all cases, but in some  cases,  some

family   members  when  contacted  too  early,   before   police

investigations have completed or reached a stage when they  feel

comfortable in allowing such contact, such evidence can be dealt

with by the family members.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His other point about whether there are guidelines, Police

monitors all court judgements carefully.  Judges have given very

good  guidelines  over  the  years as  to  what  is  permissible

behaviour when police interviews offenders.  So these are looked

at  very  carefully and complied.  Recently, the police has  put

together  an  interview  doctrine, putting  together  all  these

points which the courts have made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code QC 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, on juvenile delinquency, I want to bring

up the issue of shoplifting.  What is worrying is that it is not

so  much the increased number in shoplifting offences, but  that

when they are caught, they are quite defiant and do not seem  to

realise that this is a serious offence.  In fact, what is  worse

is  that when the parents were asked to go to the police station

to take their son away, they became very defiant and scolded the

police  for troubling them for a mere few dollars of goods  that

had been stolen.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>

This is not really good.  It creates a great social problem  and

has to be checked in time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also suggest that the police encourages at least

the  major retail outlets to install a security system, such  as

bar-coding  of  goods, that will deter the would-be  youth  from

committing shoplifting offence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On traffic offences, none of us have seen heavy vehicles

travelling  within  the  50 km speed limit  and  heavy  vehicles

always  cause  fatal accidents.  I would like to  suggest  that,

instead  of  just the driver being suspended and  given  demerit

points, the vehicle should also carry demerit points.  They  can

be  suspended  for  a period of time because the  owner  of  the

vehicle  is affected by encouraging his driver to drive fast  so

that he can make more money.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> First, on traffic offences.

Traffic Police has been working closely with the owners of heavy

vehicles,  I  am told that these owners have been responsive  to

efforts  to  inculcate good driving behaviour in their  drivers.

Hence,  it  is  not  necessary at this  stage  to  penalise  the

employers by suspending their vehicles because of the misconduct

of their drivers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed, a long-term solution would be to prevent heavy

vehicles from being able to exceed specified speed limits in the

first place.  LTA and Traffic Police are currently studying  the

feasibility of putting speed limiting devices to heavy vehicles.

The  speed limiter will prevent the vehicle from going beyond  a

specified  speed  no  matter how hard the driver  steps  on  the

accelerator and this will be introduced, if found feasible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point, Sir, I thank Mr Kenneth Chen for his

suggestion of requiring retailers to install electronic tags for

their sale items.  This is a good and useful suggestion.  I will

ask  Police and the National Crime Prevention Council  to  study

this proposal further with SRA.

together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> Sir, the Ministry of Health's budget for

the coming financial year shows just a marginal decline of about

2.6% over the previous years.  It underlines the importance  the

Government is placing on health in Singapore.  The current  year

has seen the completion of two major hospitals, the KK Women and

Children Hospital and the New Changi Hospital.  The new Tan Tock

Seng  Hospital will be commissioned sometime this  year.   These

three new hospitals were built at a cost of almost $1.5 billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other development projects are also on track. It would seem

that  the development programmes outlined in the White Paper  on

healthcare, presented in 1993 by the Minister, have largely been

implemented.   With  continued  Government  support  on   health

expenditures,  the Ministry is well poised to  meet  the  health

challenges in the coming millennium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to request the Minister to comment on the extent to

which  the  targets set out in the White Paper  have  been  met,

whether  there  are  any shortfalls and how  does  his  Ministry

propose to resolve them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of Casemix, Casemix is a system employed to

estimate  patient bills based on trends and patterns of  certain

diseases.  When properly implemented, patients can get a  better

idea  of  how  much  hospital  treatment  will  cost  them.    I

understand that the Ministry has embarked on a study of  Casemix

several  years ago and now two pilot projects are being  carried

out  in  the  restructured hospitals.  I would like to  ask  the

Minister  what are the results of these pilot projects and  when

does  he  propose  to extend this Casemix system  to  the  other

Government  and restructured hospitals in the near  future.   Of

interest  also is whether the system will be applied to  private

hospitals  where  the billing systems could  be  different  from

those  in  the  restructured  hospitals.   What  would  be   the

Ministry's policy on the use of Casemix for private hospitals?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On healthcare for the elderly, the Report on Healthcare for the

Elderly  has just been issued by the Inter-Ministerial Committee

and  the Minister at his press conference has commented  on  all

the major recommendations.  I want to comment on one issue which

is of some interest and, that is, the financing of medical costs

by  way  of  insurance.  There are existing  insurance  packages

which  cater to various aspects of the healthcare needs  of  the

elderly.   However,  it would very much depend  on  the  private

sector support because, ultimately, the insurance scheme must be

profitable for the private sector to take them on.  I would like

to  ask the Minister in what ways can the Ministry help, through

various  measures, to make it possible for the private  insurers

to  implement  the  programmes to support  this  very  important

programme on healthcare for the elderly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

there  are  about 220,000 elderly people who are  aged   65  and

above  now in Singapore. In  30 years' time, the number will  be

tripled  to  about  800,000, accounting for  about  20%  of  our

population.  This figure does not appear out of the blue.  It is

the result of the baby boom just after World War II.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my rough estimate, for the period of 20 years from

1950  to 1969, more than 1 million people were born.  From  1956

to  1960, the birth rate was more than 60,000 per year, and  the

total  population of Singapore was only 1.4 million around  that

time.  This generation of people are now middle-aged.  In 20  or

30  years' time, they will enter old age.  Whether it  is  on  a

national, social, family or individual  point of view, this is a

matter of great concern, because an ageing population is a great

problem  to  us, socially and economically. In 20 to  30  years'

time, these post-war babies will not only face the problem of an

ageing  population,  but  also a problem  of  less  children  to

support them, because they are the people who have lived through

the  age  of very successful family planning, ie, "boy or  girl,

two is enough" generation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an ageing population, the demand on health care will be

heavy, and that means medical cost will go up.  So if we do  not

handle this problem carefully, 20 to 30 years later, the working

population will have a greater burden on them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the ordinary folks, the greatest concern is medical cost,

especially  after their retirement and as they  enter  old  age,

more  medical  and health care will be needed, and hence  bigger

medical cost.  The question is whether or not they could  afford

it.   Will the younger generation be able to support them?  This

will  become an emotional problem in due course. I think it will

do  us  well  to  start  preparing for measures to  tackle  this

problem.  The Government should ensure medicine and health  care

remain  affordable  to  the  general  public.  Can  we  have  an

assurance from the Minister?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report from the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Healthcare

for   the  Elderly  was  released  recently.   This  is  a  very

comprehensive report and a very important document. One  of  the

recommendations  is to provide for a long-term health  insurance

scheme.   There is a great advantage in this scheme in that  the

insurance premium can be deducted from the CPF accounts  of  the

workers.  However, the report does not spell out the details of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>

this long-term health insurance.  Members of the public may have

doubts.   For example, what can the authority do to  help  those

who have retired or will be retiring soon, but have not taken up

this kind of health insurance?  I hope the Minister can give  us

more details on this proposed health insurance scheme.

<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, the population

in  Singapore is ageing.  One in five Singaporeans will be  aged

65  and  above in the year 2030.  Medical care and other welfare

problems  of the elderly will become a heavy burden to  us.   As

such,  all  Singaporeans must give some thought to  this  future

problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inter-Ministerial Committee on Healthcare for the Elderly

has   come   out  with  a  long  list  of  recommendations   for

Singaporeans  to  take  note of.  One  important  recommendation

urges  the  Ministry of Health to develop a geriatric  screening

protocol  to  detect medical problems such as  hypertension  and

diabetes very early.  This, I believe, can prevent complications

and  disability  among  the elderly.  The MOH  should  therefore

quickly draw up a comprehensive screening programme for citizens

who are 55 years and above.  This programme, I believe, must  be

made   compulsory  and  should  involve  all  doctors   at   our

polyclinics  and private GPs all over Singapore.  The  frequency

of screening can be carried out once a year, and for those above

65, perhaps they should go for screening twice a year.

<br>2.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important consideration in this programme is the cost of the

screening process.  It should be reasonable enough to enable our

senior  citizens  to afford it.  I am sure with  a  standardised

health  screening, the cost could be as low as possible so  they

could reach out to all our senior citizens.  MOH could cooperate

with  all our Community Development Councils to share the burden

of the cost.  I hope that MOH will consider the above points and

I wish to ask the Minister how soon can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>

MOH start the screening programme for the elderly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): During this time

of  economic crisis and unstable market conditions, it  is  very

difficult  for voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs)  to  carry

out  fund-raising activities.  In fact, these organisations  are

constantly worrying about how to get the funds needed for  their

activities.   I am concerned that activities of these  voluntary

organisations may be paralysed for lack of funding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, VWOs which provide convalescence, chronic care

services  or  day-care services for the aged enjoy  50%  subsidy

from  the  Government.  I would like to urge the  Government  to

increase  the  subsidies  for  VWOs,  particularly  those  which

provide  health services for the elderly, to, say, 60% of  their

cost.  In addition, I hope that the Government can also  provide

land to these VWOs to build their own hospitals or hospices,  at

concessionary  prices.   I understand that  in  Hong  Kong,  the

government  gives  the  land,  free  of  charge,  to   voluntary

organisations to build facilities for the aged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a saying in Chinese, "Open up resources and save on

their  outflow."  If you can give them more subsidies, that  is,

more  resources,  I hope that the Government can  also  consider

other  measures,  such as the setting up  of  a  task  force  to

provide  guidance to these VWOs on how to be more cost-effective

in  order  to save cost.  Perhaps, the Government could  provide

them with cheaper supplies of medicine so as to help them to cut

costs.   These voluntary organizations are doing a great job  in

providing medical care and support services selflessly  for  the

chronic  sick  and  aged persons in our society.   They  deserve

better support from the Government.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, may I have your

permission to take my two cuts together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Thank you. I would like to declare that I am a

medical practitioner.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>

Preventive  healthcare is all-important in ensuring a population

of  healthier people.  It should be promoted vigorously  and  it

should  be  targetted  at  everyone.  Today,  I  would  like  to

emphasise  preventive  healthcare for the  elderly.   Sir,  this

needs  urgent attention because we face a fast-aging  population

in  Singapore.   It  is  crucial that  the  Ministry  of  Health

facilitates the various efforts at helping the elderly  to  stay

as  healthy  as possible and for as long as possible within  the

community.   This  is  the way to reduce the nation's  otherwise

colossal  burden  in financing the healthcare  for  its  people.

Sir,  I  would  like  the Ministry of Health to  strengthen  the

following areas:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) support should be given more readily to community centres,

voluntary  group  organisations,  and  grassroots  organisations

caring  for the elderly in the community.  The support need  not

be  financial  all  the time.  Logistics advice,  deployment  of

available   personnel,  loan  of  resources   or   even   simple

endorsements  of  support may be all  that  is  needed.   Giving

advice  on  setting up of Centres of Activity  for  Retired  and

Elderly (CARE), providing paramedics for health screening checks

and  conducting of educational talks at the community level  are

some examples of such help.  The Ministry of Health, acting as a

centre  and facilitator to coordinate volunteer doctors, medical

students and nurses, will be able to reach out to more people in

more constituencies;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) the expansion of home-care facilities could be looked into

more comprehensively within the Singapore context.  This can  be

achieved  by  training  more personnel  that  are  relevant  and

interested  home-caregivers who look after the sick and  elderly

at   home.   The  training  of  more  general  practitioners  in

geriatrics  would  be  a welcome path to  take.   More  training

should  also  be  offered  to  nurses  and  physiotherapists  in

geriatrics  medicine.  And even if it is scant, recognition  and

encouragement  should  be given to volunteers  trained  in  home

nursing.   They can certainly lessen the load of home-caregivers

and medical personnel; and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) the Ministry of Health should look into forming a permanent

team  specialising  in the early detection of chronic  illnesses

and  in the provision of better care of those chronic illnesses.

Any morbidity and mortality from any disease can be dramatically

reduced  when the diseases are treated in their earlier  stages.

It  is essential that the team be geared to reach the masses  at

the local community level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Health influences the health matters

of  the whole population.  Making the right plans and taking the

right measures can make all the difference in whether our people

will be even healthier and happier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to go on to my next cut. I am very glad

that some headway has been made in establishing the basic tenets

of  "long term healthcare" for this country.  There is an urgent

need for us to look into "long term healthcare" from this moment

in  time  because  neglect in this area could  have  devastating

effects for us in the future.  I think the report of the  Inter-Ministerial Committee on Healthcare for the Elderly has given us

a very comprehensive overview of what work is in store for us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have raised in this House, more than once, the issue

concerning  the  inadequacy  of  the  present  "medi-plans"  for

elderly  Singaporeans at financing their "long term healthcare".

I  have  also  suggested that perhaps another insurance  scheme,

"Medicare"  -  a patient/Government co-payment scheme, may  fill

this  inadequacy.   I  am delighted therefore  that  the  Inter-Ministerial   Committee  on  Healthcare  for  the  Elderly   has

recommended an insurance scheme to solve this problem.  However,

I  would like to ascertain if the scheme, though applicable  for

those  with  disability, would be applicable for those  patients

who are relatively well, and in fact, only need some help to pay

for  outpatient  long term expenses on chronic  diseases.   This

will  constitute  a  very  important  proportion  of  long  term

healthcare.   Sir,  chronic illnesses will be  a  big  financial

burden  to the afflicted and it would pose substantial recurring

expenditure for them, for instance, to control

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>

diabetics  and hypertension.  Long term medication  and  regular

follow  up  are  necessary to prevent complications  from  these

diseases.   It  has been noted that in times of economic  crisis

like   this,   patients  have  been  self-reducing   intake   of

medications and missing follow ups so as to save costs.  This is

a  hazard  from the lack of means and if this part of long  term

healthcare is not eligible for claim, you will defeat the  tenet

of  your  plans  on  healthcare for the  elderly.   I  hope  the

Ministry of Health will clarify on this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad indeed that all the various issues and their

remedies  on  the  elderly, which I have raised  in  this  House

previously,   have   been  addressed  in  the  Inter-Ministerial

Committee Report.  I am also very pleased that there is  perfect

conformity  between my ideas and remedies with this  report.   I

beseech  the  MOH  and  the  MCD to hasten  and  to  effectively

implement all the recommendations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, surveys in America have shown how

critical it is to have a healthy workforce.  According to  these

surveys,  more than 60% of all diseases are caused by  lifestyle

risks.  Poor dieting habit is associated with leading causes  of

death.   In  general, overweight workers have 30% more  hospital

days and 48% more health-care claims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we are also facing a shift in disease profile

from  the infectious diseases to lifestyle diseases.  The  major

causes  of  death in recent years are cancers, stroke and  heart

diseases.  These are related to our lifestyle and what  we  eat.

Moreover,  an  aging workforce is emerging.  The  percentage  of

workers in the 40 to 59 years age group has increased from about

24%  to 35% of the workforce.  Although an older worker need not

necessarily  be physically less fit or has negative  implication

on  productivity,  we must accept that older  workers  are  more

prone  to  illnesses.  So, the challenge is to  keep  the  aging

workforce  healthy through all kinds of disease preventions  and

health promotion.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at June 1997, the annual average days of hospitalisation

leave  is  10  days per employee and it has been estimated  that

more  than  $400  is spent on healthcare for  each  employee  in

Singapore every year.  This works out to a total of $500 million

for  the  Singapore workforce.  The unrestrained, rising  health

costs  can adversely affect the competitiveness of our  economy.

It  is,  therefore, in the interest of every company to take  an

active interest in the health of its employees.  NTUC has  taken

the  initiative  to  launch the Workplace  Health  Programme  in

August  last year with the support from the Ministry of  Health,

Singapore Sports Council and the NTUC co-operatives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Ministry of Health would allocate more

resources  to encourage and facilitate private sector management

to take a preventive approach in dealing with employees' health.

Instead of just providing healthcare benefits, companies  should

invest money in programmes that will help improve their workers'

health, and thus cut healthcare costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Roger Smith, the retired CEO of General Motors, as

quoted in a publication, said that, "For every $1 we have  spent

on wellness programme, $3 are returned in increased productivity

over  a  3-year  period.   And  of  course  there  are  dramatic

reductions in absenteeism and on-the-job accidents."  I  suggest

the  Ministry conduct a cost and benefit study at our workplaces

and  devise  some form of incentives such as tax incentives  for

companies with structured Workplace Health Programmes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, on 1st April 1993,

the  Government set up Medifund with an initial contribution  of

$200  million from the consolidated revenue account.  As at 31st

March  1998, the capital sum of the funds stood at $600 million.

The  number of Medifund applications approved in FY97  was  over

56,000,  amounting  to  more than $13 million.   Medifund  is  a

safety  net  for qualifying individuals who cannot afford  their

healthcare  cost.  The individual Medisave and  those  of  their

immediate family

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>

members will be called on first and Medifund is applied  to  the

shortfall.  Medifund has provided relief to many needy people in

dealing with their health cost.  I am raising the following as a

matter of principle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that there are cases where family members object

to  contributing their share, be it cash contribution or the use

of  their  Medisave.  Very often, they cite that they have  been

estranged  from the sick member.  I have no doubt that  in  some

cases,  a  parent may have neglected the child, and,  therefore,

the  child begrudged being called upon for assistance.  Perhaps,

there  has been a serious family fall out.  Whatever the reasons

given,  I  am questioning whether it is then right to leave  the

burden  to the other taxpayers to carry.  It is my premise  that

it  cannot  be  right. In times of need, family  members  should

rally  round  and forget the past.  If one cannot forgive  one's

own  family member, who else can one forgive?  In some cases,  a

family member who refuses to help out is also the wealthiest  in

the family.

<br>3.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not be a practical solution to suggest that family

members  bring the matter to the Family Tribunal.   The  process

can  be  protracted and painful.  I suggest  that  at  the  very

least,  the  contribution  from the  Medisave  accounts  of  the

immediate  family  members should be made an  automatic  process

through legislation.  This way, the burden of family members who

chip  in  with  the cash payments would be lessened,  and  where

taxpayers'  money is used, at least we know that  all  immediate

family  members  of  the individual to  be  helped  had  made  a

contribution.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, I am specifically requesting

for  help  in  providing dental care and treatment for  children

with cerebral palsy.  The main concerns are that most public and

private  dentists and oral surgeons are not equipped  to  handle

difficult cerebral palsy clients who are unable to control their

involuntary  movements, or drooling.  And getting  them  to  sit

still is the greatest challenge.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also no awareness among graduates about the needs of

dental care for the cerebral palsy, because their courses do not

include  this  area  of  treatment.   There  is  a  need  for  a

designated  dental service in the community which  the  cerebral

palsy  can  visit  as  part of our healthcare  benefit  for  all

Singaporeans.  And there is a need to expose dental students  to

handling, in practice, more difficult cases of treatment for the

disabled  in a designated hospital facility, so that  eventually

when  they set up their own clinics, they will accept and  treat

such  clients.   There  is a greater need  to  provide  free  or

subsidised   dental  treatment  to  clients  who  are   severely

disabled, like the cerebral palsy.  Currently, only clients from

MINDS benefit from free dental treatment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Spastic Children's Association of Singapore is the primary

advocate for more help to be extended to the disabled.   It  has

240  schoolers, 60 adult trainees and workshops,  and  55  adult

members.  If the Association sets up a dental clinic of its own,

it  needs  resources  and  a  pool  of  volunteers  like  dental

personnel.  The critical factor here, however, is where can they

even  get  to start a programme with volunteer dental  personnel

who know how to treat the spastics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospital is still the most practical venue to cater to the

needs  of  the disabled.  I propose that we start by identifying

dental graduates who are interested in this area of treatment to

run a Government-sponsored programme in NUH or SGH.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we are merely reinforcing one additional aspect of care

within  the existing medical infrastructure, very little capital

and  operating costs are needed.  I feel that this is  the  most

cost-effective measure.  As it is only a small number of  people

who  will  need the service, it will not be an excessive  burden

over  the  current case load of dental personnel.  What  we  may

have  to  reinforce is a group of paramedics or  trained  dental

assistants  who can prepare patients beforehand, and  administer

sedation,  if  necessary,  before  the  doctor  attends  to  the

patient.  What we need more is to promote a positive

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>

attitude towards the medical needs of the disabled.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, Singapore has a growing reputation as a hub of

medical  excellence  in the region.  This  did  not  come  about

through  chance.  This came about through the high  professional

standards  maintained  and provided by a  pool  of  well-trained

doctors  and  healthcare  workers.  We will  need  a  continuous

stream  of junior doctors coming on in succession.   To get  top

notch  doctors, we need training for these juniors.  Conversely,

these  juniors need the training to move on career  wise.   They

are  usually bonded.  They are often over worked, and  they  are

perhaps  underpaid.  Most of all, they have little or no  choice

but  simply  to get through with their stint in public  service.

This  may cause loss of morale among the junior doctors.  I feel

strongly that for the junior doctors to give of their best,  the

Ministry of Health must first have their welfare at heart.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I would like to highlight the unhappiness of many junior

doctors  concerning their employment benefits, especially  their

basic medical benefits.  Sir, a medical officer was admitted  to

hospital in March 1997, suspected of foreign body ingestion.  He

was found to have pulmonary tuberculosis.  He stayed for a total

of  seven  days in B2 Class and had to pay $1,496.08.  It  would

have  been $4,539.50 if he had chosen an unsubsidised ward.   He

had  to pay the entire bill like any other patient, and only the

surgeon's  fees  were  waived, but not the  anesthetist's  fees.

During  this period, he was working as a medical officer in  the

same  hospital.  It is possible that he contracted  tuberculosis

from  his  patients.   The point here is that he felt that  some

form  of professional courtesy, like what the surgeon had, would

have been extended to him for being a staff of the hospital.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another medical officer was admitted in November 1997 for gastro-enteritis which he had apparently contracted during his night

duty.  He had to pay $1,233.67 for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>

four  days  of  stay.   Again,  no  professional  courtesy   was

exercised by the hospital he was working in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aforesaid were two cases of many more similar situations

faced  by  junior doctors.  Employers are morally law  bound  to

medically  cover  occupational mishaps and disabilities  arising

from  work.  It is imperative that the healthcare sector  should

not  be  an  exception.  In many other industries, the employees

receive services from within the industry they work in, often as

part of the benefits.  Doctors and healthcare workers should  be

given the same privilege.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, doctors are exposed to a vast array of health hazards, such

as  infectious diseases, in the course of their duties.  Medical

benefits for medical practioners in the civil service have  been

pegged  to  the  level  of other civil  servants  that  are  not

similarly at risk.  Many doctors feel that as they are  more  at

risk,  they  should  be better covered for  these  risks.   Many

doctors  also felt that the mechanism for their medical benefits

was not apparent to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the Ministry of Health intends to have the welfare of

junior  doctors adequately looked after.  Sir, this is one  area

requiring some adjustments by the Ministry.  The perpetuation of

the  aforementioned  incidents and  the  negative  publicity  it

received  is  unhealthy.  It is detrimental for  the  morale  of

junior  doctors  and  deleterious to  public  opinion  upon  the

hospital  and the Ministry.   The Ministry should set  the  pace

and  show itself as a responsible and caring employer.  Sir,  it

is reasonable and appropriate that they provide medical coverage

to  healthcare  workers more susceptible to contacting  diseases

while working.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, the Report of the Inter-Ministerial

Committee   on  Healthcare  for  the  Elderly  has   made   many

recommendations.  However, I notice that there was no mention of

an  institution  to spearhead these recommendations.   So  I  am

asking  the  Minister  to  consider  whether  the  Home  Nursing

Foundation

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>

could  be  used  as  the  institution  to  spearhead  all  these

recommendations.  Of course, we need to upgrade the institution.

We  need to give it higher stature, responsibility, function, to

oversee  and  initiate the many health programmes and  services,

not  only  for  the  elderly but also for  other  modalities  of

healthcare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the services that the Home Nursing Foundation could

embark  on?  I would include rehabilitation programmes,  chronic

illness  management,  health  maintenance,  home  care,   health

education  at community level.  And what are the target  groups?

The  target groups are the recently discharged hospital patients

for   continual  rehabilitation  programmes  complementing   the

hospitals,  chronic  disease patient management  like  diabetes,

strokes,  some  spinal problems, hypertension, asthmatics,  etc.

And  the  other  area they should take care, of course,  is  the

senior citizens on the health maintenance programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we do it? I would like to make a suggestion. I think to

get  it  better  organised and spearhead all the recommendations

the  Committee has made, we could set up what I call a community

health  services centre.  We could set up these centres  between

the  Home  Nursing Foundation and CDCs.  These community  health

services centres would provide the following modalities of  care

-   home  care  services, community care services which  include

coordinating  the  many  health  service  providers   like   the

community  hospitals, outpatient clinics, general  practitioners

and  a group of what I call the allied health care organisations

like  the  diabetic society, the renal society, cardiac  society

and  so  on.  It could also serve as an information and advisory

centre  on  health  problems.  And,  of  course,  it  should  be

involved  in  the health maintenance programmes and also  health

screening.  We have to determine the number of such centres.   I

think  they  should preferably be distributed evenly  throughout

the  island,  perhaps  around eight centres.   I  am  only  just

mentioning  this number.  It could be more. A few  CDCs  may  be

involved   in   one  centre  together  with  the  Home   Nursing

Foundation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A proper study, of course, needs to be made on the location of

such  centres and whether it will be a stand-alone  building  or

whether  we could tie up with some very well equipped  community

centres  like  mine.  To do all these, I suggest that  the  Home

Nursing Foundation be considered seriously as the institution to

organise and manage the care of the elderly.  Of course, we need

proper  funding and manpower should be provided.  It is  only  a

suggestion.   I  do  hope  that  the  Minister  will  take  into

consideration what I have just said.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, the Report of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Healthcare for the Elderly is

comprehensive and promising.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acute help is offered by our hospitals and I am glad to learn

that  the Ministry is incrementally creating more beds  to  cope

with rising numbers of our aging population.  By the early years

of  the  new  millennium, our forecast needs will  be  met.   We

already  have a number of homes  for the aged.  The Home Nursing

Foundation  alone  operates  12 centres  to  offer  a  range  of

services to the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am more concerned, however, by what follows after the patients

are  discharged from institutional care.  In fact, hospitals are

facing  resistance in discharging elderly patients who  are  not

too  ambulant  but not sick enough to stay in hospital,  as  the

families do not know how to take care of them at home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the growing demographic trends, this deserves serious

consideration.  I would like to focus on two aspects:  first, in

training  home-carers on how to care for the frail elderly  more

effectively  and,  second, developing nursing  and  para-nursing

services  that  can be sold to private homes  on  principles  of

affordability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, focus on homecare. What are the critical challenges?

First,  we  may  ask by asking: who takes care?   Primarily  the

wife,   daughter   and   mother,  with   lower   and   declining

participation, from the husband, daughter-in-law  and  the  son,

according to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>

a  Singapore Survey in 1995.  Conversely, daughters, as  carers,

have increased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, care-giving role is adversely affecting care-givers who

feel  the  physical  and  psychological  strain  caused  by  the

necessity of constant engagement, thus restricting personal life

and  increasing financial burdens.  The situation  is  obviously

worse  if care-givers also have to work to support the  rest  of

the household needs.

<br>3.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third challenge is home-care is evidently the cheapest

way of solving the problems of long term care, but this may mean

depriving  carers, in particular daughters, the  chance  to  re-enter the labour force or take over extra-familial roles in  the

community.   Some longitudinal research has shown  that  "family

centred"  women  deteriorate earlier and actually  experience  a

lower degree of quality of life in old age.  We lose out both at

the labour front and the home front.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth challenge is what if the elderly has no children

to  do the caring?  Or what if the elderly prefer to live alone?

Or  live  in a home for the aged?  The trend towards independent

living  is  increasingly  apparent in a  more  educated  greying

population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last challenge is that there are real problems when old

parents  are often angry, bad-tempered, grumbling and  difficult

to manage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given these challenges, what services, skills package and

information  are  available now to provide support  networks  to

help  these  carers  cope?   Are they  adequate  in  offering  a

differentiated support system for the elderly?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that instead of looking for more buildings and

day care centres, we may want to creatively look deeper into the

community and tap its embedded resources to help.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is where I think CDCs, Women's Wing, Women's Executive

Committees   and  NTUC  cooperative  movement,  Family   Service

Centres,  hospitals and medical consultants,  volunteer  medical

teams  and neighbourhood clinics could work out a Nursing  Focus

Plan  to  identify the needs of each neighbourhood  and  develop

small  scale,  efficient and effective programmes at  the  local

level  to  promote collaborative, self-organising  networks.   I

think  the  spirit  and orientation of such a  service  is  very

similar to what Dr Tan Cheng Bock earlier mentioned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second focus is on developing nursing and para-nursing

services.   I feel we have not sufficiently utilised the  skills

and  capabilities of the Nursing Association network and retired

nurses  as  well  as homemakers, who may be like part-time  paid

jobs,  be  trained as para-nurses to care for the frail elderly.

Their paid service will  be a positive relief for carers who can

then leave the homes and do their own thing for a few hours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can use CDC or a neighbourhood polyclinic as a base. We

then  identify  the  medical skills level  in  the  constituency

through the Nursing Association.  Trained nurses and consultants

can  serve  as  leaders  to train a network  of  para-nurses  to

respond to home calls.  It is like the insurance business  which

has  a lead agent with a network of understudying trainees.  The

Ministry will then set guidelines on payment schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is becoming increasingly problematic to rely on

family care as the only and best solution for caring for an aged

person.   We have to complement this initiative by strengthening

home  care  and  nursing service as a para-professional  service

which  can be offered by paid agents who are not family members.

While  this  is  already happening in a  small  segment  of  the

community   which  can  afford  such  service  from  private-run

operations,  I  am calling for a community-based  initiative  at

each  constituency to make healthcare a localised and affordable

community  service,  with appropriate level  of  regulation  and

quality control from the Ministry.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, several Members have indicated their

interest  in what I have to say on this amendment.  I hope  they

are not disappointed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Mr Tham who runs a hair clinic came to my meet-the-people

session  several times relating the problems he has  encountered

in conducting his hair transplant business.  His hair transplant

process  involves re-inserting hair follicles removed  elsewhere

one   at  a  time.   His  clinic  employs  medical  doctors  and

specialists  who were trained in the specialty  clinics  in  the

United States.  I do not know about the effect of his operation,

but  he has a  long list of clients from Singapore and the Asia-Pacific  region.   His business seems like a  sun-rise  industry

with good demand, and good return on investment.  It also has  a

"feel-good"  effect on the customers.  Not everyone  can  handle

hair loss with the grace and dignity as some notable Members  of

this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the risk of infections and complications, hair

transplant   operation  of  this  nature  should  be  regulated.

However, this Mr Tham seems to run into regulatory entanglements

with  the  Ministry  of  Health, such  as  the  suitability  and

certification of doctors involved.  Furthermore, when  he  tried

to  put  up  an advertisement, he could not use the words  "hair

transplant" in the advertisement, but the words "hair  services"

which could mean anything actually.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me hasten to add that that I am not bringing this

matter up on behalf of Mr Tham.  But through the interaction,  I

became  interested to find out how the Ministry of Health  views

hair  transplant  as  an economic activity.   Is  it  a  medical

operation,  cosmetic  service or plastic surgery?   Furthermore,

are  the  doctors  involved subject to  the  regulation  of  the

Medical Registration Act?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head P (cont.) -

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> First, let me

thank  the  Members,  who have spoken, for  their  comments  and

suggestions.   Let  me  first reply to the  points  made  by  Mr

Bernard Chen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper on Affordable Healthcare identified

four strategies to ensure that healthcare remains affordable:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to maintain a basic medical care package which all

Singaporeans can have access to;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to regulate the supply and type of doctors and

hospitals;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) support for medical R&D, education and training; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) have sound healthcare financing policies to support

the objectives laid out in the White Paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, my Ministry took stock of the implementation of

the  White Paper recommendations.  I am happy to inform  Members

that at the time of the stock take, most of the targets, as  set

out  in  the  White  Paper,  have  already  been  met.   Let  me

elaborate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While MOH has maintained the basic medical care package, we

also  regularly  review  the package to take  into  account  new

technologies and treatment procedures.  We have also taken steps

to  strengthen the regulatory role of the Ministry and  reviewed

our legislation and policies to ensure that we continue to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>

maintain a high standard of medical care and medical practice in

Singapore.   The White Paper had recommended the setting  up  of

key national medical centres.  I am happy to report the National

Centres  for Skin, Eye and Heart are already operational,  while

the  remaining two, the National Cancer Centre and the  National

Neuroscience Institute, will begin operations this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of research, MOH established the National

Medical Research Council in December 1993, and we have allocated

$280  million  to fund medical research for the period  FY94  to

FY2001.  So far the research interest and results have been very

encouraging.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining key recommendation that has yet to be fully

implemented  is  Casemix  which is an  important  tool  to  help

contain  future increases in healthcare costs and  at  the  same

time  enhance quality of care.  MOH will introduce  the  Casemix

system  in  all  public hospitals by the end of this  year.   We

will,  within the next three to five years, expand  the  Casemix

system to private sector hospitals to control charges by private

doctors  and hospitals to patients who use Medisave to help  pay

part  of  their  medical  bills.  So with  the  introduction  of

Casemix, all the key elements contained in the White Paper would

have been implemented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me move on to the points raised by Mr Chen on Casemix

itself.   Sir,  let  me take this opportunity to  first  briefly

explain  to  Members what is Casemix.  Casemix is a system  that

allows  hospitals to group patients according to  their  medical

conditions  and  the level of resources needed  to  treat  them.

Casemix  offers two important benefits: firstly, it will  enable

the  hospitals  to  better  understand  and  better  manage  the

resources  needed for a particular medical condition;  secondly,

it  will encourage performance monitoring, benchmarking and best

practices, leading to better quality of care of our patients.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of Casemix, as mentioned by Mr Chen, was piloted

at  two sites in May last year.  This was extended to cover  the

remaining Government-owned acute hospitals six months  later  in

October  1998.   All the hospitals now have systems  to  capture

information  required under Casemix.  By the end of  this  year,

these  hospitals will receive subvention based on Casemix.   And

the  Government will fund the public sector hospitals  according

to  the  number of patients treated in each Casemix category  or

the  technical  term which is used is Diagnosis  Related  Groups

(DRG).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Government White Paper on Affordable Health Care, Casemix

was  mentioned  as  one mechanism that can be  used  to  control

balance billing in private hospitals.  Casemix information  will

enable  us  to  set  the  limit on the total  amount  a  private

hospital can bill a patient for a particular DRG if he is  using

Medisave to pay for part of his hospital bill.  This limit  will

be  regardless  of  the length of stay, the  type  of  tests  or

medications  ordered.  The control of balance  billing  will  be

implemented in three to five years' time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has already started to engage the private sector in

discussions.  We will encourage and help the private  sector  to

actively pursue the use of Casemix.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Members have spoken on issues related to the

elderly  and  the  Report  that  was  released  by  the   Inter-Ministerial Committee on the healthcare needs of the elderly.  I

will  take  them  altogether and address them according  to  the

issues.   First,  let me thank Members who have expressed  their

views  and concerns on the Report of the IMC and also for  their

strong  support.  As many have stated, Singapore  faces  a  very

serious  challenge in the 21st century as a result of the  rapid

ageing of our population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Goh Choon Kang mentioned, the number of elderly persons

above  the  age  of  65 will climb from 225,000  today  to  over

800,000 by the Year 2030.  Clearly, a four-fold increase in  the

number of elderly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>

persons  in  our  society over the next  30  years  will  impose

immense  pressures  on the healthcare system.   We  must,  as  a

nation,  start  preparing now for the transition.   We  must  be

proactive  and  anticipate,  plan  and  phase  in  the  critical

national health infrastructure and services over time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IMC has recommended a two-pronged approach to look after the

healthcare needs of the elderly.  Firstly, health promotion  and

disease  prevention  to  enhance  the  health  of  the  elderly.

Secondly,  the provision of adequate, appropriate and affordable

services  for the elderly who require long-term care.  The  main

strategy  to meet the healthcare needs of the elderly  obviously

is  to  avoid disease and disabilities through life long  health

promotion and disease prevention.  Healthy elderly persons  will

then  remain  happy,  active  and  productive  members  of   the

community.   This approach will also shorten the period  of  ill

health  and  reduce  the  need to institutionalise  the  elderly

whenever they fall ill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo has suggested that my Ministry should work closely

with and support voluntary and grassroots organisations that are

interested in conducting educational talks and health screenings

for  the  community.  Sir, I can assure her that we  are  indeed

doing  so  in the area of educational talks but, nonetheless,  I

shall ask my officials to look into her suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of healthcare screening, Mr Ibrahim Othman and Dr Lily

Neo  touched  on  that.  Let me reply to them now.   Mr  Ibrahim

Othman  stated  that  MOH  should draw up  quickly  a  screening

programme for the elderly and should make it compulsory and have

it  done yearly.  When they get a little bit older, it should be

done  twice  yearly and it should be cost effective.   The  cost

should be reasonable and affordable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the IMC has recommended that the elderly should undergo

regular  medical screening that allows medical  problems  to  be

detected  and  treated early.  This would then  improve  patient

care and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>

reduce  the risk of serious complications and disabilities.   To

achieve  this objective, my Ministry has developed a simple  10-minute  geriatric health screening protocol.  This  protocol  is

meant  to  pick  up early symptoms and signs of common  diseases

such  as  high  blood  pressure, diabetes,  visual  and  hearing

impairment, other functional and mental problems in the elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screening protocol is being validated currently and, once it

is  validated, we will give it to the GPs and polyclinic doctors

to  administer to elderly patients.  Mr Ibrahim Othman said that

this  should be made compulsory.  Sir, we should not make health

screening  compulsory.   It  should  be  a  voluntary  programme

because  this  is  in line with the Government's  philosophy  of

individual  responsibility.   We will  educate  the  individuals

through the mass media and the community organisations about the

importance  of  health  screening.  We hope  that,  through  the

organisations at the grassroots level and the VWOs, we will have

a  pretty  good  outreach.  We expect the cost to be  affordable

because the screening would be simple, low cost and it takes  10

minutes.  My officials are now in the process of identifying and

training  service providers to administer the screening  and  to

decide on the appropriate frequency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo raised the question of MOH supporting community health

screenings.  Sir, I feel it will be better for the organisers to

rely not just on MOH, but to reach out and involve GPs and other

healthcare providers and workers that are working in  the  area.

This  is because there are a lot more GPs and healthcare workers

in the private sector than in the public sector and many of them

would  be  happy, I am sure, to strengthen their links with  the

community in which they serve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me touch on home care. Mdm Claire Chiang stressed the

need for us to tap on the community and that there is a need for

us  to  provide greater support to home carers.  Sir, I  totally

agree  with her.  We do indeed ensure that there is an  adequate

support for home carers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>

because  the burden on the family members who are providing  the

care  is  actually  quite great.  In keeping with  our  societal

values  and norms, our philosophy is that the elderly, even  the

disabled  ones,  should  as far as possible  remain  with  their

families    and   stay   within   the   community,    and    the

institutionalisation of the elderly should only be  the  measure

of  last  resort  and not the first resort.   We  are  therefore

taking  various steps to enhance home care and to alleviate  the

burden being borne by family care givers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first touch on the type of home care services that we are

providing to support the home carers.  The first is home nursing

care.   The nurses from the VWOs, who provide this home  nursing

care,  visit  the elderly at home to provide such nursing  care,

like  wound dressing and teaching the elderly sick and the  care

givers  simple  exercises to improve their  health  and  fitness

levels.  The second is home medical care where doctors visit the

elderly  sick  at home to provide treatment and follow-up  care.

The third is home-help where home helpers make visits to deliver

meals and provide respite care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these three categories of home care services will be an

important support for family care givers.  My Ministry will work

closely  with  MCD to identify and encourage more  VWOs  to  get

involved and to assist and nurture them.  We will also work with

the grassroots organisations and the professional organisations,

like the nursing association and others, to identify people  who

are  interested in such  a service and identify who can  be  the

key  leaders in each area and help them drive the process.  This

is  a nation-wide requirement and the more helping hands we  can

get,  the  more  effectively we can help the home  care  givers.

Sir, I totally agree with Mdm Chiang and we would definitely  be

working in that direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to healthcare financing. Mr Bernard Chen asked

how we are going to get the private insurers to get involved  in

the  provision of long-term care insurance.  And  Mr  Goh  Choon

Kang, on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>

the  other hand, asked in view of the likelihood that healthcare

costs  will continue to go up, how we would help the elderly  to

pay  for  their healthcare needs in the future, how do  we  help

those  who presently need such care and who may not be  able  to

have  access to the long-term care insurance and how do we  help

them  to pay for such services.  Sir, because our population  is

relatively young now, this is the right time to put in  place  a

proper framework for financing healthcare.  That is why we  have

come  up  with this solution of long-term care insurance because

this  would enable individuals to start paying the premiums  now

in  anticipation of 20 or 30 years' time when they get  old  and

may need long-term care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also aware that the cost of long-term care, especially

institutionalised  long-term  care  for  the  elderly  who   are

severely  disabled and will require extensive  support,  can  be

quite  expensive.   At present, some of you may  know  that  the

patients  or  the elderly with household income  of  $2,000  and

below  qualify  for subsidies in the VWO homes.  Those  families

with  household  income  above that  level  are  unable  to  get

subsidies.  We have had quite a fair bit of feedback  that  many

families  in  the  lower middle income groups do  find  it  very

difficult   to   bear   the  full  fees.    Arising   from   the

recommendations of the LTC, the Government has agreed to  extend

such  subsidies  to families in the lower middle income  groups.

We  will  need to have a means test to identify who will qualify

for  such  subsidies  and my Ministry is  now  working  out  the

details  on where is the cut-off income level.  In reply  to  Mr

Goh  Choon  Kang,  those families who are in  the  lower  middle

income  groups  today  will  be able  to  have  access  to  some

subsidies once my officials have finalised their studies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in terms of getting the private sector to be involved, our

aim  is  that  the Government, through CPF and  MOH,  will  only

launch one basic long-term care insurance plan.  For this  plan,

the  premium  will be kept low and affordable and the  benefits,

although they will not be very large, will still be adequate for

the lower

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>

middle  income and lower income families.  Because, in addition,

to  the cash benefits from the insurance payment, they will also

have  access  to, firstly, Government subsidies,  and  secondly,

financial  support from the VWOs.  With these three  components,

the cash outlay required from those families will be affordable.

This means that since we are only providing the basic insurance,

we will need the private insurers to come in to provide enhanced

plans.   This  is very similar to the MediShield approach  where

CPF  provides a fairly basic MediShield package and the  private

insurers provide the enhanced package.  To make it possible  for

the private insurers to participate, we will also be prepared to

extend the use of Medisave to pay for the premiums.  The details

are now being worked out between my Ministry and the CPF Board.

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo asked whether the long-term care insurance will also

pay  for  the  treatment of chronic diseases like  diabetes  and

hypertension.  The long-term care insurance would only cover the

care provided by the elderly with serious disabilities and would

therefore require extensive care from care-givers, whether it is

at  home  or  in  institutions.  These severe  disabilities  are

usually fairly long-lasting or prolonged, if not permanent,  and

can  therefore be very costly for the family to manage,  whether

they  are  living at home or in the institution.  The  costs  of

medication   for   chronic   conditions   like   diabetics   and

hypertension are generally affordable and I think most  families

are  able  to pay for them out of pocket.  For those who  cannot

afford the medications from the private sector, they have access

to   the  polyclinics  where  heavily  subsidised  services  are

available.  The normal subsidy is 50% at the polyclinic and  for

the  elderly above the age of 65, they get another 50% discount.

Sir,  in  actual fact, for the elderly, the subsidy is more,  in

the range of 75%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the key thing is to remember that the aim is to

keep  the  premiums for the long-term care insurance as  low  as

possible and that means having as tight a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>

coverage  as  possible, rather than as wide a coverage,  because

the  wider  the coverage, the greater the coverage,  the  higher

would  be  the premiums required and this would be  contrary  to

what we are trying to achieve, which is to keep the premiums low

and affordable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang talked about the role of the VWOs and

asked  for a review of the subsidies.  I agree with Mr Yeo about

the  role of the VWOs.  We too value their role because they are

able  to perform a very difficult job with great compassion  and

with  great commitment and, therefore, we should try to make  it

as  easy as possible for them, without getting them involved, in

just  doing fund-raising full-time, which I think, some of  them

are doing.  But at the same time, we have to make sure that they

are  being run efficiently, so that with the subsidies  we  give

them,  they  are  able to operate without having  to  raise  too

extensive the amount of funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that in Hong Kong the land is given to them for free.

Sir, I want to let him know that in Singapore, this is also  the

case.   We  charge them a Temporary Occupation Licence  or  TOL.

But  this  is  a  paper transaction because  the  TOL  is  fully

subsidised  by the Ministry.  So, in effect, they get  the  land

for free.  Not only that, we provide them with a grant that pays

for 90% of the cost of the building, so the amount they have  to

actually raise is quite low.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think what is a burden on them is the need to raise funds

for  the recurring expenses since we only subsidise 50%.  And  I

am  happy  to inform Mr Yeo that we are actually reviewing  that

too.   The  aim  is that we should make sure that, firstly,  the

subsidies  are increased, so that their burden is lessened,  and

secondly,  to widen the coverage.  And as I mentioned just  now,

we are going to increase the coverage from just the lower income

groups  to the lower middle income groups, and I think it  would

make the burden on the VWOs a lot lighter.  We are reviewing  it

together  with MCD and we hope to finish the review  within  the

next six months.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Cheng Bock suggested that for the implementation of

the   LTC   report,  we  have  an  institution  to   drive   the

recommendations and that we should expand the role  of  the  HNF

and  utilise  the  CDCs  and other community  organisations  and

grassroots organisations to help drive the implementation.   The

recommendations of the Inter-Ministerial Committee cover a  very

wide  spectrum  of  areas  from  preventive  healthcare,  health

education, health screening, community-based services, including

home  nursing to the setting up of physical structures - nursing

homes,  community hospitals, the whole lot.  It  really  is  the

work of a Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, my Ministry will continue to drive the implementation of the

recommendations but we will do that in close collaboration  with

the   VWOs  because  we  are  not  the  ones  who  are  actually

implementing.   The VWOs will have to come in  and  provide  the

services and provide some of the training and we will be at  the

back helping them, but making sure that where there are gaps, we

are  able  to  quickly  identify new  VWOs  or  maybe  encourage

existing VWOs to fill the gaps.  And we may, later on,  set  up,

in certain areas, coordinating groups or ensure that there is  a

leader  for some of those programmes.  So, it is mid-way between

what  you have proposed and what we are actually doing.  He  has

asked  for  us  to make use of the CDCs.  Sir,  indeed,  we  are

looking  into that and would like to work as closely as possible

with the CDCs down the road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have replied to most of the points which I am

supposed  to have replied to.  I will now ask Dr Aline  Wong  to

answer the rest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Aline Wong):

Sir,  I  would like to address the points raised by Mr Yeo  Guat

Kwang.   I  think he made a case for the Ministry  to  encourage

more  workplace  health promotion programmes.   Indeed,  we  put

quite   a   bit  of  emphasis  on  promoting  healthy  lifestyle

programmes at the workplace.  As early as 1988, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>

already  formed  a Workplace Health Promotion  Unit  within  the

Ministry and we went out to various organisations and ministries

to  help  them organise comprehensive workplace health promotion

programmes.  We also train facilitators at the workplace so that

they  can  carry  on those programmes after  we  have  done  the

initial  kick-off for them.  Come September this year, in  order

to  highlight the importance of our emphasis on workplace health

promotion  programmes, we are going to present a special  award,

the  acronym  of  which  is HEALTH, which  stands  for  "Helping

Employees Achieve Lifetime Health", to those employers who  have

commendable workplace health promotion programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to show our appreciation here to NTUC for launching

the  NTUC  Workplace Health Promotion Programme in  August  last

year  which had quite a widespread participation rate among  the

various organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo asked what kind of incentives we should provide to

employers to promote health at the workplace.  But as he himself

said,   increase  in  productivity,  decrease  in   absenteeism,

increase   in  worker's  morale,  all  these  will  reward   the

organisation  many  times over the amount  that  they  spent  on

health promotion activities.  So I think there is really no need

for additional incentives, such as tax incentives to be given to

these  organisations.  But I applaud and agree with him that  it

is important to promote health at the workplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee advocates compulsory deduction from Medisave

of  family members if a patient is unable to pay for his medical

expenses, particularly if the family can afford to do so.   From

our  experience,  there are actually very few  cases  where  the

immediate  family members refuse to pay for the healthcare  cost

of  a patient, particularly the parent, who is unable to pay for

himself.   This  shows  that family links  or  relationships  in

Singapore  are still very strong, and in matters of  the  heart,

like  family relationships, filial piety, I think the Government

should not interfere as much as possible.  We already

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>

have  the  Maintenance of Parents Act which  allows  an  elderly

person  to claim maintenance from the children who are  able  to

contribute  but refuse to do so.  We should not  press  for  the

medical maintenance of parents further.  At least the problem is

not significant enough to warrant legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for dental care for the disabled, Mdm Claire Chiang

raised the special case of the spastics.  Let me inform her that

MOH  provides  dental service to the pupils of all  the  special

education  schools, including the spastics.  We do it either  by

sending a mobile dental clinic to the school grounds, park there

for  a  couple  of months, and let the children have  a  regular

check-up and be treated.  Or we give them access to the school's

dental  clinics  at  nearby schools so that  the  volunteers  or

teachers  can  bring the children over for their regular  dental

check-ups  and  treatment.   The  children  from  these  special

schools,  as  well as children from MOH approved welfare  homes,

get  free treatment.  The other disabled children, if they visit

our  polyclinics, our dental clinics, are charged  at  the  same

concessionary  rate as children without disabilities,  that  is,

50% of the adult rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think she recognises that children with certain types of

disabilities, such as spastic children, are difficult to  manage

at  times, because there are uncontrollable movements  and  they

are  not able to function as normal children in terms of  bodily

control.   It  is  a  complex problem.  For  children  who  need

sedation  for  their dental treatment, they are presently  being

catered  to  by  the  National Dental  Centre.   Those  who  are

spastic,  children  who  are  particularly  fidgety,  can   seek

treatment there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chiang spoke about the need for specially trained dentists

who  are  willing and able to handle the spastic children.   The

stand of the Dental Faculty at NUH is that the Dental Centre  at

NUH  provides  dental  care to disabled persons,  including  the

spastic children or children with cerebral palsy.  In fact,  the

dental students now are given exposure under the supervision  of

their academic staff to treat these

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>

children.  But it is not possible for every dental student to be

trained well enough to be able to handle these children on their

own.   It  requires some further special training.  I think  the

best  solution  for  the spastic children  is  for  the  Spastic

Children  Association to run a dental clinic on its own,  which,

in  fact, I hear they have plans to do so, when they move to the

new premises.  Then they can gather a group of dentists, whether

they  are  paid or volunteers, who would be helped by their  own

paramedics  who would prepare the children for dental treatment.

By and by, they would accumulate some expertise in this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another association, the Margaret Drive Special School

which  will be running a dental clinic at its premises,  and  it

will  be manned completely by volunteers from the Dental  Health

Foundation.  So, I think the Spastic Association can learn  from

the  experience of the Margaret Drive Special School on how they

can run this kind of dental clinic for spastic children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo made a very emotional appeal for the medical

benefits  of junior doctors.  I must say that I was taken  aback

by  her  description  of  the Ministry of  Health  as  almost  a

heartless  organisation.  I take strong objection to  that.   My

Ministry  is concerned about the welfare and the morale  of  our

staff.   In  fact,  only recently, we have revised  the  medical

scheme  of  service and implemented several measures to  improve

the  working conditions of medical doctors, including the junior

doctors, and these measures have been described in the House.  I

would not dwell on them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo talked more specifically about the medical benefits

for  the  junior doctors.  Medical benefits have all along  been

provided  for  doctors in the civil service, which  include  our

junior  doctors.  These were revised when changes were  made  to

the  civil  service medical benefit in 1994, in  line  with  our

national  objective  of encouraging personal responsibility  for

one's own healthcare.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Deputy Prime Minister introduced this scheme in

the House at the end of 1993, he gave a very full explanation of

why  we  made  a  switch over from the old  scheme  to  the  new

Medisave-cum-subsidised outpatient (MSO) scheme.  Under the 1994

MSO  Scheme, the Government contributes an additional 1% of  the

officer's total monthly salary into his Medisave account.   This

additional   Medisave   contribution   is   meant    to    cover

hospitalisation  expenses should they  be  incurred  or  to  buy

approved  medical  insurance, including  MediShield,  MediShield

Plus,  for costly serious illness.  So this additional  Medisave

that  is  paid  into  the salary of the doctors,  including  the

junior  doctors  on MSO, is meant to cover his medical  expenses

through   insurance  or  through  out-of-pocket  payments.    In

addition,  the doctors or the civil servants in general  on  MSO

are subsidised up to $350 a year for outpatient expenses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Ministry of Health, all the new junior doctors are

briefed  on  their  eligibility for  medical  benefits  and  are

advised  to  purchase medical insurance coverage, using  the  1%

additional Medisave contribution.  However, I agree with Dr  Neo

that the hospitals where the doctors work should look after  the

junior  doctors  well,  especially  those  who  require  medical

treatment   either  as  inpatient  or  outpatient,  and   extend

appropriate  courtesy to them.  This has been emphasised  by  my

Ministry  to the hospitals from time to time.  Where the  junior

doctors  contract illnesses which arise out of  their  work  and

require medical treatment, the Ministry is prepared to bear  the

cost if it can be shown that the illness is related to the work.

I  would therefore request Dr Neo to let me have the details  of

the two cases cited by her.  If my officers ascertain that their

illnesses were work related, we will ask the hospitals concerned

to look into bearing the cost of the medical treatment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the subject of hair transplant, hair loss is one of

those things in life associated with the aging process or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>

otherwise,   which  I  think  we  all  have  to   take   a   bit

philosophically,  although this seems to afflict  one  sex  more

than the other.  For those who would like to seek treatment, the

way is open to them.  Singapore does not ban hair transplant  at

all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang's question to MOH is: what is our stand? Do we

encourage  or  not encourage it?  We allow it to  be  practised.

But   because  of  the  technical  expertise  required  and  the

potential  danger of infection, the procedure must be  performed

by a registered medical practitioner with recognised specialties

in   a   licensed  healthcare  establishment.   For  live   hair

transplant, it can only be performed by specialists certified in

the fields of plastic surgery, general surgery or dermatology. I

do  not have the time to describe to the House how this is done.

But  I  understand, in Singapore, there are currently 13 plastic

surgeons,  76  general  surgeons and 33 dermatologists  who  are

accredited  under  the Specialist Accreditation  Board  who  can

perform this procedure in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the case he mentioned, about why Mr Tham's clinic was not

allowed to advertise hair transplant services, it is because  we

have established the specialist register and hair transplant  is

not  listed  or considered by a panel of experts as a specialty.

Therefore, they were not allowed to advertise themselves  as  "a

licensed medical clinic providing specialised services  in  hair

transplant".  They can only use the term "hair services".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, thanks to the National Arts Council (NAC), we have

been  fairly  successful  in promoting the  arts,  and  bringing

culture  to  the mainstream, as part of our greater  efforts  to

develop  a more gracious society.  The NAC has recently unveiled

a  master  plan  for an intensive Arts Outreach Programme  which

aims at making the arts accessible to all Singaporeans.  It will

try  to  bring music, dance and theatre performances to HDB  new

towns, HDB town centres, MRT stations and shopping centres.   It

is  indeed a good move.  Thanks also to Shell, the sponsor,  for

this  new  Arts Outreach Programme for this year, 1999,  without

which the arts would not be able to reach our HDB heartland.  At

the  same time, Sir, the NAC has called for more private  sector

companies to come forward to sponsor and to help bring the  arts

to the doorstep of every Singaporean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is that our arts groups have been affected by the

economic  slowdown.  The amount of sponsorship has not  been  as

forthcoming  as before, as many companies have been affected  by

the  recession.  And unless the Government comes in to help fund

the arts groups during this economic slowdown to make up for the

shortfall  in  sponsorship,  I  am  afraid  some  of  our   arts

programmes may suffer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the operating grant given to the NAC in this year's budget

is  $16.3 million, and this amount shows a decrease of 7.2% over

last  year.   The decrease is attributed mainly to a  lower  EOM

provision because of a cut in employer's CPF contributions.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>

The  savings in manpower costs here could have been given to our

arts  groups by way of greater grants to the NAC to enable  them

to develop their talents and to carry out their activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask the Minister whether he would

convince the Ministry of Finance to provide more grants  through

the  NAC to assist these arts groups.  Unless this is done soon,

some of our arts groups may not survive this recession, and many

may not see daylight when the economy recovers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the NAC in the last 1-2 years has been promoting our arts

abroad,  and this is also a wise move.  This includes  promoting

Singapore's arts and artists at international markets to  secure

performance and exhibitions.  I wish to ask the Minister what is

the objective of regionalising our arts, and how successful have

they been so far.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I notice that in many

Government   departments  and  private  companies,   art   works

exhibited which are reproductions and not authentic works.  This

may  have  something to do with their budget on the purchase  of

art  works.  Of course, in this present financial crisis, it may

not  be  a  practical suggestion to Government  departments  and

private  companies to spend more money in buying  authentic  art

works  of  our  local artists.  We all know that art  works  are

priceless.   The artistic value cannot be measured  in  monetary

terms.   However, to many of the artists in Singapore,  most  of

whom  are  amateur artists, with  steady incomes of  their  own,

their aspiration is that their art works can be exhibited in the

reception   area  of  some  important  buildings   and   private

companies.  Therefore, many of the local artists are willing  to

donate their works, free of charge to MITA.  Of course, they  do

not wish to see the art works they donated being tucked away  in

the storeroom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have the privilege of visiting the Arts Museum of

Stanford University.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noticed that the university had openly encouraged private

companies to donate precious art works and antiques to them,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>

and  received very enthusiastic response.  From what I know, the

art  works  were permanently displayed in the arts  museum,  and

were  given  dedicated protection.  It is not  a  case  of  just

exhibiting for a short while and then tucked away in the cellar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, I hope that MITA could set up a Local Arts

Committee,  and  with the help of the NAC, to help  arrange  for

these  art  works  to  be  rotated and displayed  in  Government

departments  and  private  companies  for  open  exhibition  and

display.   In  this  way,  we can help to  encourage  our  local

artists  to  continue with the arts creation,  and at  the  same

time  allow  Singaporeans and visitors to view  these  authentic

works of our local talents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, arrangement should be made for masterpieces

previously donated by our older generation of artists and  local

collectors to be exhibited openly on a permanent basis, like the

arts  museum  at Stanford University.  This would  have  certain

encouraging  effects  on private companies and  individuals  who

wish to donate their art works in future.  It would also help to

prevent  some  precious collections from  being  lost  to  other

countries.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, the promotion of arts

needs,  amongst  other  things, strong financial  support.   The

economic  slowdown has affected many sectors.   Many  charitable

organisations have reported significant drop in their donations,

some  as much as 40%.  I am sure our arts groups must have  been

similarly  affected.   Corporate funding would  dry  up  if  the

economy does not improve.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.25 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask how badly has the National Arts Council's special

account  scheme  been affected?  While I can understand  private

sector funding will be drastically

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>

reduced,  I hope the Government will not slow down or  cut  back

public  sector funding for the arts.  In fact, if the Government

cannot  increase  the funding to make up for  the  shortfall  in

donations  from  the private sector, the minimum the  Government

can  do  is  to  sustain the existing level of funding  for  NAC

grants.   I  urge  the  Government to  seriously  consider  more

Government  funding  for the arts so as to help  strengthen  the

role and relevance of the arts in Singapore in the next century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, efforts should be made to bring the arts to the

masses.  There should be more outreach programmes for the  young

and old, as well as families and the working public to enjoy and

have  fun.  This can include more outdoor concerts in the parks,

neighbourhoods  and shopping centres as well as arts  activities

organised for residents at the constituencies.  MITA should work

closely with the Community Development Councils to promote  arts

on a shoestring budget and try to reach out to the HDB heartland

on  a  wider scale.  Community clubs could be encouraged to join

with  some arts groups and to excel in at least one of  the  art

forms.  The community clubs management committees could be  made

patrons to these arts groups, which can then be adopted  by  the

community  clubs  who can also help to support the  arts  groups

financially, besides providing a convenient venue to  house  the

arts groups.

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, Chinese

operas   in  Singapore  are  mainly  dialect-based  in  Teochew,

Cantonese, Hokkien and Hainanese.  The general impression  given

is  that  the majority of people in the audience are the  senior

citizens and these operas are performed mainly  during  the  7th

Moon  Festival.  However, the fact is, over the past  20  to  30

years,  Chinese opera in Singapore has evolved from  an  outdoor

wayang-type  of  performances  to indoor  theatres  and   school

auditoriums.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to records kept by the Singapore Chinese Opera

Institute, there

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>

were  a  total of some 2,500 performances of Chinese  operas  in

Singapore  in 1998.  Out of these, some 1,500 performances  took

place   during   the  7th  Moon  Festival.   The   other   1,000

performances  were  in  the  schools,  community   centres   and

theatres.  A good number of these performances took place at the

Victoria Theatre,  next door to our Parliament House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the senior citizens and middle-aged people, more and

more  young  people  are  attending such performances  nowadays.

Some even take part in the performances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent rise in support level for Chinese operas in

Singapore  can  be   attributed  to  two  reasons.  First,   the

establishment of the Singapore Chinese Opera Institute  in  1995

to  promote  Chinese  opera  in the schools  and  the  community

centres.   Secondly, we have a group of enthusiasts  who,  while

keeping  a low profile, have been contributing money,  time  and

efforts  to  support these theatre groups in their performances,

not   only  locally,  but  overseas  as  well.    The  Singapore

Federation of Clan Associations and other community groups  have

been  inviting  well-known artistes from  China  to  perform  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a lot of problems exist in the Chinese opera

theatres,  the people are continuing to help out  in  their  own

way.   I  believe that many of our Members here  have  seen  the

street  wayangs in the past.  I myself have enjoyed tremendously

watching  street wayangs and have learnt a lot of  lessons  from

there.   These  Chinese  operas  have  not  only  enriched   our

festivals  but  also our childhood.  It is also a  good  way  to

inculcate  in our people the traditional Chinese values.   There

are   a  lot  of  stories  that  teach  loyalty,  filial  piety,

benevolence and justice, and to show us how we could  deal  with

problems  in  times of crisis.  This is the type of  spirit   we

need, especially in the present crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that we should accord due recognition to these

enthusiasts  who have contributed greatly to the development  of

traditional Chinese operas in Singapore so

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>

as  to  encourage  more people to come forward  and  lend  their

support in this field.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In recent

years,  the  Government's main economic policy is  to  encourage

Singaporeans  to come forward and venture into business,  become

entrepreneurs  to  create more wealth for  our  people  and  our

nation.   Like many people I know, I am quite intrigued by  this

call by the Government.  Singapore is a market economy.  Do  our

entrepreneurs  need to be encouraged before they  come  out  and

make  big  money?   Have our people not enjoyed excellent  track

records in their business ventures all this while?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, please allow me to take this House on a tour outside

Singapore.   First,  we go to the famous Silicon  Valley.   Many

people  call  this  the "IC Valley".  IC, of course,  refers  to

Integrated  Circuit.  But many people say it  could  jolly  well

stand  for  Indians  and Chinese.  Why?   Because  many  of  the

scientists and businessmen who study, work and start enterprises

there are of Chinese and Indian origins.  In Silicon Valley, 23%

of  the  people were born outside the United States of  America.

The  culture they were exposed to during their early  years  was

not  American   culture,  but the various  cultures  from  their

native  countries.   When they were young,  the  education  they

received  could well be very traditional, and not what  we  call

"creative" nowadays.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we go to Vancouver, Canada. You will notice that 5%

to  10%  of  the businesses there are being run by the  Chinese.

Like  the  Silicon Valley, most of the Chinese there  came  from

Hong  Kong  and Taiwan. They publish their own newspapers,  have

their own shopping centres, television station, etc.  In a short

span of 10 to 20 years, they actually emerged from a society  of

white people, and opened up a whole new world of their own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us come back to Asia. There is no lack of

entrepreneurs  in Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, and Southeast  Asia.

In  the  area  of  high-tech industry,  Taiwan  is  particularly

outstanding, having

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>

performed  remarkably well.  In a short period of  20-odd  years

after  the cultural revolution, a good number of new enterprises

have  sprouted  in  mainland  China.   Their  entrepreneurs  are

enthusiastic,  far-sighted, daring to venture, and  hardworking.

When  our businessmen went to China to have dealings with  them,

we often have the feeling that we are inferior to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has a population of 4 million. Hong Kong's population

is  twice  that  of ours, while Taiwan is five times.   However,

among the successful entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, the number

of  those  who originated from Hong Kong and Taiwan is far,  far

more than ours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not talk about Chinese for the time being. In America's

Silicon  Valley  or  business  sector,  there  are  a   lot   of

outstanding Indian scientists and management experts.   Most  of

them are first or second-generation immigrants from India.  With

sharp  foresight and high education, they are able to seize  the

opportunities, catch on with the fast moving economic trend, and

eventually outshine others in various fields.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many philosophers and social scientists hold the view that

China's  Confucian  teachings  and  India's  Hinduism  are   not

positive  enough.   They resist science and technology,   regard

themselves  as infallible, and thus resulted in their  societies

not progressing with the times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not a sociologist, and I have no wish to challenge this

argument here.  However, the examples I cited above have already

proven  that  there are errors in their macroscopic  conclusion.

What they have seen are the results of historical evolution over

the  thousands  of  years in China and  India.   But  they  have

neglected  the  fact that these were the effects caused  by  the

monarchy  and government officials. Whether it was the  monarchy

who used the Confucian ideology to rule the nation or it was the

Confucian ideology that brought about the monarchy is  an  issue

which has been debated over

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>

and over since time immemorial without any conclusive outcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, looking at it from various angles, this ancient

cultural  ideology  does  have its  merits.   For  example,  the

Confucian  teachings advocate honouring the old  and  respecting

the  wise;  always  ready  to  help  in  a  worthy  cause;  good

neighbourliness  and  friendliness, spirit  of  magnanimity  and

resoluteness, honesty and faithfulness, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early days, Chinese immigrants to the various parts of

the  world  were  mostly  illiterate, but  they  all  came  from

families  of  Confucian  background.   From  young,  they   were

imperceptibly  influenced  by the traditional  consciousness  of

Confucianism which was deeply embedded in their youthful  minds.

So  when  they  went  overseas to  earn  a  living,  they  would

spontaneously follow the moral standards and ethics set down  by

the  Confucian teachings, and stick to them judiciously for  the

rest  of  their  lives.   This situation  includes  the  Straits

Chinese  or  Baba  which have settled down overseas  since  many

generations ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Confucianism has so much negative effects, then how do

you  explain  the  success stories of the Hong Kong  and  Taiwan

people in the United States.  The amount of Confucianism in them

is certainly more than that in us.  It cannot be less.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take our most successful entrepreneurs in the high-tech field,

Mr  Sim  Wong Hoo, for example.  Those days, with the  Confucian

teachings  in  him, he started off with $200 a  month,  suffered

hardship  and  persevered  in toil, knowledge-oriented,  learned

from  his mistakes, and brought up his Creative Technology  from

nothing to today's glamorous high-tech empire.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from Mr Sim, Singapore has no other more outstanding

example.   Personally,  I  feel that apart  from  the  education

system  and  the size of our domestic market, other factors  are

gradually  causing  Singapore to be  lacking  in  entrepreneurs.

One  of  the  factors  is the diluting  of  our  culture.   Many

youngsters

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>

today  can  be  said to be half-eastern and half-western.   They

have  not learnt the excellent oriental culture, nor the essence

of the Western culture.  On the one hand, they do not have their

ancestors'  virtues of being plain and simple,  hardworking  and

thrifty,  honouring  the old and respecting  the  wise,  keeping

one's word and having good faith.  On the other hand,  they  are

unable  to  emulate the creative and independent spirit  of  the

westerners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore hope that the Minister would seriously consider

this  problem.  If necessary, engage the services of experts  to

study  and  find out the respective merits and strong points  of

the  oriental and western cultures to educate the people through

our institutions of learning, community organisations and social

activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I hope that the Minister would study our kiasu culture,

and transform it into  a "win-win" culture.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, there has been some talk or opinion

that the next millennium in the 21st century will start only  in

the  year  2001, and not the year 2000.  May I ask the  Minister

what  is  the official view on this, and what is the  basis  for

this view?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that MITA is coordinating the millennium

celebration  this year to try to bring Singaporeans together  to

celebrate this occasion to usher in the new millennium.   May  I

ask  the Minister to unveil the celebration plan to this  House,

and also let the House know what amount of money is estimated to

be  spent on these celebrations?  What proportion will come from

the Government coffer?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the next subject matter on heritage projects, I do not

propose  to  speak,  as  I understand Mr Hawazi  Daipi  will  be

speaking on this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, six budget sittings ago, the

Minister  for Information and the Arts announced in  this  House

the  formation of a working group to look into the establishment

of a Malay Heritage Centre.  I believe MITA has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>

examined the working group's recommendations, and would like  to

ask  the Minister whether the Government has made a decision  on

the matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally think there is a need to set up a Malay Heritage

Centre  which  can be a centre of reference for  Malay  culture.

The  Malay community in Singapore originates from many different

parts of the region.  In the past, living in their own enclaves,

they showed distinct characteristics.  However, in the past  two

decades or so, with inter-marriages and lesser use of their  own

dialects or rather languages, the young Singaporeans from  these

Malay  sub-ethnic  background may not  be  aware  of  their  own

cultural  heritage.   The Malay Heritage  Centre,  if  and  when

established, could therefore be a reference centre for those who

want  to learn about and contribute to the understanding of  the

Malays  in  general and the Malay sub-ethnic  groups   -   their

history  of migration, languages and dialects as well  as  their

business and trade links.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minster a few basic questions. If MITA

supports  the  establishment of a Malay Heritage  Centre,  where

will  it  be located, who will run it, and what kind of  support

will the Government give to the Centre?

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, first of all, I must thank MITA and the

National  Heritage  Board  for the fine  work  it  has  done  in

Singapore.  Our museums are today better housed.  There are more

exhibits.  It is not only the local people who are visiting them

but also the foreigners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to touch on today is another issue. This is

trying  to  locate  our buildings of historical  interest,  both

commercial as well as residential buildings, where our  pioneers

had lived and many of our shophouses which used to house schools

in  Amoy Street and Tanjong Pagar.  I would urge MITA to explore

this.  Whether  it is school or clan association,  it  may  have

started  off as a small shophouse and today a high-rise building

may be there.  What I want the Minister to consider is a plaque,

which in fact they have already started doing.  It is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>

important for our children to know our history and this  process

could  be  easily attained if we follow some of the  suggestions

which I have told the House.

<br>4.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect which I would like the Minister to consider is

this.   Some  years back, the National Museum joined force  with

the Hindu Endowments Board to have the Deepavali celebrations on

a  Sunday with food and paintings, etc.  Because it was not well

publicised  very few tourists came.  But the tourists  who  came

were  really impressed.  I think it would be something  for  not

only  our  own students to see, but also the visitors  at  large

could  see  for themselves what Singapore has to offer.   May  I

urge  the  Minister  to consider this, even if  it  may  require

financial expenditure, but I think it is worthy of support.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, not

long  ago, the well-known Chinese calligrapher and poet, Mr  Pan

Shou,  passed away.  This is a great loss to the arts  community

in  Singapore.   His death has left an irreparable  gap  in  the

field  of  calligraphy  in  Singapore.   We  have  also  lost  a

"National  Treasure"  in  the arts. The  works  of  a  "National

Treasure" like Pan Shou should be treasured by the State.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pan Shou cannot be resurrected or born again. Whatever he has

left behind, his calligraphy and poems should be treasured by us

very  dearly.   Many  of us, especially the  lovers  of  Chinese

calligraphy,  have  expressed the hope that  the  representative

works of Pan Shou should be systematically kept and preserved by

the State as our arts assets for posterity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am thinking not only of Pan Shou but also other

"National   Treasure"   class  artists  in   Singapore.    Their

representative works should be collected and carefully kept in a

systematic  manner.  May I suggest that our National  Museum  or

Arts Museum set up a special exhibition

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>

room  or  hall  for the display of the representative  works  of

these  "National Treasures".  Since they are national treasures,

their works of art should be regarded as part and parcel of  our

arts  assets  of  the  State.  By having this  sort  of  special

display  or  exhibition hall, we can avoid having  our  artists'

treasured  works being lost to other countries.   It would  also

provide  the opportunity for young Singaporeans and tourists  to

view  the  representative works of our masters in arts.   By  so

doing,  it  will  also  gradually  and  eventually  enrich   the

collection of our museum.  If we have such a plan in place, I am

quite  sure  will get the support from our local  collectors  to

donate their collections to the museum.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I wish to speak on this National Red

Lion  head that we have.  This Red Lion icon that we have  is  a

National  Day symbol and I wish to ask for it to be  made  as  a

national symbol protected by the law, just as the State crest or

the State flag and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons for this is that the icon has become a

very familiar sight among the public in Singapore and it has  in

fact  become associated in a large part with what we do whenever

we  have  a national event.  It is in fact even more well  known

than the Merlion icon, which in the early days had been used  to

represent Singapore.  It was, as I said yesterday in this House,

a  very recent invention and, in fact, very much related to  the

tourism  industry, so that now it is more an icon  of  Singapore

tourism than an icon of nation itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a lion city and the Red Lion head has done well. It

has  done  so well, in fact, that CASE actually went  after  one

unscrupulous  renovation  contractor.   We  found   that   their

letterhead had the Red Lion icon and a logo that looks  somewhat

like  the HDB logo.  And they were telling people in that estate

and  several  estates in Singapore that they were implying  that

they  were HDB renovation contractors engaged by HDB  to  do  an

upgrading programme, and they said, "Please sign up by today, or

else  you  are  forever  out  of the upgrading  programme."   We

realise

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>

that a lot of people were taken in because when they saw the Red

Lion  icon  and thought it was really a Government agency,  they

therefore had to respond.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is one of the reasons why I think a national icon

like  this should be protected.  And I think it has done a  very

good  job  in  identifying  Singapore and  Singapore's  national

events.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, following calls by Members of

this  House  in  the  past  to  develop  the  film  industry  in

Singapore,  the  Government last year set up the Singapore  Film

Commission.   I understand the Commission's task is to  nurture,

support  and  promote  Singapore  talent  in  film-making,   the

production of Singapore movies and films and the development  of

our  film  industry  in Singapore.  With the recent  success  of

locally  produced movies like Liang Po Po, Money No  Enough  and

Forever  Fever,  the  demand  for  local  movies  has  increased

markedly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should now accelerate and step up the

development  of our local movie and film industry.  I  therefore

wish   to  ask  the  Minister  what  plans  the  Singapore  Film

Commission has to meet its challenges ahead and how soon can our

local  movies reach a standard comparable to the better ones  in

Hong Kong, Taiwan and even the PRC.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, before I speak on the issue, I

share  the sentiments of Dr Toh See Kiat on the Red Lion  and  I

hope that the Minister would give consideration.  After all,  we

are a Lion City, Singa.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move on to films. The Singapore Film Commission has

come into existence.  It is good.  It is just not enough for  us

to  nurture the film industry here.  Recently I was in Australia

and  I  was surprised how the Australians were trying to set  up

their  own  film industry and the Americans were  interested  in

setting  up a studio there.  In fact, Indian film producers  are

sending  their crew to Australia.  Then I found to  my  surprise

that  they had also been to Singapore.  And for Hindi and  Tamil

films, they sometimes come here for shooting.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me share with the House an anecdote which somebody told me.

They  saw a Hindi picture with a Singapore scene, and they  were

so  attracted that they sent a crew to visit some of the  spots.

This, of course, is a good selling point for us.  But what would

be more interesting is if we could develop the facilities as one-shop facilities where we offer tax incentives and what-nots.   I

think  Singapore, being located strategically,  has  advantages.

Because even Mauritius, which is far away, the Indian film  crew

are going in.  Bear in mind that the Indian film industry is one

of  the biggest in the world.  I think we should look at it  not

just artistically but also its commercial viability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, two weeks back, somebody told me that there was a

shooting done here by an Indian film company.  But I think  more

must  be  done.  Probably our High Commission and other agencies

there could work it out.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in the past one year,

our    newspapers,  television  and  radio,  and   even   senior

Government officers, have openly supported the development of  a

film industry in Singapore.  As a matter of fact, the local film

industry has enjoyed great results during the past one year.  It

is  true  that we do have excellent local talents  in  the  film

industry  but,  more importantly, there is enthusiastic  support

from  various  quarters.  Singaporeans find a  strong  sense  of

identity  with  the  local films.  I  think  this  is  the  most

important  factor  contributing to the  recent  locally-produced

films.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note that TCS has done a lot to help the

development  of our local film industry.  When I went  to  watch

Jack  Neo's  Money  No Enough and Liang Po Po  -  The  Movie,  I

noticed that some famous artistes from TCS, like Zoe Tay and Kym

Ng,  had  made guest appearances in the films.  This illustrates

TCS'  sense  of  identity  with our local  productions  and  its

support  for the local film industry.  It is heartening to  note

that  TCS  has acted pro-actively to promote the development  of

the film industry in Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five years ago, many people would have thought that it was

impossible. In the past, TCS was only concerned with  protecting

itself and would try its best to avoid its competitors.  But now

TCS has changed for the better.  I notice that TCS has used some

photographs taken from Liang Po Po - The Movie  on the cover  of

its   Radio  and  TV  weekly,  and  was  giving  away  some  250

complimentary tickets to its readers.  Inside the magazine there

were  11  pages of coloured photographs to introduce this  film.

This shows that TCS has given great publicity and support to the

local  films,  and by doing so it will help the local  films  to

grow steadily and rapidly in Singapore.  Without the support  of

the  newspapers,  TV and the people, I do not think  they  would

have achieved such a marvellous box office record.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to commend MITA and TCS for being so open-minded in

helping  the development of our local film industry.   With  its

own  financial resources, skills and technology,  TCS  is   well

capable  of  producing its own local movies  and  even  gung  fu

films.    I   believe  there  is  a  steady  market  for   these

productions.   Of  course, when TCS wants  to  produce  its  own

movies,  it  should select some themes or subject matters  which

are  different from those of other local films.  Then there will

be  some very healthy competition.  By doing so, it will open up

a new phase of development of the film industry in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the number of locally produced movies is still very

limited.   If TCS can participate in this field and can  satisfy

the  demands  of our local audiences, it will go a long  way  to

promote  the  growth of our local film industry.  I  hope  that,

very soon, films produced by TCS can have an important place  in

the  international film arena, and perhaps win an Oscar one day.

I hope that MITA will encourage TCS to take on this challenge.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Seng Han Thong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> I am not speaking, Sir.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, the face of Singapore TV has changed

tremendously  over  the  years.   In  the  early  days,  our  TV

producers   in   the   then   SBC,  or  Singapore   Broadcasting

Corporation, concentrated on producing local documentaries, news

and  current affairs programmes.  Entertainment programmes  were

largely  imported.   Today,  our local  TV  stations  have  been

corporatised.  Thus, they are largely accountable for their  own

resources and the need to remain commercially viable.  I do  not

envy the management of these local TV stations.  Their jobs  are

onerous.  This is made worse by the increased competition  posed

by  some  30  channels  from Singapore Cable  Vision.   And  the

easiest  way  out  for  our  local TV  stations  is  to  acquire

programmes from abroad and to repeat these programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not to say that our local TV stations have not been

producing  local  programmes.  Indeed, they  have  been.   Since

corporatisation, local productions from TCS have grown markedly.

However, as a commercial organisation and with its focus on  the

bottomline,  TCS may sacrifice quality for quantity.   Moreover,

with  intense competition to be posed by SCV, when the cable  TV

project linking up the whole island is completed by end of  this

year, our local TV station may be forced to change strategies to

remain viable and forget about its nation building role.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a national objective, our local TVs have to carry or

produce  local  programmes to promote our culture,  arts,  value

system, current affairs, local politics, info-education and even

programmes  to reflect our multi-racial society.  They  have  to

manage  the requirements and sensitivities across the age groups

catering for children's television as well as the needs  of  our

retirees.   I  wish  to ask the Minister how are  our  local  TV

stations  coping  with  the challenges ahead  and  if  he  would

reassure  this  House  that there will  be  more  quality  local

programmes  on our local TV stations, ie, Channel 5, Channel  8,

Prime 12, Premiere 12 and now Channel News Asia.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister if

our  local  media could stay relevant in the light of  increased

proliferations of foreign media in Singapore and easy access  by

Singaporeans.  It is undoubted that, for Singapore to succeed as

a  knowledge-based economy, access to information  is  critical.

The  impact  of foreign media reporting on current  affairs  and

news  on  our  underlying societal values and political  systems

could be anathema to the values that we uphold.  This is because

the  foreign media, unlike our local media or TV stations,  have

no  obligations  to  support or reflect the national  objectives

highlighted earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the playing field is therefore not level. My concern

specifically is whilst our local news network presently  upholds

the  principle of giving election air-time to political  parties

in  proportion  to  the  strength of  their  participation,  the

foreign media has no such constraint.  Indeed, we have witnessed

many interviews from CNBC and BBC with some populist politicians

in  Singapore  of late for frivolous causes.  This principle  of

fair  election air-time will no doubt come under pressure  since

foreign  networks  with different sympathies  could  simply  air

interviews  and  programmes which our local citizens  have  free

access to.  In order to compete, our local network, media and TV

stations  may  be  under  pressure  to  abandon  this  long-held

principle of fairness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would also like to avoid the situation in Malaysia where

the  circulation  of Utusan Malaysia actually fell  dramatically

during  the  early days when Mr Anwar was arrested, as  distrust

for local media in Malaysia had led to a lot of Malaysians going

to  the  Internet and foreign media.  I would like  to  ask  the

Minister if he has any comments or plans to ensure that national

objectives and long held values by Singaporeans can continue  to

be reflected in our broadcasters' selection of programmes in the

face of uneven competition posed by the foreign media.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I must, at the outset, declare my

interest.  I am a member of the Indian Programmes Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will confine my remarks to the Indian programmes,

namely, Tamil.  It would be dishonest not to say that the Indian

programmes  have improved considerably.  But there is  room  for

improvement, especially in view of the competition that is faced

by  cable television from both SUN and ZEE.  I know some  people

are saying that this should be closed.  I would ask the Minister

not  to  do  so because there is no other Hindi programme  other

than  film.  We should continue.  In fact, we should have  more,

so that people have more choices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one danger. Many older viewers tend to

identify with politics in India and they watch Indian programmes

because  our Tamil programmes are very limited.  So many viewers

have  the opportunity of tuning to these channels.  May  I  urge

the  Minister to consider, first of all, increasing the air-time

of  the  Tamil programmes and also to have more current  affairs

programme.   It is very important for the Indians in  Singapore,

Singapore  Indians  I  would say, to have a  programme  that  is

tailored  to their needs and not depend too much on  the  Indian

programmes because their values are quite different.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are trying to build a multi-racial society and it is very

important  that the Tamil programmes should cover not  just  the

Indian programmes but the Chinese and Malay programmes as  well.

It  is very important for the Indian community to get a feel  of

the  other  communities as well if we have to build  a  national

consciousness.   I  feel strongly on this  issue  and  urge  the

Minister  to  give some thought to it.  I know that  finance  is

limited and the figure he is going to cite is, "We have only  7%

and  so we cannot give you more."  But I think we must not think

just   in  terms  of  digits,  but  in  terms  of  the  national

consciousness.  I hope the Minister will consider my proposal.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin:</b> Sir, TCS launched a new free air channel on

1st March to provide

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>

news when you want and where you want it.  With this new channel

providing different market views from TCS, CNN and others, there

is a potential to develop a regional audience for regional news.

Reliable   information   for  informed  business   decision   is

important.  During this economic crisis, there is an urgent need

for  more  accurate  news and different news  perspective.   For

example,  the western media reports on China are always  on  the

viewpoint  of  human rights and unrest in Tibet.   But  news  in

China  is  more  than  just  Tibet.  Businessmen  will  be  more

interested  in  matters  such  as possible  devaluation  of  the

Renminbi,   economic  changes  in  China   or   new   investment

regulations from Beijing.  Channel News Asia is therefore a much

welcome  change.  This channel also has the potential to develop

into  a  much sought after channel by the international business

community.  Currently, a number of areas still have difficulties

in receiving Channel News Asia.  Right within my own division of

Toa  Payoh  East, 22 blocks of HDB apartments are  not  able  to

receive  this channel.  It is not just HDB estates  but  private

estates  are  also affected.  What measures would  be  taken  to

rectify this problem?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the glut of satellite transponders that are now

readily  available, TCS should consider expanding  Channel  News

Asia to satellite transmission and really establish Singapore as

a  regional  news  broadcasting  centre.   It  will  also  allow

Singaporeans based overseas to keep in touch with reliable  news

reports  of events happening back home.  Can I ask the  Minister

for his views on the future development of Channel News Asia and

whether establishing Channel News Asia requires more grants from

the Government?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a need to provide certain product

differentiation  between  regional news  and  local  news.   The

question  then  is the quality of newscaster that is  available.

Is there a sufficient number and, if not, what measures will the

Government take to improve this?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, Channel News Asia is broadcast only in

English.   Has  TCS  studied the feasibility  of  setting  up  a

similar Mandarin channel?  The information available will be  of

great significance to the Chinese-speaking business community as

well.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, a while ago, I heard Mr Chew Heng

Ching expressing his concern and worry that Singaporeans may  be

exposed to too much opposition opinions from external television

channels  that  are  now  accessible  to  Singaporeans  who  are

connected to the cable network.  I wish to assure him that there

is  no  need for him to worry about such influence because  this

Government,  the PAP Government, will know how to  control  such

influence directly or indirectly and to ensure that at least  it

is not easy for Mr Chew, because of the influence, that he might

lose his seat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are various ways that the Government could

influence the stations although they might be plugged  into  the

cable  network.   There  is  the granting  of  licence  and  the

question of whether or not they will be accessible to the  cable

network.   Similarly, the same goes to foreign  publications  in

Singapore.   The  Government deals with foreign publications  by

influencing them on how to report or what to report.  Otherwise,

they  may  be  banned  or their circulation will  be  curtailed.

Anyway,  I  do not think that there is a cause for  Mr  Chew  to

worry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that, although Singapore Cable Vision is

a  private  firm, some of the major shareholders are Government-linked  companies  and  I also understand  that  the  Government

intends  to use the cable system for the Singapore ONE  national

IT  project.  With this backdrop in mind, I wonder whether it is

the  Government's intention to force all Singaporeans to use the

cable network.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a concern among those who do not intend to connect

to  the  cable network that the television stations may one  day

decide  not  to transmit signals via the air wave.  Thereby  the

traditional mode of receiving TV programmes via the antenna

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>

system  will  become obsolete and indirectly force  everyone  in

Singapore who wishes to watch television to connect to the cable

network.   I  would therefore like the Government to  state  its

position on the matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that those who live in landed property will

have  to pay a yearly maintenance fee to Singapore Cable  Vision

under the connection agreement. If one wishes to continue to use

the cable network to receive those non-paying channels, like the

HDB  flat dwellers, after they have paid for the laying  of  the

cable infrastructure, I would like to know what is the rationale

for imposing such a fee which is subject to revision by SCV.   I

would  also like to know whether the Minister thinks it is  fair

for  SCV  to  impose  such  a  fee  for  maintaining  the  cable

infrastructure after asking the residents to pay for the  laying

of  the  cable infrastructure in the first place.  I  understand

people who live in HDB flats need not pay the maintenance fee.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would like to

continue  my focus on regulation in the examination  of  whether

deregulation could result in lower cost.  Singapore  ONE  is  an

exciting new infrastructure which, when fully operational,  will

thrust  Singapore into the information age.  There are two  ways

to  access Singapore ONE, either through SingTel ADSL network or

through  Singapore  Cable  Vision  cable  network.   SCV's  $500

million nation-wide cable network is expected to be completed by

September this year, three months ahead of schedule.  All  these

are commendable achievements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to seek clarification with regard to four aspects.

First,  this  is  the first time in Singapore's history  that  a

nation-wide  infrastructure  has been  installed  by  a  private

company and not by a Government agency.  I would like to ask the

Minister to elaborate on why this is the case.  What aspects  of

the   company,  that  is,  the  Government  and  presumably  SBA

regulate,  and  how much subsidy is involved in  developing  the

cable network, if at all?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, what I find uncomfortable is that SCV is the monopoly

provider  of access to TV channels, such as CNN, CNBC, Discovery

Channel, and so on.  Singaporeans do not have a choice  in  this

matter because satellite dishes are not allowed in Singapore.  I

have  no alternative but to subscribe to SCV if I want to  watch

CNN  or  Discovery Channel.  The question I have is:  would  the

price  be  reduced and service improved if indeed there  was  an

alternative  provider to cable television than  just  SCV?   For

example,  could  not SingTel ADSL network provide  the  same  TV

quality services so that consumers have a choice whether

they wish to subscribe to Magix or to SCV?

<br>5.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there is also the issue of the hook-up fee. I

understand that the hook-up fee is based on the cost for service

principles.  Since it costs more to roll out the cable to landed

homes,  landed  homes pay more.  I subscribe to this  principle.

What  I  find  difficult in understanding is, however,  how  the

rates  are arrived at and why there is such a large differential

between HDB flats on the one hand which pay nothing for the hook-up,  and landed properties which pay up to about $6,000 for  the

hook-up  fee?  My question here is: is there also the  principle

of  the  ability  to  pay used in terms of charging?   In  other

words,  in  terms of charging $6,000 for landed  properties,  is

there a sense that because landed property owners can afford it,

so therefore they should pay more?  Or is it merely based on the

issue of cost for service?  Does it cost that much more to  roll

out  a  cable to a landed property home compared to a HDB  flat,

private condominiums and so on?  I would like to ask whether  it

is  true indeed that there was a Government grant to SCV to wire

about  7,000  HDB blocks but no grant for private  flats  and  I

presume no grants for landed properties.  This was a point which

was  mentioned during last year's debate.  And if this is indeed

true, what is the size of the grant and why is it this grant was

not granted across the board to all households, and why only  to

HDB flats?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the take-up rate for cable television as at end

January 1999 was 18.5%.  After having made the entire nation

cable ready, it would be a pity if only one in five homes were

actually hooked up and it will be worthwhile to find out why the

other four homes have not subscribed up to this point.  The aim

should be a 100% take-up rate either by cable or ADSL in the

near future.  Then, only then will Singapore ONE become a

reality.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Information and the Arts (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Sir, Mr Chew Heng Ching spoke of the competition

posed  by  SCV  and the foreign broadcasters  to  our  local  TV

stations.   I  notice that Mr Low Thia Khiang took  a  diferring

position.   Our  local  broadcasters are  keenly  aware  of  the

competition.  In fact, we saw it coming, which was why we forced

the  corporatisation of SBC, preparing it for  long-term  future

privatisation.   We  knew  we  have  to  compete  in  a   fierce

environment.   So  TCS  and  STV  12  gave  emphasis  to   local

programming and I am glad to report to this House that  so  far,

Channels  5,  8  and Prime 12 have been able to  maintain  their

dominant  anchor  positions in the minds of Singaporeans.   Many

Singaporeans  who  are cabled up tell me that even  though  they

have  30  or 40 channels, somehow they still find most attracted

to  our  English, Chinese, Malay programming, and  to  a  lesser

extent,  our Indian programming.  I think that is a  good  sign.

They  are,  by  no  means, there yet.  They  have  got  to  keep

plugging  away  and  make sure that they maintain  those  anchor

positions  because  that is crucial to the preservation  of  our

identity as Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Malay and Tamil broadcastings clash and

compete  for prime time on Prime 12.  And because of this,  MITA

has decided that by the end of this year, we will separate Malay

programming out to a separate channel.   STV 12 will  set  up  a

separate Malay channel so that Malay and Indian programming will

no longer have to compete for prime slots as they now do.  Malay

programming will remain on Prime 12, and its hours will increase

from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>

36.5  hours  per week to 43.5 hours.  We would then move  Indian

programming to a new channel which will enjoy an additional  5.5

hours  per  week of prime time.  This will go some  way  towards

answering some of Mr Rai's concerns.  As to whether we can  pump

more  public monies, which are licence fees plus the  15%  grant

from  the Finance Ministry to Indian programming, I do not think

we  can justify it because this is really a zero sum game.  More

money   for  Indian  programming  means  less  money  for  Malay

programming   or   Chinese  programming   and   already   Indian

programming on television and radio receives a disaproportionate

share of public funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our TV stations have also gone into new multimedia

platforms like Internet and exploring the early introduction  of

digital  television.   Their  websites  are  very  popular   and

accessed by Singaporeans and foreigners all over the world.  TCS

and  STV  12  are committed to recruiting the best  broadcasting

professionals  from  around the world.   Our  TV  networks  will

continue with these strategies to remain competitive.  Singapore

International  Media,  which  is  a  holding  company,  is   now

reviewing its organisational structure to see how it can  better

position   our   TV  stations  for  an  even  more   competitive

environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to Mr Chew Heng Ching, on the concerns which Mr

Low said should not exist, I agree with Mr Chew that we must  be

watchful  that  the proliferation of foreign channels  does  not

prevent  us from developing our own identity.  When we  look  at

the  way  the foreign channels have become part of the  domestic

politics in Malaysia and Indonesia, I think we should worry  for

ourselves.   If  we are not careful, foreign broadcasters,  like

foreign  newspapers, can undermine some of our social and  other

policies,  for  example, our advertising  standards,  our  anti-smoking campaign and even our censorship norms.  A few may  even

be  tempted  to  interfere  in  Singapore's  domestic  politics,

especially before a general election.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we have always insisted on the Government's right of

reply for newspapers and broadcasters which target Singaporeans.

But  we  are  a media and broadcasting hub and we are  marketing

ourselves  to  be  such  a  hub,  and  in  recent  years,   many

international  broadcasters have located  here.   Therefore,  we

should  impose  minimal  conditions  on  transmissions  out   of

Singapore  because it is not for us to impose our  standards  on

other people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for transmissions which are relayed to Singapore

households, such as those channels which are now carried by SCV,

and  later  by many other service providers as well,  we  should

require  of  them  the  same standards as  we  impose  on  local

broadcasters.   For example, if you cannot advertise  cigarettes

on Channel 5 and 8, you should not be allowed to do so either on

a  foreign  channel carried by SCV or on Magix.   Those  foreign

channels  which have few local viewers should not  interest  us.

Thus, SBA takes little notice of the occasional nude scenes that

you find on French Channel 5 which is on SCV.  But channels with

significant  local  audiences must be  put  on  the  same  level

playing field and, during election time, the rule of campaigning

must  apply to these channels as they apply to TCS and  STV  12.

Otherwise,  some  candidates may be  tempted  to  lobby  foreign

channels or even to buy air-time from them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulatory framework for local broadcasters is, of

course,  not static.  With digitisation and the availability  of

bandwidth, we have to adjust our position all the time, which we

have  done.   We have to flow with the tide in order  to  retain

some  freedom  for  ourselves.  We have to  maintain  a  certain

degree  of  autonomy and find our own separate identity  in  the

world, which we must if we are to remain competitive and  be  of

service  to  others.  Some people think that IT will  eventually

make all of us Americans one day.  I doubt it.  Yes, others also

face  the  same  challenge, like the French,  the  Germans,  the

Japanese and the Chinese.  But they are determined they will  be

themselves and retain their own separate identities and I  think

we should do so too.  But we can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>

only do so by skilfully moving with the technology, not by being

reactionary.   And  those Asian countries  which  cling  to  old

positions  rigidly will be undermined and will be  swept  aside.

But we have got to play this game in a smarter way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Tsao Yuan today and Mr Low Thia Khiang and many

others during the MND debate asked many questions about SCV  and

why  is  it HDB flat owners are cabled up for free while  others

have  to pay some money.  Dr Lee Tsao Yuan asked why it was  SCV

and  not  the Government who laid our cable network.  She  asked

what  aspects  of SCV SBA regulates and how much  subsidies  are

involved  in  laying the cable network.  She also asked  whether

there  will  be an alternative provider to SCV.  She also  asked

why  SCV imposes different connection charges for HDB flats  and

private property owners.  Because of the great interest shown in

this House at this Budget debate on SCV, I would like to make  a

detailed clarification of the issues raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, the Government agreed to let SCV lay an advanced

island-wide cable network by 1st January 2000, in return  for  a

limited 7-year monopoly on cable TV which will end in June 2002.

This  network is an important national infrastructure that could

be  used  not  only  for  cable  TV  but  also  for  interactive

multimedia services.  Because of technological and market risks,

the  Government  decided  that Singapore's  interests  are  best

served  by  having the project commercially driven.  Because  we

will not know how the technologies will change, how the policies

will  change, what new trends and new products will come to  be,

it was better from the start to make it a commercial undertaking

than to develop it as a national infrastructure project.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alternative of managing it as public infrastructure

would  have  made  it much less responsive to technological  and

market  changes.  So, a private company was chosen  to  lay  the

infrastructure and provide services on a commercial basis.   The

shareholders are SIM, SPH, Singapore Technologies and Media  One

International, which is the third largest cable operator in  the

US.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBA regulates SCV on its cable roll-out plan, programming

standards, customer service and inter-connection issues but  not

the details of SCV subscription rates and cabling charges, which

are quite complex.  While SCV has been given exclusive franchise

in the provision of subscription TV, this exclusivity is limited

both  in  scope  and  in duration.  Let me  explain.   As  a  TV

distributor,  SCV faces strong competition from the  terrestrial

channels  provided by the SIM group of companies.  SBA  requires

it  to carry most of the terrestrial channels for free, which is

an  unusual  practice in the cable TV business.   SBA  has  also

allowed  SingTel  to offer video on demand and  other  broadband

services  like  Magix.  SCV's monopoly position is  therefore  a

limited  one.   SCV's exclusive franchise is  for  7  years,  in

exchange for which it is required to wire up the entire  island,

regardless of take-up by Singaporeans.  In some countries,  such

as  in  the  US,  cable operators may be given up  to  15  years

exclusive franchise for cabling up households above the  ground.

SCV  is  required to lay all cables underground which makes  the

undertaking much more costly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCV is aware from the very outset that its financial outlay will

be  considerable while its monopoly position is short.  It knows

that  when its franchise ends in June 2002, the Government  will

be  allowing  other  subscription TV services,  both  wired  and

wireless,  including satellite, to operate here.  SCV  therefore

cannot  be  complacent and its strategy is therefore to  attract

subscribers for the long term.  Only if there are many long-term

subscribers can SCV hope to recover its investment  and  make  a

decent  return  on  shareholders' capital.  SCV  must  therefore

charge  cable  TV in a way which could win it a  large  base  of

loyal long-term customers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of cabling varies with the dwelling type. Hence, HDB

flats are cheaper to cable up than private highrise which are in

turn  cheaper  than  landed properties.  For landed  properties,

again it varies, whether it is a terrace or bungalow.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>

SCV's cost of cabling up all HDB flats amounted to $242 million.

They  receive $60 million from HDB, being the amount  HDB  would

have  to  pay itself had it continued maintaining and  upgrading

its  existing central antenna system in HDB estates. This  comes

with the flat, and HDB has an obligation to provide and maintain

it  and  upgrade  it from time to time when new channels  become

available.  What HDB has done is to pass this buck to SCV and to

pay  SCV  the  amount it calculates it has to pay anyway  if  it

undertook the responsibility for itself.

<br>5.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither HDB nor the Government subsidises SCV for cabling

the  estates.   SCV decided that the difference of $182  million

was  worth  incurring  because of the advantage  the  large  HDB

customer  base would give it over future competitors  after  its

monopoly ends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Condominium dwellers pay a rate of $150 for the first cable

point  or  $240  for the first two cable points.   The  cost  of

external wiring amounting to some $25 million is absorbed  fully

by SCV.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the cabling of landed properties, SCV decided to divide them

into  two groups.  There are some 55,000 units, mostly terraces,

semi-detached houses and small bungalows, which are  located  in

or  near mixed neighbourhoods, and they are near the main  cable

tap off points, so that they are easier to wire up.  SCV's cost,

on  average, of cabling each of these homes, regardless of take-up,  is  about $2,300.  This means that if one out of two  homes

subscribes  to SCV, the cost of laying the cable per  subscriber

is  $4,600,  compared  to  the  $2,300  which  SCV  charges  per

household.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another group of some 5,000 bungalows located in low-density areas further away from the main cable tap off points.

The  cost  of cabling such homes on average is $8,000 per  unit,

again  regardless of the take-up.  And if one in  two  bungalows

subscribes,  the  cost to cable each bungalow subscriber  is  in

fact $16,000, because you have to go a long

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>

way  to reach one home.  But in order to make it more attractive

for these households to subscribe, SCV decided to charge each of

these households about $6,000 in 2- or 3-year instalments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost to SCV of cabling up all landed properties is $177

million.  Hence, at a 50% take-up rate, SCV would have  to  bear

some  $97  million  in  cabling costs for landed  properties  in

Singapore.   It  is  therefore  completely  untrue  that  landed

property owners are subsidising condominium or HDB flat  owners.

SCV has decided to absorb a higher loss per household for landed

properties as it believes that the take-up rate will  be  higher

among  such households.  And this in fact has been borne out  by

their  experience.   According to SCV, the  actual  subscription

rate  is about 18% for HDB homes, less for 2- and 3-rooms,  more

for  4-  and 5-rooms and Executive flats; 35% for private  high-rise  homes and about 40% for landed estates.  This is  actually

an  encouraging figure, given that our cable TV service  started

only  in  1995.  As a comparison, Hong Kong, which  started  its

cable service  in 1993 has a take-up rate of 24%.  In the US, it

took 50 years to reach a 70% take-up rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not have been desirable for SBA to regulate the prices

charged  by  SCV.   Too  many factors were  involved,  too  many

assumptions would have to be made.  SBA could at best  have  set

ceiling rates based on infrastructural cost recovery, but  as  I

have  explained,  SCV's  charges are well below  infrastructural

cost recovery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By September this year, SCV would have cabled up every home in

Singapore.   For  landed property, this means  a  cable  to  the

curbside.   SCV would then position itself to take advantage  of

the broadband network SCV has laid, which is a valuable asset to

SCV.  Hence,  in  addition to subscription TV,  SCV  is  working

towards  the  commercial launch this year of a  high-speed  data

service  on cable modems, sometime at the end of this year.   It

is  also  working  towards the provision of  broadband  services

including integrated Internet telephony, video e-mail and video

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>

conferencing,  and all these will help to make Singapore  an  IT

hub  in this part of the world.  This is from the Government and

the public perspective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From SCV's perspective, however, it is still not clear at all

whether or not it will make money.  When it negotiated the terms

of  the  deal with the Government, Internet was not  yet  a  big

factor.   Now  it is, and all the calculations would  have  been

quite different had they known of Internet coming.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, all kinds of digital services provided by

different companies will be in fierce competition, and SCV  will

be one of many such competitors.  I would also like to assure Mr

Low  Thia  Khiang that even after Singapore has been  wired  up,

free-to-air broadcast will continue because many of  us  are  on

the  move,  in  trains, cars, buses.  There will  be  wristwatch

television sets or we may be in a boat.  We may be in  Johor  or

Batam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho Tat Kin welcomed the launch of Channel News Asia, but

mentioned   the reception problem faced by some of his residents

in  Toa  Payoh East.  The vast majority of Singapore  homes  are

connected  to the cable network and can already receive  Channel

News  Asia  on  Channel 6.  There are, however,  about  800  HDB

blocks which are unable to get Channel News Asia for up to three

months,  because they are either at the tail-end of  cabling  or

undergoing  HDB upgrading works.  SCV and HDB are  working  very

hard  to  complete all the necessary work as soon  as  possible.

TCS  is  also  working with the management of private  high-rise

homes on facilitating reception of Channel News Asia.  Residents

of  landed  homes can seek assistance from TCS if they encounter

difficulties in receiving the new channel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho also asked whether CNA intends to go regional. CNA hopes

to  go  up  on  satellite within a year if there is  a  regional

market,   which  I  think  there  should  be.    The   Singapore

International  Foundation is also interested in folding  all  or

part of Singapore international TV into Channel News Asia if  it

goes regional.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for setting up a similar channel in Mandarin, TCS will

consider it at a later stage if the commercial case for  such  a

channel   is  strong.   Channel  News  Asia  does  not   receive

additional funding from SBA for establishing this news  service.

So it is a commercial undertaking by TCS and the Government will

not bail it out if it turns out to be a failure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi asked about the plan to establish the Malay Heritage

Centre at Kampong Glam.  I have on a number of occasions in this

House mentioned that the Government would like to see the Istana

at  Kampong Glam converted into a Malay Heritage Centre.  In May

1993  during  the Budget debate, I informed the  House  that  Mr

Ridzwan  Dzafir was chairing a working group to look into  this.

The  working  group  subsequently made its  recommendations  and

since  then,  we  have had discussions with  various  Government

agencies.   And I am glad to now announce to the House  that  we

are  able  to  take  concrete  steps towards  establishing  this

Centre.   It  has taken us some time but it has been  worth  the

wait.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MITA will soon establish a Foundation to develop the Malay

Heritage  Centre.   We  will  invite  leaders  from  the   Malay

community  and others who are able to contribute to  take  part.

Mr  Ridzwan Dzafir has kindly agreed to be the Chairman  of  the

Foundation, and I do not think that we could have found a better

man  for  the job.  He is a Boyanese himself.  He told  me  once

that the island where his ancestors came from, Pulau Bawaen,  in

the Java Sea, has a little kampong called Sangapura, named after

Singapore, because of the large number of Boyanese who  migrated

to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Foundation should aim to deepen our awareness of the history

and culture of the Malays, and this heritage belongs not only to

the  Malay community but to all Singaporeans, to all of us.   In

this  effort, we should take a wider view of the history of  the

Malays  in  the region and how the Malay community in  Singapore

has come to be.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will provide two buildings in Kampong Glam for

the  Foundation to house the Centre, the Istana Kampong Glam  as

well as the building next to it, which is known as the Bendahara

House.   The Government has just gazetted Bendahara House  today

for  acquisition for this purpose.  The Istana Kampong Glam,  on

the  other hand, is State property, and has been so since  1897.

The  Government  will  first  restore  and  conserve  these  two

historic buildings.  MITA will bear the renovation costs.  After

restoration  in  about 2-3 years' time, the  buildings  will  be

handed over to the Foundation to run.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have announced to this House some years ago, the Government

will  provide a dollar-for-dollar matching grant  of  up  to  $2

million  for  the  establishment of a Heritage Centre  Endowment

Fund.  The Foundation will be encouraged to generate revenue  of

its  own  and  to raise funds from corporate sponsors  and  from

individuals.   Support  for  the  Foundation  from   the   Malay

community will be crucial to its success.  And we hope that this

Centre, when it is completed, will be a vibrant place which will

engage  Singaporeans and show the diversity of our  heritage  to

the  world.  It should become one of our cultural anchor points,

and it should also bring back life and activity to Kampong Glam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of the Centre should reflect the history of

Kampong Glam. Being the seat of Malay royalty, it existed before

Raffles  arrived.  After 1819, the Malay community in  Singapore

grew  rapidly  and  included  Arabs,  Indians,  Indian  Muslims,

Javanese,  Buginese, Banjaris, Boyanese and others.  And  indeed

the  sense of a mixed community with diverse heritage  is  still

evident  in  Kampong  Glam today, names  like  Arab  Street  and

Bussorah  Street. Separate sections in Kampong Glam accommodated

different  groups  like  Kampong Melaka, Kampong  Java,  Kampong

Bugis.   Till  today,  some of our best  Padang  restaurants  by

Minang people are still to be found there.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also Chinese stone masons and ironmongers,

shopkeepers,  making Kampong Glam a truly cosmopolitan  district

with  its  own  distinct character.  And nearby  is  the  Sultan

Mosque,  which was planned for by Raffles, and it is interesting

that  till  today, the trustees of the Mosque must  include  two

North Indians, two South Indians, two Malays, two Javanese,  two

Buginese  and  two Arabs.  So very early, the community  decided

that it must ensure wide representation.  The Centre that we are

establishing should somehow capture that old spirit, and through

that  old  spirit,  continue  to link  the  Malay  community  in

Singapore to all four corners of the Archipelago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kampong Glam is to the Malay Muslim community in Singapore what

Chinatown is to the Chinese community.  Just as many Chinese  in

Singapore  can  trace part of their ancestry back to  Chinatown,

many Malay Muslims in Singapore can trace part of their ancestry

back  to  Kampong  Glam.  Recently, there was a  bit  of  public

commotion  over STB's plan to redevelop Chinatown.   It  created

some  inconveniences  to STB, but it was  a  very  good  debate,

because it showed that Singaporeans have strong emotional  bonds

to  the  land, and are concerned about what for them  is  sacred

ground  should be treated.   In fact, if Singaporeans had showed

no  interest to the way Chinatown was being redeveloped, then we

should  worry,  because it would then mean that we  are  just  a

hotel for Singaporeans, and Singaporeans are themselves rootless

citizens with no sense of where they come from and who they are.

So,  I  hope that the establishment of the Malay Heritage Centre

at  the old Istana will anchor the living heritage of the  Malay

Muslim community in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching and Dr Ho Tat Kin have urged MITA to give

more  money  to the arts, or to maintain the level  of  funding,

because of the economic downturn.  I was very worried last  year

that  funding would dry up from the private sector, and some  of

our  arts  groups would suffer great pain.  But, in  fact,  even

though companies could afford less, many made a great effort  to

maintain

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>

the  level  of  funding.  Every year, I write  letters  to  many

corporations  in  Singapore, begging for money  to  support  the

annual festivals.  Usually, whenever they can, whether in  money

or in kind, they would make the effort.  What this shows is that

the  support for the arts in Singapore is no longer only by  the

Government but by a wide section of a community.  But  what  the

National Arts Council should do is to broaden this base further,

and  bring the arts to all housing estates, so that the arts are

also  local and indigenous in character, and in the process also

widen the sponsorship base, the support base.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have therefore asked the National Arts Council to seek out

smaller  donors and smaller sponsors, and which  is  why  I  was

delighted  by the proposal made by Mr Seng Han Thong and  others

that  we  should make the effort to win over local  businessmen.

Chinese  operas,  for a long time, back to colonial  days,  were

supported by local temples, clan associations, small businessmen

and,  of course, seventh moon groups, which is why it is at  the

seventh  moon  that  the most Chinese operas have  traditionally

been shown.  So we should now find a way to build upon this fine

tradition  in the HDB setting; modernise it,  build upon  it  so

that  our  seventh moon groups, our local businessmen, our  clan

associations, will continue to support the arts in  its  various

forms.   But  to do that, we must reciprocate and give  national

recognition.  So the National Arts Council is now working out  a

system of award for community sponsors and donors who give money

to  the arts.  Right now, arts patrons have to give a minimum of

$50,000  in  any one year.  That is a little bit  too  much  for

community  supporters.  We need maybe a new category  of  awards

for  our  community leaders so that every year  those  who  have

contributed  and  those who have made big bids at  seventh  moon

auctions can then dress up and receive proper awards from  maybe

the  Chairman of the National Arts Council or the  Minister.   I

think  this is a very good idea.  I thank Mr Seng Han Thong  for

it.   We will certainly work towards implementing it in the near

future.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>

<br>5.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Choon Kang said that the works of Pan Shou and other

artists  should  be displayed in our museums and public  places.

This  is  a  point also raised by Mr Peh Chin Hua.   It  is  not

always possible to have these works on permanent display because

nowadays,  and  this  is  a worldwide trend,  museums  are  like

shopping  centres.  Each visit should be a different experience.

When  you  enter  the  main  hall, the  main  hall  should  look

different after a few months.  It should not be like in the  old

days  when  years after, people asked, "Did you  see  the  whale

bones  up  in the ceiling?"  The artifacts were as permanent  as

they could be.  We do not have many square metres of good museum

spaces.   So  we  have  got to keep grabbing  the  attention  of

audiences  so  that they will come back again and  again.   They

pass  by,  they  have  got a bit of spare time,  it  is  raining

outside,  they say, "Let us go in and take a look.  Maybe  there

is  something  on, something different."  This is  the  way  our

museums  will  have  to  be,  using  multi-media,  using  modern

marketing  techniques in order to stay attractive  and  to  stay

relevant.  So it is not easy for us to have a permanent display.

Of course, if we have the Mona Lisa or the Venus de Milo, yes, I

am  sure there will be a permanent space for these things.   But

we  have  got  to  do  it  in  a judicious  way  without  boring

Singaporeans  or at the same time showing respect to  those  who

have made very important contributions to the local arts scene.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the proposal that we should try and rotate our exhibits

around  to  the different Ministries and statutory boards  is  a

good one.  In fact, this has already been done.  The museums run

an  arts bank and they rent out the exhibits, to MITA, to MTI or

to  some statutory boards, in return for which they curate, they

do  the  wordings, they come and change the exhibits once  every

year  or two for a fee.  If private corporations are interested,

I  am  quite  sure  the museums would be able  to  work  out  an

attractive deal and an attractive package for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pan Shou was not only a calligrapher. He was also a great

poet.  It is important

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>

that some of his poems are remembered by young Singaporeans.  So

the  National  Arts  Council is working on a collection  of  his

better  poems  which  will be in the long Chinese  form  and  in

jianbizi  with hanyu pinyin, with word by word translations,  so

that  if you are a secondary school student, or if you are  like

me, trying to appreciate his poems, you do not have to take up a

dictionary and check the meaning of words.  Then it becomes  too

much  of  an  effort.  You sit down, you will be able  to  read,

learn  and  enjoy  the meaning and the spirit of  the  poem,  in

either  English or Chinese.  This is something which  should  be

done this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai urged MITA to preserve buildings and to

have more plaques for historically important buildings.  This is

an  on-going  programme.  What the Heritage Board together  with

the  Heritage Society tries to do, every year, is to  mark  more

sites in Singapore so that Singapore is an island littered  with

memories,  our  finger  prints and  the  finger  prints  of  our

ancestors all over.  A park is not just a park.  A park was also

the  setting for some important events in the past.  Then  every

place   becomes  an  interesting  place,  otherwise   we   build

something,  we  clear it, we build something  else,  we  are  no

better than a theme park or a hotel.  If we keep on doing  that,

without  leaving  behind memories, without planting  our  roots,

Singapore will never become a home for Singaporeans.  This is  a

work of generations.  Every year we must do some and I thank  Mr

Rai for his excellent suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, what we do for Singaporeans we are proud to show to

tourists.   If we can make some money for the tourism  industry,

that  is  wonderful.  Which is why the Singapore  Tourism  Board

supports  many  heritage projects.  In many countries,  heritage

tourism  is  important.  You read a brochure, it  says,  "Second

World War fortification, the Percival Headquarters for Southeast

Asia, come take a look."  A tourist may be attracted to spend an

additional  half-a-day  or  a  day  in  order  to  explore   the

fortification.    That  is  good  business   for   hotels,   for

shopkeepers,   for   restaurants,  for  businessmen   who   sell

souvenirs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chuang Shaw Peng gave a very thoughtful contribution on

the  relationship between culture and entrepreneurship.  He  was

very  unhappy with the fact that sometimes we look down  on  our

own  values, that anything associated with Confucianism must  be

bad.   We  have many western friends who also tell  us  that  we

have  inherited  bad values and bad habits from  our  own  past,

which we should shed quickly, and perhaps become more like them.

That  is not a very historical view of things.  Of course, there

were  things  in our Confucianist past for Chinese  Singaporeans

which  held us back, like the treatment of women, foot  binding,

the emplacement of businessmen at the bottom of the social totem

pole.  All that kept back the development of enterprise and  the

development  of  a free business spirit.  But there  were  other

aspects  of our ancestral culture which are valuable to  us  and

which  account for a lot of the success of Singapore today,  our

high   savings  rate,  our  emphasis,  almost  obsession,   with

education,  strong  family unit, hard  work,  thrift,  in  fact,

values  which  we cling on even more dearly in a crisis.   Those

things we should not lightly weaken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chuang talked about how Chinese and Indian groups

perform  differently in different settings.  There is a cultural

impulse  which is a potential and in certain political settings,

the  potential flowers, blooms, like in Silicon Valley, like  in

Hong  Kong,  like  in  Taiwan,  like  in  Singapore.   In  other

settings, like under socialism in India, or communism in  China,

it  was  suppressed.  So before the war, Shanghai, when  it  was

mostly  foreign  concessions, was the greatest city  in  all  of

Asia.   Under  communism, it became gray and dark.  With  reform

and  opening  up, it is blossoming again.  This shows  that  the

underlying cultural potential was always there, which is  why  I

am  not  particularly concerned that we have no  entrepreneurial

spirit  in  Singapore.   It is in our  history,  it  is  in  our

culture,  it is in our blood.  But what we must do is to  ensure

that    our   rules   and   regulations   better   enable   this

entrepreneurial  spirit  to  come forth  in  the  new  high-tech

knowledge economic setting.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>

This  is, of course, what the Technopreneurship 21 Committee  is

about,  and  about which I spoke a bit this morning  during  the

debate on MTI.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. General Yeo, we are running short of

time.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> I will now ask Mr Yatiman to

answer  some of the other questions on the Red Lion  symbol  and

the film industry.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Chairman, do I have your permission

to seek just one clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Make it very short because we are really very

short of time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I would like to ask the Minister: was

controlling  what  should be transmitted to  the  homes  and  be

viewed  by Singaporeans uppermost in the Government's mind  when

deciding  to  wire  up  the whole nation by  cable  rather  than

allowing  Singaporeans  to have direct access  to  international

channels freely via the satellite dish?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, satellite dishes are not as

convenient  as Mr Low may think.  Satellite dishes require  line

of  sight, which means you cannot have it if you live in a high-rise  apartment  block.   If you have one  satellite  dish,  you

access one satellite, you may not get all the channels that  you

want.  Furthermore, even after you have got the satellite  dish,

you  have still to cable it to your home.  So it is not  as   if

satellite represents a cheap alternative.  It is far better  for

us,  economically speaking, to see the whole of Singapore as one

large  condominium satellite with big satellite  dishes  pulling

down  channels  from  all over the world  and  then  feeding  it

through a cable system and through wireless systems to different

households,  office blocks, schools and so  on.   This  was  the

model that we adopted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would we allow the free use of satellite one day? We

already  allow it for banks and companies.  We have  decided  to

hold back on households in order to buy

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>

ourselves more time for local programming to take root.  We also

wanted   to   make  sure  that  extreme  broadcasts  which   are

pornographic or inflammatory in a racial or religious sense  are

kept  out.   Of course, a cable system, if there is  a  national

emergency,  or if there is an SAF mobilisation, is  very  useful

for these purposes.

<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof):</b> On the

millennium  celebrations, I think Mr Chew  is  right  in  saying

that,  strictly speaking, the new millennium is not in the  Year

2000,  but  in  the  Year 2001.  Even a person  like  Arthur  C.

Clarke,  the  famous science fiction writer, feels  so  strongly

about people calling next year a new millennium that he issued a

public  statement  to correct it because the Gregorian  calendar

starts  with Year 1 and not Year 0.  The 21st century  does  not

actually  begin until 1st January 2001.  Nonetheless,  the  year

2000  has a profound psychological effect on many of us and  our

sense  of  time.  Most countries have indicated that they  would

celebrate the millennium. Do we intend to do so?  Yes.  Together

with  the rest of the world, Singapore will welcome the new year

with a host of events.  MITA is coordinating these events, which

are organised by both public and private sectors.  Starting this

month, they will span 18 months.  These events will mostly  ride

on  existing programmes such as the Arts Festival, the  National

Day Parade and the usual year-end light-ups and countdown shows.

The incremental expenditure should not be significant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Ong will launch the Singapore Millennium 2000

Logo  on  20th  March 1999 together with Singapore's  Millennium

website.  The logo will serve as a visual unifier for the  whole

range  of nation wide celebrations, with its accompanying slogan

"A  Shared  Heritage,  A  Common Vision".   Some  of  the  other

activities include commemorative markers, such as time  capsule,

sculpture  and a Millennium clock.  Millennium coins and  stamps

and a new series of currency notes will also be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>

issued.   A  number of countdown shows at various parts  of  the

island  are also being planned.  These bashes will set the  mood

for  Singaporeans  to  ring in the new century  as  one  people.

Details  of the festivities have been announced and reported  in

both local and foreign media.  Time magazine, Sir, for instance,

carried a positive report on our proposed festivities.  This  is

the report [indicating] that appeared in the Time magazine.  And

may  I  ask the Clerk of Parliament to distribute them  to  hon.

Members?  [Copies of report distributed to hon. Members.]   More

information will be found in the Millennium website and released

to the media in the course of the year.

<br>6.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the promotion of film industry, Mr Chew Heng Ching and

Mr  Shriniwas Rai spoke of promising prospects of the local film

industry and called for more incentives to help film makers.  Mr

Peh  Chin Hua said that TCS should produce more local films  and

show them in cinemas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the success of Money No Enough last year, things are

looking  good  for our local film industry.  Liang  Po  Po  made

quite  a  successful debut recently, and it is reported that  12

other films will be released this year.  Incentives such as  the

Pioneer  Incentive  Scheme  and the  Development  and  Expansion

Incentive,  which allow tax holiday of 5% to 10%, or  a  reduced

tax rate, have been offered.  A few companies were awarded these

incentives  in the early 1990s but there were not  enough  films

being made then.  Today, there is greater optimism.  People  are

seeking  for  new  ideas, looking for new locations,  trying  to

angle into the new growing industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our part, the Singapore Film Commission has set up

committees to help film makers.  A Funding Committee will invest

up  to $1 million on four feature films and $200,000 on 40 short

films  every  year.  It recently awarded some  $300,000  to  two

local  film-makers, quite a big amount for  our  standard.   The

Film Commission will also support the development of good

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>

scripts.   Noted script doctors have been invited to run  script

seminars  and script laboratories in Singapore to encourage  the

growth or the production of better script writers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Facilitation Committee will help film-makers by making it

easier  for  them  to obtain permits for location  shooting  and

other  necessary  requirements  from  Government  and  statutory

boards.  This  Committee will also help run courses  to  educate

film-makers  on  the legal and business aspects of  film-making.

They  are  also  looking  to  develop  and  widen  the  pool  of

technicians, such as lighting and camera people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai said that he was impressed by what he saw and what

the Australians are doing.  In actual fact, we have sent a study

group to places outside Singapore, including Australia.  So  the

Film  Commission,  from the experience of the visits  that  were

made,  will  work with the Economic Development  Board  and  the

relevant agencies to help the industry such as in the setting up

of  post-production  facilities  and  granting  of  further  tax

incentives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember that world-wide, film-making is a risky

business  as no one can predict whether a film will  succeed  or

fail  at  the  box  office.  But I am hopeful that  with  proper

planning  and  encouragement, Singapore can  become  a  regional

centre for the film industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Mr Peh's comment on TCS' film-making

venture, we welcome the move.  TCS' Raintree company, which  has

widely advertised in our local TV, has produced its first  movie

Liang  Po  Po, which was a success at the box office.  There  is

certainly synergy between the TV and film industries,  not  just

in  terms of the common pool of talent and actors that they  all

share,  but  also  in terms of the supporting industries.   TCS'

move will therefore result in a more vibrant media scene.  MITA,

of course, will continue giving its support wherever it can.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Red Lion National icon, Dr Toh See Kiat feels that there

is a need to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>

regulate  the use of the Lion icon, which is our national  icon.

The  Singapore Lion symbol, introduced in 1986, has been  widely

publicised,  used and accepted as our national  symbol.   It  is

included in MITA's National Symbols kit where guidelines on  its

use are given.  The symbol is already protected under Rule 14 of

our Trade Marks Rules and internationally under Article 6 of the

Paris Convention.  Only Government organisations are allowed  to

use  the symbol.  Other organisations wishing to use the  symbol

must  seek MITA's permission.  We are constantly looking at ways

to  promote its usage in keeping with its image as our  national

symbol.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin:</b> Sir, I want to talk on dialect broadcasting.

With  news  being broadcast in dialect, our senior citizens  are

now  kept  well  informed  of local international  developments.

What  is more important is that the senior citizens are able  to

understand Government policies from news which they can hear for

themselves   rather  than  having  to  listen  to  third   party

translations, which very often are not the exact.  Dialect  news

broadcast  has  been well received.  Currently, with  cable  TV,

there is sufficient bandwidth to provide more dialect programmes

for old people.  MITA could encourage more dialect programmes to

be  broadcast, especially in the day time, for senior  citizens,

as  it  is  the time when their children are at work and  senior

citizens  need entertainment.  Dialect opera and classic  movies

will be welcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the current widespread use of Mandarin among the younger

generation, the problem of dialect diluting Mandarin will be non-existent.  I hope the Minister can consider this suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I go on to digital broadcasting. To position at the

forefront  of  technology,  we  are  committed  to  embrace  new

technology  and  continue to improve all forms of  services  for

Singaporeans.  This is the same for broadcasting.  Digital audio

broadcast (DBA) is the latest buzzword in the radio industry and

has been labelled the sound of the future offering interference-free, CD quality sound, graphic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>

pictures  and  text  information in addition to  audio  signals.

This  means useful information like traffic and weather reports,

headline news, including leisure and financial information,  can

be transmitted via DBA for listeners' benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBA has announced Singapore's commitment to implement digital

radio  and  digital TV.  These are key technologies  which  will

propel  the  local broadcasting industry into the  digital  age.

This   will  give  consumers  more  programming  choices,  offer

newsreels  for broadcast and enhance Singapore's position  as  a

broadcasting hub.  Digital audio broadcast has been launched  on

a limited scale.  I believe we have offered Asia's first digital

audio broadcast service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister what is the result of this launch and

when will the full launch be implemented?  I would also like  to

ask  the Minister the results of the digital television test  to

study the three technical standards currently available.  Has  a

conclusion  been reached as to which standard is  most  suitable

for  Singapore?   When  will digital television  be  rolled  out

eventually and how long will it be before analogue TV is  phased

out totally?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, the importance of Internet has been

recognised by the Government for some time now.  And I am  proud

to  say that Singapore is widely recognised by the international

community as being at the forefront of developing an intelligent

island,  with  the  various initiatives such  as  Singapore  One

project.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our current approach to tackling the Internet problem is a

multi-agency  one.   We have progressed thus  far  with  various

initiatives  by  the universities to promote  the  teaching  and

usage  of  Internet, Ministry of Education on  the  teaching  of

Internet  among students in schools, EDB working  with  business

community  to  promote  e-commerce and  to  develop  web-related

businesses,  NCB  on  developing an Internet  culture,  and  the

Singapore Broadcasting Authority on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>

regulation of Internet, and so on.  Like it or not, Internet has

become  part and parcel of our life, be it at work, at home,  or

in  dealing  with  the  Government.  This  current  multi-agency

approach to tackling the Internet problem may not be a good one.

I  feel a need for an overall body to coordinate the regulation,

promotion,  development, teaching and the usage of  Internet  in

Singapore.  This will help ensure that our limited resources are

not duplicated and that there is a more coordinated approach  to

achieve  Internet  development, instead of just  leaving  it  to

individual agencies to chart up individual road maps  which  may

not have the same benefits as a more systematic coordinated plan

in place for the whole country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the Minister for Finance had two days ago

announced  the  possibility of forming an IT  coordinating  body

comprising NCB, TAS and SBA.  I would like to propose that  this

body  take  on the task of promoting, regulating and  developing

the  Internet  industry.  I would venture to suggest  that  this

body comes under the purview of MITA, the Ministry in charge  of

information.  I would like the Minister's comment on this.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, since I entered this House in 1997, I

have  been calling for the establishment of a Ministry  to  deal

with  the multifarious aspects of information technology  policy

planning and development in Singapore.  Recently I was fortified

in  my  stand by the discovery that the outgoing Chief Executive

of  the National Computer Board, Mr Stephen Yeo, shared my view.

I  was equally encouraged by Mrs Yu-Foo's call in this House  on

Monday  for a Ministry of IT Power.  I am thus no longer a  lone

voice  in  the  wilderness.  To top it  all,  the  Minister  for

Finance's reply to her was the most encouraging piece of news  I

have  had  this  year.  Yes, even though the Government  is  not

convinced that a Ministry for IT (by whatever name it is called)

is  needed,  it has acknowledged that some streamlining  of  the

regulatory agencies is possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulties of pigeon-holing different aspects of IT

policy to different agencies and Ministries is exemplified

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>

by  my  recent call in this House for the regulation of Internet

Relay  Chat  facilities.  I had been alarmed to  hear  that  two

girls had been raped and/or molested.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to move on to say that when I asked the question on the

Internet  Relay  Chat facilities, I had asked for  clarification

from  at  least two Ministries.  Actually I had even thought  of

filing a Question for the third Ministry because this had to  do

with communication infrastructure.  I do remember that last year

when  the APEC Ministers discussed electronic commerce, we  were

represented  by  Mr  Mah  Bow  Tan,  who  is  the  Minister  for

Communications, even though electronic commerce is more an issue

which is governed by the Ministry of Trade and Industry and  the

National Computer Board which is an agency under MTI.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, even though I do disagree somewhat with the

Minister's  reply  earlier in this House  that  IRCs  cannot  be

regulated, I think more education can be given to get parents to

know  that uncontrolled Internet use by their children can  lead

to  problems and they must actually not use the excuse that they

know nothing about Internet and ignore what the children do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can also suggest that perhaps we have this special service

which currently is only operated by SingNet but we can open  it,

maybe  even  on  a mandatory basis, to all the Internet  Service

Providers, and this Family Safe Internet Service would not  only

screen  off pornography for children but also other things  like

Internet  Relay Chat facilities that parents can switch  off  if

they do not consider it wholesome for their children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all technology, the Internet can be used for good as well

as  for  bad.  We need to avoid what Dr Lee Tsao Yuan has called

"kiasu" regulation yesterday in this House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. There are only two or three minutes left.

BG  Yeo, do you want to reply or you want the Member to carry on

speaking with no reply?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, perhaps I can seize the

opportunity of the 2 minutes left to give quick replies  to  the

questions raised so far, rather than have all the questions with

none of the answers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes. I think it is better that way.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Dr Ho Tat Kin's question on dialect

programming  on  SCV,  I  think SBA will  consider  having  more

daylight dialect programmes for elderly Singaporeans.   That  we

will do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On digital audio broadcasting, it is already available. The

trade launch has been done, and the commercial launch should  be

in  July  this  year.   We  will see how  the  market  develops.

Digital  television will commence as early as next year  or  the

year after.  Analogue TV will continue for a long, long time  to

come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching asked whether, whatever this new agency we

are creating on information technology, it should be located  in

MITA.   I do not think MITA will be a good place to locate  such

an   agency,   because  regulating  the  technical  aspects   of

telecommunication and information technology is a big job  which

is best given to a technical Ministry rather than to MITA.  MITA

will  continue to be interested in social and cultural  content,

both  its regulation and its promotion, in conformance with  our

policies on censorship, language or whatever.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is 6.15 pm.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> It was a lively debate. I have one cut

which  I  have no chance to talk.  I will raise it as a Question

for  Oral Answer at a subsequent sitting.  With that, I withdraw

my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $195,007,210 for Head R ordered to stand part of

the Main Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $174,697,300 for Head R ordered to stand part of

the Development Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the Committee

and took the Chair of the House.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to

report that the Committee of Supply has made further progress on

the  Estimates of Expenditure for the financial year  1999/2000,

and ask leave to sit again on Monday, 15th March, 1999.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it.
