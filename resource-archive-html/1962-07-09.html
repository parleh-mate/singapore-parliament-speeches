<div align="center"><b>REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF PRIVILEGES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Case of Sardara Singh)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly doth agree with the Committee of

Privileges  in  their Report as contained  in  Paper

L.A. 10 of 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Report ---



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I rise on a point of order, Mr

Speaker, Sir ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> --- whether it is proper, in the light

of  the  motion  passed by this Assembly  on  Friday

limiting  certain items of business up to  Wednesday

night,  to introduce new items during the course  of

these sittings, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is in order under the Standing

Orders.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, this Report deals

with  the  matter  which the Member  for  Anson  had

wanted  to  raise in this Assembly on  the  case  of

Sardara  Singh,  former  Acting  Sergeant   in   the

Singapore Police Force. Subsequently it came  to  my

knowledge  that  the Member for  Anson  was  also  a

solicitor  for the said Sardara Singh,  and  I  drew

your  attention to the fact that (his could probably

be  committed  to  the Committee of  Privileges  for

investigation.  The Committee has met  and  produced

this  Report. It has been agreed that if the  Member

for  Anson  had  raised the matter of  the  case  of

Sardara  Singh in the Assembly and in the manner  he

proposed  he  could  have come within  the  mischief

indicated in the preceding paragraphs and could have

been  dealt with accordingly for abuse of  privilege

or for dishonourable conduct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Committee investigated also the

desirability of framing a general



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 5</b></font><br><br>



resolution   to   cover  the  matters   raised   but

considered that in the light of the above it was not

necessary to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when a person has acquired three "P.s" to his name - meaning, privilege, profit and power - he

is virtually in an unassailable position. During the

debate  on  the  amendments  to  the  Advocates  and

Solicitors Ordinance, the Member for Anson  admitted

that  an  advocate and solicitor was  in  a  special

position  of  privilege and also in  a  position  of

profit.  Here  I  would like to  add  that  when  an

advocate  and solicitor also becomes an Assemblyman,

particularly if he is on the Opposition Bench  where

he  does not have to bear responsibilities, he  also

acquires  his  third  P. - meaning  that  he  acquires

power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, normally a member of the Bar would be

responsible   to   the  body   that   controls   his

profession,  which  is the Bar  Committee.  The  Bar

Committee can haul a fellow member over the coals if

there  has  been a breach of etiquette.  But  if  an

advocate  and  solicitor is also  a  Member  of  the

Assembly, and he is given liberty to speak  in  this

Assembly  on matters which probably touch  upon  his

professional  work, he would be in  a  position  not

only to enlarge his profit from the advertisement he

gains  in this Assembly but also he would  be  in  a

position of power. However, such a person could  not

be  disciplined  by  the Bar  Committee.  Under  the

Powers and Immunities Ordinance of Assemblymen, such

an  advocate and solicitor cannot be hauled over the

coals by his professional body. However, it does not

mean  that we should allow a person to exercise  his

power  and his privilege in an unrestrained  manner.

If  a  professional body is powerless to  discipline

its  member by virtue of the fact that he is also  a

Member of the Assembly, then it is up to this  House

itself to discipline its own Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliamentary democracy can only succeed, Mr

Speaker, if Assemblymen exercise restraint and self-discipline. If there is absolute licence  of  speech

and  if  there is any attempt to get away  with  the

penalties for which he would nominally be guilty  of

if he were outside the Assembly, it would mean, Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>



Speaker, that the reputation of this Assembly  would

be brought down to a very low level.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Umm ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I hear a grunt from the Member

for  Anson.  But  I am quite sure  that  he  in  his

uprighteousness  does  want to uphold  parliamentary

democracy.  I  know he tries very hard  to  restrain

himself  at  times, but, as they say,  the  body  is

weaker than the spirit. However, the lesson which we

wish  to draw from this Report is this, Mr Speaker,

and  that is that Assemblymen, especially those  who

are  professional men, in particular  advocates  and

solicitors,  must  remember  that  they  are  in   a

position   of  privilege,  profit  and  power,   and

commensurate with these special qualities that  they

have   acquired  they  should  also  exercise  equal

responsibility.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, there is an air of

unreality in discussing privilege and the dignity of

the  House  in  the  context of the  throes  of  the

struggle  for  the  survival  of  democracy   itself

through  which we are going today. I  shall  not  be

long,  Sir, nor shall I seek to contest this  ruling

particularly  in  the light of the fact  that  every

minute  we  are discussing this we are  taking  away

that  much  time  from a much more crucial  question

which is subject to a guillotine provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to draw attention to one or two

points,  Sir, just for the record. It is  inaccurate

to suggest that there was anything but a willingness

and  desire  on my part that this matter  should  be

clarified. Having come across some vital information

which  I  considered would affect the view  of  this

House  in respect of certain matters concerning  the

administrative  conduct of statutory  provisions,  I

had  wished that this House should know of it, after

my client had ceased to be my client and he had left

this  country and the result of whatever took  place

here  could have no effect on him. When I gave  that

indication, I learned that the Deputy Prime Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>



and  the  Leader  of  the House was  unhappy  as  he

thought   that  I  might  contravene  the  privilege

provisions.  If  you  will  remember,  Sir,  I   had

indicated that in those circumstances I would  wish,

rather than speak on it and possibly contravene  any

privilege  provisions, that  the  matter  should  be

considered by the Committee of Privileges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am delighted that you saw fit to consult the

Fourth  Clerk at the Table in the House  of  Commons

and  I  find myself in complete agreement  with  his

stand as indicated in paragraph 10:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I think that it might be accepted as a broad

general principle that a Member would be in contempt

(of  the House) if his advocacy in Parliament  of  a

matter  in which he had been professionally  engaged

was  in any way proved to be due to a desire to show

that  he  was continuing to give value for  the  fee

marked  on his brief. If, however, his parliamentary

activities   were   completely   divorced   from   a

furtherance  of his lay client's interests  at  law,

there would seem to be no objection.'



<br><br>And in point of fact, Sir, that was my stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I can understand the unhappy position in

which  the Committee found itself where it  received

the  memoranda  and  representations  from  the  Bar

Committee.  I  refer  to the  Chairman  of  the  Bar

Committee who was asked what if a Member of the  Bar

in  the course of his professional duties learned of

matters of national importance and thereafter ceased

to  act and had his client's permission. And he said

that  it would be objectionable still. One can  only

believe that that was his view because he is  not  a

national of this State and it had no reality in  the

context  of  his  representations. But  he  says  in

paragraph 16 that the Bar Committee would still take

objection:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I would still take objection because it seems it

could  be  deemed  that the lawyer  mentioning  this

matter   would  be  seeking  to  attract  trade   by

advertisement.'



<br><br>Sir,  my view is very simply this. If it can at  any

time  be  shown that a member of the Bar who  is  an

Assemblyman has acted whether within or without this

Assembly utilising his position in the Assembly  for

purposes of furthering his client's interests or for

purposes of furthering his personal interests in attracting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



trade,  then he has  acted  in  a  grossly

improper  fashion - whatever  name  you  may  call  it

by - under the Privileges and Immunities Ordinance  of

this House, Sir. But where it is completely divorced

from  any  ulterior motive of that  character,  then

there can be no question, as the Fourth Clerk at the

Table  of  the House of Commons said. But I  do  not

wish  to  lengthen  this debate.  I  shall  move  no

amendments, Sir, I merely wish to record that  I  am

happy  that no general principle has been enunciated

by  the  Select Committee which could fetter  future

Assemblies.  I  take note that the Select  Committee

went no further than to say that if I had raised it,

and  had  my conduct been of a certain character  in

the  presentation of the Sardara Singh case, I could

have  been brought up. I shall not bring it  up.  In

the  context  of the composition of  this  House,  I

shall not take that risk.



<br><br>2.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I am glad the

Member  for Anson at least has accepted in principle

the  Report of this Committee of Privileges and  the

assurance  that he, for one, opposes any attempt  by

any  advocate and solicitor to utilise his  position

in   this  Assembly  for  further  gain  and  profit

outside. I am sure that is a sentiment which Members

of  this  House will agree with, and I have  nothing

further to say to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly doth agree with the Committee of

Privileges  in  their Report as contained  in  Paper

L.A. 10 of 1962.

<div align="center"><b>TARIFF ADVISORY COMMISSION BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.



<br><br>2.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir,

I  beg  to move, "That the Bill be now read a  Third

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I moved the Second Reading of the Bill, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I had a feeling that this Bill  might

well arouse



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



a  raging controversy between the Singapore  traders

on  the one hand and the Singapore manufacturers  on

the other. This Bill seeks to regulate the manner in

which a Tariff Advisory Commission is to conduct its

investigations on any proposals to impose tariffs in

Singapore.  As  such, therefore, the Bill  seeks  to

change  from  time to time the free port  status  of

Singapore.  There  was an expectation  then  that  a

controversy  might rage between the upholders  of  a

100  per cent free port status of Singapore  on  the

one  hand, and the manufacturers who want to see new

industries as fast as possible on the other hand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Bill was sent to Select Committee, the

usual   processes   were  set  on  foot,   including

advertisements  in the papers asking  for  views  of

interested  parties. A strange thing then  happened.

There   was   absolutely  no   response   to   these

advertisements and the closing date for reception of

memoranda  had to be extended. Finally, two  parties

made  their submissions, namely, the Joint  Chambers

of  Commerce, who were somewhat apprehensive of  the

provisions   of   this  Bill,  and   the   Singapore

Manufacturers' Association, who welcomed the general

provisions of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a fairly cordial and friendly discussion

with the interested parties in Select Committee,  as

a result of which two amendments were introduced and

approved  by  Select  Committee.  May  I  draw   the

attention of the House to these two amendments? They

are  in  clause 6. There is an addition to clause  6

and  the  additional sentence reads  as  follows  - I

should  mention that clause 6 allows the  Commission

to  co-opt, on an ad hoc basis, two or more  persons

with  special  knowledge  of  the  subject  at   the

inquiry.  An  amendment was made to this  clause  to

allow  and, in fact, to make it compulsory that  one

of   these   persons   shall  represent   industrial

interests  and  the  other shall  represent  trading

interests. This amendment was made after the  Select

Committee  heard  the views of the representors  and

agreed  that  they had a strong case.  So  clause  6

contains this additional sentence which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`At least one of such persons shall be a person

representing industrial interests and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



one  other  shall  be a person representing  trading

interests.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendment occurs in clause 9 (2) (a) (ii)

in  page  A3,  line 27 of the Report of  the  Select

Committee  on  the Bill. This gives  effect  to  the

proposal  tabled  by  the  Member  for  Tanglin  who

desires  that  the  Commission  should  investigate,

among  other  things, the effect of tariffs  on  the

general level of employment in Singapore. And  this,

I  think,  Members  of the House  will  agree  is  a

completely unexceptional request and accordingly the

Government   agrees   to  the  inclusion   of   this

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clauses do not call for any comment from

me  at  this  stage  as they have  been  dealt  with

adequately, I think, on the Second Reading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.

I  beg  to move, "That the Bill be now read a  Third

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is for the most part consequential on the

passage of the Tariff Advisory Commission Bill.  But

in  Select  Committee,  I took  the  opportunity  of

proposing certain amendments which were accepted and

these amendments dealt with the quantum of draw-back

which  local cigarette manufacturers may receive  on

the  export  of  their cigarettes overseas.  As  the

Customs  Ordinance stands, the quantum of  draw-back

is  limited to seven-eighths of the total duty  paid

on  imported tobacco. The amendment allows the drawback  to  be  paid to manufacturers up to  the  full

amount.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  have  His  Excellency the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's recommendation to proceed with this Bill. I

beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read  a  Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill, together with the complementary

Local  Government Integration Bill,  which  will  be

moved by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has

been drafted to carry out the P.A.P.'s programme  of

unified  administration as  outlined  in  The  Tasks

Ahead.  Therein we pointed out the peculiar position

in  Singapore  of  two  parallel administrations - the

Central  Government  and the  City  Council - existing

side  by side and duplicating each other's functions

and  activities. We were against such a wasteful and

expensive  system  of government for  such  a  small

island    and    proposed   to    rationalise    the

administrative structure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the implementation of this policy of

integration was phased in three stages:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The administrative integration of the City

Council Departments into relevant Ministries of  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The financial integration which was completed

with  the  coming  into  operation  on  the  1st  of

January, 1961, of the Property Tax Ordinance and the

Local  Government  Financial Integration  Ordinance.

These  two Bills, the Public Utilities Bill and  the

Local  Government Integration Bill,  will  mark  the

fruition of our policy of unified administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this Bill comes into force and the Public

Utilities Board is established, integration will  be

legally completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, incorporated in this Bill are those sections

of  the Local Government Ordinance, 1957, which  are

applicable  to  the  three  trading  departments  of

electricity, water, gas and their duties, powers and

responsibilities. Regard is also being paid  to  the

relevant  legislation, including the  Federation  of

Malaya Electricity Ordinance, 1949, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>



Housing  and  Development Ordinance, 1959,  and  the

Singapore Telephone Board Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Statement adequately indicates the

intention  and purpose of the Bill.  As  it  is  the

intention  to  refer this Bill together  with  other

related   Bills   involved  in  this   exercise   of

integration  to  a  Select Committee  to  allow  for

careful study before enactment, I do not propose  to

elaborate on the detailed provisions of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of sending it to Select Committee

is  in order to allow all interested parties to make

their  representations. It may well be, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  that  these  representations  will  entail   a

redrafting of the Bill when it is submitted  to  the

House  again  later  in the new  Session  after  the

Assembly has been adjourned sine die and prorogued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> There is just one

provision in the Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir, on which  I

would  like  to  touch, which seems to  involve  the

question  of  principle, and the  principle  is  one

which  affects  the authority of the  Assembly.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, the power to borrow money as  set  out

in  the various clauses here seems, in some way,  to

infringe upon the rights of the Assembly in  so  far

as  the  monies  of  the State are  concerned.  Take

clause  23  onwards, Mr Speaker, Sir. There  is  no

doubt  that the Board must be given ample powers  to

borrow  money and, as such, it must be able  to  fix

its  rate  of interest and the terms and  conditions

upon  which  repayment  will be  effected.  I  fully

appreciate  all  that. I also  appreciate  that  the

Board will be in a very different position from what

the  City Council was, because the City Council  was

an  institution which had been in existence for some

considerable time. It had property of  its  own  and

all  the loans which were raised by the City Council

for  its  public utility undertakings were a  charge

upon  all the assets of the City Council. That being

so, it was possible to induce the investing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



public  to  take up those loans. But the Board  will

naturally be in a different position. All its assets

will be assets which are not marketable assets,  and

therefore  the borrowing powers to that extent  will

be  largely hampered from a security point of  view.

Therefore,  it is necessary that these loans  should

be   underwritten   by  the  Government.   I   fully

appreciate  that.  But there is a provision  in  the

Bill  which says that if the revenues of  the  Board

are  insufficient to meet payments from  these  loan

liabilities either incurred in the past  or  in  the

future,  then they shall be a charge on  the  public

debt of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as you know, under the

Constitution, any charge on the public debt  is  not

an  item arguable in this Assembly. It is an item of

statutory    expenditure   which   the    Government

automatically gets. This is a question of  principle

which,  I  think, the Assembly is rightly interested

in, although I do appreciate the difficulties of the

situation.  The position could arise,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir, that a great deal of money could be borrowed by

the   Board,  naturally  with  the  consent  of  the

Minister,  and  yet the Assembly would  find  itself

unable   to   do  anything  about  it  because   any

expenditure in the way of repayment will be a public

debt. The Assembly will be powerless. I do not  know

what  the  solution is; perhaps the  Minister  might

think  of  one,  but I raise it as  a  matter  which

concerns the rights of the Legislative Assembly.



<br><br>3.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  with  regard  to clause 19, I  would  like  the

Government, or the Select Committee when it sits, to

pay attention to it. It may sound to be a matter  of

detail, Mr Speaker, Sir, but it is a detail that is

causing  hardship  to a very large  number  of  poor

people in Singapore. So perhaps the Select Committee

will pay attention to this detail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 provides that the Board may cut off

supply  in default of payment. I do know of  people,

especially  those occupying S.I.T. flats,  who  are

asked to pay a deposit of $40/- or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>



thereabouts. Now, if for months and months they have

used  these facilities to the sum of $7/-  or  $8/-,

they would still have a balance of $32/- on deposit.

But by virtue of clause 19, immediately they default

payment for the first time, although they have a big

deposit  left there, they will still be deprived  of

their  supplies. And to get their supplies  resumed,

they  will have to pay not only what they are  asked

at  that time but also the expenses incurred by  the

Board  in  so cutting off the supplies and  resuming

them.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I heard the hon Member say it

was  a matter for the Select Committee. I think  she

has  made  her point, and perhaps she  will  send  a

memorandum   to   the  Select  Committee   on   this

particular point.



<br><br>3.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  in moving  the  Second  Reading

debate  on  this Bill, the Prime Minister said  that

the  Government dealt with the third  stage  of  the

integration  of  the  local  government   with   the

Singapore Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with this Public Utilities Bill

the establishment of the Public Utilities Board will

change  the situation in Singapore and that  of  all

the  people  in Singapore. It will also  affect  the

procedures  in public utilities. We hope the  supply

of gas, water and electricity from the Board will be

complete and better than at present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like the Prime Minister to assure the

House that the establishment of the Public Utilities

Board  will not increase the expenses of the  people

of Singapore in regard to water and gas supplies.  I

would  like  him to ensure, too, that he  would  not

increase  the charges for water, gas and electricity

because  this  will  greatly affect  the  people  of

Singapore, especially the common people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you have seen that before the

establishment of the Housing and Development  Board,

i.e. during the time of the S.I.T., the rents fixed

at that time were not as high as those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>



after   the   establishment  of  the   Housing   and

Development Board. So after the establishment of the

Public  Utilities Board, will this  Board  take  the

same  step as the Housing and Development Board  and

increase the charges for water, gas, and electricity

supplies?  I  hope the Prime Minister will  give  an

assurance   to  the  House  that  the  charges   for

electricity, gas and water will not be increased  in

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, from this Bill we can also see that the past City Council staff, i.e. those who worked

in  the Gas, Electricity and Water Departments, will

be   integrated  and  transferred  to   the   Public

Utilities Board. We hope the staff at present in the

three Departments will enjoy the same benefits  even

after they have been integrated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we welcome the commitment of this

Bill  to  a  Select Committee. We  hope  the  Select

Committee  will  consider  in  greater  detail   the

opinions  of  the  people concerned  and  also  will

arrive at conclusions more beneficial to the people.



<br><br>3.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the point made by the

Member  for Farrer Park was one which was considered

by  a Committee which went through the Bill together

with  the  World  Bank. A large sum  of  money  will

probably have to be borrowed from the World Bank for

extensive expansion of both our power supply and our

waterworks. Therefore, the views of the  World  Bank

as  to the proper safeguards and provisos that there

should be in the statutory provisions regulating the

conduct of the Board are of some importance to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to go into details regarding

this.  Needless  to say, the World Bank,  before  it

advances  large sums of money which may well  amount

to  over $100 million altogether, would want  to  be

assured  that  there  are sufficient  guarantees  on

repayment  and  certain  guarantees  on  the  proper

conduct of the business of the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the points made by the Member for Choa Chu

Kang, I think they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>



are  not worth any specific replies. Nobody has ever

moved  any  Bill in this Assembly by  which  charges

have gone up, to the detriment of the public, or  by

which the conditions of service of the employees  of

the Government Departments who have been transferred

to  the  Board have been worsened. I think they  are

the usual propaganda points made over and over again

in  the hope that they may win votes. I do not think

we  are  losing  any, and so I shall not  bother  to

reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr

Speaker  as  Chairman and such  Members  as  may  be

nominated by the Committee of Selection -[The  Prime

Minister].

<div align="center"><b>LOCAL GOVERNMENT INTEGRATION BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir,

I  have  His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

recommendation to proceed with this Bill. I  beg  to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recall, Sir, at the Budget session last

year  I  mentioned that the integration of the  City

Council  into  the Central Government  was  a  major

administrative  reform undertaken  by  the  People's

Action Party Government. I touched at some length on

the  make-up of the City Council and the  manner  in

which  it  was  proposed to integrate  it  into  the

Central  Government. Since 1st  January,  1961,  the

physical integration of the City Council other  than

the  three trading departments has been in progress,

and  administratively  and operationally  they  have

been absorbed by various Government Ministries. This

major  administrative reform is in  accordance  with

the  pledge  of the Party to bring about a  smoother

and  more  efficient  public service  to  serve  the

people of the State. In the process, duplication  of

functions that had previously



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



existed has been removed, and it is expected that in

the   long  run  economies  will  be  effected   and

efficiency raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill before the House is complementary to

the  Public  Utilities Bill which was earlier  moved

for  a Second Reading by the Prime Minister, and  it

provides  for  the transfer to the  Government  with

retrospective effect from the 1st January, 1961,  of

all  assets as well as liabilities and employees  of

the  City Council and of the Rural Board other  than

those transferred to the Public Utilities Board  for

the   running   of   water,  gas,  and   electricity

undertakings. These are contained in Part I  of  the

Bill. It also enacts in Parts II to VI and VIII  all

provisions of the Local Government Ordinance,  1957,

relating  to  streets, sewage,  public  health,  etc

. - matters  which  hitherto  have  been  within   the

jurisdiction  of  the  City Council  and  the  Rural

Board - and  vests the necessary statutory  powers  in

Government officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only new legislation is in Part VII which

establishes  District  Offices  and  gives   certain

powers to District Officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enactment of this Bill will formally complete

the   Government's   policy  of  integrating   local

authorities  into the central administration.  Since

it is proposed to refer the Bill to Select Committee

for  closer  examination and since  the  Explanatory

Statement gives the objects and reasons of the Bill,

I  shall confine my remarks to two important aspects

of  the Bill: namely those concerning personnel  and

finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides that all employees of the City

Council  who  are  not  transferred  to  the  Public

Utilities Board shall be transferred to the  service

of the Government at the same rate of pay or as near

as may be the same conditions of service as those on

which  they were employed by the City Council.  Upon

the  coming into operation of this Ordinance,  these

employees will become Government servants  and  will

legally be governed by Government regulations and by

the Constitution. But it is our intention, in so far

as   salaries   are  concerned,  that  all   serving

employees on the permanent establishment of the City



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



Council  shall  be  allowed to retain,  if  they  so

desire, their existing salaries and salary scales on

their transfer to the Government service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to other terms and conditions of

service, it is hoped, in consultation with the Staff

Unions concerned, to bring about a set of conditions

of  service that would be acceptable and which would

be   patterned  on  the  terms  and  conditions  now

applicable  to Government servants. It is  envisaged

that  in  the process certain minor adjustments  and

changes may be necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides that persons transferred

from the City Council who are already members of the

Municipal Provident Fund will continue in membership

of  that  Fund.  In addition, such persons  who  are

eligible for membership of the Fund at the  time  of

transfer to the Government service will retain  that

eligibility.  Officers of the City Council  who  are

not  members of the Municipal Provident Fund nor are

eligible for membership thereof will be governed  by

the  Pensions and Central Provident Fund  Ordinances

in   every   respect  as  they  are  applicable   to

Government  servants. Persons  appointed  after  the

coming  into force of this Bill will, of course,  be

governed  by the Pensions Ordinance and the  Central

Provident  Fund  Ordinance. The  management  of  the

Municipal Provident Fund will be transferred to  the

Government   together  with  all  its   assets   and

liabilities, and the accounts thereof will  be  kept

by    the   Accountant-General.   The   assets   and

liabilities connected with the public loans  of  the

City  Council, including the sinking fund for  those

loans, are to be transferred to the Public Utilities

Board  under  the  Public Utilities  Bill,  but  the

Government  will contribute to the Board in  respect

of  those portions of outstanding public loans which

were  used  to buy assets to be transferred  to  the

Government under this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, the only new provision in this

Bill  is the establishment of District Offices.  The

principal function of District Officers is to ensure

the  adequacy  of various services provided  in  the

districts, to receive representations, and generally

to act as liaison



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



officers  in the districts with respect  to  matters

coming within their jurisdiction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is envisaged that certain functions and powers

of  the  Government  Ministries, in  particular  the

Ministry  of Health and the Public Works  Department

of  the  Ministry of National Development,  will  be

delegated  to the District Officers so that  a  more

efficient and quicker service can be provided to the

people in the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will involve the Government in extra

financial expenditure in the payment of salaries and

operational    expenses   of   various    Government

departments integrated with those of the Government.

These  expenses  were  formerly  chargeable  to  the

Municipal  Provident  Fund. The  amounts  cannot  at

present  be fully ascertained but will be  dependent

on the services to be provided and improvement works

to  be  carried  out  by  the Government  under  the

Ordinance. However, this extra financial expenditure

is  in  reality  not so for these  services  had  in

previous  years been borne by the City  Council  and

the Rural Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Government's hope that when the

administrative  machinery of  integration  is  fully

implemented there should, over a period, be  overall

savings  to the Government in that additional  costs

from duplication of functions and services will have

been reduced, if not totally removed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> This Bill is namely a re-enacting Bill

which is, at the same time, seeking to integrate the

services now carried on statutorily under the  Local

Government Ordinance into the Government. As such, I

have nothing much to say. But there are two or three

provisions  in  this  Bill  which  seem  to  involve

questions  of principle which I think I might  raise

straightaway.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under clause 2, the repeal of any

Bill  leaves  any regulations under the Repeal  Bill

effective as law,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there is a proviso which goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`.... that the Minister may by order vary, amend,

extend  or  revoke  such subsidiary  legislation  so

remaining in force or any part thereof as he  thinks

fit.'



<br><br>You   will  notice,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  that   the

operative words there are "may by order". There is a

provision  to  clause  182  for  regulations.  Under

clause  182 -  "The Minister may make  Regulations...".

And  under  sub-clause (7) of that clause - "All  such

regulations shall be published [and laid before  the

Assembly and the Assembly can take a certain line of

action if it so desires]." The question I would like

to  ask the Minister is this, whether an order under

clause  2  will  be deemed to be a regulation  under

clause 182. If it is not, then it gives the Minister

a whole host of powers to alter the law as he wishes

without  consulting the Assembly,  or  the  Assembly

being  in any position to revoke that order made  by

the Minister. That is the first point. That seems to

be  a  clause  in derogation of the  rights  of  the

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the terms of clause 9 are not understood.

Normally when one service is being transferred to an

existing   service   or  two  services   are   being

integrated, the posts are held in the same way  that

they   were  before  integration,  and  the  persons

holding the posts would hold those posts. But I seem

to get the impression from this proviso that in some

cases even the holders of the posts cannot hold  the

new  "integrated"  posts - if  I  may  call  it  that

without   the   approval  of  the   Public   Service

Commission,   unless   I  have   misunderstood   the

provision.  But  it  looks  to  me,  on  the   first

reading - or  even  the second and  third  readings - of

this clause, that there may be posts coming into the

Government in respect of which the approval  of  the

Public  Service Commission would be necessary before

they can be confirmed insofar as the present holders

are  concerned. If my interpretation is  correct  it

seems to be an unusual provision which has not  been

availed of before in respect of other services which

have already been integrated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other provision which I am not clear about is

the  transfer  to the Government of the  assets  and

liabilities of the City Council and the Rural Board.

Apparently,  the assets which are to be  transferred

are  at the end of the year 1960. I ask the Minister

why  at the end of the year 1960, and why not up  to

the  time when integration takes place, because  the

City Council as such does, in fact, now exist and it

must be holding assets now? So why the provision  in

clause  5  to  the  effect that it shall  only  take

effect  insofar as the assets of the Council  as  at

1960 are concerned?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Goh, in reply.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, as regards clause 2 and

clause  182,  the position as I see it is  this.  In

clause  2  (2) , the Minister is empowered  to  vary,

amend,   extend   or   revoke  existing   subsidiary

legislation.  I  think the Member  for  Farrer  Park

agrees  that this is a reasonable provision because,

where  by-laws  and regulations have already  passed

and    are   now   found   to   be   working   quite

satisfactorily, there is no reason why  they  should

be revoked and not allowed to continue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the point he has made in respect of clause 182

is  that  he  thinks in some way or  the  other  the

jurisdiction of the Assembly would be restricted  in

respect of ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> On a point of explanation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I am not saying that the Minister

should  not have that power. By all means,  let  him

have  that  power. All I say is that  once  he  acts

under  clause  2,  then such an  order  should  come

within  the ambit of clause 182 (7) . That is  all  I

say.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think the point the Member for

Farrer  Park  is  making is worth  looking  into  in

Select Committee. If, in fact, the objections to the

Bill as it now stands which he has raised cannot  be

overcome,  then  I think the Select  Committee  will

certainly look into the matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as regards the proviso to sub-clause (1) of

clause 9, I think this is really a requirement which

follows  on  the  Singapore  Constitution  in   that

certain posts in the Government service can only  be

filled  by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara acting on  the

advice  of  the  Public Service Commission,  and  on

integration certain posts which were formerly in the

City   Council  are  now  part  of  the   Government

establishment  and  as such the incumbents  must  be

approved by the Public Service Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the date of the transfer of the assets,

we have decided on the end of 1960, the reason being

that  the effective date of integration will be  1st

January,  1961. Therefore, it does seem to  me  that

31st December, 1960, gives the correct date on which

assets should be listed as value for the purpose  of

transfer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Bill be referred to a Select Committee

consisting  of  Mr  Speaker as  Chairman  and  such

Members  as  may  be nominated by the  Committee  of

Selection.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Does the Minister not consider that

the same Committee appointed to look into the Public

Utilities Bill could very well look into this  Bill,

or does he require a different Committee?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The same.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Then the motion will be that the Bill

be  referred  to the Select Committee to  which  the

Public  Utilities  Bill has been committed  by  this

Public  Utilities  Bill has been  committed  by  the

<div align="center"><b>PLANNING (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>3.33 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I have His Excellency  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's recommendation that the Bill be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>



proceeded with. I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Planning Ordinance,

1959,  on  account of the integration of  the  City

Council  with the Government and is solely concerned

with staffing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that on the abolition of the

Singapore Improvement Trust in February 1960,  about

89  employees of the Trust were transferred  to  the

Planning  Department in Government and the remainder

to  the Housing and Development Board. The employees

of  the  Trust who were transferred to the  Planning

Department were members of the staff engaged in  the

planning  functions of the Trust.  Their  terms  and

conditions     of    service,    including     their

superannuation, were governed by the same  rules  as

applied to the employees of the City Council. It has

been  the  intention  that the staff  of  the  Trust

transferred  to  the  Planning  Department  and  the

employees   of  the  City  Council   who   will   be

transferred  to  the Government as a consequence  of

the  integration  should enjoy the  same  terms  and

conditions of transfer and superannuation. In  order

to  ensure that these former employees of the  Trust

would enjoy similar superannuation benefits as those

applicable to employees of the City Council who  are

to  be transferred to the Government as a result  of

the  integration, it is necessary  to  commence  the

Planning   Ordinance   to  provide   for   identical

provisions   as  those  contained   in   the   Local

Government Integration Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extension of the benefits of the Government's

pension  scheme  to former Trust  employees  in  the

Planning  Department will involve the Government  in

some  small  expenditure.  In  a  few  cases,  these

persons  will  find the benefits of the Government's

pension scheme greater than those to which they were

entitled  in  their  previous  employment  with  the

Trust.  It is most probable that in these few  cases

they  would  choose the benefits of the Government's

pension   scheme.   The  exact   costs   cannot   be

ascertained until their final retirement. But in all

probability there will only be a few cases and it is

unlikely  that  the additional cost  would  be  very

large.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir,

I  beg  to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Pensions Ordinance,

1956.  It  provides for pension and other retirement

benefits  of persons transferred to the  service  of

the  Government from the City Council, the Singapore

Improvement  Trust and the Tan Tock  Seng  Hospital.

The  superannuation schemes to which  they  belonged

prior  to  the  transfer generally allowed  them  to

continue  membership  in their  respective  schemes.

They  could also count their service before transfer

as  service reckonable for pension on their eventual

retirement. As matters stand, such a person would be

eligible  on his retirement for benefits  under  his

own  superannuation  scheme as  well  as  retirement

benefits  under the Government pension scheme.  This

is    clearly   contrary   to   the   principle   of

superannuation.  It  is,  therefore,  necessary  for

provision to be made to enable employees transferred

from  the  City Council, the Trust and the Tan  Tock

Seng  Hospital to choose to receive benefits  either

from  their own superannuation scheme or those under

the Government pension scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the aspect of death benefits. The

Government's pension scheme, as it stands,  requires

the  payment  of at least one year's salary  in  the

form  of  a  death gratuity to the dependants  of  a

deceased  officer.  As  on  their  transfer  to  the

service  of  the Government, employees of  the  City

Council,  the  Trust and the Tan Tock Seng  Hospital

become  Government officers, their dependants  would

be entitled to a death gratuity or one year's salary

should  they die in harness. The existing provisions

for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



payment  of  a  death  gratuity  do  not  take  into

consideration death benefits to which a  transferred

person  may be eligible under his own superannuation

scheme.  If  this situation is allowed to  continue,

then  transferred persons would be better  off  than

Government servants who have only the pension scheme

to  rely on for benefits. For this reason, provision

has  been made in the Bill for the quantum of  death

gratuity  payable  under  the  Government's  pension

scheme  to be reduced to the extent of contributions

paid  to  the  superannuation  scheme  to  which   a

transferred person belonged by his previous employer

and Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Housing and

Development  Ordinance, 1959, so as to  bring  about

uniformity  of provisions relating to superannuation

of  the  staff between that Ordinance and the Public

Utilities  Bill. The latter contains provisions  for

the  appointment  of trustees in respect  of  monies

payable on the death of an employee of the Board out

of  any  superannuation scheme to which he belonged.

There is also provision in the Public Utilities Bill

for the safeguarding of benefits under the Municipal

Provident   Fund  of  employees  of  the   Singapore

Improvement Trust who have been transferred  to  the

Housing and Development Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving the Second Reading of the Planning

(Amendment)  Bill,  I explained  the  necessity  for

parallel  provisions  in  legislation  relating   to

superannuation and terms and conditions  of  service

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>



employees of the Trust who have been transferred  to

the  Housing and Development Board and the  Planning

Department  and  of the City Council  employees  who

will   be   transferred  to  the  Government.   That

explanation holds good here. If I may reiterate,  it

is that Trust employees were on terms and conditions

of service, including superannuation, identical with

those of the City Council employees. It will not  be

equitable, therefore, to provide varying  terms  and

conditions  of service and superannuation  on  their

transfer  to the Housing and Development  Board  and

the Planning Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>3.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move

the motion standing in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House resolves that the people of

Singapore  be asked to express their choice  on  the

mode  and manner of the inevitable reunification  of

the  two  territories and that a referendum be  held

for the people to decide between the alternatives of

reunification on the basis of



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the constitutional arrangements set out in

Paper  Command  33  of 1961  giving  Singapore

autonomy in education and labour; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a complete and unconditional merger as a state

on an equal basis with the other eleven states

in    accordance   with   the   constitutional

documents of the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the Order Paper appears an amendment in the

name of the Member for Cairnhill whereby he seeks to

add  to  the  two alternatives (a) and (b)  a  third

alternative, `or (c) to enter Malaysia on  terms  no

less  favourable  than  the  terms  for  the  Borneo

territories'. In moving this motion, it will  assist

the debate if I make it clear at the outset that  it

is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



the  Government's intention to accept the  amendment

moved  by  the  Member for Cairnhill,  and  I  shall

discuss the three alternatives posed as set  out  in

(a),  (b)  and  (c). This motion we are  asking  the

House to accept will put the issue of merger to  the

people  in  a simple and clear-cut manner. Everybody

in  this  House  has agreed that  threre  should  be

merger and the people will be asked by this motion ---



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification, Mr

Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Surely.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, with reference to the

desire   of  the  Prime  Minister  to  discuss   the

amendment   to  be  proposed  by  the   Member   for

Cairnhill, does that necessarily mean that  we  will

have   to  follow  suit,  or  can  we  discuss  that

amendment when it is made?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It would be for the convenience of the

Assembly   if  that  amendment  could  be  discussed

together with the motion standing in the name of the

Prime  Minister.  But if it is not convenient,  then

Members  are  entitled to say their piece  when  the

Member for Cairnhill moves his amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, when I moved the

motion  for  the guillotine, after consideration  of

the  two  motions,  it was decided  that  the  three

motions,  one  standing  in  my  name,  another  two

standing in the names of the Member for Anson  - item

10* - and the Member for Queenstown - item 11+ - should also  be  guillotined for 12 midnight on  Wednesday.

Sir,  I  would not wish in any way to conscribe  the

capacity   for  word  formation  and   practice   in

elocution  by  any Member in this Assembly  if  that

would  help  that person's political career.  But  I

would suggest, not only for the convenience of the



<hr size="2" noshade>

*That this Assembly calls upon the Government to make arrangements (a) to ascertain the will

of the people of Singapore in respect of the proposed constitutional changes by way of a

referendum on the following question only:"Do you accept the proposed closer constitutional relations

with the Federation of Malaya as incorporated in Command Paper No.33 of 1961, a copy of which is attached

to the Order for this Referendum"; and (b) to name Polling Day as a day four weeks from the date of the Order therefor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+That this House condemns the Government for its dishonest and malicious distortion of the Opposition's stand on the

Merger issue, whereby it seeks to mislead and confuse the people in the forthcoming referendum.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



House  but also for the effectiveness of the  debate

and  the  presentation of the arguments,  that  each

Member,  if  everybody agrees, should speak  on  all

three  motions  and the amendment  proposed  by  the

Member for Cairnhill.





<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, if that is convenient. I should

imagine that it would be convenient at this stage to

say  that the debate should range over items 10  and

11. That, I take it, is convenient. When we come  to

the   amendment  to  be  moved  by  the  Member  for

Cairnhill,  there is nothing to prevent  any  Member

from  ranging over that amendment. But, as I say,  I

cannot,  under  the  Standing  Orders,  compel   all

Members to range over that amendment at this  stage.

But  there  is  nothing, as I said, to  prevent  the

Prime Minister and any other Member who wishes to do

so to range over that amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps the

procedural point can be settled if, after I close my

opening  remarks and the question has been put,  the

Member  for  Cairnhill will be available immediately

to move his amendment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is exactly the difficulty. I

think  Members  have  before them  a  notice  of  an

amendment  which has been filed by  the  Member  for

Queenstown. It is in line 3 of the Prime Minister's

motion, to leave out from "their" to the end and  to

insert ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"wishes on the inevitable reunification of the two

territories  and that a referendum be held  for  the

people  to decide whether they accept or reject  the

constitutional arrangements set out in Paper Command

33 of 1961".



<br><br>So  that  the procedure will be that that  amendment

will have to be disposed of first before we can pass

on  to  the amendment to be moved by the Member  for

Cairnhill. That is only procedural. But in so far as

the debate is concerned, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



I  have indicated, the debate may range over all the

motions and all the amendments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I shall continue my

opening on the lines that you have indicated to  the

House.  The people will be asked by this motion  and

the   amendment  to  be  moved  by  the  Member  for

Cairnhill to decide between three alternatives:  (a)

merger under the White Paper terms; (b) complete and

unconditional  merger as a state on an  equal  basis

with the other eleven states, and (c) enter Malaysia

on  terms no less favourable than the terms for  the

Borneo  territories. Sir, 33 Members of  this  House

have supported the proposals set out in the heads of

agreement  in  Cmd. Paper 33 of 1961. Of  the  other

Members,  13 in the Barisan Sosialis, through  their

Party  Chairman, in September last  year  asked  for

complete  merger like Penang and Malacca;  three  in

the  United People's Party, through their Secretary-General,  the Member for Hong Lim, in a radio  forum

on  the  14th of June this year, the proceedings  of

which  are  recorded on the tape, asked for  merger

terms - and  I quote - "parallel to Johore";  and  one

Member,  the Workers' Party, through their Chairman,

the  Member for Anson, in this Assembly on the  23rd

of  November  asked  for - and I quote - "complete  and

unconditional merger" - and again I quote - "on an equal

basis  with the other States". Sir, only one  Member

in  this  House, the Member for Joo Chiat,  has  not

expressed his views on the type of merger we  should

have. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is true that subsequently

at  a radio forum which was broadcast on the 14th of

June this year, the Member for Hong Lim said the Bansan  Sosialis - and I quote his words again - "have once

made  a  mistake and that since their mistake,  they

have  asked  for automatic conversion of  Singa-pore

citizens into Federation citizens." It is also  true

that  the  Member for Anson, in the  same  forum  on

behalf of the Barisan Sosialis ---



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> --- the proceedings of which are

on the tape, I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



know whether he had the authority to speak on behalf

of  the  Barisan  Sosialis, but he spoke  with  such

vehemence  in  the presence of the Party  Chairman,

the  Member for Queenstown, who remained so  silent,

overawed  by  the occasion, that I thought  he  must

have  had  the  authority to speak  on  his  behalf.

However, that is a matter for them to clear up.  But

what  he did say, and what was recorded on the tape,

is  this:  "Barisan Sosialis mistakenly used  Penang

and  Malacca",  I  quote the words  in  the  debate,

"mistakenly  used Penang and Malacca", and  I  quote

the  Member  for  Anson's exact  words,  "They  have

admitted  their  mistake. They have  withdrawn  it."

Now, Sir, whether ---



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> What date?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> "They have admitted their

mistake. They have withdrawn it."



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> What date?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> It is at the, radio forum on

14th  of  June, at the top of page 10. "They  merely

used  Penang  and  Malacca  because  there  were  no

citizens  of  Penang and Malacca  there.  They  have

admitted their mistake. They have withdrawn it." Mr

Speaker, Sir, whether or not the Opposition  Members

made  a mistake in asking for complete merger  like

Penang  - or Malacca or Johore or, as the Member  for

Anson says, "complete and unconditional merger as  a

state on an equal basis with the other states,"  the

fact  remains  that  there can be no  constitutional

mistake,  because the constitutional  terms  of  the

other 11 States are questions of fact which can  be

determined   by   a  study  of  the   constitutional

documents  of  the  Federation  of  Malaya,  namely,

first,  the Federation of Malaya Agreement of  1948,

second,   the   Federation  of  Malaya   (Amendment)

Agreement,  1952, third, the Constitution,  of  the

Federation   of  Malaya,  1957,  and  fourth,   Nine

Nationality Laws of the Nine Malay Sultanates.  Sir,

the  terms therefore under which the 11 States  were

brought   together  and  the  laws  regulating   the

acquisition of citizenship by the people of  the  11

States  can  be spelt out from these documents.  The

Barisan Sosialis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



have  subsequently  said that  they  want  automatic

conversion  of Singapore citizenship into Federation

citizenship and there has been support  now  by  the

Member  for Anson and the Member for Hong Lim.  Sir,

if  the constitutional documents contain either,  by

precedent or by analogy, provisions to support  such

a  claim, then I say, let a judicial or any fair and

impartial tribunal so find it. But if, in fact,  the

constitutional documents contain no such  provisions

upon  which  such a claim can be founded,  then,  of

course,  the  claim will be rejected. The  words  in

alternative  (b)  that have been spelt  out  in  the

motion - "complete and unconditional merger" and  the

phrase "as a state on an equal basis with the  other

states" are those that have been used by the  Member

for  Anson. Sir, he, being the lawyer amongst  them,

has  used  words which more legalistically  describe

what   the  Barisan  Sosialis  have  ineptly  called

"complete merger like Penang and Malacca", and which

the  Member for Hong Lim has described as  "complete

merger  parallel to Johore". He said in  Hansard  of

the  23rd  of  November, 1961, col.  557,  with  his

eloquent rhetoric on that occasion:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`And, Sir, in case there is any suggestion as to

when I and My Party....'.



<br><br>Sir,  I  do not know whether the Government Printer

was  given  the recording on the tape, but obviously

the  importance of that occasion did not escape him,

because  he printed "I" and "My" in capitals - "I  and

My   Party" - no  doubt  after  the  script  had  been

corrected  by the Member for Anson. And  it  is  the

importance  of  this  occasion for  the  Member  for

Anson.  "I and My Party" said he; not small "m"  and

small  "i" but a big "M" and a big "I", Mr Speaker,

Sir ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Prime

Minister ought to bring the Government Printer  into

the  debate.  I  do  not know whether  that  was  an

alteration made by the Member for Anson. He will  be

able to tell us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No doubt at the appropriate

moment,  he  will elucidate and give the  House  the

engaging reason



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>



why  the words are printed in black type. But anyway

he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... began to believe in merger, here is a dog-eared

copy  of  the very first and the only party platform

of the Workers' Party...'.



<br><br>I  do  not know whether all the others had been lost

or  are in storage. Undoubtedly he had the authentic

copy and brought it to this House ---



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> We do not change our Party platform

like the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> True, Sir. They only had one

copy  left  and they brought it to this Chamber.  We

had the privilege of hearing him quoting:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`.... on its formation in December of 1957.'



<br><br>That  was  before Mr Chang Yuen Tong,  whom  I  had

occasion  to  refer to, left the Party in  a  hurry.

However:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In the very first paragraph and in the very first

sentence, it says...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pity "it" is not in capitals, Sir. I think it all

refers to the same thing:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"The basis and framework of all policy must be

recognition   of   the  fact   that   Singapore   is

geographically, ethnically, and economically part of

Malaya  and  the only healthy ultimate  solution  is

integration with Malaya on an equal basis with other

states.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is miraculous that we used that phrase "on

an equal basis with other states"...'.



<br><br>Sir,   the  words  in  the  motion  have  studiously

followed the words of the Member for Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he went on with great eloquence, beginning at

the bottom of 561, to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, the people of Singapore, I believe, recognise

that  if we want unity, if we want equal privileges,

we   must  carry  heavy  responsibilities.  We  must

recognise that there can be no reality of unity,  no

identification of the Federation and Singapore if we

pursue different policies in education and labour. I

do  honestly believe, Sir, that the P.A.P. errs when

it says that the people of Singapore will not accept

that the whole of Malaya should be in control of our

education and labour policies. I believe that if the

issue were put to the people of Singapore, ---'



<br><br>"if the issue" - this is the issue. We agree with him ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"Do you want unconditional merger complete or do

you  want the P.A.P. White Paper?" We would have  90

per  cent of the people voting for unconditional and

complete merger.'



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> What date is that?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> 23rd of November, in the year

of the Lord, Anno Domino 1961 ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Domini.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Domini. Sir, I have always had

a  faulty  Latin conjugation. I must thank  you  for

reminding  me that I used to neglect my  work.  But,

nevertheless, what I am grateful to the  Member  for

Anson for is having put in legalistic language words

which we have now found most appropriate to pose  as

a  second alternative of the three choices to be put

before the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make this point, that what we

are  doing now is exactly what the Member for  Anson

wanted us to do, to put the issue in those words. We

have,  of  course,  I hope with due  decorum  and  a

little bit of modesty, left out the P.A.P. from  the

description  of  the White Paper as  adopted  by  33

Members  of this Assembly. But if it is the wish  of

the  Opposition  that their names should  appear  as

adjectives to the second alternative, I think we  on

this  side of the House are quite willing  to  allow

them to describe the second alternative as sired  by

them. Since it is a motley crowd, it is difficult to

know out of whom which was sired. But, nevertheless,

we  are  quite prepared not to allow this to  be  an

abortion  because abortions are horrible things.  We

will  allow them to put their hallmark on the second

alternative and, as the Member for Anson said in the

third  radio forum of the 27th of June, if  he  were

allowed  to put it exactly in those words, he  would

be quite happy ---



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Oh, be fair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Why? Nevertheless, Sir, I will

leave  it to him to qualify and requalify, but those

words are on the tape and can be verified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Indeed, Sir. You have on several

occasions pulled up, for example, the Member for Nee

Soon  for  misquoting Members of  the  Assembly  in

respect of statements allegedly made by them. I say,

in this instance, that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>



Prime   Minister   is  misquoting  and   consciously

misquoting.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If indeed it is an actual misquote,

then   it   is   wrong.  But  if  it   is   just   a

misrepresentation of the meaning of what the  Member

for  Anson said, then the Member has a chance  later

on  of  correcting that misrepresentation. Is  it  a

misquote?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, Sir, I must regretfully

disagree  that it is a misquote. The tape  is  there

and  it  can  be checked and verified. Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  if you will give me permission, I shall  bring

the tape into this Assembly. But ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I understood that the words on

the tape have been transcribed on foolscap paper and

if that transcription is read, that will suffice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> As you wish, Mr Speaker, Sir.

I think the force, the vitality and the eloquence is

lost  in  the  transcript. However,  I  accept  your

ruling.  I  need  only  say that  I  hope  you  have

followed  me  accurately on the report  in  Hansard.

Nobody could complain that the Hansard, which has no

doubt   received  prior  scrutiny  by  the   author,

represents  his  exact expression and  intention  of

meaning. However, I shall leave the Member for Anson

in  due  course with his voluminous tomes to explain

away all the erudite statements that he has made.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> What?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On the question of economic

integration  with the Federation and  on  the  issue

that is to be put to the people - the two issues: (a)

the White Paper which he labels P.A.P. and which  we

say   White   Paper;   (b)  merger,   complete   and

unconditional as a State equal to any of  the  other

States. Sir, there are precedents for putting  these

alternatives for the choice of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will read out briefly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Newfoundland Referendum in 1947, the people

were asked to choose:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Whether they wanted to remain a colony of

Britain; in effect, that was what it meant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To be independent by themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.To be federated with Canada.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choice of the people was the third - federation

with Canada.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again in the referendum held in the Trust

Territories of the Cameroons in February last  year,

supervised  by the United Nations, the  people  were

asked whether they wished to be independent:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) by joining Nigeria;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) by joining the Republic of the Cameroons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The North chose to join Nigeria, and the South

chose to join the Republic of the Cameroons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I told the House on Friday last, in Uganda, the

fate  of  two  lost counties is to be decided  by  a

referendum which will ask the people of the two lost

counties to choose between three alternatives:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To remain under the rule of the Kingdom of

Buganda;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To be transferred to the Kingdom of Bunyoro's

rule;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To remain permanently under the Central

Government of the Federation which will include

Buganda and Bunyoro.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was never suggested that the people should

choose  to remain lost counties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The course we are

adopting,  therefore,  is supported  by  reason  and

precedents.  11  States have come  together  in  the

Federation  of Malaya. By reason and  logic  we  are

entitled to as much as what was afforded to  the  11

States.  I  have said before, and I repeat  it  now,

that it is the duty of the Government to see that we

are  treated  as  favourably as  any  of  the  other

States.  But  I  cannot promise to  get  terms  more

favourable than those for the 11 States. Alternative

(a),   which  is  Cmd.  Paper  33  of  1961,  giving Singapore

local autonomy in education and labour, is a  variation  of  the

norm of the terms  of  the  11 States.  We  believe, Sir, that this

is a  variation for the better to suit the special circumstances  of

Singapore,    because   of   Singapore's    separate developments since

its separation in 1945  from  the rest of the Straits Settlements and Malaya,

separate developments particularly in policies in labour  and education,

and  also  because  of  the  fact   that citizenship has already





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>



been  granted  by registration to some 340,000  non-Singapore   born  persons  under  laws  which   were

different from those in the Federation. But although

we  believe  that these arrangements  in  the  White

Paper  are  better  than complete and  unconditional

merger as a State in the Federation, nevertheless we

shall  bow to the will of the people if they  choose

complete and unconditional merger in preference to a

merger  which bestows on us or leaves us with  large

powers of local autonomy, not just in education  and

labour, but health, welfare and so on as set out  in

the White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the haze of the dust churned up by wilful

and  malicious  propaganda, it might  be  useful  to

remind everybody what is the meaning of complete and

unconditional merger, and how it compares  with  the

constitutional arrangements in the White Paper which

the Barisan Sosialis and their Communist stooges and

friends and sympathisers have chosen to describe  as

a  phoney merger. Sir, in a complete merger, even if

for the sake of argument we asume that the condition

asked  for  by  the  Barisan Sosialis  of  automatic

conversion of citizenship were granted and agreed to

by  all  the  other 11 States, first, education  and

labour  will  have to be controlled by  the  Central

Government,  and  all  our revenue  which  pays  for

labour, education, welfare, health services and  all

the  other powers of local autonomy will have to  go

to  the  Central Government to defray  the  cost  of

these  services. On the other hand, the White  Paper

proposals leave more than 75 per cent of our revenue

at   the   disposal  of  the  Singapore  Legislative

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It is 75 per cent now!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, under complete and

unconditional merger, this Assembly will become like

any  of  the other Assemblies in the 11 States.  Its

powers  will  be  reduced to  those  of  Penang,  or

Johore, or Pahang, or Perlis; multi-lingualism  will

cease, and many of the present hon. Members in  this

House  will not be eligible to sit in the  Singapore

State Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, certain constitutional preferences which the

Communists   and  their  stooges  have  consistently

attacked  as  Malay  privileges  will  have  to   be

observed. For example,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>



the  allocation of scholarships, entry  into

the  civil service on a 4 to 1 basis, preference  to

Malays,  where other things are equal  in  order  to

help  them  in  business  and  such  things  as  bus

licences, tenders, and so forth-all these provisions

regarding  preferences will not apply  in  Singapore

under alternative (a), the White Paper Agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill's amendment which

will  offer  the people alternative (c)  will  allow

them  to choose terms no less favourable than  those

for  the  Borneo territories, if they consider  that

these  terms  are  more suitable to  Singapore  than

either  (a)  merger under the White  Paper,  or  (b)

complete and unconditional merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am obliged. It is rather

important,  Sir.  Would the Prime Minister  indicate

whether he anticipates that the terms offered to the

Bornean  territories would be published at the  time

the referendum is taken?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I have no desire to

anticipate the conference in London which is to take

place, as I understand it, at the beginning of  next

week.  I  am arguing here on the basis of  principle

that  whatever is offered to the Borneo territories,

no  less  favourable  terms  should  be  offered  to

Singapore.  That is the proposal made by the  Member

for  Cairnhill and I accept it unreservedly. And  no

doubt if the alternative is pursued, all those terms

will have to be published.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is reason and logic in this: since we

are  all  going to be States in one Federation,  the

terms that bring us together, although they may vary

because  of  our  differing  circumstances,   should

nevertheless be substantially equal. What is offered

to  the  Borneo territories may not be suitable  for

Singapore,  but whatever is offered to  the  Borneo

territories must also be offered to Singapore if the

people   of   Singapore  prefer   these   terms   to

alternative (a) the White Paper, or (b) complete and

unconditional  merger.  We  accept  this  amendment,

therefore,  that  the  people  be  offered  a  third

choice, to enter Malaysia on terms no less favourable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



than the terms for the Borneo territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I noticed from yesterday's newspapers that

some  19  Opposition  Members have  written  to  the

United  Nations  giving their views  on  the  coming

merger and the referendum. They have made scurrilous

and  unfounded allegations. I need hardly say,  Sir,

that  we  on this side of the House fear nothing.  I

say  to  this House now, and I say it to  any  other

Assembly  or any other august tribunal, be  it  from

the  United Nations or any of its agencies, that  we

can  prove  that  these alternatives  posed  in  the

referendum  can withstand the closest  scrutiny  and

the  most stringent test of reason and logic and the

realities of the position in Malaya and Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first principle of any federation is that all

States are dealt with equally and that the norm,  or

rather, the equivalent of what was given to  the  11

States of the Federation should also be available to

any  new  member  if the new member desires  it.  If

there is to be any variation, it will be a variation

from  this  norm with something added and  something

subtracted, the result being more or less the  same.

We say that the White Paper is that variation of the

norm   which   suits  Singapore  best.  The   Borneo

territories  will have terms worked out  which  will

suit  the Borneo territories best. I repeat: if  the

people  of Singapore desire the terms either of  the 11 States of the present Federation, or of the three

States  of  the  Borneo territories, then  they  are

entitled  to  them, and the Government  will  ensure

that their wishes are complied with. But to get more

than what was given to the 11 present States of  the

Federation or more than what is to be given  to  the

three Borneo territories is something not within the

realms  of reality. To put as an alternative  choice

to  the  people something which is not possible,  as

has   been   suggested  by  some  Members   of   the

Opposition, would be a fraud on the people - offering

them  on  the  menu something which we know  is  not

contained in the larder. Any Party in this House, be

it  the  S.P.A. or the Workers' Party of the  Member

for  Anson,  is  entitled to  communicate  with  the

Federation Government and the Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



Minister direct and to try and negotiate for  better

terms. The Member for Anson has tried and he  knows

what  the  realities are. The Member  for  Cairnhill

cannot  be  unaware  of  the Tunku's  views  on  the

matter.  And  even the Communist-controlled  Barisan

Sosialis,   through  their  open  front   Secretary-General, Mr Lim Ching Siong, in April, a few months

ago,  sent  a  letter to Tunku Abdul Rahman  by  the

personal  hand  of  the Assistant Secretary-General.

What the letter contains presumably is only known to

the  Secretary-General and the Tunku. But  everybody

can  guess  what  this gesture of  peace-making  was

aimed  at.  However, the very fact that neither  the

letter  nor the response of the Tunku to the  letter

has ever been made public ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Even to the Chairman.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> --- probably even to the Chairman

of  the Party, is in itself significant. Unlike  the

Opposition,  the  Government's  duty  is   to   make

practical,  realistic  arrangements  for   the   the

people's  future in Malaysia. We are  not  concerned

with  our  personal  or our Party  future.  That  is

unimportant.  What  is  important  is   the   future

well-being  and security of the people  of  Singapore

and of the people of Malaysia. We have done whatever

is  possible  in  the  White  Paper  proposals.  The

Communists know that when the people choose  between

the   three  alternatives  - (a)  White  Paper,   (b)

complete  and  unconditional merger, and  (c)  enter

Malaysia on terms no less favourable than those  for

the  Borneo territories - the overwhelming choice  of

the people will be for the White Paper. Then the lie

to the propaganda line of the Communists that merger

is phoney will be nailed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall let the events of the next few years,

particularly in the field of economic and industrial

expansion after merger and Malaysia, prove how  real

merger  and the common market is to the daily  lives

of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after merger has been implemented, it is true

that some of the first



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



persons  to find out that merger is not phoney  will

be  the Communists. A very strong Central Government

of  an independent Malaysia will have a tonic effect

on   the   political  stability  and  the   peaceful

conditions in Singapore which will be to the benefit

of  everybody. But, in the meantime, it is our duty,

in  so far as the Communists and their stooges  talk

of  peaceful  action and talk of using peaceful  and

constitutional methods, to allow them to do so in so

far as the law and the rules are observed. It is our

business  to  counter  their  lies.  But  when  this

process  of  registering  the  people's  choice   is

complete,  then all their lies will  have  been  run

down to earth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the purpose of this motion, Sir, to put

three  real  alternatives for the people  to  choose

from,  and I do not think anybody in his right  mind

doubts the outcome.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House resolves that the people of

Singapore  be asked to express their choice  on  the

mode  and manner of the inevitable reunification  of

the  two  territories and that a referendum be  held

for the people to decide between the alternatives of

reunification on the basis of



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the constitutional arrangements set out in

Paper  Command  33  of 1961  giving  Singapore

autonomy in education and labour; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a complete and unconditional merger as a state

on an equal basis with the other eleven states

in    accordance   with   the   constitutional

documents of the Federation of Malaya."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated, the debate may range over the

amendments,  notice of which has been given  by  the

Member  for Queenstown and the Member for Cairnhill,

and items 10 and 11 on the Order Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill)</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Does the Member for Cairnhill desire

to move his amendment?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member for Cairnhill speaks now

to  the  main Question, he will not be able to  move

his amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> No, Sir, It is just to explain

that,  in  view  of  what you  have  said  that  the

amendment of the Member for Queenstown will have  to

be  disposed of first, I will leave it to the Member

for Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Prime Minister has just given an indication that

he is willing to accept three alternatives to be put

to  the  people. I am just wondering, Sir,  when  it

comes  to  that,  whether I  can  put  in  a  fourth

alternative  later on. At the present moment,  I  am

only  moving the amendment standing in my name.  How

does  that fourth alternative come in? I would  like

your guidance, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The difficulty the Member for

Queenstown will be facing is this: if he speaks  now

and  moves his amendment, he is speaking to the main

Question.  Therefore, he will not be  able  to  move

another amendment later on. I would suggest that the

most  convenient  way is for somebody  else  in  the

Party   to  move  that  fourth  amendment,  if   the

amendment is to be moved.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I would like to seek your

guidance  again, Sir, on the motion standing  in  my

name  asking for the condemnation of the  Government

on   the   malicious  falsehoods.  Do  I   have   an

opportunity to reply to that motion?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not know whether the Member

wishes to speak on that motion now?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If he does, perhaps he could speak on

that motion and if it is necessary for him to reply,

then I will consider the point at that stage.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, we have just seen the

P.A.P. distortionists working in this House. When we

interject,  they say we are disorderly. When  we  do

not  interject and observe the rules of debate, they

say we are overawed by the occasion. Even the "I and

My Party" of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



Member  for  Anson  have  been  distorted  to   mean

something  entirely different.  I  think  the  Prime

Minister should be ashamed of himself for the way he

has distorted words and meanings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the mistakes which he talked about, Sir, I

shall  deal with them as I come to that part  of  my

speech which deals with the motion that condemns the

Government   for  their  dishonesty  in  maliciously

distorting the Opposition stand. The Prime  Minister

also  referred  in  passing  to  the  referendum  in

Newfoundland. In the referendum in Newfoundland,  as

we   all   know,  the  people  were  offered   three

alternatives:  (1) to remain as  a  colony;  (2)  to

become  independent;  or (3) to  be  federated  with

Canada. But compared with the alternatives that  are

offered to us today, does the Government offer us  a

chance to be independent?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You want it to be a colony.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Let them put all the

alternatives  down, Sir. Let them put down  all  the

alternatives  which Newfoundland put to  the  people

for  a  referendum. Then it would  be  a  fair  one.

Otherwise,  how can they compare our  referendum  to

the  referendum  in Newfoundland? In addition,  Sir,

may  I  also  remark  in passing  that  Newfoundland

recognised  the  universal  principle  of  a   clear

majority  in  the referendum? If you remember,  Sir,

they  had to hold two referenda because in the first

referendum  there was no clear majority for  any  of

the  choices  offered to the people. In our  present

case  in  Singapore, Sir, we have a dictatorial  and

dishonest Government that do not even recognise  the

universal principle of a clear majority in the  case

of  voting. Sir, as I remarked when I first  sat  on

this  side  of  the House, we are  all  students  of

politics and we will always be learning, Sir, unlike

some  people  who pose as masters but who,  in  fact

grovel at the feet of dictators to learn how  to  be

dictatorial and to be unjust and dishonest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister takes great delight in

talking  of  first principles. He  talked  of  first

principles in the radio



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



forum  on  the  26th of June, 1962.  And  again,  he

talked  of  first principles in his speech  in  this

House  on  the  4th of July when  he  made  a  silly

attempt  to defend and to justify the most abhorrent

and  distatorial clauses 28 and 29 of the Referendum

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion, Sir, requests that the people of

Singapore  be asked to express their choice  on  the

mode  and manner of the inevitable reunification  of

the two territories. Sir, on first principles, I say

that  if you wish to ask the people to express their

choice  on  any matter, then you first consult  them

before you make a decision on the matter. It is only

after  there is full consultation that any  decision

can  be reached. But, in the present instance,  Sir,

the  P.A.P. had already made up their minds and  had

reached  agreement  with the  Federation  Government

before  any  information of the  matter  was  placed

before  the people. The Deputy Prime Minister  first

informed  the leaders of the Opposition on the  26th

of August, 1961, of the agreement already reached in

principle  between the two Prime  Ministers  on  the

23rd  August,  1961.  You see.  Sir,  agreement  had

already been reached in principle when the people of

Singapore were informed of the matter. There was  no

consultation  and the P.A.P. White  Paper  proposals

were a fait accompli.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us trace the events as they were unfolded

before us last year. We had an inkling of the  sell-out  proposals of the P.A.P. while we were still  in

the  P.A.P., and it was because there had been  this

intra-party difference of opinion and views  on  the

matter  and  because of non-consultation that  there

was  a  split  in  the P.A.P., with  the  consequent

formation  of the Barisan Sosialis. We  had  clearly

then  shown  to  the people that the P.A.P. leaders

were  imposing an intra-party dictatorship and  that

they  had deviated from their original P.A.P. stand.

I  dare  say that the Member for Bras Basah recently

discovered the same errors in the P.A.P. leadership.

After  we  had  left the P.A.P. and had  formed  the

Barisan Sosialis, we repeatedly called for a general

election in order that the people of Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



could  elect  a  government more  representative  of

their views on the issue of merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Is

this  sordid  whitewashing of  the  failure  of  the

Barisan  plot  relevant to the  motion  in  my  name

posing the alternatives?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Member for Queenstown is

attacking  the phrase "on the mode and  manner".  He

has  indicated that it should not be there, and that

the  people should have first been consulted  before

that phrase came in that motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Prime Minister hates to be

reminded that he has made promises to the people and

has  broken faith with them. That is why he does not

like  me to repeat all this, Sir. But I think it  is

good  that  we  should  have a  record  of  all  the

infidelity of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We felt, Sir, that the general election should be

held before the P.A.P. Government should commit  the

fate   and  the  future  of  Singapore  to   certain

proposals which the P.A.P. leaders had in mind.  But

the  P.A.P., as expected, did not heed our call.  If

they  had  been  sincere in wanting to  consult  the

people  and in asking them to make their  choice  on

the mode and manner of merger, then they should have

heeded  our  call and held a general election.  But,

no, the P.A.P. leaders were scared. They were afraid

they  would  lose their present posh  jobs  in  air-conditioned rooms, and they did not want to  consult

the  people  in a general election. They, therefore,

countered  the  clamour for a  general  election  in

order  to  let the people express their  choice  and

wishes on a merger issue by offering instead to hold

a  referendum,  and the decision was made  with  the

announcement  on the radio forum in September  1961.

Of  course, another good reason for the decision  of

the P.A.P. to hold a referendum instead of a general

election  was that the Government need  not  resign,

even if the P.A.P. should lose in the referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as it became more and more clear that the

merger proposals of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P. were unacceptable to the people,  the  three

Opposition Parties, namely, the Workers' Party,  the

United  People's  Party  and the  Barisan  Sosialis,

wrote  to  the Deputy Prime Minister on 6th October,

1961,  and  jointly  asked for  a  special  Assembly

sitting  in order to discuss the question of merger,

but  the request of the Opposition Parties was again

refused.  We  asked  that the  merger  proposals  be

discussed  in the Legislative Assembly, but  instead

the  P.A.P. leaders went merrily along ignoring  all

our pleas for consultation on the fate and future of

the people of Singapore. Meanwhile, through pressure

of   public   opinion  and  through  pressure   from

Opposition  Parties asking that the details  of  the

merger proposals be disclosed, there was this "strip-tease"  performance  of  revelation  of  the  merger

proposals in dribs and drabs. Thus, Sir, we can  see

there was no consultation whatsoever of the opinions

and  views of the Opposition Parties. The P.A.P. had

not dared to reveal the details all at once, because

the P.A.P. leaders knew that such a revelation would

raise an outcry against the Government straightaway.

So  the  people  of Singapore did not  know  of  the

merger  proposals until these proposals were  tabled

for  debate  in the House on the 20th  of  November,

1961.  So  what is all this humbug about asking  the

people  to express their choice? Where is the choice

as  freely expressed by the will of the people? Sir,

the  only  genuine  expression  of  choice  will  be

through a general election when the people can elect

a  Party  that puts up the form of merger  proposals

that best meets their approval.



<br><br>4.43 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. did not allow the people this free

expression  of  choice when that free expression  of

choice was most vital and necessary, that is, before

agreement  was reached in principle and  before  the

P.A.P. foisted  on the people their  sell-out  fait

accompli.  The Government's only excuse  to  justify

their  perfidious  act of not having  consulted  the

people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>





on  their  own  future is that the  P.A.P. had  the

mandate from the people when the P.A.P. were elected

to office in 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is another falsehood which the P.A.P.

has  kept on repeating time and time again for  want

of  a  better line. The P.A.P. leaders never  had  a

merger  mandate from the people. The Five-Year  Plan

was  the mandate the P.A.P. received from the people

- the "bible" which the Members of the S.P.A. used to

produce,  whenever they talked of the  P.A.P.  Plan.

But  it looks as if all the promises the P.A.P. made

in the Five-Year Plan have now been clean forgotten.

There  was no talk, Sir, of merger in the speech  of

the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  in  the  first  year,

neither was there a whisper of merger in the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's  speech in the  second  year.  So,

merger, Sir, was never a mandate given to the P.A.P.

And  indeed if the people had decided to vote  in  a

Party  on the merger issue, it is my guess that  the

people  would  have voted in the S.P.A. whose  1959

election  slogan  was,  "If you  want  merger,  vote

S.P.A.,"  especially  as the  Tun  is  on  the  most

friendly  terms  with  the  Prime  Minister  of  the

Federation, whereas the same could not and cannot be

said  of  the P.A.P. And the S.P.A. - the Party  that

had the best prospects for merger at that particular

time,  the Party that had merger as one of its  main

slogans  - suffered a trouncing defeat. This  clearly

demonstrates  that the people of Singapore  did  not

have  merger  on  their minds when  they  voted  the

P.A.P. into office in 1959. Now the P.A.P. want  to

make  this utterly ridiculous false claim that  they

had  a merger mandate from the people. In fact, Sir,

the only time the P.A.P. made any play on merger was

during  the  Anson  by-election  and,  as  everybody

knows,   their  merger  proposals  were   completely

rejected  by  the people in Anson in July  1961.  At

that  time the P.A.P. loudly proclaimed that a  vote

for the P.A.P. was a vote for the P.A.P. merger, and

thinking  that  the P.A.P. were going  to  win,  the

Minister  for Culture took great pains  to  describe

the ward in Anson as the most representative ward in

the  whole  of  Singapore.  All  this  now  Sir,  is

history.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> It

was a stab in the back!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The people of Singapore must

clearly  understand that the P.A.P. never  had  this

mandate on merger. So let us get rid of this  hocus-pocus  of  the  P.A.P. On the other hand,  Sir,  the

P.A.P. had  the  clearest  responsibility - as   was

promised  in  Anson  and subsequently  both  by  the

Deputy  Prime Minister - and by the Prime  Minister - to  put forward their merger proposals to the people

for  acceptance or rejection. There is no necessity,

Sir, to pose alternatives to the people. Indeed,  in

any referendum, Sir, only one single question should

be posed to the people and that question should only

require a simple answer of yes or no.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I explained during the debate on the Referendum

Bill, the correct translation of "referendum" should

be  chyuen  min fu chyueh, that is, the  people  are

asked  to  endorse the Bill or motion that had  been

passed  in  the Legislative Assembly. In  our  case,

Sir, the merger proposals of the P.A.P., as embodied

in Command Paper No. 33 of 1961, have been passed in

the Assembly and these proposals should now be posed

to the people for their acceptance or rejection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now remind the Prime Minister and the other

P.A.P. Ministers of the numerous promises they  have

made to the people of Singapore - promises which they

have now forgotten, but which will bear testimony to

the perfidy of the Prime Minister and the P.A.P. for

years  and years to come. On the 11th of July. 1961,

at  a  mass rally in Anson, the Prime Minister said,

"Merger   must  be  decided  by  the   people,   not

Ministers."  Not  Ministers,  Sir,  "Merger  is   an

important question. If agreement is reached with the

Federation  today," he said, "and the people  reject

it  tomorrow, then that will not do." You  note  the

word  "reject", Sir. To reject means to reject  one

set of proposals, and it does not mean compelling  a

person to chose another alternative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, on the 13th of July, the Prime Minister said

the  same thing. He said that the people will decide

whether or not we want merger, not by a few of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



us  or  by  a  political Party.  But  see  what  has

happened  today. The P.A.P., in the  person  of  the

Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance, decided

on   merger   with  the  connivance  of  the   other

Ministers - not the people - only the P.A.P. decided  on

merger.  And now the people are asked to  choose  on

the  mode and manner of this merger which the P.A.P.

have foisted on the people. Now these are all solemn

words, and the Minister for Finance has always  said

that  the  Prime  Minister  weighs  his  words  very

carefully. According to the Minister for Health  and

Law,  there  is  perfect co-ordination  between  the

Prime  Minister's brain and tongue.  Has  the  Prime

Minister  then forgotten these solemn words  uttered

on  a  solemn  occasion, as promised to the  people?

Sir,  I can quote you umpteen examples of the  Prime

Minister  making  promises  of  placing  before  the

people   the   proposals  for  their   approval   or

rejection,  but  I  will  spare  you  the  ache   of

listening  to  a  catalogue of  broken  promises  by

Ministers elected by the people and who had promised

to  work  for the interests of the people.  Even  on

Teachers'  Day,  Sir,  in  August  1961,  the  Prime

Minister  had told a large gathering of teachers  in

the  Happy  World  Stadium  that  merger  terms  and

conditions  would  be presented to  the  people  for

approval.  You  will  note,  Sir,  that  the   Prime

Minister never said anything about mode and  manner.

There  was no talk about mode and manner of  merger,

Sir.  There  was only one type of merger  which  the

P.A.P. had  in mind - the merger proposals  of  the

P.A.P. which are embodied in Command Paper No. 33 of

1961.  All along, he said-and at times that was  all

he  said - that  the  merger proposals  would  be  put

before  the people for approval or rejection with  a

simple yes or no. That is what the people understood

of  his words - "The people will decide." But see what

has  happened,  Sir? See the way the Prime  Minister

talks  today. He has forgotten the original  promise

of placing before the people the merger proposals he

was  negotiating supposedly on behalf of the  people

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, may I, for the record, remind the House also

of what the Deputy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



Prime  Minister said in a letter to Opposition Party

leaders  on  the  6th of September, 1961?  He  said,

"When  the  deliberations of the working  party  are

completed  and agreement is reached, they will  also

be  published. The people can then either accept  or

reject them." Sir, these are very solemn words  - all

promises made in black and white. Have they  such  a

short memory?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> They have no memory!



<br><br>Dr  Lee  Siew  Choh: I agree with the  Member  for

Cairnhill, Sir, that they have no memory. They  will

only  remember when they once again meet the  people

for their verdict on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, again, on the 14th of October, 1961, the

Prime  Minister  in  a letter to Opposition  leaders

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is the intention of Government when all the

details have been worked out to publish a Paper  and

table  it  in  the Legislative Assembly for  debate.

Then the people can accept or reject them.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note the words, Sir, "accept or reject them". All

these  are  solemn promises, promises  made  to  the

people   that  the  P.A.P. would  allow   them   an

opportunity  to accept or reject the  P.A.P. merger

proposals  as we know them today. And all  this,  of

course,   can   only  be  done  in  a   one-question

referendum.  There  was  never  any  talk,  Sir,  of

alternatives to be put before the people. And in all

the  promises made by the Deputy Prime Minister  and

the  Prime  Minister, the undertaking was  that  the

merger proposals would be posed to the people for  a

clear answer of yes or no, accept or reject, approve

or  disapprove,  in a one-question  referendum.  All

these  are  solemn promises made and are on  record,

and  therefore it is only right and proper that only

one  question on the White Paper Command No.  33  of

1961  be  now  posed to the people  for  the  simple

answer  of  yes  or no. Indeed it would  be  a  true

chyuen  min  fu  chyueh,  because  the  White  Paper

Command  No.  33  has  already been  passed  by  the

Legislative Assembly and this White Paper  must  now

be  taken  to  the  people  for  their  approval  or

rejection. Hence my amendment, Sir. Let us hope  the

Prime Minister will really and truthfully - I use his

own words -" bow to the will of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



people".  Let  us hope that the Prime Minister  will

really bow to the will of the people by posing ---

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am about to finish, Sir ---

just a couple of sentences. I said, let us hope that

the   Prime  Minister  this  time  will  really  and

truthfully bow to the will of the people  by  posing

their White Paper to them for rejection or approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will continue afterwards, Sir.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at rising I

was  speaking on why it was necessary  to  pose  the

White  Paper to the people and to ask them for their

approval or rejection. Accordingly, Sir, I  want  to

move the amendment which stands in my name. But  now

let  us see what alternative is put up by the P.A.P.

for  the  so-called choice of the people. A complete

and  unconditional  merger as a State  on  an  equal

basis  with the other 11 States. Sir, so far  as  we

are  concerned, merger is the political  integration

of  Singapore  and  the  Federation  with  a  common

electoral register and a central administration  and

legislature, i.e. with all citizens sharing a common

citizenship  and with Singapore having  proportional

representation in the Central Parliament.  The  word

"unconditional" can mean many things,  Sir,  but  if

"conditional" means that we get automatic Federal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



citizenship and proportionate representation,  then,

of  course,  that  word will not  be   objectionable.

Otherwise, that word can only be understood  by  the

P.A.P. and it will allow the P.A.P. too  much  room

for  their dishonest manoeuvres. The Prime  Minister

has  said  that  this  second alternative  which  he

offers  as a so-called choice to the people is  what

we  in the Barisan Sosialis have asked for. I do not

know what this alternative really means in spite  of

the  limited explanation given by the Prime Minster.

There  is  no White Paper on this second alternative

and   we  are  in  no  position  to  know  the  true

significance of this alternative with no White Paper

on  it. But it is significant, Sir, that there is no

longer  any  mention in the question  posed  of  the

Penang type merger. Probably this is a new switch of

P.A.P. falsehoods and propaganda. They have come  to

realise  that the people cannot be further  deceived

by  their  malicious falsehoods and their distortion

of  the  Opposition's stand on merger. Sir,  I  will

leave  the third alternative which will be  proposed

by  the  Member for Cairnhill and will hear what  he

has to say before we give our views on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have a motion standing in my name asking

that  this  House  condemn the  Government  for  its

dishonest   and   malicious   distortion   of    the

Opposition's stand on the merger issue,  whereby  it

seeks  to  mislead  and confuse the  people  in  the

forthcoming  referendum. As you  have  indicated.  I

will  now  speak on this aspect of the  debate.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  let me take you back to  the  recent

past  when  the Government indicated, through  radio

talks  and  speeches  by Mr  Jek  Yuen  Thong,  the

Political Secretary to the Prime Minister, the Prime

Minister himself and the Minister for Finance,  that

in   the   forthcoming  referendum  on  merger   two

questions would be posed to the people, namely,  the

Government's merger proposals as embodied  in  White

Paper  Command  33  of 1961, and (2)  the  so-called

Penang/Malacca   type  merger   which   the   P.A.P.

repeatedly  said  would  automatically  disfranchise

half  our citizens in Singapore. The P.A.P., through

their propaganda machine,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



Radio   P.A.P.,   Rediffusion  and  the   partially-controlled  Press had been drumming into the  people

of  Singapore day in and day out that the Opposition

Parties   have   been  advocating   this   so-called

Penang/Malacca  type  merget. The  P.A.P. have  all

along  been  saying, i.e. until very recently,  that

the  reason  why  they offer this so-called  Penang/

Malacca  type  merger  as  an  alternative  in   the

forthcoming  referendum is that they wish  to  allow

the  people  a  chance to choose  between  what  the

Government advocate and what the Opposition  Parties

advocate. Under this pretext of giving our people  a

chance   to   choose,  the  Government   have   been

propagating  the malicious falsehoods  of  this  so-called Penang type merger, a merger which the P.A.P.

allege   is  the  merger  stand  of  the  Opposition

Parties. Now the Prime Minister says it is the  same

as the stand of the U.P.P. which asks for, according

to  the P.A.P., a Johore type merger, and the  stand

of  the  Workers' Party, according to the P.A.P. an

unconditional complete merger. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I

wish to say from the outset that this Penang/Malacca

type  merger  is  nothing but  a  concoction  and  a

fabrication  of  the P.A.P.'s genius for  distortion

and  dishonesty.  No  one  has  advocated  a  merger

arrangement  whereby half the citizens of  Singapore

are going to be automatically disfranchised. We have

publicly  called  the P.A.P. liars for  telling  the

people  that  the Opposition Parties want  a  merger

that  is going to disfranchise half of our citizens,

and  I  charge  them again in this House  for  their

blatant dishonesty and malicious distortion  of  the

stand of the Opposition Parties on the merger issue.

I   charge   the   P.A.P.  Government   for   having

deliberately told our people the naked lie that this

so-called  Penang  type merger of P.A.P. concoction

and fabrication is what the Opposition Parties want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis have repeatedly

stressed  that what we want as a basis  for  genuine

merger is (1) automatic Federal citizenship for  all

citizens   of   Singapore,  and   (2)   proportional

representation  in the Federal Parliament.  Even  as

early as the 28th of August, 1961, i.e., even before

my  Party had its inaugural meeting, we had  made  a

major



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



policy  statement on the merger issue. Let me  quote

just a short paragraph, Sir, from that statement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We declare that if the representatives of the

people  of  the Federation are agreeable to  do  the

same,  we  will  pledge ourselves to  wholeheartedly

exert  our  influence to win the people of Singapore

to  accept full and complete merger forthwith, i.e.,

with   Singapore  as  the  twelfth  State   of   the

Federation   and  Singapore  citizens  automatically

becoming    Malayan   citizens   with   proportional

representation in the Federal Parliament like any of

the present 11 States constituting the Federation of

Malaya.'



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The 27th.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The 28th of August, or the 27th

may  be. Since that statement was made, Sir, we have

consistently   stressed  that   merger   must   mean

automatic   Federal  citizenship  rights   for   all

Singapore   citizens  together   with   proportional

representation. During the inaugural meeting of  the

Barisan Sosialis held on 17th September, 1961,  this

point  was again stressed. The Secretary-General  of

my Party, Mr Lim Ching Siong, said, "What does full

and complete merger mean? It simply means - the entry

of Singapore into the Federation of Malaya as one of

its  constituent States like Penang and Malacca with

all its citizens automatically becoming citizens  of

the Federation and having all the rights, privileges

and  obligations like any of the other  citizens  of

the  Federation.  Singapore  will  thus  become   an

integral  and  separate part of  the  Federation  of

Malaya  having  proportional representation  in  the

Federal   Parliament  like  the  other  States   and

sharing  a common political life and destiny."  When

this  merger issue was finally brought to this House

for debate in November last year, you will remember,

Sir, that we moved an amendment to the motion by the

Minister for Labour in which we asked for a  genuine

merger  of Singapore with the Federation of  Malaya,

with  Singapore  entering  the  Federation  as   the

twelfth    state   and   with   all   its   citizens

automatically  becoming Federal citizens  on  Merger

Day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, that during the debate

that  followed, our stand on merger as  embodied  in

our  amendment had the full support of the  Workers'

Party and the United People's Party.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



Our   amendment,   however,  was  opposed   by   the

Government and the S.P.A. Alliance. Is it not  utter

dishonesty for the P.A.P. Government now to tell our

people  that the Opposition Parties, especially  the

Barisan   Sosialis,   want  a  merger   which   will

disfranchise  half our citizens - these  are  printed

words  solemnly said in this Assembly  and  recorded

for posterity. Is this not clear evidence that it is

the P.A.P. who are against giving citizenship rights

to our people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so very long ago, Sir, the Prime Minister in a

forum  in the University of Singapore said that  the

citizens  of Singapore who were not local born  were

worth   only   one   dollar - just  two   packets   of

cigarettes.  That is the Prime Minister's  valuation

of  the  non-local born Singapore citizens. You  can

imagine  why  the Government refused to  accept  our

amendment! The Prime Minister never gave  a  thought

to  the Singapore citizens who were not local  born,

and  the  way he put a one dollar price on our  non-local  born Singapore citizens is a clear indication

of  the  way our Singapore Prime Minister views  our

Singapore non-local born citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But first let us look into this so-called basis on

which the P.A.P. have distorted the Opposition stand

on   merger.   This   whole   controversy   of   the

Penang/Malacca  type  merger arose  when  we  quoted

Penang  and Malacca as examples of equal constituent

states in our statements on merger. Let me quote  to

you again, Sir, the relevant policy statement of the

Barisan Sosialis made on 28th August, 1961, page  2,

under the heading, "Our Stand on Merger." It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The way ahead for real reunification for our

country  and our people is in one of two directions:

(a)  an  immediate  full and  complete  merger  with

Singapore  joining the Federation as  a  constituent

State  like Penang or Malacca [those fateful  words]

and   (b)   as   an   autonomous   unit   within   a

confederation, with the Borneo territories coming in

when possible.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the statement which has given rise to so

much talk about this Penang type merger. On the same

page  of  this  policy statement  in  the  following

paragraph, Sir, we elaborate on what we mean by full

and  complete  merger  with  Singapore  joining  the

Federation as a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



constituent  state like Penang and Malacca.  Let  me

quote  our statement in its proper context  so  that

the  people can more clearly see how the P.A.P. have

deliberately quoted our statement out of context and

how  they have dishonestly and maliciously distorted

our stand to mean something entirely different.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote, Sir, the paragraph that is the meat

of our stand on merger:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We declare that if the representatives of the

Federation  are agreeable to do the  same,  we  will

pledge   ourselves  to  wholeheartedly   exert   our

influence to win the people of Singapore to accept a

complete  merger forthwith, that is, with  Singapore

as   the  twelfth  state  of  the  Federation,  with

Singapore  citizens automatically  becoming  Malayan

citizens  with  proportional representation  in  the

Federal  Parliament, like any of the present  eleven

states constituting the Federation of Malaya.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will notice that we have specifically

stated  in this statement what we mean by  full  and

complete   merger   with   Singapore   becoming    a

constituent  state like Penang or Malacca.  We  have

specifically emphasised that it must mean  automatic

citizenship  rights  for all the Singapore  citizens

and  the right of proportional representation in the

Federal  Parliament like any of the  present  eleven

states   constituting  the  Federation  of   Malaya.

Nowhere  in this or any other statement made  by  my

Party - or any other Opposition Party for that matter

- has  this  P.A.P. fabricated  Penang/Malacca  type

merger  been  advocated. I challenge the  P.A.P. to

produce  any  evidence to say that  we  the  Barisan

Sosialis or any of the other Opposition Parties have

advocated a merger which will disfranchise half  our

citizens  in Singapore. If they cannot produce  this

evidence, then I say they stand exposed as malicious

liars and dishonest distortionists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we cited Penang and Malacca as examples

of  equal  constituent  states,  it  was  clear  and

obvious  to  anyone who has no evil,  dishonest  and

machiavellian  intentions that we  mentioned  Penang

and  Malacca  as states - nothing else. We  mentioned

Malacca  and  Penang,  because  Singapore  has  more

things in common with these two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



states than with the other states of the Federation.

Singapore,  Penang and Malacca were formerly  member

states  of the Straits Settlements, and, unlike  the

other  nine states of the Federation, they in common

do not have a Malay sultanate. It is obvious that if

Singapore  were to merge with the Federation  as  an

equal  constituent state, we would have in Singapore

a  Governor  not  unlike the  present  Governors  of

Penang  and Malacca instead of having a Malay sultan

like  the  other states in the Federation.  That  is

what we mean and that is what everybody with no evil

and  malicious intentions understands  us  to  mean.

That  is,  everybody,  except the  dishonest  P.A.P.

distortionists, except the warped and twisted  minds

of the P.A.P. genius for distortion and dishonesty.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Let me trace the events as they

unfolded  in  Singapore. You will remember  how  the

P.A.P. cried that it was impossible - now  that  the

Minister  for  Finance  is here  - for  Singapore  to

become  a  constituent state and at  the  same  time

having   all  our  citizens  automatically  becoming

Federal  citizens  with  the right  of  proportional

representation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 1961, the Minister for Finance in a

radio forum pretended to be a constitutional expert.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Come, come!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And he told the people of

Singapore  a  deliberate falsehood  that  under  the

Federal   Constitution   it   was   constitutionally

impossible   for  all  our  Singapore  citizens   to

automatically become Federal citizens on  merger.  I

have completely exposed this falsehood in the merger

debate  and  the Government could not  even  give  a

single answer.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Article 22 of the Federal

Constitution  tells  us that the Federal  Government

have   full  powers  to  decide  on  the  terms   of

citizenship  for  the  people  of  a  new  territory

joining the Federation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Can the Member for Queenstown

tell us whether we can get full automatic conversion

under  Article 22 of the Constitution? Is  that  his

interpretation of Article 22?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Of course, of course.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On that matter, Mr Speaker,

Sir, if I can explain ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister for Finance has

asked a question and I ask the Member for Anson  not

to  interject. Let us have the reply from the Member

for Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister for Finance is very

impatient. I will come to it. Just let him  be  more

patient.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Nobody is impatient.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Now, listen, boy!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Speaker has been called all

kinds  of  names. I do not think he  has  ever  been

called "boy" in this Assembly. Let us remember  this

is  a  serious  debate  and I  ask  the  Member  for

Queenstown to be  serious when addressing the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I have never been more serious,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You are very comical.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Therefore, the question of

citizenship  on merger is essentially a  matter  for

negotiation between the parties concerned.  Let  the

Minister for Finance learn this fact, and learn this

fact  fully.  There  is no such thing  as  automatic

disfranchisement except when agreed upon by the  two

parties concerned.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I hope the Member for Queenstown

will  come to the point quickly. Now, his Secretary-General has written a letter to the Tunku ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Minister for Finance

rises  on a point of elucidation, he must be on  the

point  which has been made by the Member for Queenstown. He must not go to any other point.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the Minister for Finance is

obviously  finding  it difficult.  He  and  all  the

P.A.P. Ministers were so crestfallen when we exposed

their deceit in the debate in November ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You were exposed!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister for Finance just walks

into  this  Chamber and then starts interjecting.  I

would suggest there should be as little interjection

as possible.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> So lost for argument were they

in   November   1961  that  they  had  to   blackout

completely  all our arguments on citizenship.  Radio

Singapore - Radio P.A.P. - had one line on what we said

about citizenship, that is all. If they were honest,

they would allow the people to read and to know what

we  said in that important debate. But they realised

that  they were all wrong and the only way  for  the

P.A.P. at  that time was to shut out what  we  said

from the gaze of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, this falsehood of theirs has been

exposed,  but they still persisted in this falsehood

until  even  the  Prime Minister of  the  Federation

could not stand it any longer. He openly stated that

it  was  possible  for  all  Singapore  citizens  to

automatically become Federal citizens. I am sure the

Minister for Finance would not dare counter this. He

has been grovelling at the feet



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Does the Member for Queenstown give

way? No, he does not give way.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> One need not have to be a lawyer

to    understand   Article   22   of   the   Federal

Constitution. Anyone with average common  sense  can

see  that  Article  22  of the Federal  Constitution

gives  the Federal Parliament complete discretionary

powers  to  decide  on the terms and  conditions  of

citizenship  for  the people of a new  State  to  be

admitted  into  the Federation.  There  is  no  such

thing, as I have said, as automatic disfranchisement

except  by  way of a Bill to this effect passed  in

accordance   with   Article  22   of   the   Federal

Constitution. I have no intention, Sir, of repeating

the  arguments on citizenship, for this has  already

been adequately dealt with during the debate on  the

merger  issue last year. But, Sir, I have  to  bring

out  certain relevant parts again in order to refute

and  expose the lies, the falsehoods and distortions

of the P.A.P. Government. Falsehoods and ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have been watching the use of

this  word  "lies", and I think in  this  particular

context   now   it  is  completely  unparliamentary,

because  it  has  reference to the  Government,  and

Government means the Ministers who take their  seats

in  this  Chamber. Therefore, I ask the  Member  for

Queenstown to withdraw that word and, to be  on  the

safe side, not to use it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I withdraw the word "lies", Sir.

Falsehoods  then  and distortions  which  they  have

persistently   repeated  over   Radio   P.A.P. and

Rediffusion ever since the merger debate last  year.

Falsehoods  and  distortions which  they  hope  some

people might believe if they were repeated long  and

loud  enough.  Sir,  there may be  some  people  who

choose  to  believe that we in the Barisan  Sosialis

made  a  mistake  in citing Penang  and  Malacca  as

examples  of  equal  constituent States.  The  Prime

Minister in his opening speech said that the  Member

for  Hong Lim said, "The Barisan Sosialis have  once

made  a  mistake." The Prime Minister also mentioned

that  the Member for Anson said, "They have admitted

their  mistake. They have withdrawn it."  Sir,  such

comments, as far as we are concerned, may only go to

add  confusion to the P.A.P.'s distortion by  saying

that we in the Barisan Sosialis did not understand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>



what  we  were saying when we mentioned  Penang  and

Malacca  as examples of equal constituent States.  I

must say here, Sir, that we are not responsible  for

anyone  who  chooses  to  believe  that  we  made  a

mistake. As it is, the P.A.P.'s distortionists  have

sufficiently  distorted and twisted  our  statements

into    something   entirely   beyond   recognition.

Therefore,   let  not  other  people  wittingly   or

unwittingly add on to the confusion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we did not make a mistake in our citing Penang

and  Malacca as examples of constituent  States.  If

there  was  any  mistake, it was that we  completely

underestimated the evil genius and the  capacity  of

the  P.A.P. for malicious distortion and dishonesty.

Sir, as can be seen from the radio forum held on the

12th  of  June,  1962,  it  is  clear  that  had  we

mentioned  any other State of the Federation  as  an

example  of  an  equal constituent State,  we  would

still not have escaped the P.A.P.'s evil genius  for

distortion  and dishonesty. You will remember,  Sir,

Johore was mentioned, and since then the P.A.P. have

seized  the  opportunity to say that the Member  for

Hong  Lim  advocated merger like  Johore,  in  which

case,  even  more  citizens would be  disfranchised.

Thus,  there  is now this so-called Johore  type  of

merger  which the P.A.P.'s evil genius makes out  to

be  worse than the Penang type of merger. I can only

say  there  is no limit to the depths to  which  the

evil  genius of the P.A.P.'s capacity for dishonesty

and distortion can sink.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson pointed out the danger of

carrying  an  analogy  too  far.  He  gave  a   very

picturesque example. He said, if we say  a  girl  is

beautiful like a flower, it does not mean  the  girl

thrives on manure. In the radio forum on the 27th of

June,  1962, I quoted another example. I said  if  a

daughter  is asked to grow up like father,  it  does

not  mean that the daughter, when she grows  up,  is

going to be changed into a man. I can give you  many

similar examples, Sir, like the Minister for Finance

and  the  Prime  Minister. If I say that  the  Prime

Minister  drinks like a fish, I am sure  he  is  not

really a fish and the Minister for Finance is not  a

fish.  If I say the Member for Anson smokes  like  a

chimney, I am sure he is not a chimney. Similarly, I

can say that the Minister for Home Affairs is like a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>



woman. He has been talking like a woman, he has been

crying  like  a  woman, acting like a woman,  eating

like  a  woman, but he is not a woman, and  evidence

can be deduced...



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Are these

personal references permissible?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> They are not permissible if they

become  offensive. I take it the Minister  for  Home

Affairs is taking it as a joke.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> They were never meant to be

offensive, Sir, I just wanted lo show the  absurdity

of  their  carrying an analogy to  well  beyond  its

logical  context. It is clear, Sir, that  the  whole

purpose  of  the P.A.P. is to try and  frighten  the

people of Singapore into believing that any type  of

merger, other than the type the P.A.P. want to  give

us  and  are prepared to rig a referendum  to  shove

down   our   throats,  brings  with   it   automatic

disfranchisement  of a good section  of  Singapore's

citizens  - a  malicious  falsehood  which  must   be

thoroughly exposed. We have pointed out before,  and

we  wish  to  emphasize here again,  that  if  there

should  be merger, then all the people who  are  now

citizens  of  Singapore should automatically  become

citizens of the Federation of Malaya on merger,  for

merger  is after all a merger of the peoples of  the

two territories and not just the joining together of

two  pieces of territories. To everyone with  common

sense, this is the only rational, sensible and  fair

way  of  treating this whole question of merger.  If

the  Federation Government is not prepared to accept

all the citizens of Singapore as Federal citizens in

a  united Malaya on merger, then it only means  that

the  Federation  is  not prepared  for  merger  with

Singapore  now. Our stand on this merger  issue  is,

and  has  always been, that both Governments  should

agree  that all persons who are already citizens  of

Singapore  immediately before  merger  day  will  by

operation  of law become Federal citizens.  Such  an

arrangement, as I have already indicated,  could  be

given legal effect in pursuance of Article 22 of the

Federal  Constitution. The Tunku has said  automatic

citizenship  is possible. The only unfortunate  part

of this disgraceful sell-out is that our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>



Singapore Prime Minister went to negotiate with  the

Federation not with the strength and support of  the

people  of Singapore, but on bended knees. I do  not

want  to go much further into it, Sir, but you  will

remember  there was a party split in July  1961  and

immediately  after  that the P.A.P. leadership  was

left  with  an empty shell. The Party was shaken  to

its very foundations and this was openly admitted by

the  Minister for Finance, and recently again by the

Prime  Minister. That is why we could not get better

terms  than what we are getting today. That  is  why

the  P.A.P. cannot offer anything better than  their

so-called merger proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now expose why the P.A.P. have wanted to put

in  this  so-called  Penang type  merger,  why  they

invented this Penang type merger. There are two good

reasons  for  the P.A.P. First, the P.A.P. want  an

excuse to justify posing two questions to the people

in  the  referendum.  The Barisan  Sosialis  is  the

largest Opposition party and has the support of  the

workers  and  the  vast majority of  the  people  in

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It is doubtful.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> All that the Member for Farrer

Park  need  do is to go along to one of our  rallies

and he will find that he cannot even squeeze himself

through. If the second alternative, according to the

P.A.P. thinking, is to be put to the people,  it  is

obvious  that the alternative must be on the  merger

stand of the Barisan Sosialis, that is, full genuine

merger,  but the snag is this, the Barisan  Sosialis

stand  of  full  and complete merger  with  complete

equality  in  common  citizenship  and  proportional

representation would have the support of the people,

and,   under   those  circumstances,  the   P.A.P.'s

proposals would still be rejected. The only way  out

for  the  P.A.P. is to distort the Barisan  Sosialis

stand  into something that will mean the  losing  of

citizenship for half the citizens of Singapore,  and

they   pick   on  these  two  words,  "Penang"   and

"Malacca",  and have been using them all  along,  to

distort our stand. Then, according to P.A.P. way  of

thinking,  it would not be acceptable to the  people

and then only would it be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



safe for the P.A.P. to pose it as an alternative  to

the  people.  So now the P.A.P. claim  justification

for  putting two questions to the electorate in  the

referendum. And so they now talk of "mode and manner

of merger". By this the P.A.P. hope that there would

be   less  objection  to  their  non-democracy   and

unfairness in the operation of the referendum.  Thus

the P.A.P. hope to find an excuse for not posing  to

the  people one simple question that can be  answered

with a simple "yes" or "no".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is one of malicious intent and

has more sting and venom in it, The P.A.P. object is

to   identify   the   Barisan  Sosialis   with   the

unacceptable fictitious Penang type merger.  As  you

know,  Sir,  from  the P.A.P. standpoint,  the  only

opposition  to  them  is the Barisan  Sosialis.  All

their policies and actions have been directed at the

Barisan  Sosialis. You will remember, Sir, they  had

to  admit  that certain provisions in the Referendum

Bill were directed at the Barisan Sosialis. We asked

for  meetings, we asked for rallies,  we  asked  for

conventions,  anything  that  the  Barisan  Sosialis

asked  for, it was always a categorical "no". It  is

because  they fear us that they have from the  first

day  tried to isolate the Barisan Sosialis  by  this

smear  of  Communism  and pro-Communism.  Sir,  they

think that a lie told often enough would be mistaken

for  the truth and, therefore, the P.A.P. propaganda

machine has spared no efforts in trying to drum this

point  into the minds of the people. Day in and  day

out  Radio  P.A.P. and Rediffusion have  been  going

full  blast that the Penang type merger is what  the

Barisan  Sosialis ask for. All their statements  and

speeches,  inside  and outside  the  Assembly,  keep

blurting  out  these falsehoods, this fiction,  this

fabrication of the P.A.P. Such is the devilish  Penang

type  merger plot of the P.A.P. It serves the P.A.P.

in  allowing  them the chance to rig the  referendum

with  two unacceptable questions on two unacceptable

types   of   merger.  It  serves   the   P.A.P. by

disseminating   the  falsehood  that   the   Barisan

Sosialis  want  merger  that  will  cause  half  the

Singapore citizens to lose their citizenship. It  is

not an alternative offer for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



people of Singapore. It is a plot cunningly spun out

of  the evil genius of distortion. It is the fiction

of  people  so intoxicated and corrupted with  power

that  they have completely lost all sense of decency

and fair play.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is a plot to trap and ensnare

voters  into supporting the P.A.P. merger proposals.

It is a plot to compel the voter to put in uncertain

and  blank  ballot papers so that  these  blank  and

uncertain  ballot papers could be deemed to  support

the  P.A.P.  You see, Sir, that is the intention  of

the  P.A.P.'s dishonest and malicious distortion  of

the  Opposition's stand, and especially the  Barisan

Sosialis'  stand  on  the merger  issue.  No  honest

government would distort the stand of the Opposition

on  any issue, least of all on an issue that affects

the  future  of all the people in the country.  That

the   P.A.P. have   dishonestly  and   maliciously

distorted our stand on merger has been proved to the

hilt.  Let  the  House condemn the P.A.P. for  such

dishonesty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the Referendum Bill has been passed and

now  that we have the questions to be posed  to  the

people  clearly indicated, let us see  what  happens

when   the   voter   is   faced  with   unacceptable

alternatives. We have moved the amendment  that  the

referendum should be held on one question, and  that

one  question should be  on the White Paper,  Command

Paper  No.  33 of 1961. If the Government refuse  to

accept our amendment to have only one question to be

posed  to  the  people  in the  referendum,  if  the

Government  refuse  to  let the  Opposition  put  in

acceptable  alternatives  - I  must  emphasise,  Sir,

acceptable  alternatives - as will  be   moved  by  my

Party at the appropriate time, then the people  will

be  left  with no choice whatsoever and the  voters

will be forced to express their protest in only  one

possible  way,  namely,  by throwing  in  blank  and

uncertain  votes,  votes which  are  protest  votes,

votes  which indicate disgust at the Government  for

the  way  they  have  handled the whole  referendum,

votes  which indicate protest at the dishonesty  and

dictatorship of the Government in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



the way they are posing the questions to the people.

When  the people put in these blank votes, Sir, they

will be putting in these blank votes in protest, (1)

against  the  sham referendum which  the  Government

want  to  hold; (2) against the White Paper  of  the

P.A.P.,  and (3) as a demonstration of no confidence

in  the Government. That will be the meaning of  the

blank votes if the people are going to be faced with

no acceptable alternatives in the questions that are

posed  in  the  referendum. And  if  the  Government

insist  on stealing those blank votes and converting

them into votes for the P.A.P., then let us solemnly

warn   the  Government  that  they  must  bear  full

responsibility  for  all the consequences  of  their

unconstitutional  and dishonest referendum.  Sir,  I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 3, to leave out from "their" to the end and

insert ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"wishes on the inevitable reunification of the two

territories and that a referendum be held for the

people to decide whether they accept or reject the

constitutional arrangements set out in Paper Command

33 of 1961".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House resolves that the people of

Singapore  be asked to express their choice  on  the

mode  and manner of the inevitable reunification  of

the  two  territories and that a referendum be  held

for the people to decide between the alternatives of

reunification on the basis of



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the constitutional arrangements set out in

Paper  Command  33  of 1961  giving  Singapore

autonomy in education and labour: or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a complete and unconditional merger as a state

on an equal basis with the other eleven states

in    accordance   with   the   constitutional

documents of the Federation of Malaya.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since which an amendment has been moved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 3, to leave out from "their" to the end and

there to insert ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"wishes on the inevitable reunification of the two

territories  and that a referendum be held  for  the

people  to decide whether they accept or reject  the

constitutional arrangements set out in Paper Command

33 of 1961".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be

left out, be left out."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, like a nightmare

worm being pulled out from the sands, there seems to

be  no  end  of this Government's contempt  for  our

people. They have expended extraordinary, tremendous

energy   in   the  past  year  for  distortion   and

falsification  to mislead our people, utilising  all

the  paraphernalia of the State and some very  shady

tactics with reference to the Press. The tragedy  is

twofold, Mr Speaker, and I will deal with  both  of

them, both major.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, that the people of Singapore have been made

conscious that even under a democracy there  can  be

contempt  for them, for the Government they elected.

And  in  this context I ask you to permit  me,  Sir,

because it is pertinent, to quote from a document on

the Pakistan Constitution published by the Bureau of

National  Reconstruction of Pakistan and  issued  by

the Government of Pakistan. I read from page eleven:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Finally the system [they are talking of the

parliamentary  system] presupposes that  holders  of

power  submit  themselves to a code of honour.  This

unwritten code is embodied in precedents and  usages

usually  called the Conventions of the Constitution.

Conventions are not laws and can be disregarded when

they are no longer in conformity with changed needs.

Although  not  legally enforceable, their  force  is

nevertheless  almost as binding as laws  enacted  by

Parliament. They give substance to the principle  of

sovereignty of the people. Politicians are bound  to

observe them even if it brings them loss of office.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the fact that the Prime Minister

has  again  raised the question about  alternatives,

may  I quote from page 27 of the same document about

the Pakistan Constitution? A very short paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In case the President does not agree with the

legislature  he  has  been  empowered  to   hold   a

referendum on the question by referring  it  to  the

basic democracies who form the Electoral College  of

Pakistan.  In  such an eventuality the  point  under

dispute would have to be reduced to a form in  which

it can be  answered by a simple yes or no.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I table this document.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An even more tragic aspect - one can hardly think of

something  more  tragic than  the  strangulation  of

democracy we are seeing enacted under our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



very  own  eyes - is the fact that if this  Government

had  expended one-quarter of this energy in  seeking

to improve the citizenship provisions, in seeking to

impress  the  Federation  Government  that   it   is

essential for the stability of Malaysia as  a  whole

that the White Paper proposals should be improved in

that  regard.  I  am  convinced,  Sir,  that  today,

instead  of viewing this Government with the  horror

which our people are wont to, we may well have  been

joining  them in a common and honest effort to  bring

about  that  integration which we all seek  for  our

welfare as well as for the welfare of the Federation

and  the  Borneo  territories. I  say  to  you,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  whether it is today, whether  it  is

this year or whether it is in two years' time, those

citizenship proposals must be and will be  improved,

and  radically improved, if we are to have a  united

and   happy   nation.  The  Federation   has   shown

considerable capacity for maturity in the  past  few

years,  considerable capacity for understanding  the

political realities, and I say I cannot believe that

if they were to be faced squarely with the issue - you

cannot  have Singapore and you cannot have a  stable

Malaysia  unless  you have a common citizenship - they

would  recognise  it and they would  grant  us  that

citizenship.  That  is  the major  tragedy  of  this

horrible  circus mounted with ability - Machiavellian

ability - and  with unbounded energy by this  terrible

group - the tragedy that they could have utilised that

force and that ability to better ends, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead today we embark on this rear-guard action

for  further  distortions and further employment  of

the   technique   of  using  this  Assembly   as   a

smokescreen  to  cover  up  P.A.P. perfidy  and  to

mislead  the people. You might have wondered  why  I

rose  on  a  point of clarification when  the  Prime

Minister  misquoted me - I shall prove to  you  in  a

moment  how he has misquoted me. The point is  this,

Sir. His speech gets, and I am not complaining,  and

it  should get, not only P.A.P. Radio publicity  but

publicity  from  all the Press. Our corrections  are

blacked out, but complete.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say in the context of this rearguard action for

decency  and  democracy, in  which  we  know  we - are

fighting a losing battle - a battle that was  lost  at 10.25  p.m. last Friday - I ask you to recognise  the

lustful  jubilant  note  of the  Prime  Minister  as

reported by the Press, when the next morning in  the

Federation he said, "The tragedy of Singapore is the

one  man  one  vote  system."  So  the  tragedy   of

Singapore  is  the one man one vote system - a  system

which,  when  as an Opposition leader, he  supported

with all his heart; a system that he stood up for in

the  hustings; a system for which I thought  he,  in

common  with  us, sought to gain the hearts  of  our

people;  a system better than which I know  of  none

evolved   by   the  human  mind  for   the   healthy

development  of human society. But now that  he  has

reached the paranoiac height of power, he says - and I

wonder whether this does not stick in the gullet  of

the  many honest Back-benches, Sir, who stood on the

hustings  with  him  and  sought  to  plead  for  an

understanding of the democratic process, how do they

view that statement made on Saturday - "The tragedy of

Singapore is the one man one vote system."  He  does

not believe in the democratic system now that he  is

in power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion the Prime Minister has moved this

afternoon,  Sir,  allegedly  seeks  to   place   two

alternatives  before the people.  One  is  perfectly

honest and acceptable to very many people. With  all

respect to the Barisan Sosialis, with whose fight  I

find  myself in complete agreement in major  aspects

with  reference both to the referendum  and  to  the

merger issue in seeking for citizenship, I say I  do

not agree with them when they say that there are not

many  honest  people  who believe  the  White  Paper

proposals and genuinely believe that the White Paper

proposals are good. Such people do exist, and  exist

in  large numbers. It may well be ... I am not sure,

Sir, I am frankly, as I, have said before, in doubt.

I  would not take a bet either way - not that I  am  a

betting  man. But, Sir, it is an honest proposal  in

that  it has been spelt out - this proposal of  closer

relations with the Federation, and I am happy to see

that the word "merger" is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



not  there used. It has been spelt out in the  White

Paper in its main headings, and though I would  have

preferred  to see the draft Constitution being  made

the  basis  for the referendum as being  the  proper

constitutional approach, I would not use that  minor

criticism  to  quibble  at  this  juncture.  I   say

proposal  (a) is right to be put to the  people.  It

has been discussed. It has been spelt out. There  is

a document clarifying what it means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what I do quarrel with is that in the context

of  refusing  our people the right to say  `yes'  or

`no'  and  compelling them, as the  P.A.P. seek  to

compel them, to make a choice of one of two or three

alternatives, they introduce as a second alternative

something about which the meaning is in controversy,

something  which  has not been  spelt  out.  Sir,  I

should  like  to  leave  the  issue  of  the   third

alternative until the Member for Cairnhill has dealt

with  it,  because I do not know whether he  has  in

mind   that   the  terms  offered  to  the   Bornean

territories will be published before the referendum,

in  which case it would be quite right and proper to

put  that as an alternative, or whether on the basis

of  what  the  Malays called `letak  buta',  we  are

supposed  to  buy  a  pig in a poke  in  respect  of

unpublished terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister has told us that the

meaning  of proposal (b) can be clarified by  taking

jurist  views. But what are the jurists' views?  Has

he  taken any jurist views? You remember, Sir, I put

the  question a few days ago and I have  been  told,

"Oh,  yes, we consulted our State Advocate-General."

Right, but not even his views have been published as

to  what  proposal (b) means when spelt out legally.

We  know  what it is in lay language, Sir, but  when

you put it in this form for the people, I think they

are entitled to know what it is supposed to mean.  I

ask  you to notice, Sir, although it is alleged that

the Opposition has used this phraseology, that not a

single Member of the Opposition has at any time used

the   phrase   which   is   sought   to   make   the

framework - this   is  it - "in  accordance   with   the

Constitutional  Documents  of  the   Federation   of

Malaya". Not one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



Member  of the Opposition has ever used that  phrase

as  being  the  framework of equality of  status  of

Singapore with the other territories which they  now

seek  to slip in with sneering remarks about how  we

will dodge what we have asked for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall come slowly, if I may, and yet I will not

take  too long, to what we stood for. Because I  ask

you  to notice this. This new element he introduces:

"in accordance with the Constitutional Documents  of

the  Federation" is an extremely vague element.  Mr

Speaker, what are the Constitutional Documents?  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, are you aware, as you must  be,  have

you  forgotten? - may I refresh your memory  that  in

1962,  in this year, Sir, there was an amendment  of

the    Federation   Constitution   which    affected

citizenship  rights  to which  many  of  the  people

seemed   to   take  strong  exception?   Is   it   a

Constitutional   Document   or   is   it    not    a

Constitutional   Document - an   amendment   of    the

Federation Constitution? Sir, the document is  known

as  "The  Constitution (Amendment) Act, 1962".  That

Constitutional Act radically changes the citizenship

terms  under which the 11 States federated  together

when  they first formed the Federation in 1957.  So,

is  Singapore  to  come in in  accordance  with  the

Constitutional Documents which are of  a  radically,

allegedly  inferior  character  to  the  citizenship

arrangements in 1957? That is what seemingly, on the

face  of  it, that proposal seeks. Are we, who  have

been  asking for equality with other States, to take

into   account  what  subsequently  transpired  with

reference  to this Constitution (Amendment)  Act  of

1962?   For   you  will  remember,  we   have   been

consistently seeking equality since 1957.  What  are

the answers? What is the meaning of proposal (b) ? Is

this  the  way for the Government of the  people  to

treat  our  people who elected them? To treat  their

own   people   with   falsehoods,  with   misleading

statements,  with false trails and with  perversion?

How  can  they  put proposal (b) to  the  people  of

Singapore  without first clarifying what  it  means?

Could  we  not get a jurist opinion as to the  exact

legal significance of those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



terms?  Could we not publish it, Sir? It is on  this

basis  I ask you to consider the second alternative.

For  I say to you, that in the context of last  year

it  was  different, but in the context of today,  to

put  that proposal without clarification as  to  its

exact legal meaning is a fraud upon the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Prime Minister on 4th of July, at

page 14 of the transcript [Vol. 18, No. 6, col. 685]

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If a man fully understands the alternatives and

indicates his choice showing which he prefers ...'.



<br><br>Yes, but how can he fully understand the alternative

when the second alternative is a large question mark

today ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

It was what you had asked for!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> --- with two major contending

interpretations  radically  different?  How  is   he

supposed  to understand that alternative today?  The

Gentleman  across the Floor, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  who

goes  by  the designation of the Minister  for  Home

Affairs,  says it was what I had asked for.  May  we

come to it now? Mr Speaker, if you will remember, I

referred to the only platform the Workers' Party had

not to the only copy of a platform that the Workers'

Party  had.  We have not changed our  stand  and  it

remains  our stand. And, Sir, it has been quoted  to

you  - I am delighted - by my opponents. I take  pride

in  the fact that they think it is important, as  we

think  it is important, because it is our very first

plank. I will read it:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The basis and framework of all policy must be

recognition   of   the  fact   that   Singapore   is

geographically, ethnically, and economically part of

Malaya  and  the only healthy ultimate  solution  is

integration with Malaya on an equal basis with other

states...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing about Constitutional Documents so far; this

being  a  platform,  Sir, to be distributed  to  the

people  was  put in lay language which is understood

by the people. Not with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



the  "whereases" and "wherefores" and "therebys" and

"in the premises" of the lawyer --- [Interruption]. So,

Sir,  what  did  we mean by that? Mr Speaker,  Sir,

very  unfortunately,  that phrase  of  ours,  "equal

basis with other States," - you will notice first that

did  not mention, for example, that we wanted a free

port  status.  Of  the 11 States in the  Federation,

there is only one that has a free port status, but I

do  not  think  anybody, short  of  the  insane  and

Members of the P.A.P., would for a moment doubt that

we  meant  "on  an  equal basis" with  a  free  port

status,  because that is accepted by the  Federation

as  good for the Federation, and good for us. I mean

it  was  an  implied thing that everybody recognised

that  the  Federation would agree  to  a  free  port

status. What did we mean by "integration with Malaya

on   an   equal  basis  with  other  States"?  Here,

curiously  of all people, you know, who, Sir,  comes

to my assistance? The Member for Cairnhill!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me quote him explaining me. It is very

interesting, because, after all, he is my  political

opponent and he has no interest to assist; but if he

says  something, and he is in fact correct, it comes

better from him than it comes from me. I ask you  to

look  at the Hansard of the 22nd of November,  1961,

Sir,  at column 438. There you will find the  Member

for Cairnhill saying:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We all know what we mean by the word "merger".

Merger means the integration of Singapore as a  part

of  the  Federation and the rights  enjoyed  by  the

citizens of the Federation will be conferred on  the

citizens of Singapore when merger takes place.  That

is what we all mean by merger, and what we all know.

But unfortunately, because of the political moves on

the  part  of  ... the Prime Minister  and  his  ex-comrades,  merger has been twisted to mean something

else.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there you have a very honest explanation of what

everybody  understood by the word  "merger"  at  the

time;  what we all understood by "integration on  an

equal  basis", even the P.A.P. But let us  continue,

Sir,  because  when you find a lode like  this,  you

should try and work it a little more. The Member for

Cairnhill again in column 456:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There can be only one meaning for merger - complete

integration.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, Sir, at column 462:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I would urge upon the P.A.P. in all their speeches

after this not to try to claim that Cmd. Paper No.

33 is bringing about merger.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is the explanation of what we meant by

merger on "an equal basis with other States".  Using

lay    language - complete    integration,    complete

identification.  And I would ask  the  Minister  for

Home Affairs, and I would ask those who are here  to

listen, did they not mean the same, when they  spoke

of "struggling for independence through merger"? And

are  they  merely indulging - I would not go  through

those  adjectives,  Sir  - but  this,  this  specious

argument  which started from November onwards,  this

which  has sullied even our language, Sir, the equal

of  which  I have never met, except during the  time

when  I  was  imprisoned and I used  to  hear  those

officers  in  jackboots using  language  about  fair

treatment to prisoners in accordance with the Geneva

Convention,  and nonsense like that with  completely

straight  faces, and they knew they  were  lying  in

their  throats. They used words like  the  Communist

use the words "socialism" and "democracy" to explain

their  system. So the P.A.P. are using  words  which

have  been  shorn of their meaning, which have  been

distorted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. have in these intervening months

introduced  a red herring. But before  I  deal  with

this  red  herring,  I want you  to  notice  a  very

interesting  aspect of the Federation  Constitution.

Mind you, I will be quite frank.  At the time I  had

to  draft  my platform on an equal basis with  other

States,   I   was  not  conscious   of   the   legal

technicalities which help me. But I  would  like  to

draw  your  attention  to this,  Sir.  That  at  the

material  time when I had written this, there  were,

in  fact, in existence in the Federation in 9 out of

the  11  States  persons who  were  known  as  State

nationals, rulers of the subjects. Those  Rulers  of

the subjects were ---



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Subjects of the Rulers.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged to the Member for

Cairnhill. Subjects of the Rulers, Sir. There must

indeed be a great deal of tension in this House if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



a slip like that can cause such hilarity. But let us

go  back.  At that stage, Sir - this is important  to

recognise  - there were subjects of  the  Rulers  who

were   State  nationals,  that  is  to  say,  Johore

nationals,    Negri   Sembilan   Nationals,    Kedah

nationals.   Sir,   under   Article   28   of    the

Constitution,  those State nationals became  Federal

citizens  automatically. The Prime  Minister,  in  a

speech  which would no doubt have received  all  the

adulation  which the Press now so subserviently  has

been  giving it, has said, "if you can  give  me  an

analogy to give automatic citizenship to the  people

of  Singapore, I shall fight for it." Yes, you  will

fight  for  it.  This is the analogy. Singapore  has

State  nationals. The citizens of Singapore  are  in

the  same  position as the subjects of the Ruler  of

Johore.   Should  they  not  then  have  the   same,

analogous treatment? That is, analogous treatment to

that  accorded  to the subjects of the  Rulers.  Can

they be accorded automatic citizenship?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to read you one paragraph which might interest you. The Report of the

Federation of Malaya Constitution Commission, known

as the Reid Commission, made in 1957, and I read

from paragraph 37. Sir, they said that if we can

show them that Singapore citizens should

automatically be citizens of the Federation, this is

paragraph 37:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We recommend that all who have rights of

citizenship before Merdeka Day should continue to

have such rights. Those who have already established

their rights of citizenship should continue to be

citizens after Merdeka Day and they would not be

required to make any further claim. Those who are

now citizens by operation of law but who have not

yet established their rights ---',



<br><br>but  that  is no longer applicable. And they  refer,

Sir,  to Article 14 and Article 15, sub-clause  (1) .

So   their  recommendation  was  that  all  who  had

citizenship  rights at that time in connection  with

the  Federation  of Malaya should continue  to  have

those rights. I say to you, Mr Speaker, Sir, in the

context  of  the second proposal, to  speak  of  our

going  in  in  accordance  with  the  constitutional

provisions  is fraudulent, because at  the  time  in

1957  when  the  Constitution  came  into  force  in

August, there were no Singapore citizens. There  was

no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



provision   in   the  Federation  Constitution   for

Singapore citizens. And consequently, Sir, if we  go

in   technically  and  legalistically,  without  any

special   provision   under  Article   22   of   the

Constitution, every single one of us would not be  a

Federal citizen. And you know what we would be, Sir?

I   know   that  this  anomaly  should  cause   some

risibility. We would not be Federal citizens, but we

would  be  British  subjects. We  would  be  British

subjects!  Singapore citizens! Federation  nationals

and  British subjects! That is our Merdeka! Not  one

of  us  would  be entitled to automatic citizenship.

Those  of  us  who want to have Federal  citizenship

will  have  to  apply. Is that  the  spirit  of  the

Constitutional Documents of the Federation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 22, which seems to arouse such hilarity on

the    Government    benches,    was    specifically

incorporated  in the Constitution of the  Federation

in   order   to  enable  the  Federation  to   grant

citizenship on our joining the Federation,  and,  it

was at that time thought, Brunei too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is it fair to suggest that proposal (b), as it

stands,  is  an  honest or an  understandable  or  a

reasonable alternative to put to the people, that on

Merger   Day  not  one  of  us  will  have   Federal

citizenship,  not one of us can become a  Federation

citizen, not one of us can vote. Not merely 341,000.

Those  300,000 odd, Sir, would merely  be  precluded

from  even making an application. Because they  have

not  got the qualifications. But there are those  of

us  who can apply and in the months to come we might

be granted Federal citizenship. But the point is, is

that the spirit in which the other 11 States entered

into   the   Federation,  or  formed   - they   never

entered - the  Federation? You heard me read  out  the

Reid Commission's Report and how its recommendations

were  accepted in Article 14. You know, Sir, Article

28  makes subjects of the Ruler Federation citizens.

Well,   Sir,  subjects  of  the  Ruler   are   State

nationals.   Why  cannot  the  State  nationals   of

Singapore automatically have Federation citizenship?

If   we   are   to  talk  of  the  spirit   of   the

constitutional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



documents, that is the spirit, Mr Speaker.  To  put

the technicalities is to put the fraud because since

1957 when these documents were published, there  has

been a new entity, Sir, a new status - the status  of

Singapore   citizenship  created  by  the  Singapore

Citizenship Ordinance of that year under  which  all

642,000  citizens enjoy our citizenship rights.  How

are these to be provided for? Sir, even the Minister

for  Law - I  have at no time made any  secret  of  my

assessment  of  his  intellectual  understanding - had

this  to  say.  I refer you to Hansard  of  22nd  of

November,  1961, at column 481, Sir.  He  recognised

that you have to use Article 22. You cannot have any

kind  of a merger without it. These are his phrases,

Sir - I will refer you to that paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is obvious, Sir, that under the provisions of

Articles  4  and 22 of the Federation  Constitution,

special  arrangements  would  have  to  be  made  on

citizenship at the time of merger.'



<br><br>Right  at the top, Sir, he said Article 4;  then  he

changed it to Article 2; I am just putting it in the

proper context. Now, Sir, he himself recognises that

"special  arrangements would  have  to  be  made  on

citizenship  ..." But here you are putting  proposal

(b)  - nothing about citizenship. Yes, not only that,

but  I  would remind you, Sir, the arch distortioner

of  the  P.A.P. - the  Minister  for  Culture - said  at

column  499  of 22nd of November. 1961, who  started

this  campaign,  this campaign of smokescreen  about

what   the   Barisan  Sosialis  wanted,   what   the

Communists want and now, it seems according  to  the

Prime  Minister, what everybody wants.  Let  us  see

what the Minister for Culture said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Originally the Barisan Sosialis leaders demanded

merger on the basis of Penang and Malacca - I repeat,

Sir,  on  the  basis  of  Penang  and  Malacca.   We

correctly  pointed  out that the  Barisan  Sosialis'

proposal  would have meant that only  about  284,000

out   of   the  624,000  Singapore  citizens   would

automatically qualify for Federal citizenship  under

the present citizenship laws of the Federation.'



<br><br>That  is  not  true, Sir; nobody would automatically

qualify;   there   is  no  automatic   transfer   of

citizenship; no provision. He goes on to say,  "Sir,

if the Barisan Sosialis' leaders are really sincere,

..." - we will come to this `really



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



sincere';  they can fight it out between themselves.

Sir,  therefore, you recognise that  unless  special

provisions,  as the Minister for Law indicated,  are

made  under  Article 22 of the Constitution  of  the

Federation, there can be no question of any  of  our

citizens  automatically becoming  Federal  citizens,

because  there  is no provision in the  Constitution

for  automatic grant of citizenship on the accession

of  any  new territory. There was in respect of  the

time when all the eleven territories coagulated  but

there  is no provision for the accession of any  new

territory   having   automatic  citizenship   except

insofar as Parliament grants it under Article 22. So

this  is the proposal which they seek to put to  the

people. Is this an honest proposal, because  let  me

remind  you,  Mr Speaker, that they  say  they  are

going  to  put - and how often have they repeated  it

- two   honest   alternatives - honest  as   a   P.A.P.

corkscrew;  "honest". I will remind you of  some  of

their phrases. The Minister for Law said on 2nd July

at  page 63 of the transcript [Vol. 18, No. 4,  col.

517]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There is nothing undemocratic in giving the voter

the  right  to  choose between two  or  more  honest

proposals in a referendum...'



<br><br>Is  this  an honest proposal? And, Sir,  why  do  I

support  this  Barisan Sosialis' amendment?  Let  me

remind  you; they do put their feet in it sometimes,

Sir,  because sometimes they forget that  they,  how

shall I say it, have got to maintain a certain  line

of distortion, and you have the Minister for Finance

at  column 131 in Select Committee of the 8th of May

[Official Report No. 3]. Sir, saying this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There is an advantage, in principle, in

restricting a referendum to posing one question.'



<br><br>Yes, I agree with him. Why take away this advantage?

I  agree  completely.  "There is  an  advantage,  in

principle, in restricting a referendum to posing one

question." While recognising that advantage, why  do

they want to pose a question whose meaning they have

sullied, whose meaning they have made controversial,

whose meaning they have left in doubt and in respect

of   which  they  give  no  definition?  Now,   Sir,

supposing we do, how do we know how it is  going  to

be implemented - what meaning is going



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



to be given to proposal (b)? At least, if we had

an agreed explanation of its meaning between the two

Governments  - the  Federation  Government  and   the

Singapore  Government - we could  know  what  we  are

about,  but we have no such agreement, Sir. We  have

no  such  agreement to its meaning, and we  have  to

leave  ourselves to the tender mercies of the P.A.P.

dictionary.  Sir,  they say they  want  to  put  the

Opposition's stand: "What is wrong with our  putting

the Opposition's stand?" Their tender regard for the

Opposition  is very, very touching. We  all  believe

it,   Sir - these  crocodile  tears  of   regard   and

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see how they chop and change and chop again.

Sir,  on  22nd  November, 1961, at  column  488  the

Minister  for  Law - and I ask you to note  his  words - said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, we believe that complete merger will be

totally  unacceptable to the Federation  Parliament.

and they have said so.'



<br><br>Well,  but  on 12th June over Radio P.A.P. - broadcast

on the l4th - this is what the Prime Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the people reject the White Paper proposals,

they  just  vote for complete merger.  That  is  the

rejection of the White Paper proposals and  we  will

get them complete merger.'



<br><br>I wonder how the Prime Minister and the Minister for

Law  square  their views, or do they not ever  meet?

First,  the Minister for Law said: "We believe  that

complete merger will be totally unacceptable.";  the

Prime  Minister  over Radio P.A.P. on  the  14th  of

June, "We will get them complete merger." I have the

documents here, Sir, It is on page 8. Now, Sir,  the

Minister  for Home Affairs on the 3rd of July  [Vol.

18,  No.  5,  cols.  581-2] - this  was  a  few  days

ago - said, at page 28:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`However, having made the first error of declaring

for full and complete merger like Penang or Malacca,

the  Barisan  Sosialis could not publicly  repudiate

their stand; and even if they want to, they dare not

for  they realise that they cannot stem the tide  of

history  and  go against the wishes of  the  people.

However, they did not then expect the Government  to

take  their  proposition  seriously,  and  that  the

Federation, in any case, would not accept it.  Here,

we  see  how  dishonest and unfaithful  the  Barisan

Sosialis are.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we get the Prime Minister on the 12th June

telling us he will get



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>



complete merger. On the 3rd July we get his Minister

for  Home  Affairs  saying that  the  suggestion  is

dishonest  and unfaithful, to whom I  am  not  quite

sure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are we? Has language any meaning? Are we

playing  out  a tragedy? A farce of the  P.A.P.  Has

language no meaning to them? Have they no shame?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No amount of grunting can help the Deputy Prime

Minister.  Here are facts, Sir, I have not  invented

them. 22nd November, the Minister for Law: "Complete

merger  impossible." 12th June, the Prime  Minister:

"We  will  get them complete merger." 3rd July,  the

Minister  for  Home  Affairs:  "Complete  merger  is

dishonest  and unfaithful." Sir, I do not understand

that "dishonest and unfaithful".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has sought to quote me. I have here the

full transcript, Sir, copied word for word, not  now

anymore.  They  slipped up in  the  Sunday  Mail.  I

understand  that there have been grave repercussions

because  they put the radio broadcast in  full,  the

Sunday Mail of 1st July.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, he said that I wanted the question put about merger on an equal basis. May I read to you a

very short paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at what the Opposition asked for on the 21st

November. We amended a merger motion. We requested a

genuine  merger of Singapore with the Federation  of

Malaya,  with  Singapore entering the Federation  as

the   twelfth  State  and  with  all  its   citizens

automatically  becoming Federal citizens  on  Merger

Day. That is the alternative the Opposition offered.

That  is  the  alternative  for  which  17  of   the

Opposition  - three  Parties  - voted.  That  is   the

alternative  which  the  P.A.P.,  after  a  marathon

debate,  turned down with a majority of  32  to  17,

with  their friends, the S.P.A. and U.M.N.O., voting

with  them. A genuine merger of Singapore  with  the

Federation  of Malaya, with Singapore  entering  the

Federation  as the twelfth State and  with  all  its

citizens automatically becoming Federal citizens  on

Merger Day. If that alternative which we ask for  is

posed  to  the  people. I am prepared  to  apologise

publicly  and  to  pay  a thousand  dollars  to  the

National Union of Journalists."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could it be clearer in our stand?



<br><br>And  he  said I asked for merger on an equal basis.

Sir, I would like to add this bit:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But I say this to you, whether it is one question

or two questions. Even if they pose



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>



our question, I say the people should have the right

to say "Yes" or "No".'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, he quoted to you - that was the 27th

June - only recently, he quoted to you from  the  12th

June which was broadcast on the 14th. I want to  put

it  to  you  how it came about. Page 7.  May  I  use

names,  Sir?  To clarify it, Sir, I do not  want  to

refer to the Member for Anson. It sounds absurd if I

refer to myself as the Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Say "I".



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I see. Thank you, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I: `Who wants Penang and Malacca?'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Prime Minister: That is what the Barisan Sosialis

asked.'



<br><br>Then notice:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I: `Even if they made a mistake [even it they made

a  mistake]  are  we  running the  country  for  the

Barisan?  Are  we  having  the  referendum  for  the

Barisan or for the people of Singapore?'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Prime Minister: These were solemn words, said

solemnly.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I: `All right, they have withdrawn the words.'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member can say, "I said."



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, these technicalities sometimes

make it an absurdity:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Prime Minister: They have withdrawn. True, true,

they withdrew.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has got it - even if it is alleged that before that

date  they  wanted it. Here he admits, "True,  true,

they withdrew." This is the 12th June, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> A P.A.P. twist.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And, Sir, recognise - I want you to

see.  They  knew very well that they were distorting

what the Barisan wanted. At page 9, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Prime Minister to the Member for Queenstown:

"By   complete  misconception  of  what   you   were

advocating, you did so."'



<br><br>So  he  knew  it was a misconception, in his  words,

that  the  Member  for Queenstown  meant  something

else.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`You did so not knowing what you were in fact

proposing, as your Opposition friend, the Member for

Hong Lim, has said.'



<br><br>Then,  Sir, this is where the part quoted.  You  see

how it can be taken out of Context:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I said: It is the P.A.P. genius for dishonest

distortion  that  makes the Prime Minister  say  the

Opposition  wants a merger according to  Penang  and

Malacca.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has heard repeatedly the Barisan say what they

meant  was  they  wanted equality like  every  other

State.  It was in that context there came the phrase

they  mistakenly  used, Penang and Malacca.  If  you

want to call it a mistake.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position is this. In lay language, what do we

all understand by "on a basis of equality with other

States."?  It was lay language that we  were  using,

and  this analogy which is perfectly legitimate, and

a  perfectly honest one. Anything the P.A.P. touches

is  turned to filth. There was a man called  Croesus

and everything he touched was turned to gold. I wish

he had touched the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That was Midas.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Who wants this proposal (b)? Sir,

they   have   a  gentleman  they  call  a  Political

Secretary,  paid  by us, Sir, paid  by  the  State - a

Political Secretary by the name of Jek Yuen Thong, a

gentleman who became famous when he went down before

the  Member  for  Hong Lim in a somewhat  disastrous

effort. But let us come back to this gentleman,  Mr

Jek Yuen Thong, the Political Secretary to the Prime

Minister,  in  his third radio talk. He  said,  "The

Communists  say they want full merger [now  we  have

got  it,  Sir] like Penang and Malacca. So  what  is

wrong with asking the people if they approve of this

Communist idea?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite sure the P.A.P. Government, having been,

shall  we  say, a sleeping partner of the Communists

for  so  long, have a very tender regard  for  their

erstwhile  comrades, and if they  want  to  put  the

Communist idea, I for one take strong exception that

it  should  be suggested that there should  be  many

people  of Singapore who have any sympathy  for  the

Communists ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> --- but if the P.A.P., being in power,

seek   to   give  a  sop  to  their  erstwhile   bed

companions,   what   is  wrong  with   putting   the

Opposition  stand? What is wrong  with  putting  the

united  Opposition stand, Sir, made in this Assembly

with due formality on the 21st November, 1961, which

you find at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



column 406? What is wrong with putting it? They have

a tender regard for the Opposition? Here is what the

Opposition has said. We repeated it over the  radio;

we  pleaded  for it. What is wrong with putting  our

stand  which  is: `genuine merger of Singapore  with

the  Federation  of Malaya, with Singapore  entering

the  Federation as a twelfth State, and with all its

citizens automatically becoming Federal citizens  on

Merger  Day.' 17 Opposition Members voted for  this,

no  Communists, 17 of us. Why can we not have  that?

If you want to give the Communists their say; if you

want  to  give the S.P.A. their say; if you want  to

give  everybody his say; give us on these two  Back-benches  a chance to put our proposal to the people.

Oh,  no, Mr Speaker, that would be a fraud upon the

people of Singapore! That, it seems, is a fraud. Why

is it a fraud?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say it is dishonest to ask for it because we

know  we  cannot get it. You will remember,  Sir,  I

have  quoted  and  I  do not  want  to  repeat,  the

Minister  for  Home Affairs and the  Prime  Minister

today,  it is dishonest to put complete merger  that

we want; but it is dishonest to put our stand on the

ballot paper because we know we cannot get it.  Sir,

that  is a very curious definition of dishonesty.  I

want  to say this to you. If a man says, "I want  to

marry Miss X." He is dishonest because he knows  she

does  not want him! Right, he says, "I will not mary

Miss  A.  I will not marry Miss B. I will not  marry

Miss D. I will not marry till I marry Miss X." He is

prepared to wait for Miss X. What is dishonest about

that?  But  I  want  to show you, Sir,  these  short

memory  gentlemen, I think you will remember perhaps

a  day of long ago, the 5th of April, 1956, Sir.  At

column  1862, there was a motion before this  House,

and the operative words of that motion, Mr Speaker,

were:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`.... the Assembly instructs its All-Party

Delegation  to the forthcoming Constitutional  Talks

in London to seek forthwith for Singapore the status

of an independent territory within the Commonwealth,

and to offer an agreement between the United Kingdom

Government and the Singapore Government whereby  the

Government of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>



United   Kingdom  would  in  respect  of   Singapore

exercise  control  over external  defence  and  give

guidance  in foreign relations other than trade  and

commerce.'



<br><br>Was  it dishonest? It was? Well, I say I do not want

to  misinterpret the Deputy Prime Minister, but  let

me  remind him, Sir, that at column 1863 there  were 27  Ayes  and not one No; and amongst the Ayes  were

his  friend, the present Prime Minister, his  friend

the  Minister for Labour, and his friend, is it  the

Parliamentary   Secretary  to   the   Deputy   Prime

Minister, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Deputy Prime Minister. Those were

the  people  who  voted in favour of  our  demanding

forthwith for Singapore the status of an independent

territory within the Commonwealth.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> You did not get it.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No, but was it dishonest? We tried

it.  Mr  Speaker,  was  it  dishonest  to  try  for

something that you know is good?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> That would have postponed

merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am obliged to the Minister - some

interjections are helpful. Now, Sir,  he  says  that

means  postponing merger. Fair enough. Sir,  let  us

look  at  the  picture. We asked for our alternative

because it is a genuine proposal. It is said by  the

P.A.P. that  it is not one which would  today  find

acceptance  by the Federation, and therefore  merger

would have to be postponed. Mr Speaker, Sir, I know

I am said to use flamboyant analogy, but if I wanted

to get married ---



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> You are already married!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> All right, I am already married. Mr

Speaker,  Sir, if a girl wants to get married  to  a

man;  if he refuses and she knows she cannot  do  it

today,  but  she may do it next year, so  today  she

becomes his mistress! That way she gets no marriage.

And I say to you, Mr Speaker, merger is inevitable.

That is right. I agree completely. It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



inevitable   because  with  growing   maturity   the

Federation  will more and more recognise  the  vital

character  of Singapore as the kingpin of South-East

Asia.  We  are not asking for the moon, Mr Speaker,

Sir.  Our modesty is something to be amazed  at.  Is

that  not  modesty, being prepared, as I am prepared

on  behalf  of  my Party, to accept disproportionate

representation  discriminatory to Singapore?  I  say

the  postponement is a postponement  for  the  good,

because if you started off on the wrong foot as  the

White Paper, I may be wrong in my opinion, but in my

honest  opinion, with the White Paper you start  off

on the wrong foot, it could bring grave consequences

and  it  would be better to postpone and get off  on

the  right  foot than seek to force the White  Paper

through.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this matter, in particular, Sir, it may not be

inappropriate at this juncture to draw attention  to

a  reply  to  me from the Lady from Mountbatten  who

said,  "Would  you prefer to be democratic  and  see

democracy  die,  or undemocratic in  order  to  save

democracy?" That is a jesuit point of view, Sir, but

let  us  examine it. I ask the Lady from Mountbatten

how  much  of  democracy is left  today  after  that

Referendum Bill? How much of it is she going to save

and  for whom? It is a hole in a corner for timorous

mice. There is no room for a man to stand up in what

is left of democracy ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member must remember

he  is  addressing the Chair and he has  raised  his

voice. Up to now I have not stopped him, but I think

he  is raising it a bit too much. I must ask him  to

modulate his voice.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> My apology, Mr Speaker, to have

contributed even a little to your discomfort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, at page 64 of the 2nd of July [Hansard Vol. 18 No. 4, col. 518], a week ago, Sir, last

Monday, the Minister for Law stated that it would be

a  fraud  on the electorate if, in fact, a no-merger

proposal  in  the  guise  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis

proposal   for   complete  merger   with   automatic

conversion    of   citizenship   and   proportionate

representation is put to them. So we have gone



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>



full  circle  from  the Minister  for  Law  on  22nd

November,  1961, saying it is unacceptable,  to  the

Prime Minister on 12th June saying that he will  get

complete  merger  for us, to the Minister  for  Home

Affairs  on the 3rd of July saying that  this  is  a

fraud on the people, and the Minister for Law on the

2nd  of  July saying that it is a no-merger proposal

and  it  is a fraud. They seem to have got  together

this  time. Why is it a fraud, Mr Speaker, when  in

truth  and  in  fact  every single  human  being  in

Singapore understood by merger that there  would  be

automatic  citizenship and  we  would  go  in  as  a

constituent  State. This was what we all  understood

and this, in the language of the P.A.P., is a fraud.

Then  may I ask the P.A.P. that they put a fraud  in

their   constitution  saying  they   "struggle   for

independence through merger." Or did they understand

something else by merger?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, when the Prime Minister said pompously,

"We  will permit the people to decide between  three

alternatives," he is in fact only giving  them  one,

for (b) is one about whose meaning controversy rages

and  there  is  no agreement between  Singapore  and

Federation Government as to its meaning. How can you

treat  people with such contempt, Sir? How  can  you

throw  out a proposal like that and say that  it  is

the  Opposition who wants it when the Opposition  is

on  the record as wanting something precise? How can

people quite so blatantly indulge in falsehoods?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then. Sir, the proposal of the Member for

Cairnhill, which seems to have the seed of something

worthwhile, and I would like to reserve my right  to

speak when I understand it fully. The main objection

that  I  can see at this stage is this, Sir, If  the

terms are published before the referendum, then,  of

course, it is a perfectly legitimate question to put

to  the people. But if the terms are secret,  is  it

fair  to put to the people a pig in a poke? I  mean,

you  are asking people to change their lives,  their

entire future, to opt for a constitution which  will

guide  their  destinies,  which  will  govern  their

destinies and that of their descendants. Can you  do

it just punting on a dark



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



horse?  Because  a horse is out of  Corruption  from

Dishonesty,  therefore, it might be a winner  called

the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister has referred to a letter

which  was sent by 19 Members of this House  to  the

United  Nations and he had the inpertinence to  call

it scurrilous. With your permission, Sir, it is only

two  paragraphs;  I  would like to  read  those  two

paragraphs in fairness:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The United Kingdom proposes shortly to transfer

sovereignty over the colonial State of Singapore  to

the Federation of Malaya. We are satisfied that this

transfer of sovereignty will take place in a  manner

otherwise  than through the free expression  of  the

wishes  of  the people of Singapore and contrary  to

the  spirit and the letter of resolution 1,514 (15th

General  Assembly)  of  the United  Nations  General

Assembly of the 14th December, 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We attach herewith a memorandum which sets out very

briefly  the  true  position  and  urgency  of   the

situation. We appeal to the United Nations,  through

its  Committee on Colonies, to send out an  observer

urgently  to Singapore to ascertain the exact  facts

and  to judge whether it is, as we believe, a matter

for intervention by the United States.'.



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  in  the  P.A.P. language,  that   is

scurrilous.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Not the United States, the United

Nations.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am so sorry. I am much obliged. The

United Nations. Thank you for the correction.  That,

in  P.A.P. language, is scurrilous. I shall  not  be

taking  very  long, Sir. But I do want to  show  you

that  the  capacity for falsehood of the  P.A.P. is

illimitable.  It is boundless. And the  capacity  of

its  members  to  face the people without  shame  is

quite  unbelievable. Sir, here, right in this House,

we  have  the Prime Minister because he  is  annoyed

with  a  step  which the Opposition felt  should  be

taken.  Whether it succeeds or not, Sir,  it  is  an

outlet  for  the frustration of our people  who  are

suffering  today.  We  are not  allowed  to  hold  a

national convention in Badminton Hall. Therefore, it

seems  we  have  become Communists, the  U.P.P. and

ourselves,  we  are all Communists  because  we  are

following the Communist tactic. So no meeting at the

Badminton  Hall.  Press reports of the  Opposition's

stand  are  being heavily excised in the newspapers.

Sir, the people are reaching



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>



a  stage when I say it is necessary to give  them  a

healthy  outlet.  Here we seek a constitutional  and

legitimate approach to protest against the  proposed

transfer  by the United Kingdom in a manner contrary

to  the freely expressed wishes of the people and we

are  told it is scurrilous because he does not  like

it.  We  are told the group that seeks to  have  the

Badminton Hall to have a meeting there is Communist.

Everybody is a Communist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are told that what is filthy

is  right,  that  proposal (b) which  is  thoroughly

dishonest,  is  honest.  We  are  told  that  it  is

absolutely clear and unambiguous. Sir, I heard  this

evening  from  the Prime Minister  a  remark,  whose

significance, I do not know, may not have been fully

appreciated  by other Members. He has told  us  that

this  House  will be suspended at the  end  of  this

sitting and the Session will be prorogued. Under the

Constitution  he  does  not  have  to  call  another

meeting of the Assembly for 12 months. I had  hoped,

Sir, when I saw the Order Paper and noticed that the

Bills  were sent to Select Committee that, in  fact,

we  would be sitting and earning our allowance, that

we  would  be in a position to continue at least  to

keep  an  eye, as a watch-dog keeps an eye,  on  the

interests  of  our  people. But now  we  are  to  be

prorogued,  he  has  got  what  he  wants,  he   has

bulldozed  it through. So whether it is  in  Cameron

Highlands  playing golf, or whether it is  with  his

Right-wing cronies drinking beer, or whether  it  is

evolving  further  Machiavellian  schemes  with  his

basic contempt for our people and for the democratic

process,  our Prime Minister will then be  free,  as

free as any dictator, to do with us as he wills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the second question is dishonest in the context of today, although it would have been a

legitimate one ten months ago. But in the context of

today and the falsifications of the P.A.P., or shall

we say, the misunderstandings, but in the context of

its ambiguity today the fact that nobody knows



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>



exactly   what   it   means,  it  is   unreasonable,

particularly when you use that new phrase which says

"in accordance with the Constitutional Documents  of

the  Federation of Malaya". Constitutional Documents

of  the  Federation  of Malaya - many  of  them,  all

unspecified,  one  of  them  the  1962  Constitution

(Amendment)  Act which radically alters  citizenship

laws.  It is dishonest to put to the people anything

that  is  not clear and cannot be easily understood.

They  kept  saying  to us, and  the  Prime  Minister

himself  said,  "If  a  man  fully  understands  the

alternatives..." - that was the phrase he used on  4th

July-how  is  anybody  going  to  understand   fully

alternative (b), Sir? As it stands, it is not merely

a  question  "analogous  to the  provisions  of  the

constitutional  documents", but  with  reference  to

their technical terms. And how does he know that  he

can  get  from the Tunku what he understands?  Would

you  not agree, Mr Speaker, Sir, that if he has any

respect  for  our people he would have first  worked

out  at least a draft with the Federation Government

as  to the possible meaning of that alternative  and

then put it to our people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Lady from Mountbatten, with feminine adulation of her leader, said to us that it

was her great leader, the Member for Cairnhill, who,

having  gone  into the P.A.P. den  and  bearded  the

Prime Minister, came forth with the promise that the

questions would be discussed in this Assembly. I  am

sorry  to disappoint the Lady from Mountbatten.  But

as  you know, the motion which is now item No. 10 on

the  Order  Paper was received by you a  long,  long

time before the radio forum on which the Member  for

Cairnhill appeared with the Prime Minister.  It  was

circulated  to  them and they knew that  because  of

that  motion,  the questions had to be discussed  in

this  Assembly.  So that is the  way  in  which  the

S.P.A. bearded the P.A.P. valiantly,  coming  forth

with the scalp of the Prime Minister and the promise

of the questions being discussed.

<br><br>7.47 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what happened after that? Because the

Government have a preemption - and the Lady from Mountbatten  will  remember only a couple of days  before

the  meeting started - they put in their motion  which

we are now discussing, and they put it as number one

on  the Order Paper to be heard before our's.  I  am

not  complaining, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I am  sure

that  the Lady from Mountbatten would wish  to  have

the  facts straight, that it was not thanks  to  the

S.P.A. or to any sense of decency of the P.A.P. but

it   was  thanks  to  constitutional  procedure  and

Standing  Orders  which compel discussion  of  these

questions  as to what is to be put to the people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the amendment of the Member for Queenstown because in fact it leaves to

the  people to vote on one question which  has  been

spelt  out  and it leaves it to them  in  an  honest

manner - a  referendum to be held for  the  people  to

decide   whether   they   accept   or   reject   the

constitutional  arrangements  set  out   in   Paper

Command  No. 33 of 1961. That is the one before  us.

All  other  proposals are intended as a smokescreen.

If  we are compelled to have several proposals,  let

us  have at least the Opposition's proposal  of  the

21st  November, 1961, incorporated, that is  to  say

genuine  merger,  with Singapore coming  in  as  the

twelfth  state,  and with automatic citizenship  for

our citizens. But that is not in fact ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> That is not on an equal basis.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, the Minister for

Home  Affairs says that is not on an equal basis.  I

do not know, Sir, and I will spell it out, because I

am  sure  others  have understood. There  were  nine

Malay  States  in the Federation in  1957.  Each  of

those  nine  Malay  States had a special  Act,  Sir,

providing  for State nationals known as subjects  of

the  Rulers.  Those State nationals, on Merger  Day,

became Federation citizens



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>





automatically.  Singapore, in 1957  August,  had  no

Singapore citizens, but after 1957 August,  we  have

the    1957   Citizenship   Ordinance.   Under   the

Citizenship Ordinance, we had nationals of the State

of   Singapore  known  as  Singapore  citizens.   By

analogy,  those nationals of the State of  Singapore

are  similar in status to the subjects of the Rulers

of  the  Malay States of the Federation. By analogy,

they  should become Federation citizens - Q.E.D. Do  I

have  to  spell it out again? And finally, yet  once

more - the  Reid Report. I will not read it except  to

remind you that the Reid Commission emphasised  that

all  those  who had citizenship rights  should  have

them  in  common  on  Merger Day.  And  it  provided

Article 14. The spirit of that is this: those of  us

who have citizenship rights in Singapore should have

them  on  Merger Day, in common with the  others  as

common citizens - Q.E.D.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> That is what you think.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am

indeed  grateful to the Member for Anson for  giving

me a little time before the dinner break to speak on

this  very important issue now before the  House.  I

can understand the strong feelings of the Member for

Anson. I can understand why he should speak in  such

flowery  language - in  language  that  condemns   the

P.A.P. in  no  uncertain terms. It is  because  the

P.A.P.,  whenever  they make any  reference  to  the

Member  for Anson, forget that they have a  Ministry

of  Culture and they can never become cultured!  And

that  is  what goes against the grain of the  Member

for Anson. In fact, the Member for Anson nearly blew

his top off just now.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That will be good.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am indeed very happy to see

that  that has not happened, because we like him  in

this  Assembly. We would like him to remain as  long

as there are elections in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, maybe because of his strong

feelings  of  grave  injustice  perpetrated  by  the

P.A.P.,  he has become a little bit, shall  we  say,

off  colour  in  his  speech, so  much  so  that  he

mentioned  "the United States" when  he  meant  "the

United Nations". He mentioned Rulers of the subjects

when  he  meant  subjects of  the  Rulers.  Then  he

mentioned  dishonest  distortion  as  if  distortion

could ever be honest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, speaking on the amendment of the day, I am

indeed surprised at the amendment of the Member  for

Queenstown,  that  he has asked for  a  one-question

referendum. He made it as far back as April when the

motion of the Member for Anson was being debated for

a  referendum. The Barisan Sosialis tried  it  then.

They  tried again during the Committee stage on  the

Referendum Bill. And they now try it again. Although

the  Member  for  Queenstown did say  that  if  this

failed he had another proposal, the fourth proposal,

which he would like to put forth. And the Member for

Anson  himself has given notice of an  amendment  to

proposal  (b) . I think this matter would  have  been

expeditiously ---



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir. Mr

Deputy  Speaker, in the light of what  I  understand

will be the fourth alternative which is what I seek,

if  we  cannot  have one question, I  shall  not  be

moving my amendment of which notice has been given.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am very glad to hear that the

Member for Anson will not be moving the amendment of

which  he has given notice. That would mean that  he

does not feel so strongly about proposal (b) at all.

I  thought that he felt so strongly about it that he

put in his amendment and therefore he wanted to have

that   proposal  corrected  in  the  light  of   his

criticism. But now it seems that he might  not  even

move  his  amendment. He is quite prepared to  allow

this  proposal to go through after all - he  has  said

that - just because the Barisan Sosialis is putting in

a fourth proposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is true that the debate on this referendum

and  on  merger has got on the nerves of all Members

in this House and that at times we do not behave



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



rationally as we want to behave, but that is not our

fault.  It is all due to the wear and tear  and  the

strain that we have been subjected to by this  party

warfare  between the P.A.P. and the  ex-P.A.P.,  and

those  who do not belong to the Party are just taken

into  the  arena. Things are getting more  and  more

confused, and the longer the debate carries  on  the

more confused the debate will be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since it has been moved by the Member for

Queenstown,  I  must say why I object  to  the  one-question  referendum. I hate to repeat what  I  have

been  saying, but I must do so in order to make  our

position  clear. A one-question referendum will  not

get  the  right answer - the answer from  the  people

whether  or  not they want closer relationship  with

the   Federation   of   Malaya.   The   one-question

referendum   will   just   give   the   long-awaited

opportunity to the electors to write "finish" to the

life  of the P.A.P. They would gleefully just  cross

out  Command Paper No. 33 as if to say, "The  sooner

the P.A.P. gets out of the picture, the healthier it

will  be for politics in Singapore." That is  why  I

say  a  one-question referendum will  not  give  the

right answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to suitable alternative questions, the Member

for Anson felt it necessary to cross swords with the

Lady  from Mountbatten and try to claim credit  that

it was he, because of the notice of his motion, that

is  to say, item 10 on the Order Paper, who had been

successful  in forcing the Government  to  agree  to

debate the questions to be proposed in a referendum.

Sir, I, who have received no legal training,  am  a

bit  chary in entering into a debate with the  hon.

Member  for Anson, who is a very well-known  lawyer.

But  I must make it clear to him that item 10 on the

Order  Paper  does  not, under the Standing  Orders,

force the Government to debate the questions at all.

Item 10 is an attempt by the Member for Anson to try

and  force the Government to agree to a one-question

referendum. And if the Government had not agreed  to

have  the  questions debated in  this  Assembly,  no

questions  would have been debated in this  Assembly

other than the Government simply saying "No" to  the

motion; and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



Member  for  Anson,  and also his  Barisan  Sosialis

colleagues,  would be wanting to say, "Yes"  to  the

motion.  He cannot, I submit, claim credit  that  it

was  he  who  forced  the  Government  to  have  the

question  debated in this Assembly, just because  he

has  given notice of a motion - item 10 on the  Order

Paper   - for  debate,  and  trying  to  corner   the

Government   into   agreeing   to   a   one-question

referendum and fixing a time limit for polling  day.

Sir,  we  do  not want to claim credit for  anything

done  at all. On this very important national issue,

let  all  Parties  in  this  Assembly  forget  party

credits. Let us all work together at least  on  this

one  issue to get the people to go to the referendum

and   vote   for   closer  relationship   with   the

Federation. There should be no question of a Barisan

Sosialis proposal, or a Workers' Party proposal,  or

even a S.P.A. proposal. In fact, the proposal that I

am going to move as an amendment should not be taken

as  a S.P.A. proposal, and I will touch on that when

the time comes. Let us place all the propositions ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I say all the propositions.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> --- all the alternative questions to

the  electors.  And the alternatives must  give  due

recognition to facts. In trying to establish  closer

relationship with the Federation of Malaya, we  must

try  to put our heads together to find out how  many

forms  of closer association there can be. If  there

are  five forms, let us put up five forms. If  there

are three or two, let us put up three or two. Let us

put  our  heads  together  and  bring  back  to  the

electors  for  a  referendum  questions  that   have

relationship to facts. Now proposal No. 1 of Command

Paper  No. 33 is, in fact, not merger. It is a  form

of  closer  association. It  is  a  form  which  the

P.A.P.,  as  a  Government,  has  secured  from  the

Federation  Government. And it is a form  of  closer

relationship  which the S.P.A./Alliance  has  fought

for,  because the S.P.A./Alliance must, in  all  its

consideration on matters of public importance,  have

their facts straight. The P.A.P., as a Government, can  only

get that and no more. But it does not mean



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



that  Command  Paper  33  is  not  open  to  further

improvements.  Of  course, once we have  established

closer relationship, future governments can carry on

from  where  the  P.A.P. has left  off.  It  is  not

merger. It is a son of half merger. Therefore, after

having  got that form of merger - a half merger,  let

us say - must we now try to say that there must be 75

per cent or 80 per cent or 90 per cent merger? There

could  be  no  other  alternative  than  a  complete

merger. If it is 50 per cent, we could not just say,

"I  think  we  should  try and have  70  per  cent,"

because  the  electorate will not know what  70  per

cent  means.  50 per cent is embodied in  the  White

Paper.  Let  us  have  the  50  per  cent,  if   the

electorate think that that is a good thing under the

present circumstances. Or if we do not want  50  per

cent, well let us have a hundred per cent, that  is,

complete  and unconditional merger. The  wording  of

the Government is this: a complete and unconditional

merger  as a state on an equal basis with the  other

eleven  states in accordance with the constitutional

documents  of the Federation of Malaya.  And  it  is

because of the way it is worded that the Member  for

Anson  took  strong exception to  it  and  tried  to

accuse  the P.A.P. of wanting to perpetrate a fraud,

and  the P.A.P. says that the Barisan is wanting  to

perpetrate a fraud. Let us forget all frauds. Let us

not  call each other names. It would make the public

more  confused. If one is trying to be cleverer than

the  other in this important issue, if one is trying

to  outdo the other in language, in distortion,  and

in  trying to play on the emotions of the masses, we

may reach a very unhealthy state of affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You want to support the P.A.P. ---



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> And if an unhealthy state of

affairs is reached, each and every one of us here is

responsible, not only the Barisan and not  only  the

P.A.P. All of us who are elected representatives  of

the people should try to give a clear-cut picture to

the  electorate, free from emotion, free from  party

political content, and let the electorate choose  in

a very calm and peaceful atmosphere.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> An honest referendum!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I am also getting confused

myself  because I am getting a battery  of  harmless

shots from behind! The Member for Anson tries to see

in  this  proposal  (b)  an  attempt  to  cheat  the

electorate.  I think what is more important  to  the

country  is to see that the wording of the questions

should be free from possible misinterpretation,  and

it   would   be   left  to  the  political   Parties

represented  in this Assembly to hold  a  referendum

meeting and speak about their particular stand.  The

P.A.P. and the S.P.A./Alliance will do their best to

explain to the people why Command Paper 33 is in the

best  interest  of the people of Singapore.  If  the

Barisan Sosialis or the Workers' Party want complete

and  unconditional  merger as a State  on  an  equal

basis  with the other eleven States, they can go  to

the  people and explain their stand; what they mean,

that there should be automatic citizenship: and what

is  meant by proposal (b); and what they support  is

that  they want Singapore to join the Federation  as

one  of  the states of the Federation with  all  its

privileges  as  well  as its responsibilities.  They

will  have  to say what they mean by their automatic

citizenship. But they will also have to  explain  to

the  people that once we get complete merger,  there

will  be no autonomy on any subject whatsoever. They

will  have to go in - take all the benefits that  are

there  and  also  accept all the disadvantages  that

complete  merger  could mean. If they  present  that

picture as they see it to the electorate, and if the

electorate  vote for it in the image of the  picture

that  they present, then the Government of  the  day

will  have to take due note of the decision  of  the

electorate in the light of the picture presented  to

them  by  the  Parties that are in favour.  But  all

these  arguments back and forth and this calling  of

names  make people think that we have not even grown

up. What is all this argument about? What is the use

of  saying, "I want complete merger. I want this.  I

want that."? If the Federation says "no" to you,  it

is just the end of it. Why all this unnecessary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



calling  of  names?  If there are Political  parties

that  are  for  proposal (b) or may be for  proposal

(c) - when I come to move it- or for proposal  (d),  if

it  is  accepted by this Assembly, then it would  be

left  to  the  Government to go  to  the  Federation

Government  and say, "Well, our White Paper  is  not

accepted.  The feeling of the people as a result  of

the  referendum  is proposal (b),  proposal  (c)  or

proposal  (d)."  Then  it  would  be  left  to   the

Federation Government to consider whether  they  are

prepared  to  reach  agreement  with  Singapore   on

proposal (b), proposal (c) or proposal (d). But  all

the heat that is being generated here is just making

the  job  more  difficult should the  electorate  of

Singapore  decide  on a form of closer  relationship

that  is not Command Paper 33. But the less we raise

our  voice  and shout at each other, the  easier  it

will  be  for  the  Government  to  have  to  reopen

discussions  with the Federation Government  if  and

when it is necessary as a result of the referendum.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sham referendum!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Member for Queenstown

did  say that we must put all the alternatives down.

In  other words, he was prepared to accept more than

one  question  if, in his view, all the alternatives

are  put  down. If that is his stand, why should  he

have  wasted  the time of this Assembly  from  about 3.15  p.m. right  up to now to move  his  amendment

knowing that that amendment will be defeated? I hope

that  the other Members of the Barisan Sosialis will

not  waste  the time of this Assembly and  say  that

their amendment could be put to the vote.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Why do you not cross the Floor?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It will be defeated. Sir, I think

there  is  such  a thing as silence means  contempt.

Sir,  it  should be defeated. Then we can  go  ahead

with the Barisan's fourth alternative and we will at

least have the time, energy and goodwill to give due

thought  to whatever proposal they may have  as  the

fourth proposal.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Barisan alternative.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I think the tone of this

debate could be kept down to normal if the P.A.P. do

not  start  all over again that proposal  (b)  means

what the Barisan want, citizens who were not born in

Singapore  will lose their citizenship rights.  They

should   not   try  to  say  something  which   they

themselves admit they are not sure of, because  they

have  not consulted the jurists and it is up to  the

jurists  to  say.  But if that is their  contention,

they are entitled to their contention. Other Parties

who   sincerely  believe  that  proposal  (b)  means

automatic  citizenship are entitled to  their  views

and  they can put it to the electorate that proposal

(b)  means automatic citizenship and it is up to the

electorate   to  choose.  If  they  want   automatic

citizenship,  they must also be prepared  to  accept

the policies of the Government of the Federation  of

Malaya.  There  will  be no  more  autonomy  in  any

subject whatsoever, and if in the realisation of the

privileges and responsibilities they want it, I  say

that the Government must reopen discussions with the

Federation  Government. It is wrong  for  the  Prime

Minister  to  say, as has been pointed  out  by  the

Member for Anson, "If you want (b), I will get (b)."

The  Prime  Minister has no right  to  say  it.  The

person  who  can say yes or no is the Government  of

the  Federation of Malaya and not the Prime Minister

of  Singapore.  All he can say is if the  electorate

choose (b), the Government will strive sincerely  to

get proposal (b) for the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think all these arguments brought in by the

Member for Anson about the Reid recommendations  and

about  the  constitutional proposals  in  1957,  and

that,  according to his interpretation, if we  enter

the  Federation and secure merger on an equal  basis

with any of the eleven states, it will mean that  no

citizens  of Singapore will become citizens  of  the

Federation are ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Phooey.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> --- I will not say phooey - just

another unconscious effort on the part of the Member

for  Anson  to  bring more confusion to  an  already

confused issue. His stand, as I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



clearly  understand  it,  is  that  a  complete  and

unconditional  merger  means automatic  citizenship.

Let  us respect his stand. Let him try and sell that

stand to the electorate in the same way as we in the

S.P.A. Alliance will have to try and explain to  the

people that Cmd. Paper 33 is the best possible under

a  P.A.P. form of government. Of course,  it  could

have   been  better  had  it  not  been   a   P.A.P.

Government.  But because we are realistic,  we  know

the signs; we are prepared to support it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again I see another thing. The Prime Minister

has  brought in the question of the Malays'  special

privileges.  I do not see why such an  issue  should

have  been  brought in, Sir. Let  us  consider  this

issue  - these special privileges - from the point  of

view of the socialists. The P.A.P. say that they are

socialists;  the Barisan claim that  they  are  more

socialist  than the P.A.P. Therefore,  what  is  the

socialist doctrine? We should give to those that  do

not  have.  Those that have not must be given  their

due rights. Those that have must come to the help of

those   that   do  not  have.  A  simple   socialist

principle. Those that have must help those  that  do

not  have,  and in Malaya today, those that  do  not

have just happen to be the Malays. So let us not say

that  we  want  to  give special privileges  to  the

Malays.  Let  us  say  that we  are  giving  special

privileges  to those that do not have  in  order  to

make Malaya a better country for all to live in. Let

us  not try and bring in the communal issue. If  the

Barisan Sosialis and the P.A.P. claim that they  are

genuine socialists ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If the P.A.P. claim.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> --- that is the proper way to tackle

this  question;  not to bring in, say,  the  Chinese

must  come to the help of the Malays and the  Malays

will  greatly benefit at the expense of the Chinese.

That  is wrong. Benefits will be given to those that

must  have the benefits, and those that already have

the  benefits  must be content with what  they  have

until  there is a more just and more equal  society.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I really find little to pick fault with the

Member  for Anson when he criticised the  P.A.P. in

such strong terms. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P. have  been doing all those things  that  the

Member  for  Anson has described. One Minister  says

that  it is impossible to have complete merger.  The

Prime  Minister  says,  "I will  get  it  for  you."

Another  Minister  says.  "Come  on,  it  bears   no

relationship to the facts." It is because they  have

now got into the position in which they have to keep

on  moving from one place to another, and in  which,

in  order  to beat distortion, they must  also  lend

themselves to practising distortion. That is why all

this confused situation has arisen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest to the P.A.P. and the ex-P.A.P.

that  is  to  say, the Barisan Sosialis - they  worked

together  as  a  Party and were pledged  to  merger,

although the leader of the Barisan now says that the

P.A.P. has never made any mention of merger. I think

he  was  wrong, Sir. As soon as the P.A.P. came  to

power,  they did make a few bleats about merger.  Of

course,   they  were  not  in  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's   speech,  or  in  any  of   their   policy

statements,  but  they did make a few  bleats  about

merger.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is not in the Five-Year Plan.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> And every time they make those

few  bleats  when  the  Member  for  Queenstown  was

sitting  on  the other side, they got  slapped  down

hard  by  the Tunku. All because - and it can  now  be

said - the  Tunku knew that in the P.A.P. there  were

Communists who were sleeping with the P.A.P. And  it

was   because  the  P.A.P. had  awakened   to   the

contamination  that they had through  sleeping  with

the  Communists  that the Tunku had come  with  this

idea of Malaysia. And the P.A.P. was quick enough to

catch  on  to  it  and  went to see  the  Federation

Government  and reached agreement with  them.  There

was  really  - if  I  may use the phrase - an  indecent

haste. The P.A.P. should have known that they  would

be reduced to 26 Members. If they had wanted to save

all  this  unnecessary distortion that is going  on,

they  could  have  had an All-Party Delegation.  No,

they did not want to have it, because they wanted to

claim credit for it. That is where the first mistake

was made. If they had not just wanted to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



so  quick  at clutching the straw to save them  from

drowning,  they  would have been a little  bit  more

sensible  and  would have consulted  the  Opposition

Parties, and that would have made their job  easier.

And  all  this  mud-slinging might  not  have  taken

place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Parties that will be holding referendum

meetings  will  remember that  they  owe  the  first

responsibility  to  the country.  Let  them  go  and

present  their  case  without  distortion.  If   the

Barisan feel that complete and unconditional  merger

is  the  one they want, and by that they  mean  they

want   automatic  citizenship - I  do   not   hear   a

distortion now ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> He said distortion.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> --- they are free to do so. And if

the  electorate  can  be convinced  by  the  Barisan

Sosialis and by other political Parties working with

the  Barisan Sosialis, they are free to reject  Cmd.

Paper  33 and vote for a form of closer relationship

that  the  Barisan thinks is best for the people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to end this speech by appealing to

Members  in  this  House: in  consideration  of  the

questions  to be posed in a referendum, let  us  not

forget that the most important point to bear in mind

is ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> To have an honest referendum.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> --- the Government of the

Federation of Malaya. The Member for Anson knows the

feelings  of the Tunku on such an important  matter,

and  surely - I am sure he will in his appeal  to  the

electorate  at referendum meetings he will  bear  in

mind that what he wants to sell to the electorate is

something  that the Tunku must also be  prepared  to

buy. Let us not get the people to vote for something

in the referendum which is not easy to achieve. We ---



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of explanation if the

Member will permit, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Has the Member for Cairnhill reason

to  believe that the Federation Government  will  be

prepared to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>



grant us terms equally favourable as those they  are

prepared to grant to the Bornean territories?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will

touch  on that when I move my amendment. In fact,  I

do  not  think  it is right that I  should  move  my

amendment, and I cannot move my amendment until  the

amendment  of  the  Member for Queenstown  has  been

disposed  of.  And as the Member  for  Anson  is  so

anxious to know what is in the bag, perhaps he could

help  me  by  telling  the  Barisan  Sosialis  boys,

"Forget  it,  boys. Don't keep on  whipping  a  dead

horse."



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is a preview.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> P.A.P. - dead horse.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Barisan horse.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the more the public keep on

hearing  speeches  from the mouths  of  the  Barisan

Members,  the  more  the public are  coming  to  the

realisation  that  the Barisan do not  want  merger.

They  do  not  want merger. So they are doing  their

best  to  confuse the issue and try to see how  they

can get out of their present difficulty. They do not

want  to  hold referendum meetings where  they  will

have to tell the electorate. "This is our stand.  We

want this form of merger because we believe this  is

good  for  you." And I hope that whatever form  they

try  to  present to the electorate will be presented

in a manner that is ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> An honest referendum.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> --- in a manner that is free from

party political content. Of course, Sir, the Barisan

Sosialis  say  that when it was born,  there  was  a

star.  But  what  little I know  of  "starology"  or

whatever  you  call  it,  they  do  not  know  their

parentage. They have no parentage at all,  Sir.  The

Barisan  Sosialis, the star that  shines,  the  star

that  is  deliberately  misguiding  the  people   of

Singapore  into  trouble,  the  star  that  is  not

bringing  light  at all, the star that  is  bringing

confusion ---

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, even in this very mild

speech of mine, the P.A.P. and the ex-P.A.P. want to

really so keen on exterminating the other outside ---

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> --- it is very simple,

constitutional or otherwise. Sir, I do urge upon the

P.A.P. and the Barisan Sosialis, who in actual  fact

hope  to  be  the P.A.P. - they claim  they  are  the

genuine P.A.P. - will just forget their vendetta.  If

they  really love their country, now is the time  to

measure up ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In an honest referendum.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> --- now is the time to measure up

honestly  and  squarely.  Sir,  I  really   do   not

understand why ---

going to finish his speech?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I have quite a lot more, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House resolves that the people of

Singapore  be asked to express their choice  on  the

mode  and manner of the inevitable reunification  of

the  two  territories and that a referendum be  held

for the people to decide between the alternatives of

reunification on the basis of:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the constitutional arrangements set out in

Paper  Command  33  of 1961  giving  Singapore

autonomy in education and labour; or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a complete and unconditional merger as a

state  on an equal basis with the other eleven

states  in  accordance with the constitutional

documents of the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>Since which an amendment has been moved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 3, to leave out from "their" to the end and

insert-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"wishes on the inevitable reunification of the

two territories and that a referendum be held for

the people to decide whether they accept or

reject the constitutional arrangements set out in

Paper Command 33 of 1961".



<br><br>The Question is, "That the words proposed to be left

out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are against

the amendment proposed by the Member for Queenstown.

Our  stand  has  been  made clear  on  two  previous

occasions  in  April when the Member for  Queenstown

made an attempt to have this one-question referendum

accepted  by  the  Assembly  and  also  during   the

Committee stage of the National Referendum  Bill.  I

need  not  go  over the reasons for  our  objection.

Suffice  it  to  say that a one-question  referendum

will  not  produce the right answer and the  Barisan

Sosialis  are  anxious  to  have  that  one-question

referendum because it will mean the knock-out of the

P.A.P. - and  that is what they like to see.  But  we,

who  are  conscious  of  our responsibility  to  the

people  of  Singapore, are anxious to see  that  the

referendum  on  merger  must  be  conducted  in   an

atmosphere   free  from  distortions   and   in   an

atmosphere of calm and careful thinking on the  part

of  the electorate, so that the right answer may  be

ascertained. If it is the desire of the majority  of

the   electorate   to  choose  a  form   of   closer

association  that is not embodied in  Command  Paper

33,  i.e., if they reject Command Paper 33, then  it

is  the  responsibility of the Government to get  in

touch  with the Federation Government and convey  to

the  Federation Government the desires of the people

of  Singapore  and  do  their  best  to  secure  for

Singapore  the form of closer association  that  the

referendum result shows. It is wrong on the part  or

the  Prime Minister to say, "Tell me what  you  want

and I will get it for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



you."  He has no right to say it because he  has  no

power to give what the people want. What he can  say

is  to assure this House and the people of Singapore

that  whatever form of closer association the people

of  Singapore  choose,  it shall  be  his  duty  and

responsibility   to   have  discussions   with   the

Federation  Government with a view  to  implementing

the  result of the referendum. The Member for  Anson

was  carried  away  by his strong criticism  of  the

P.A.P. and he even went to the extent of describing

distortion  as  dishonest. There  cannot  be  honest

distortion and dishonest distortion; a distortion is

a  distortion;  it is a twisting of facts.  He  said

that   there   is  a  very  curious  definition   of

dishonesty. He went on to explain what he  meant  by

this,  that proposal (b) in the motion of the  Prime

Minister  is  dishonest  in  the  context  of  today

although it could have been honest 10 months ago. So

in  this  merger issue, Sir, everything  is  getting

confused.  It would seem to the mind of  the  Member

for  Anson  that honest things can become  dishonest

things just through the process of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson again found occasion to

criticise  the Press, but, Sir, we in the Opposition

have  seen  that the Member for Anson  secures  more

coverage than any other Member of the Opposition. We

do not grudge him that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson again said that other

proposals for closer association are intended to  be

a  smoke-screen. I think Sir, he, as  a  responsible

Member  and  leader of a responsible  Party  - so  he

claims  - must not use words that will tend  to  make

the  people more confused. He was prepared  to  have

more than one question posed in a referendum and yet

through  his exuberance he described other questions

to  be posed as a smokescreen. Surely, Sir, when  we

debate the questions to be posed in a referendum, it

is  essential for all Members of this Assembly, from

all  political Parties represented in this Assembly,

to   discuss  the  questions  in  a  calm  cool  and

collected  manner with a view to putting  our  heads

together  to  find out what other  forms  of  closer

association  there can be apart from  Command  Paper

33.  If  there  are three possible  and  practicable

forms of closer association, then those forms



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



must  be the subject of questions to be posed  in  a

referendum.  No Party in this House  should  try  to

endeavour  to  pose  a question which  has  a  party

political  content. The Barisan Sosialis should  not

say, "We want to see our question posed." The P.A.P.

have  not  said that they want to see  the  question

posed. What they are posing in Command Paper No.  33

is  a  decision of this Assembly. There is no P.A.P.

question  at  all  and there is no  reason  why  the

Barisan Sosialis should say that they want to have a

Barisan  Sosialis question posed in the  referendum.

Let  us all forget our party politics in this matter

of  grave importance to the public. Let us sink  our

political  differences and find  the  best  possible

solution for the people of Singapore, and after that

let  us  have it out in this Assembly,  and  if  the

Opposition could contain their impatience  and  they

desire to see the end of the P.A.P. until after that

date, then I could say that the Opposition would  be

a  very  responsible Opposition. Let us not try  and

confuse  the  electorate on a matter on  which  they

have to seek our guidance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, as to the questions to be posed. There

is  no  necessity for any group in this Assembly  to

try  and describe the other party as dishonest - as  a

party  that  is  out to perpetrate a  fraud  on  the

people. If the questions have been fully debated and

accepted  by the Assembly, then it is for  each  and

every  political  Party to go  out  to  the  masses,

conduct  referendum  meetings  and  explain  to  the

people in a straightforward, honest way the form  of

closer  association that the political Party  stands

for.  No  one in this House would imagine  that  the

Barisan   Sosialis   would  be  holding   referendum

meetings  to try and persuade the people  to  accept

Command  Paper 33. But if they feel that their  idea

of  closer association is complete and unconditional

merger, then they are free to explain their stand to

the  electorate and get the electorate to vote  with

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in all these discussions on the form of

closer   association,   let   us,   as   responsible

representatives of the people in this House, be most

conscious  of the fact that we have to consider  the

views



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>



of  the other party, that is, the Government of  the

Federation of Malaya, and whatever utterances we may

make,   let  us  be  very  conscious  of  the  grave

responsibility that is thrust upon us.  Let  us  not

make  it more difficult for the Government to  carry

out the wishes of the electorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will move my amendment later on, but there

is  a  point  that  the Member  for  Queenstown  has

brought  up in his very lengthy speech. He  confuses

himself - he  contradicts himself.  He  says,  "Before

they  can  express their choice,  that  is  to  say,

before  the electorate can give their vote,  on  the

questions  posed  to  them,  they  must   first   be

consulted."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a referendum is a form of consultation of the

electorate. Perhaps, Sir, he does not know what he

has been reading since that masterpiece could not

have been written by him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, then he keeps on playing the old line - again

general    election,   general   election,   general

election.  I  say to them again, forget the  general

election. If they are so keen to prove their  worth,

to  prove that they are the staunch champions in the

Opposition, go out, come back, and I shall  take  my

hat off to them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is it.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> If they ever come back.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he says again that merger has been rejected by

the  people of Anson. By that I think he means  that

because  the P.A.P. was not returned and the  Member

for  Anson was returned, the merger proposal of  the

Government  had been rejected by the people  of  Anson. I do not think it is a right conclusion. If, as

he  is very fond of saying, the S.P.A. Alliance  and

the P.A.P. are on the same side of the fence on this

question  of  merger, and if he  were  to  take  the

trouble  to add up the votes of the P.A.P. and  the

S.P.A. Alliance candidates, he would find that  they

are more than the votes of the Anson candidate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot do what we like on this very grave

issue. I know the P.A.P. are very fond of trying to

knock out the Barisan and doing all they can to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>



make  use  of this merger referendum as a  means  of

delivering the knock-out blow. And the Barisan is so

keen to have a one-question referendum to knock  out

the P.A.P. In this mutual desire of wanting to knock

out each other, let them remember that they must not

try  to  knock  out the interests of the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three questions - the two questions moved by the

Prime  Minister and the amendment to be proposed  by

me - will be  posed in the referendum, and in the same

way as the referendum in Newfoundland was conducted.

Therefore,  there  is this precedent  which  we  can

follow.  But the questions posed in the Newfoundland

referendum were questions that had a bearing on  the

next  constitutional  step  - the  advance  that  was

sought  for Newfoundland. So, in the same way,  when

we   pose   all   possible  questions   for   closer

association  with  the  Federation  of  Malaya,  the

electorate can choose one form and reject the  rest.

It is silly to suggest, as has been suggested by the

Member for Anson and the Member for Queenstown - they

seem  to  echo each other - that the voter must  have

the right to say "Yes" or "No".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes" or "No" to three questions? If you get two

"Yeses" and one "No", what is the answer? You get no

answer  at all. The electorate can have their choice

and  if,  as  the  Barisan believe,  the  people  of

Singapore do not like Command Paper 33, surely  they

will  have every opportunity to vote for a  form  of

closer association that is not Command Paper 33.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to repeat my appeal to this House

again on this very important issue which means  life

and  death to the people of Singapore. Let  us  sink

our  party differences. Let us rise above them.  Put

our  heads  together and find the best solution  for

the people of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, we are having a debate  ranging  over

the  three questions contained in the motion. First,

I  will  touch on the motion by the Prime  Minister.

Mr   Speaker,   Sir,  the  Prime   Minister,   when

concluding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>



his  speech a little while ago, said that any person

who  had correct thoughts would not doubt the motion

moved  by  him;  but  I will say that  anyone  whose

thoughts  are  correct and who has  right  thinking,

will not propose such a motion as he has.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us now talk about the few

points  raised by the Prime Minister. He  said  that

the   Barisan  Sosialis  had  made  a   mistake   by

suggesting a type of merger based on the Penang  and

Malacca  type. I would like to say that the  Barisan

Sosialis  had  never  made a  mistake.  The  Barisan

Sosialis  proposed a merger such as the  Penang  and

Malacca type with certain conditions, but the  Prime

Minister  used to quote out of context  and  distort

facts. So if any person has made any mistake, it  is

the  P.A.P., because the P.A.P. Government  want  to

deal  the  Barisan Sosialis a blow; but because  the

P.A.P. cannot get any excuse, they are now  raising

the  Communist  bogey. The Prime Minister  dare  not

pose one question to the people for a decision. This

is  because  the  P.A.P. have no  courage  and  also

because the Prime Minister has no confidence in  his

White Paper on merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that the Prime Minister in his

speech many times quoted the speeches made by  other

people and so created a lot of controversy. That  is

improper. He should not have done so. He also in the

course  of  his  speech quoted various  examples  in

other  countries where referenda were held.  I  feel

that  by  quoting examples from other  countries  on

national referenda, he could not have realised  what

is now before us here. He said that what he had been

advocating  was something with precedents.  He  said

that  other  people  may no  be  familiar  with  the

precedents in other countries; but I am sure that in

other   countries  the  referendum  law  has   never

provided such a provision as deeming blank votes and

uncertain votes to be in support of the Government's

proposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister also said that the White Paper merger proposals were very good and alleged that the other type of merger proposition was very bad. He said that the Government's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



merger  proposals included autonomy  in  labour  and

education. But I have some doubts. If the Government

is so confident that its White Paper on merger is so

very good, why does it dare not put it to the people

for a decision?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister also said that the National Referendum Bill was very logical and would meet the present situation. But I would say that this type or logic must be the P.A.P. type of logic. What he said about meeting the present situation I think means

that it must be meeting the P.A.P. situation at  the

moment,  because if the P.A.P. does not  go  through

with merger, its life will not be long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now talk about why the

Prime  Minister has moved this motion. I would  like

to  talk about the motives and the plot of the Prime

Minister.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, these two  points  are

worth  studying. Let me expound to you  slowly.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, we can now see very clearly that  the

National Referendum Bill, which was passed last week

in this House, is one that cannot be seen by anyone,

because it is undomocratic and unreasonable.  It  is

full  of arbitrary provisions. There are many things

in it more Fascist than the Fascists and more Hitler

than  Hitler,  but  this Bill has  been  barbarously

passed  by  the Government. The Party in  power  has

never  seriously taken the views of  the  Opposition

Parties.  It  has  always closed  its  ears  to  the

propositions and views of the Opposition Parties.  I

have  many  doubts  about the motion  of  the  Prime

Minister.  If  only the views of the Government  and

the  Opposition  Parties can  be  unified,  all  the

difficulties can be resolved. But to arrive  at  any

agreement with the Government is not possible. I  am

sure of it. Even the Prime Minister knows this to be

so.  But  Mr Speaker, Sir, since the facts  are  as

what  I  have  said,  why does  the  Prime  Minister

introduce  his motion? It is worth our  study  here.

Judging from the appearance of the motion, it  looks

like  the  type of request the Barisan Sosialis  has

asked  for, because the Government has said that  it

will  put the Barisan Sosialis request to be  framed

in  the  question.  Now he has introduced  a  motion

incorporating a type of motion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>



supposedly   to   represent  the  Barisan   Sosialis

request.  Let  us  ask  whether  it  represents  the

Barisan  Sosialis' request. I say it does  not.  The

matter  is not so simple as that. I say the  Barisan

Sosialis  has many reasonable requests and  demands.

Why   are  all  those  requests  and  demands  being

objected  to  and  rejected by the  Government?  For

instance, the Barisan Sosialis said there should  be

only  one  question in this. The national referendum

should  provide  that  there  should  be  only   one

question  for  the  people to decide,  whether  they

would  accept or reject the Government's White Paper

on merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another request by the Barisan Sosialis was that

any  blank votes and uncertain votes should  not  be

construed  as  those supporting any  side,  but  the

Government  could not accept it. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

according  to  what  we have been  debating  on  the

National  Referendum Bill last week, the  Government

has  forgotten  the  interests  of  the  people   of

Singapore. What the Government is now looking  after

and  is caring for is its own interest. It will  not

care  for  anything  else.  Even  when  the  Barisan

Sosialis  has  been criticising the  Government  and

exposing  its  true character, the Government  still

breathes and is very thick-skinned. It will not feel

any  remorse or any shame. I would like to point out

that the Government's motion now under consideration

is not honest and not reasonable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has always prided himself on being a very clever person. But at the Students'

Forum  organised  by the University Students  Union,

when asked a question by Mr Tommy Koh, he could not

answer  it.  At  that moment, he said  that  only  a

foolish person would ask such a foolish question  to

get a foolish answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that the motion by the

Prime Minister is, of course, not meant to arrive at

a  foolish conclusion. Mr Speaker, Sir, let me talk

about   the   Prime  Minister's  motion  now   under

consideration. It appears that the Prime Minister is

rather  generous in moving this motion  and  letting

the  Assembly  discuss it. But  there  are  ulterior

motives  behind  it.  All the actions  and  measures

taken by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P. are very undemocratic, and yet it  tries  to

cover  itself and put up a facade of democracy.  The

more it pretends, the more it becomes unseemly,  and

the more it exposes itself. This motion of the Prime

Minister  shows  that  the Government  is  having  a

guilty  conscience. Why? The reason is very  simple.

Firstly,  the Prime Minister knows that the National

Referendum Bill is not popular with the people.  The

people  do not like it. It should have provided  for

the  people to decide on whether they want or do not

want the Government's White Paper on merger; and  it

should have been drafted in such a way as to achieve

that  purpose. The Government has tried  to  confuse

the  issue in the National Referendum Bill. Although

by  passing the Bill it could pose two questions, it

knows   it   is  doing  it  by  sheer  strength   of

compulsion. It knows that its White Paper on  merger

will  not  be acceptable to the people. It had  said

that  this  Bill was a general Referendum Bill,  but

later  on it changed its mind and said that it could

be  a  specific  one.  After  holding  the  national

referendum,  the Bill would be repealed.  Now,  this

proves  that  the Government has been wrong  in  the

past.  Being a lawyer, the Prime Minister  dare  not

accept  the fact that the Government or himself  has

been  wrong.  He  has  only  accepted  part  of  the

mistake,  and that shows his cowardice. He has  said

in the past that the Government would let the people

decide the question on the White Paper on merger. He

has said that the people could mark an X against the

column marked "yes" if they accept the question. The

people could also mark an X against the column  "no"

to  show that they reject it. It is obvious that the

question  should be so framed as to ask  the  people

whether  they want or reject the Government's  White

Paper  merger  proposals.  The  Prime  Minister  has

boasted  that he would ask the people, but  now  the

situation  has  changed because the Government  have

been exposed by the Opposition Parties and the Prime

Minister can find no way to save his Government from

the  present  embarrassment. He is a  very  eloquent

orator but today he cannot even give a reason or  an

argument



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>



to  substantiate  his  Party's  stand  on  the

propositions.  In  spite of his  eloquence,  and  in

spite  of  the White Paper being in black  type,  he

cannot  blind the people. However much he  tries  to

deceive the people he will not succeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we can clearly see that the

Government are gradually trying to find  a  way  out

from  their present predicament. The Government have

committed  an  unforgivable crime by  creating  some

undemocratic  provisions in the National  Referendum

Bill.  Now  the  P.A.P. are experiencing  a  guilty

conscience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the reports in today's

newspapers  we  can see a statement  issued  by  the

Political Bureau of the P.A.P. which says  that  the

P.A.P. cannot  withstand  the  pressure  coming  from  all

quarters.  The P.A.P. are trying to go  all  out  to

convince  the people of the necessity of clause  29,

so that they can have a scapegoat. Mr Speaker. Sir,

let  me in this House show you how irresponsible the

P.A.P. are by trying to push their mistakes  on  to

others.  This is a copy of the Sin Chew Jit  Poh  of

today,  local page No. 1, which contains this report

of  the  statement  issued by the  Political  Bureau

saying that the provisions regarding blank votes and

uncertain votes ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do hope that the hon. Lady

is  not  going  back to clause 29. We have  finished

with  clause 29. It has been passed and written into

the  Bill. We are now discussing what questions will

be  asked on this referendum. I cannot see  how  the

merits  of  clause 29 have anything to do with  this

motion.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, what I would like to point out is this. At  the

present  juncture the Government has made a  mistake

and  is  trying to get a scapegoat to cover  up  its

mistake.  Just like this motion, it is  a  means  by

which  the Government tries to find a scapegoat  for

the  mistakes  it  has made. When  this  motion  was

tabled  by the Prime Minister, he knew it  would  be

passed.  So  why  should such a  motion  be  brought

forward?  It is very simple. If the question  should

come before the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>



House  for debate, then the Prime Minister will  say

later  on  that  this is a question  that  has  been

decided  on by the Assembly and that he has  nothing

to do with it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> There is no logic.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): This is the

cunning  logic of the P.A.P. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  now

let  me  deal with the motion of the Prime Minister.

When  moving  it, he said "That this House  resolves

that  the  people of Singapore be asked  to  express

their   choice  on  the  mode  and  manner  of   the

inevitable  reunification of the  two  territories."

Mr   Speaker,   Sir,  this  so-called   "inevitable

reunification", especially the word "inevitable".  I

would  say, at the present juncture, that the people

of  Singapore, in the absence of a better  term  for

"merger", can avoid a merger. What is inevitable  is

actually inevitable to the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in moving his motion the Prime

Minister brought out two alternatives. The first is

the constitutional arrangements set out in the White

Paper  giving  Singapore autonomy in  education  and

labour. On the White Paper merger proposals we  have

had  a  very lengthy debate in this House and there

is   no   need  for  me  to  repeat  the  arguments,

but --- [Interruption]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Delta says that

although  I  say  I  do  not  want  to  repeat   the

arguments. I have repeated them many times. This  is

the  most  difficult thing - we tell  them  one,  two,

three,  four times, and still they do not understand

what  we tell them! As though we are talking to cows

who  cannot understand what we say. We are now in  a

position  in which scholars talk reason to  soldiers

who  cannot  understand reason at all. That  is  the

true  position in any case. If we do not  speak  our

minds,  then  we do not discharge our duty.  If  the

Government wants to force this motion through,  then

it has to shoulder the whole responsibility.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On a

point of order. The Member for Stamford says that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>



those who are listening to her are cows. The Speaker

is  listening to her. Does it mean that the  Speaker

is a cow?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes. The Member for Delta is right. I

have  always  said  that Members  of  this  Assembly

should  not  be referred to as animals of  any  kind

whatsoever, be they cows or bulls.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  was  referring to the Members of  the  Government

when I used the term, "when we were listening to the

cows."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have ruled that out. Even if the

Lady  is  polite  enough to say  that  she  did  not

include the Speaker, she must still not call Members

of the Assembly cows.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I bow to your ruling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has moved this motion on the White Paper for a decision of the people. He mentions autonomy in education and labour. It is, I say, humbug. The people are very clear about it. So, on the second alternative, I would say that it is a

very  strange  alternative to us.  More  so  to  the

people outside this House. We in this House have not

debated  the second alternative. We do not know  the

situation  and conditions in the various  States  in

the  Federation. The people outside this House  will

be even more ignorant. So this second alternative is

very  frightening  and  terrible.  The  Member   for

Cairnhill said just a few moments ago that if  after

merger - Mr Speaker, Sir, hoon chang ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, hoon chang means "damn

you".  Are  these  two expressions parliamentary  in

this   House?  Just  now  the  Member  for  Stamford

mentioned  hoon  chang.  She  interjected  with  the

expression hoon chang?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member please repeat that? I

will  get it from the interpreter eventually. Is  it

hoon chang?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Is the expression,

"To hell with you," parliamentary in this House?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> So now I know that hoon chang means

"to  hell with you". If it is "to hell with you",  I

do  not  know  whether  it is offensive.  If  it  is

offensive,  then, of course, it must  be  withdrawn.

The   Parliamentary  Secretary  has  objected   and,

therefore, I must ask the hon. Lady to withdraw that

expression hoon chang.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,   in  my  opinion,  this  expression  is   only

applicable to a person who feels offended;  then  he

will raise objection to it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Lady must not debate with the

Chair  now. The Chair has asked her to withdraw  the

expression as being offensive at least to one Member

of  this  Assembly. Therefore, she must withdraw  it

without debating it



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> On a point of order.

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Just one second. I have just dealt

with  a  point of order. Let the Lady withdraw  that

expression first.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, in that case, I withdraw the expression.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Member did not

withdraw the expression.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, does the Parliamentary Secretary feel sleepy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that to talk is just like

to  walk. If there is anything dirty, you must sweep

it   away.  If  the  Government  Benches   want   to

interject,  then  I  feel that  it  should  be  very

unsatisfactory to me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I was dealing with the second

alternative which the Government intends to pose  to

the  people. I will say that this is not in  keeping

with procedure, because this second alternative  has

not been debated in this House. It has no foundation

on  which the people can make their decision  as  to

whether it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>



is  good  or  bad. However, from our  understanding,

these  two questions are equally bad. They are  just

like Government holding a gun and asking the people,

"Do you want to live or do you want to die?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me talk about the motion of the Opposition. I feel that the first motion is just

like a test stone. If the merger proposals are to be

likened  to  gold, then it should not be  afraid  of

fire.  If the Government feels that the White  Paper

merger proposals are good, then it should accept the

amendment moved by the Opposition. The second motion

tabled  by  the Opposition is moved to  condemn  the

Government   for  distorting  the   stand   of   the

Opposition.  I  feel  that a responsible  Government

should not distort the stand of other people. By  so

doing, it is not acting responsibly. It will  be  an

irresponsible Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Speaker, Sir, let me make use of the

words  uttered  by  the Political Secretary  to  the

Prime  Minister to describe the motion of the  Prime

Minister.   I  feel  that  the  Political  Secretary

uttered a sentence which is very appropriate for the

description of the motion in the name of  the  Prime

Minister. He said this in his third talk over  Radio

Singapore. This is reported in the Sin Chew Jit  Poh

of Tuesday, 12th June, at page 5. What he said reads

as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To treat a dead horse as a live horse and give it

treatment."



<br><br>I  feel that the motion of the Prime Minister is  to

try  and treat a dead horse as a live horse, because

the  political  future of the  Government  has  gone

bankrupt.  On the day when this National  Referendum

Bill was passed, the Government was dead. As far  as

the   political  future  is  concerned,  the   Prime

Minister  is dictatorial and undemocratic. He  wants

to pose two unacceptable questions to the people. He

wants  to have these questions debated in this House

in  order to redeem himself from the bad name he has

acquired  by  committing  crimes  in  the  name   of

democracy. I will say this motion will not help  the

Government  in any way to rejuvenate or  revive  the

political life of the Party.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude my speech, I will say that I

strongly  oppose  the  motion  moved  by  the  Prime

Minister. I am in full and complete support  of  the

motion of the Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am  not prepared to make a lengthy speech in this

House because the time for debate is limited. At the

same  time, the Members of the Opposition have  day

in  and  day  out  been repeating  their  old  tunes

without producing any new points of argument.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Queenstown brought forward

a  few strange arguments. I am therefore taking this

opportunity of rebutting him. First, he  said  that

we  on  the  Government side  are  selling  out  the

people.  I  do not understand his interpretation  of

the  word "sell-out". We have explained very clearly

to  the  people  of Singapore that the  White  Paper

merger  proposals are not at all detrimental to  the

interests of the people here. The citizenship of the

Chinese  population  in  Singapore  is  still  being

retained.  At  the same time, we are to  retain  our

autonomy  in  education  and  labour.  Therefore,  I

cannot see any meaning in the words "selling out".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to raise is this. The

Member  for Queenstown has repeatedly urged that  we

should go back to the masses for a general election.

I  remember, Sir, that after we were defeated in the

Hong  Lim  by-election and when we  were  discussing

whether or not we should resign from the Government,

he   insisted  that  we  should  stay  on   in   the

Government.  This  is because they  were  afraid  of

losing  the  posts  of Parliamentary  Secretary.  We

explained at that time our failure in the  Hong  Lim

by-election.  At  that  time  we  did  not  see  any

possibility of realising the merger proposals of the

P.A.P. We now see that there is a possibility of the

merger proposals being realised. At that time, those

ex-Parliamentary  Secretaries  were   ambitious   to

become  Ministers  or even Prime Minister  and  take

over  the  government. They did not  say  that  they

wanted  to resign. Instead of that, they said,  "Now

you resign and we will take over the government."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for the split in the P.A.P. is partly

due  to the personal ambition of a certain group  of

people and partly due to their objection to merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown said that the P.A.P. did

not  get a mandate from the people in the June  1959

elections   in  support  of  the  merger  proposals.

Meanwhile,  he has repeatedly challenged  us  to  a

general  election. Let me remind him that  prior  to

the  general  elections he had signed an undertaking

with  the P.A.P. This undertaking must be signed  by

every  P.A.P. candidate who contested  the  general

election.  In this undertaking they said they  would

abide  by  the  policy as contained in  the  Party's

Fourth Anniversary Celebration Souvenir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the people of Singapore and even the

people of Malaya know that the ultimate objective of

the  P.A.P. is  to fight for a merger  of  the  two

territories  and  to  achieve  the  independence  of

Singapore  through  merger with  the  Federation  of

Malaya. In this undertaking, it was also stated that

if any Member should resign or was expelled from the

Party,  he  should  also  resign  his  seat  in  the

Assembly. If they are manly enough, they should have

kept  their promise. If I signed this undertaking  I

would not remain [Interruption.] ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown is

probably  feeling the strain of the  late  hours,  I

suppose.   He  has  been  interjecting  every   five

minutes, even less than that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

said just now that if I signed that undertaking  and

if  I  left the P.A.P., I would not remain  in  this

House.  Yet  they claimed that they  would  keep  up

[Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Barisan Sosialis Members

will not have any respect for the Chair's ruling.  I

will have to take very serious action against them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

if   the  13  Members  who  left  the  P.A.P. were

courageous  enough,  they  should  have  resigned --- [Interruption.]



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am addressing my remarks to

the  Member  for Jalan Kayu. This is Standing  Order

No. 55:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Speaker or the Chairman shall order any Member

whose  conduct  is  grossly disorderly  to  withdraw

immediately  from the Assembly during the  remainder

of that day's sitting;'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if the Member for Jalan Kayu ignores the

directions  of the Chair, he will be proceeded  with

under Standing Order No. 55.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the   Members   from  the  Opposition   side   often

interjected because what I had pointed out is like a

pin which pierces through their heart. Therefore.  I

hope  that  they will not dare to ask for a  general

election. If they were courageous enough they should

have  resigned by themselves and then we would  send

some  people to stand as candidates and compete with

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Queenstown has said that we have forgotten our Five-year Development

Plan. If the Members of the Barisan Sosialis are not

prejudiced, they will see that there are new  houses

coming  up all over Singapore. The housing  problem,

if  left to the previous colonial government,  would

not have been solved for the next 30 years.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was just wondering how that

is  relevant to the motion. Let us come back to  the

motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I was replying to the Member for Queenstown who said

that  we  had  forgotten  our Five-Year  Development

Plan.  Mr  Speaker,  the  P.A.P.  Government  is  a

realistic  Government. We are not prepared  to  day-dream. We are conscious of the present circumstances

in Malaya, and in this context we have brought about

this  Cmd. Paper 33. This proves that we are  really

sincere  in fulfilling the wishes of the  people  of

the   two   territories  in  the  reunification   of

Singapore and Malaya.



<br><br>10.49 p.m.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what we are concerned with is not theory, nor

are  we  prepared to be the slaves of any ideologies

or  jams.  What we are concerned with is  the  basic

livelihood of the people. We have nearly solved  the

problem  of  housing  in  Singapore.  Now  we  hope,

through  merger,  we can solve the problems  of  the

people in respect of clothing and food.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our declaration of the merger of Singapore

and   Malaya,   the  Barisan  Sosialis   and   other

politicians  have openly declared their  anti-merger

stand.   They  are  only  stooges  of  the   Malayan

Communists. We are not prepared to be the slaves  of

any  political  ideology. We maintain  that  in  the

context of Malaya at this moment, only Cmd. Paper 33

can   bring  about  the  reunification  of  the  two

territories  in  a realistic way.  Yet  the  Barisan

Sosialis do not stick to what they say because  they

dare  not  state  openly  their  anti-merger  stand.

Therefore,  they  introduce  many  proposals   which

cannot be fulfilled under the present circumstances.

I understand even the Chinese born in the Federation

of  Malaya,  if  their parents were not  Federation-born, will have to apply for Federation citizenship.

Under  these  circumstances, we  cannot  expect  the

leaders  across  the  causeway,  that  means   these

leaders  who  are  mostly  non-Chinese,  to   accept

automatic conversion of citizenship for the  624,000

Chinese in Singapore. If that is practicable in  the

present  circumstances, then we  need  not  have  to

labour ourselves at this moment. That is to say,  in

the present context the purpose of this demand is to

try  to  embarrass the merger proposals. Any  person

who is conscientious, cool, peaceful and sober, will

be   able   to  understand  that,  in  the   present

circumstances,  the  introduction  of  this   demand

cannot be acceptable. Those who can use their brains

will  be  able to understand that the demand brought

forward by the Barisan Sosialis has one motive, that

is, to block the way for merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the amendment by the Member for

Queenstown.  After some scrutiny we  can  understand

that  its purpose is to try to show that the  people

of  Singapore do not want merger, because they  want

the people to say only yes or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



no. By this they hope the P.A.P. Government will ask

the people of Singapore whether they will accept the

White Paper on merger, that is to say, they hope  by

that  they  can incite the general public to  oppose

the White Paper merger. If the White Paper on merger

is defeated then there will be no merger. That is  a

passive way out. It is not a positive way out.  They

think that if the White Paper on merger is defeated,

then  there will be no merger. But everybody  should

know  that merger and Malaysia are not things  which

any   politician  can  block.  If  we  examine   the

situation  in  Singapore in a cool, calm  and  sober

way,   we   can   realise  that  when  Malaysia   is

established and if Singapore is not part of it, then

Singapore will be isolated. Then Singapore  will  be

in  a  difficult  position and  will  find  it  very

difficult  to  resolve  the  problem  of  earning  a

livelihood  and other matters. On this we  have  not

seen  any  concrete suggestions or  plans  from  the

Barisan  Sosialis. During the course of the  debate,

there  was only shouting, yelling, and levelling  of

invectives. Even when we on this side of  the  House

wanted  to  make speeches, they tried to prevent  us

from  making  speeches. That  shows  their  attitude

towards  tackling the problems before us.  When  his

amendment  is  defeated, I am sure  the  Member  for

Queenstown  will bring up another  amendment  which

will  be  to  request that the 624,000  citizens  of

Singapore   would   automatically   become   Federal

citizens. Its purpose, we all know, is to thwart the

merger  plan. The consequences of that will be  that

Singapore  will be isolated from the  Federation  of

Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, about the second

amendment, I am not prepared to touched on it at the

moment  because  I  would like  to  see  what  grand

arguments the Member for Anson will be advancing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching upon the speech made by the Member for

Anson  just now, it seems that I have been  watching

an  interesting exhibition by him because I have not

much  opportunity to see him put  up  such  a  grand

performance when he was gesticulating with all kinds

of  vivid demonstrations, rather dramatic in his own

way, to attract his audience. But I can recollect



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>



that  he pointed out that Singapore should  be

one of the component States of the Federation and be

like   any  one  of  the  present  States   of   the

Federation, and enjoy equal rights as any one of the

States  of the Federation. But he admitted  that  he

did   not   know  that  there  could  be   so   many

difficulties   and  complexities  in  carrying   out

constitutional   arrangements.   He   confessed   it

frankly. And the same with the Barisan Sosialis when

they  demanded that Singapore should be merged on  a

certain basis. Later when they found that they  were

really   in   the  position  of  being   wrong   and

embarrassed  and  in  a predicament,  they  advanced

another  claim saying that the citizens of Singapore

should automatically become Federal citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also clearly expressed the

wish  that merger should be  delayed for as  long  as

possible.  This  is similar to the  Barisan's  plot,

i.e. when  the merger proposals were  first  aired,

members  of  the Barisan Sosialis were  going  round

everywhere trying to persuade the people  to  oppose

merger.  Supporters of the Barisan Sosialis kept  on

asking  the  people, why did they want merger?  They

argued  with  the leadership of the  P.A.P. against

merger.  From  that time onwards, we  realised  that

they  were trying to plot against merger openly.  In

public  they  declare that they are  in  support  of

merger,  but secretly I think that anyone who  comes

to  know  them  will know that they  are,  in  fact,

opposed to merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment proposed by them calls for the

automatic  conversion  of  Singapore  citizens  into

Federal  citizens. I hope that when the  Member  for

Anson moves his amendment he will tell us whether he

agrees that the education policy of Singapore should

keep  in line with the Rahim Talib education policy,

and  whether  he  is  prepared to  let  autonomy  in

education  and labour be handed over to the  control

of  the Central Government. I would also like to ask

him  whether  he is prepared to accept any  measures

put out by the Central Government, for instance, the

4  to  1  ratio  of  Malays to non-Malays  in  civil

service. You see, you cannot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>



have  the best of two worlds. You  cannot  have

your  cake and eat it too. That is why if  you  want

complete  merger, you cannot at the same  time  make

your  own  demands.  And  so  by  putting  out  such

propositions   which   are   unacceptable   to   the

Federation, they are thwarting merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the problems facing Singapore are mostly connected with the livelihood of the

people.  The main task of the P.A.P. is to safeguard

the interests of the people. We do not intend to  be

doctrinaires. We do not want to become slaves to any

"isms" without regard to our practical situation. As

the  Prime Minister has said, we will not become the

pawns  or  stooges  of the Malayan Communist  Party.

According  to  the present objective  circumstances,

the  proposals  as contained in the White  Paper  on

merger  are the ones which can resolve the  problems

of the livelihood of the people. They can find a way

out for the people.



<br><br>11.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker,  Sir, the Opposition  Parties  have

introduced an amendment from which we can see  their

vicious plot. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to the people

of  Singapore, the most important thing  is  merger,

but  the  Opposition  Parties have  all  along  been

repeating their platitudes and attacking the  P.A.P.

merger proposals. This action is rather vicious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, from the amendment before us we can see something vicious behind it. Since the

leader  of  the Barisan Sosialis has taken  part  in

radio  forums, we know that they wanted a Penang  or

Malacca  type of merger. After this type  of  merger

was  aired, the Barisan Sosialis leadership  thought

that  they  were more capable and so  began  talking

about how useful they had been in their branches  by

conducting  night classes in the trade unions.  They

also  talked about the good things about the  Penang

and Malacca type of merger.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal for the Penang and Malacca type of

merger  at  that time seemed to be a good  one.  But

then  the Member for Stamford said that genuine gold

dreads  no  fire.  Let me ask: how  long  can  their

proposed Penang and Malacca type of merger stand the

test of fire? It is only after a few months that  we

see  that  their  type of merger cannot  stand  this

test. And so they now turn round and deny that  they

have made such a proposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the speeches made by the Barisan Members here,

we  can see that the contents are exactly the  same.

There  are  no fresh arguments. They are frying  the

rice  over  and  ever  again. This  is  a  most  apt

description for them. Why do they oppose our putting

their type of merger as one of the questions for the

people  to  decide?  I think the reasons  are  that,

first  and foremost, they are opposed to merger.  If

there  is any form of merger which is acceptable  by

the  people,  then  it  will  not  be  good  to  the

Communists  and  their stooges. And  if  the  people

accept one of the merger forms, then the true motive

of  the  Barisan Sosialis will be exposed. In  fact,

they do not want merger. The next reason is that  if

the  people accepted the type of merger based on the

Penang  and Malacca type, then the Barisan  Sosialis

would  be  afraid of the consequences because  their

type  of  merger  would, in fact, sell  out  Chinese

education and autonomy in labour and the citizenship

of about 300,000 Singapore citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is their aim? I think we know they only want

full  internal self-government. That  is  what  they

have  been  talking about in the  trade  unions  and

their night classes and in other organisations under

their  control. What is meant by full internal self-government?  What does it mean? It  means  that  the

Barisan  Sosialis will be playing together with  the

colonialists  to enslave the people.  Full  internal

self-government will mean that the colonialists will

still  be  able to stay in Singapore and  to  govern

Singapore.  Then  how can this  type  of  government

bring  good  to the people? They have been  talking

about  doing good things for the people.  When  they

say  they  want  to serve the people, they  actually

mean to cheat



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



them. When they talk about serving the people,  they

actually mean that they want to sell out the people.

That  is  the  true motive for their  activities  in

opposing merger. From their talks and deeds  we  can

see their fundamental objectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, why do the P.A.P. want to struggle hard in

order  to  secure merger for all? Are we doing  this

for our individual interests? No. Our starting point

is  always the people. That is, we do things for the

good  of  the  people  and in  their  interest.  The

livelihood  of  the  people has been  much  improved

under  the P.A.P. Government. It is not enough  just

to  build a few roads, put up street lamps or a  few

houses.  If  we  want  to have  a  really  socialist

country, we should first have a united Malaya.  That

is why we must have merger now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, facing the people of Singapore

today  are the constitutional arrangements for their

future.  According to the plan of  the  P.A.P. last

year,   that   was   their  plan  for   the   future

constitutional  arrangements.  These  constitutional

arrangements  which are now being advocated  by  our

Prime  Minister are embodied in the White  Paper  on

merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, before the Prime Minister

reached agreement with the Federation Government, we

had  his assurance that the merger between Singapore

and  the Federation had been considered by a Working

Party.  Its  Report would be put to the  people  for

their decision as to whether or not they accept  the

White  Paper merger proposals. If the people do  not

accept, they can put a cross in the square for "no",

and  if  they  agree, they can put a  cross  in  the

square  for "yes". According to the argument of  the

Minister for Finance, the people will say "yes".  If

that  is  the case, the Government should pose  only

one question as to whether the people want the White

Paper  on  merger  or  not. Do they  have  the  guts

[Interruption] ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. If the Minister for

Finance wishes to rise on any point, the Member  for

Pasir Panjang will naturally give way. If both sides

of the House start interjecting in Chinese,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



then the Chairman will not be able to follow up!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I beg your pardon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, I do not like to deal with these points now.  I

will deal with them later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to speak on the motion moved by

the Prime Minister. The original motion of the Prime

Minister   was   to  consult  the  people   on   the

constitutional  arrangements in respect  of  two  or

three alternatives for the choice of the people. The

first  choice  was the White Paper  on  merger.  The

second  alternative was a complete and unconditional

merger  with Singapore as a state on an equal  basis

with the other eleven states in accordance with  the

constitutional  documents  of  the   Federation   of

Malaya.  The third alternative was to enter Malaysia

on  terms no less favourable than the terms for  the

Borneo territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regard to the first

alternative,  the people of Singapore  already  know

clearly  the contents of the White Paper. They  will

exercise their political rights accordingly ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. To put the record

straight,  the Prime Minister's motion contains  two

alternatives. The third alternative is moved  as  an

amendment   by  the  Member  for  Cairnhill,   which

amendment  the  Government  has  indicated  it  will

accept.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  that  is  so.  The  third  alternative  is  an

amendment moved by the Member for Cairnhill  and  it

has  now been accepted by the Government. Therefore,

I  am  going  to  deal with it as well.  Mr  Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I will take the first alternative  and

the  third  alternative. With regard  to  the  third

alternative,  the people of Singapore  do  not  know

what  will be the terms of this proposal. The second

alternative  will be an unconditional  and  complete

merger,  that is, complete merger on an equal  basis

with the other eleven States. Does



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



it mean that Singapore will become the twelfth State

of  the Federation of Malaya, and after that all the

624,000  citizens  of  Singapore  can  automatically

become  Federal  citizens? Does it  also  mean  that

there  will  be proportional representation  in  the

Central  Parliament? That is, we will have at  least

25  seats in the Central Parliament? With regard  to

automatic   conversion  of   citizenship   for   all

Singapore  citizens and proportional  representation

in  the Central Parliament, can the 624,000 citizens

of  Singapore share a common political life with the

other   citizens?  Can  they  also  share  a  common

economic  life with the other Federal citizens?  The

Minister  for  Finance says yes.  He  is  trying  to

confuse and mislead the people. What we want  is  to

have the 624.000 citizens of Singapore automatically

becoming  Federal  citizens  on  merger.  Have   you

forgotten  the interests of the people of Singapore?

Mr  Deputy  Speaker, Sir, we are to have  a  proper

distribution  of  land. That is  to  say,  Singapore

citizens  and  Federal citizens can enjoy  the  same

rights. But all these points were not made clear  by

the Prime Minister when he moved his motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point - this is very important - is the

second  alternative. He did not point  out  to  this

House  clearly what will be the proper position  and

as a result the people are confused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, concerning the third

alternative,  nobody knows what the  terms  of  this

kind  of  merger will be, especially when  Singapore

and  the Federation Government have not come to  any

agreement. Furthermore, there has been no report  in

this House concerning this third alternative. We can

see  that the motion of the Prime Minister has  been

moved  in  order to mislead the people of Singapore.

It  is something abstract and intangible. Mr Deputy

Speaker,  not  only are we ourselves confused  about

the  terms of the third alternative, but the  people

of  Singapore are also confused. They are not  clear

about  it.  They do not know the terms  because  the

Cobbold  Report has not been published. Up till  now

we do not know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



what are the recommendations or the contents of this

Report. We do not know what will be the terms  given

to the Borneo territories. Therefore, it is improper

for  anybody  to bring up this third alternative  at

this  present  juncture. The P.A.P.  Government  and

their  leaders are the most wonderful distortionists

in  the  world.  They  are in full  control  of  the

national publicity machinery. They have control over

the  Press. And they have a ruling to the newspapers

in  our State that more space should be given to the

statements  of the Ministers and that the statements

of the Opposition should be reduced.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Point of

order. I would like to know what all this has got to

do with the motion under discussion?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I am waiting for the Member for

Pasir   Panjang  to  finish  his  speech   on   this

particular point. Mr Tee Kim Leng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): We know that the

P.A.P. is  in full control of the entire  publicity

machinery  to  mislead the people of Singapore,  Mr

Deputy Speaker, let me give you an example and  show

how  wonderful  the  leaders of the  P.A.P. are  as

distortionists. For example, if the Barisan Sosialis

were  to  say  that the pencils used in  this  House

should  be  red or blue, then the P.A.P. would  turn

round and distort and say that we want blue and  red

pencils for the painting of the walls in this House.

Therefore,  we  want to condemn the  Government  for

distorting our stand on merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Chairman of the

Barisan  Sosialis said last year in the House,  when

the debate on merger was in progress ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Moulmein

(Mr  Lin  You Eng) should know that the reading  of

newspapers and books in this Chamber is against  the

Standing Orders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): At that time, we

moved  a  motion to the effect that in the event  of

reunification



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>



between  Singapore  and  the  Federation,  Singapore

should enter the Federation as the twelfth State and

with  its  624,000  citizens automatically  becoming

Federal     citizens    and    with     proportional

representation in the Central Parliament. Before the

motion of the Barisan Sosialis at that time, we also

issued  a  statement with regard  to  our  stand  on

merger  between  Singapore and the Federation.  This

was  made  on  the  28th of August,  1961.  In  this

statement  it was clearly and categorically  pointed

out  what our stand on merger was and what the tasks

ahead should be. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, our policy

statement  said,  first, we should immediately  have

complete  and genuine merger so that Singapore  will

enter as a State in the Federation of Malaya on  the

basis  of  Penang  and Malacca. Secondly,  Singapore

should enter into confederation with the Federation.

The  form  of  the  first proposal would  have  many

difficulties. The colonialists try to highlight  the

religious and racial differences among our people in

order  to  carry  on  their colonial  rule.  If  the

representatives in the Federation can take concerted

action  with us, then we can bring about a true  and

genuine merger. In this case, we will do all we  can

to  look  after  the  interests  of  the  people  of

Singapore  in  order that Singapore will  enter  the

Federation as the twelfth State. That will mean that

Singapore  becomes part and parcel of the Federation

of   Malaya,   so   that  Singapore  citizens   will

automatically become Federal citizens and they  will

have  proportionate representation  in  the  Central

Government in the Federation of Malaya. There should

be a general election in Singapore to let the people

have  an open decision, so that we can get a mandate

from  the  people to bring about a true and complete

merger.  But now the Federation Government wants  to

find out from us whether we are prepared to persuade

the people to have Singapore entering the Federation

as  the  twelfth State before 1963  in  a  full  and

complete merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that was the basic stand

of  the  Barisan Sosialis on merger. But the  P.A.P.

Government has all along been trying to distort  our

contention and stand, through Radio P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>



and  through the Political Bureau of: the P.A.P. in

distorting  our  stand, the  P.A.P. has  made  many

mistakes. These mistakes are also contained in  the

speech  of the Prime Minister on the 25th  of  June,

1961.  On  the  25th  of June, 1962,  the  Political

Bureau of the P.A.P. issued a statement which  reads

as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Now the P.A.P. are challenging us to put their

contention  of a complete merger for the  people  to

decide  in  the  referendum.  Is  that  their   true

contention of merger?'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do they mean by this? Our true contention and

stand  on merger is to allow the people of Singapore

to  become citizens of the Federation. If we can put

this  into  practice, then we shall go on our  knees

and  thank God. From all this talk we know that  our

contention  is  correct and is in keeping  with  the

desire of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister said

earlier  on  this evening in this House  that  "they

could  only  talk  about complete and  unconditional

merger."  He said this in order to avoid the  matter

of  the  automatic conversion of citizenship.  As  a

matter  of  fact, the Barisan Sosialis has  in  many

policy statements mentioned automatic conversion  of

citizenship.  The  Prime  Minister  in  his   speech

pointed   out  to  the  people  of  Singapore   that

automatic   conversion  of  citizenship   would   be

acceptable  to  the  people of  Singapore.  Although

knowing this full well, he is not going to fight for

the interest of the people.



<br><br>11.30 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead he will avoid the matter of citizenship and

say  nothing about it. He only wants to foist on the

people  the  so-called  complete  and  unconditional

merger  as  a  choice. Mr Speaker, Sir,  the  Prime

Minister himself knows that the automatic conversion

of  citizenship is very important to the  people  of

Singapore. But why should he sell out the  interests

of  the people in Singapore? Mr Speaker. Sir,  from

these  view-points we know that the leaders  of  the

P.A.P. are  trying  to distort  the  stand  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis.  Here I  would  like  to  make  a

serious charge - that this behaviour of the P.A.P. is

shameless.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the White Paper on merger before

it   was  passed  in  this  House  gave  the  P.A.P.

leadership  confidence.  From  the  remarks  of  the

Minister  for  Finance a few moments ago,  it  seems

that  the  White Paper on merger is very  good,  and

from  the  speech of the Parliamentary Secretary  to

the  Minister  for Education, we are told  that  the

White  Paper  on  merger is not a  sell-out  of  the

interests of the Chinese in Singapore. He also  says

that  the White Paper on merger is the most suitable

type   of   merger   that  can  meet   the   present

requirements of the people in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from all this talk we know that

the  leadership  of the P.A.P. have full  confidence

and  complete faith in their White Paper on  merger.

So  the P.A.P. Government should at the present  day

hand the White Paper on merger for a decision by the

people  by way of a national referendum. But in  the

motion moved by the Prime Minister, we can see  that

the leaders of the P.A.P. do not have confidence  in

the  constitutional arrangements arrived at  between

the two Governments in Singapore and the Federation.

How  is  it  that they should have lost interest  in

their  White  Paper on merger? The facts  are  very

clear.  It  is because the people of Singapore  know

very  clearly that the White Paper on merger is  not

in  keeping  with their interests. So if the  P.A.P.

Government  should  pose only one  question  on  the

White  Paper on merger for a decision of the  people

in  the national referendum, then I believe most  of

the  people  in  Singapore will reject  it.  If  the

P.A.P. should suffer such a defeat, then spiritually

and morally speaking the Government have to resign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, because their White Paper on

merger  is not acceptable to the people and will  be

rejected  by them, that is why the P.A.P. Government

have  no  guts  to refer this matter  alone  to  the

people for a decision. So instead of referring  this

matter  alone,  they  will  bring  up  two  or  more

questions  for  the decision of  the  people.  As  a

matter  of  fact,  of the present alternatives,  the

first is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



intangible. As the Minister for Finance said at  the

third forum over Radio Singapore, and as reported on

the  1st  of  July, 1962, in the Sin Chew  Jit  Poh,

there are two building contractors - one is known  as

Complete  Merger Company and the other is  known  as

the  White  Paper on Merger Company. Now  the  White

Paper  on Merger Company has built a house and asks,

"Do  you  want to move into our house, the house  of

the  White Paper on Merger Company?" But Mr Citizen

has got to find out what the Complete Merger Company

has done. Has it built any house yet?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the motion of the Prime

Minister  there are two alternatives. The  first  is

the  White Paper on merger, i.e. the White Paper  on

Merger  Company  as suggested by  the  Minister  for

Finance. According to the Minister, this White Paper

on  Merger Company has completed the construction of

a  house and it wants the citizens to move into  it.

The second is the alternative of the Prime Minister,

i.e.,   in   accordance  with   the   constitutional

documents of the Federation of Malaya, there  should

be  complete and unconditional merger as a State  on

an equal basis with any of the other 11 States. That

is  taken  to  mean  the Complete and  Unconditional

Merger  Company  as suggested by  the  Minister  for

Finance   in   a  radio  forum.  The  Complete   and

Unconditional  Merger Company has  not  put  up  any

house  and  has not drawn up any plans  to  build  a

house.  That  is  the argument of the  Minister  for

Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Government wants to put these two

alternatives to the people: (1) with a house already

completed, and (2) No. [interruption] That  is  what

you said in the radio forum! Mr Speaker, the second

alternative of the Government is to ask Mr  Citizen

to  look  for  the  master of  the  Complete  Merger

Company.   So,  in  my  opinion,  this   alternative

regarding  complete and unconditional merger  should

not  be  posed  to  the people for  their  selection

because  up  to  the present day the  Government  in

Singapore   have   not  consulted   the   Federation

Government  on this matter, and there  has  been  no

agreement  reached  between  them  on  this   second

alternative. So how can they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>



ask  the people to make a choice? Now, supposing you

say  that  the people want to move into  this  house

supposed to be built by the Complete Merger Company.

Where is the house?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the question before us should be as the Minister for Finance has said, that is the house

built by the White Paper on Merger Company, and  The

people  should be asked whether they  want  to  move

into  this  particular house. That is  to  say,  the

White  Paper on Merger should be given to the people

for a decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, finally I rise to appeal to the

leaders of the Government that they should keep  the

promises they have made. The Government should refer

the  White  Paper  on merger to  the  people  for  a

decision  in order to convince them that the  P.A.P.

Government is a responsible Government. So I see  no

reason  whatsoever why the P.A.P. Government  should

forget  about  the promises they have  made  to  the

people.  I hope that the Government could carry  out

their promise and pose the White Paper on merger  to

the   people   for  a  decision  in   the   national

referendum.  They  should not run  away  from  their

promise. Otherwise they are irresponsible.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in  the debate on the motion which  has  since

been  amended by the leader of the Barisan Sosialis,

the Member for Queenstown. I at times felt surprised

whether  this hon. Member was day-dreaming,  because

some  of  the arguments put forward in his amendment

were  that when the elections were held in Singapore

in 1959 it never occurred to the people of Singapore

that  they  ever wished to merge with the Federation

of  Malaya.  His ground was that if  the  people  of

Singapore wanted to merge they would then have voted

for  the S.P.A., because the S.P.A. then had  merger

on  its  platform;  and yet it suffered  a  crushing

defeat. The Member for Queenstown also said that the

people of Singapore had no wish whatsoever to  merge

with  the  Federation of Malaya.  This  is  directly

contrary to the arguments which we often



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>



heard  from  the Leader of the Barisan Sosialis.  It

appeared  that the people of Singapore had  no  wish

for  a merger. That is why I thought the Member  for

Queenstown had been day-dreaming, for surely  it  is

not  possible that the Member has forgotten that one

of  the items in the manifesto of the P.A.P. is  as

follows:  to strive to achieve independence  through

merger with the Federation of Malaya! This is one of

the  platforms  of  the P.A.P. which  won  them  the

election. One of the foremost planks in our platform

was  to achieve independence through merger with the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, we can see earlier today

the  Member for Queenstown, as leader of the Barisan

Sosialis, denying this. What does this all mean, if,

in  this  matter, he is quite prepared to  deny  the

facts?  There is no doubt then that the  people  who

really  dilly-dally over this matter of  merger  are

the  people in the Barisan Sosialis. They first said

that they preferred merger on terms similar to those

of  Penang and Malacca. Then they said that they had

made  a  mistake  over  this,  and  afterwards  they

further said that their stand was that merger should

be  on  an equal basis like any one of the 11 States

of  the Federation. This is no child's play. If  you

are tired, you rest a while. But politics is not  as

easy as that, particularly serious politics. If  you

are a trishaw rider or a motor-car driver, or if you

are  a  father or a teacher, and you make a  mistake

which  endangers  you or your family,  it  does  not

matter  very  much. But if you  as  a  leader  of  a

political  Party  make  a grave  mistake,  then  the

people   at   large   would   consequently   suffer.

Therefore, in our political efforts for the good  of

the  people, we should not act like children playing

a game of marbles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter before us is a national matter. By

dilly-dallying  and making mistakes  every  now  and

then,  how can we expect to guarantee the safety  of

the  people  entrusted to us? I feel,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  the leader of the Barisan Sosialis should  not

be  like  the  mother  crab, in  the  Malay  saying,

teaching  its little one to walk: She says,  "Little

one.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>



you  should walk forward," when in fact she  herself

walks  sideways. The Barisan Sosialis want immediate

automatic  conversion  of  Singapore  citizens  into

Federal  citizens on merger. The question was  asked

whether we would have equal status and the right  of

government  and so on. Various other questions  were

posed  by them, most of which have escaped me.  They

want  this and they want that. But let us pause  and

ask  ourselves: are we prepared to accept all  this?

At  least, one of the conditions for enabling anyone

to  stand as a candidate in future elections is  the

question of language, for Malay will subsequently be

regarded  and accepted as the sole language  in  the

Federation.  There  is  the  education   policy   as

embodied in the Rahman Talib Report -are we prepared

to  accept  all  that? These are  the  things  which

should be clear in our minds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several other problems which have to be

squarely  faced. Therefore, let us  not  ask,  "What

will we get as a result of merger? Will we get this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



or  that?", when we ourselves have not answered what

we  ourselves  are prepared to give in return.  Ever

since  the  debate on the question  of  merger  took

place, and ever since the White Paper proposals were

discussed to date, I have never heard even once  any

Member of the Barisan Sosialis answering these  very

pertinent  questions. They merely  raised  questions

which are aimed at gaining them votes, such as: will

we  get  automatic citizenship rights? Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  in  debating this matter, we on the Government

side are firm in our stand. Ever since we posed  the

question  of  the  White Paper  proposals,  we  were

prepared to face the people and explain to them  the

real  contents of the White Paper proposals  and  to

clarify the points raised therein.
