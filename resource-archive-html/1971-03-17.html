[8th  March, 1971], "That Parliament approves  the

financial  policy  of  the  Government   for   the

financial  year  1st April, 1971  to  31st  March,

1972.". [Minister for Finance].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, first of all, I wish to  thank  the

new  Minister  for Finance because  in  his  first

budget  presented  to  this  House,  there  is  no

increase  in the rates of taxation nor  are  there

any  new  taxes to be imposed. However, this  does

not   mean  that  I  fully  endorse  the  measures

implemented in the last financial year  and  those

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



be  implemented in the new financial year. On  the

contrary, I would like to take this opportunity to

express my views on certain matters which are  not

altogether  on  all  fours  with  those   of   the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as a small nation, Singapore is subject to the influence of many extraneous factors which are beyond our control. These factors often affect the decisions that we have to make. The political and economic developments in our neighbouring countries will always have a

certain  bearing  and  reaction  in  our  country.

Therefore, whatever we decide and do, we must  not

overlook  all  these  extraneous  factors.  To  do

otherwise would be most unwise on our part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has resorted to a mass of statistics to show how satisfactory our economic growth has been over recent years. I am not an economist, nor am I prepared to degrade myself into becoming a theorist and, in an air-conditioned room, talk

about  the  poverty outside. My view is  that  all

this talk of economic growth and progress will  be

entirely  meaningless if they do  not  bring  real

benefits and a better life for the general  public

and  ensure  a  more  equitable  distribution   of

wealth. If our progress and economic growth  bring

benefits only to a small group of people and  make

the  few  who are rich richer, that will  generate

social discontent and lead to a latent crisis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance says that in recent years

the prices of commodities in our country have been

quite   stable  and  that  there   has   been   no

appreciable increase in the cost of living. Sir, I

cannot  agree  with him on this. As  a  matter  of

fact, at the very moment when this budget is being

presented  to  this  House,  there  are  moves  to

standardise or adjust commodity prices for various

reasons. These so-called price standardisation and

adjustments are nothing more than pronounced price

increases.  Unless  we adopt the  attitude  of  an

ostrich,  I  say  that  the  so-called  stabilised

prices are not borne out by facts. I hope



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>



the  Government will look into this matter and not

avoid  it  and  shirk its responsibility,  because

this  matter concerns the livelihood of the people

in the street. They cannot remain indifferent. The

present trend in price increases should be checked

and  proper attention should be given to it by the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the budget for this year is more or less similar to that of last year and the following points have been stressed. First, the creation of a favourable climate to attract foreign investments. Secondly, the establishment of a sound infrastructure for an industrialised

state.   Thirdly,  the  training  of  much  needed

personnel, particularly middle level technical and

managerial  personnel  for our  industrialisation.

Fourthly,  the  promotion of tourism  as  well  as

urban renewal and other development plans. On  the

face  of it, there is nothing wrong with all these

measures.   For   example,  the  creation   of   a

favourable investment climate is conducive to  our

economic   development  and  security.  The   more

international consortiums we can attract into  our

country, the greater will be our ability to create

employment    opportunities,    develop     higher

technology and promote economic growth. We will be

able to develop our potential to attract even more

investors  so as to make Singapore the  investors'

paradise.  They  come  here  not  for  sentimental

reasons. Furthermore, in their own interest,  they

will  ensure  that  we are safe  and  continue  to

maintain this stability so as to ensure that their

investments  are safe and have good  prospects.  I

would,  however,  remind  the  Government  not  to

overlook the support and assistance to be given to

local  capital. I feel there is a  great  deal  of

capital  which can be tapped locally. Many locally

financed  industries  have,  in  fact,  been  very

successful in recent years. I would like  to  give

one  example. The Far East Shipbuilding Industries

in Jurong is a business enterprise financed solely

by  local capital, which has recently entered into

an   agreement  with  an  American   company   for

technical co-operation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



This  shipyard has been  able  to  win

multi-million  dollar contracts  for  shipbuilding

projects.  The Government has the duty  to  assist

this kind of local entrepreneurs with ability  and

foresight  in  the industrial field,  because  the

moment  other countries are able to offer  foreign

investors  better terms, they will not  remain  in

Singapore for sentimental reasons. They do not owe

us  a living. Therefore, in the circumstances,  it

will  be  short-sighted to ignore the exploitation

and development of the potential of local capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the assistance which must be given to

local   capital  and  the  attraction  of  foreign

capital  into Singapore are complementary to  each

other. There is nothing inconsistent about that. I

would  like  to  give yet another example.  Jurong

Shipyard Limited, a joint venture between Japanese

and  local capital, and its sister company, Jurong

Shipbuilders  Limited - now under  construction  -

are  dependent  upon  extensive  local  supporting

industries   to   be  successful.   Recently   new

enterprises  have  been  formed  to  provide   con

sultative and construction services to the setting

up  of  new  industries, which also need extensive

supporting industries. So we should utilise  every

opportunity  to utilise local capital  to  develop

such supporting industries. In this way we will be

able  to  increase  employment  opportunities  and

upgrade  our  technological skill level.  I  would

like  to  express  the hope that the  Government's

planning   and   efforts  to   train   industrial,

technical,  managerial and  other  personnel  will

meet  with the success that they deserve in  order

to fulfil the needs of our industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has also made reference to tourism. It is a sad thing to see that the Tourist Promotion Board, which has been charged with the duty of promoting tourism, has seen fit to send overseas as a publicity move some temple mediums who actually represent a backward and

superstitious era. Recently the Tourist  Promotion

Board has even thought of erecting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



some  kind  of  wax  museum  to  commemorate   the

historical  events  of  the  shameful  deeds   and

atrocities   of   the  Japanese   militarists   in

Singapore.  If  members of the  Tourist  Promotion

Board are not capable of better ideas than this or

of  bringing  about  a better publicity  campaign,

they  will  have to face the condemnation  of  the

people  and  do a lot of explanation. I  hope  the

Government will unreservedly turn down  all  these

kinds of publicity stunts and proposals which  are

an  insult  to  the  dignity of  our  people.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, I do not deny that the promotion  of

tourism is important to our economic growth. But I

think we have many other better ways of doing  it,

such  as the establishment of bird parks and large

zoos,  and  the  publicising of our multi-cultural

and   multi-religious  features,  and  many  other

aspects of local life which will help make tourism

a success. We have indeed a lot to learn from more

advanced countries like Japan and Taiwan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to turn now to the Minister's

remarks on urban renewal. My constituency  is  the

first  to  be affected by urban renewal.  In  this

respect,  the people in my constituency have  made

considerable sacrifices for national construction.

But  does  the Palembang Housing Estate  -  a  new

housing  estate  in  my constituency  -  meet  the

objectives behind the urban renewal scheme?  If  a

survey  is made amongst the flat dwellers and  the

traders  there,  they will say that  this  housing

estate is far from satisfactory. They complain  of

inconvenience in traffic and poor designs  of  the

flats,  as  a  result of which  tourists  are  not

attracted there. Because of this, business is very

poor   in   this  area.  Mind  you,   Sir,   these

businessmen have to pay many times the  rent  that

they  used to pay before urban renewal. The people

living  there  find  it rather  inconvenient  and,

particularly  in times of emergency,  even  police

vehicles and ambulances find it difficult to go in

and out of the estate. Is this not contrary to the

expectations that we envisage in the renewal plan?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to draw a lesson from this

experience, i.e., a scheme or a policy may be very

good  in  principle,  but  when  it  is  executed,

because  the  so-called experts in charge  of  the

scheme  are  unaware of the local  conditions  and

have  not  taken local factors into  account,  the

actual result is far from ideal or as expected. It

is  not too late for us to take remedial action in

respect  of future schemes and in their execution.

We  must  construct buildings which are in keeping

with the requirements of the local people. In this

respect, Sir, I am sure the Citizens' Consultative

Committee  in each constituency will  be  able  to

contribute their views to assist the experts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect about urban renewal is the sale of

land  and the identity of the investors.  On  this

point, my former Parliamentary colleague, Mr  Lee

Teck  Him,  made some worthwhile contributions  in

last year's debate. According to present plans, we

sell  plots of land by open tenders and we provide

the best opportunities and facilities for the rich

developers  to  develop the land.  But  the  small

businessmen  affected  by clearance  exercises  in

urban  renewal  do  not  get  any  concessions  or

preference.  I feel this is most unwise.  Many  of

the small and medium businessmen affected by urban

renewal  in  fact are in a position to pool  their

resources   and   participate  in  urban   renewal

projects. I know of such a plan and of people  not

only  in my own constituency but also in two other

constituencies  with such plans.  No  doubt,  when

they  pool  their  resources,  they  are  able  to

provide  a  sizable  amount of local  capital  for

development  purposes.  We  should  support   such

schemes to invest local capital in the development

of our country and should also be of help to them.

If  we do so, we will not be accused of neglecting

them  and favouring the richer developers many  of

whom are foreign capitalists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a certain trade organisation has expressed

its   willingness  to  participate   in   such   a

development scheme. But a year or more has elapsed

and  there  has been no answer from the Government

to the proposal. If I compare the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



treatment given to local people and that given  to

an  American  electronics company which  has  been

given  all the facilities required in the  setting

up  of the industry within six weeks, I feel  hurt

and ashamed of the "efficiency" of the Government.

There are two possible explanations for this.  One

explanation is that we are totally uninterested in

the  investment of local capital and will not give

it  any  encouragement. The other  explanation  is

that  we  are  over-interested in foreign  capital

which  is interested in us because we can  provide

it  with cheap labour. We are afraid that if we do

not  welcome  foreign investors  enthusiastically,

they will hesitate to come here. I do not think it

is  the  intended  policy of our  intelligent  and

honourable   Minister   for   Law   and   National

Development. But I do not appreciate the doings of

some experts in his Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, talking about experts brings me to another

thought  about  the trend in our midst  in  recent

years. Many people have faith in these experts  as

though they can provide them with all the panaceas

in  the world. I would remind those concerned that

only  those  who  are really aware  of  the  basic

requirements  of  life of our people  are  fit  to

propose  plans  for  reform.  Those  scholars  and

experts who sit in air-conditioned rooms and  talk

about the hot weather and the plight of the hungry

people  outside  must leave their  air-conditioned

rooms   if  they  wish  to  understand  our  local

conditions  and  get the views of  the  people  at

grass-root   level  before  they  can   make   any

proposals or plans worthy of consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I started speaking I mentioned the

great  effect of extraneous factors on us. I would

like  to  come back to this subject. The  Minister

for  Finance has also concurred on this point.  He

has    particularly   emphasised   the   potential

influence of Japan as an industrial power  on  the

economic development of this region. He shows very

good understanding in this connection. But no word

has  been  mentioned about another great power  in

Asia  - I refer to the People's Republic of China.

Of course, the People's Republic of China, with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



her  great land and human resources, will have  to

discharge  her political and military  obligations

as  a super power in the international arena. Sir,

I  have in this House requested the Government  to

reappraise and readjust the relations that we have

with   China,  and  I  would  like  to  urge   the

Government again to initiate positive and  correct

steps  towards this end. There is no denying  that

China's  joining  the United  Nations  depends  on

whether she will get any benefit from such a move.

Nobody can stop China from expanding her influence

in South-east Asia. If our policy runs contrary to

this  inevitable  trend, then it  will  be  of  no

benefit to us. China may become a great market for

the  primary produce of this region. This will  be

of benefit to Singapore. Many people may feel that

it  would be unwise for us to be too friendly with

China because the majority of the population  here

are  of  Chinese origin. I do not agree with  this

view.  I was born and brought up in Singapore.  If

Singapore fails, I have no other place to turn to.

So nobody can accuse me of speaking for Peking.  I

may  not  endorse  the  policies  that  are  being

implemented in that country. At the same  time,  I

do  not  believe  that  China  will  come  to  the

assistance  of  Singapore  simply  because  it  is

largely  populated with people of  Chinese  origin

when  we  get into difficulties, unless China  can

benefit  from such assistance given. My  point  is

that after years of hard struggle, China will  now

assert  her rights in the international arena  and

discharge  her  obligations as a great  power  and

look  after  her own interests and strengthen  her

influence in this region. We cannot overlook  this

important  foreign  factor.  We  must   take   the

initiative  and make preparations for  any  future

possible development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another extraneous political factor which deserves our attention is the co-operation we must have with our neighbouring countries. At the present stage, we hope to promote co-operation with our neighbours through regional mutual benefit schemes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>



But have the principles and objectives of this co-operation   been   defined?  Are   they   mutually

acceptable  to both? We must not forget  that  any

political  development in  the  peninsula  to  the

north  of  us  will  definitely affect  our  small

island   state.  Have  we  honestly   sought   for

opportunities for co-operation with our  neighbour

on  a  mutually acceptable basis and tried to sink

our differences while maintaining concord and come

to  some  kind of co-operative arrangements  which

are mutually beneficial for our two peoples?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we also cannot overlook the development of

racial  politics  in  the  neighbouring  countries

which will have a certain reaction from us. As  we

believe  in multi-racialism, our reaction to  such

development must be rational and be based  on  our

accepted principles of multi-racialism. I hope our

people,  particularly the press, will avoid  being

dragged  into expressing some kind of chauvinistic

feelings. Certain of our local newspapers  have  a

tendency to whip up chauvinistic feelings, perhaps

unwittingly or for business reasons. I do not want

to  over-stress this point. It will be  dangerous.

Sir,   I   am   not  very  optimistic  about   the

development  of our relationship with neighbouring

countries.  In  fact, I can  see  that  some  dark

clouds   are  already  looming  over  the  distant

horizon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our Government is a socialist government. The interests of the workers must be protected. I welcome the Government's intention to strengthen the Factory Inspectorate in order to promote the safety of the workers. In fact, this should have been done long ago. The Chief

Inspector of Factories has been able to work under

the most unfavourable and strenuous conditions  in

the  past  and we should give him the commendation

that is due.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about industrial safety brings me to

another  matter. When we relate the story  of  our

industrialisation success, we must not  forget  to

pay  a  tribute  to the workers  at  the  workshop

level, because without their sacrifices and  their

efforts, we will not have attained



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>



our  present position. I  have  some  rough

statistics to prove that those who are standing in

the  forefront  of industrialisation  come  mainly

from  those  educated in their own mother  tongue.

This  is  a  great tribute that  we  must  pay  to

education  in the mother tongue. Through education

in  the mother tongue, we have been able to  bring

up  a  generation  of patriotic  and  hard-working

industrial  workers  who are responsible  for  the

happiness  and  well-being of our  country.  Their

contribution  to our country is too  great  to  be

denied. If anybody tries to deny this, it will  be

a great insult to our republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is a young country. Our youths are a source of great strength. We must spare no effort to tap this source. However, history shows that any society of people who only care to enjoy life and nothing else will, in the end, become a soulless one and collapse. More than

a decade ago the People's Action Party was able to

provide our youth with the right objective in life

-  to  contribute  towards  nation  building.  The

situation  today is quite different from  that  in

the  past. Our Government must not forget to guide

our youths along the proper path to understand and

cultivate  the  right attitude  in  life,  and  to

inculcate in them the correct ideals about  a  new

life  and not ask them to be docile fancy fish.  I

feel  it  is  most regrettable that the Government

has  mentioned nothing about this aspect. It  must

give  active  consideration  to  the  problems  of

youths in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people in this region may be classified into two groups -- the forward-looking modernisers and the backward traditionalists. I believe that we today belong to the first category, and we want to be treated as such. We have to be prepared, within the shortest possible time, for the worst situation that may

occur.  Our  economic policy must be geared  along

these lines. Our success depends on our ability to

bring about a more just and more fair society  for

the  majority  of  our people,  and  not  work  on

statistics alone. Given



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



proper   supervision  and  time  to  our   present

Government and with the established spirit of  PAP

leadership   courageously  wiping  out   all   the

opportunists in Singapore at all levels, there  is

no reason why we cannot succeed.



<br><br>3.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  when  the  Minister  for   Finance

announced  in the House on the 8th of  this  month

that Singapore was not going to have any new taxes

or increase in taxes in the coming financial year,

all the people in Singapore received the news with

great  joy. Indeed, he brought tremendous news  to

the  people  of Singapore. This has  stimulated  a

spirit of self-reliance and perseverance among the

people  of  Singapore and has encouraged  them  to

work even harder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the countries which have become independent

after the Second World War, very few of them  have

been fortunate enough to be able to afford such  a

painless budget as ours. If we examine the reasons

for our success, we will find that in the last  10

years  or  so,  our  Government  has  put   up   a

creditable performance. It has established a clean

and efficient government and has helped the people

of  Singapore in overcoming their difficulties, in

creating  a  new  environment, and in  encouraging

them  to strive for a better future. On the  other

hand,  the  people of Singapore have  worked  very

hard  and  have  shown a spirit of  endeavour  and

perseverance. This surely must go down in  history

as a great performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore has progressed from strength to strength for many years now. We have received news of one success after another. If we look at the newly emergent countries, we will find that many of them, especially in the Sixties, faced chaos and experienced great disappointment

after  their  independence.  Only  the  people  of

Singapore can "thumbs up" and say that in the last

10  years they have surmounted their difficulties.

They are approaching an even brighter and glorious

future. In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>



the  last few years, they have had the benefit  of

painless budgets which have brought honour to  our

country.  Despite  this, many people  have  voiced

their  discontent. What is the  reason  for  this?

There  must  be  a reason. As the  Chinese  saying

goes,  "There  can be no wave without  the  wind."

People  in the lower income group, especially  the

wage-earners,  have  to draw  up  their  household

budget  too.  Of  course,  their  budget  is   not

comparable  to the momentous one for  the  country

drawn  up by the Minister for Finance. The people,

on  the  whole, are not concerned with development

projects as such. They are not concerned  so  much

with  the  increase  of taxes  or  new  tax  rates

because  their household budget is  based  on  the

rise  or fall of the general price level. A  small

number  of  unscrupulous merchants  have  recently

raised  the  prices  of many  goods  without  good

reasons.  This has caused great hardships  to  the

people.  This  is even worse than an  increase  in

taxes.  It is a most distressing thing to witness.

What is worse is that these unscrupulous merchants

have put the blame squarely on the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a fact that prices have increased tremendously in the last few years. The increase in the price level has been a general one, including prices for all the daily necessities: for example, tinned food, fish,

vegetables, bread and so on. Even bus  fares  have

gone up! There is indeed a general increase in the

price  level. Unscrupulous merchants  have  raised

prices  under the guise of price adjustments,  but

price  adjustments  are equivalent  to  price  in-increases.   We   have  never   yet   seen   price

adjustments  leading  to a  downward  revision  of

prices.  It  is  only now that I understand  price

adjustments to be synonymous with price increases.

It  is a new term for price increases. Nowadays we

often  hear  that  this  or  that  price  must  be

adjusted, but we have not heard that the employers

are  going  to adjust the wages of their  workers.

Let   us  take,  for  example,  the  salaries   of

teachers. The previous Minister for Education



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>



promised  the  teachers  salary  adjustments,  but

nothing has happened although the relevant  bodies

submitted their recommendations six months ago. As

the  Chinese  saying goes, "We can only  hear  the

footsteps on the staircase, but we never  see  the

people coming down." If we do not adjust the wages

of  the  working class in the face of the  general

increase in the price level, this will lead  to  a

fall in their income. It is for this reason that I

would   like  to  represent  the  people   in   my

constituency  and thank the Minister  for  Finance

who  has  brought us this good news of a  painless

budget. I would also like to express the hope that

a permanent price control committee will be set up

to  prevent  unscrupulous merchants  from  raising

prices without valid reasons.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

no  piece of information was more welcome  to  the

people  of Singapore than the declaration  by  the

Minister  for  Finance in this House  on  the  8th

March   that  no  new  taxation  measures,  either

directly or indirectly, would be introduced in the

ensuing  financial year. The fact that the current

needs    for   both   ordinary   and   development

expenditures can be met from the natural  increase

in  the  existing tax yields as a  result  of  the

rapid economic growth is eloquent testimony to the

soundness  and foresight of the economic  planning

and   expansion  programmes  laid  down   by   his

predecessor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the local newspapers have popularly

termed  the budget a painless one. That  it  would

bring about "no harm" or "unhappiness" to the  man

in  the street is an undeniable fact. Nonetheless,

affluent employers have more cause to celebrate by

reason of the tremendously "good cheer" the budget

gave to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the fact that no new taxes will be

imposed  on the excessively huge profits that  the

employers make, they are now to receive a new  tax

relief in that Government will use the proceeds of

the existing payroll tax to defray their liability

in respect of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>



"make-up"  pay  of their employees doing  national

service,  and  to  reimburse  their  expenses   in

operating    approved    training    schemes    or

apprenticeship  schemes for their employees.  Such

tax relief, according to the Finance Minister,  is

to  lighten the so-called burden of the  employers

in these two areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions that immediately strike my mind are

(1) What is this so-called burden of the employers

for  which the Minister has such great solicitude?

(2)  Should the Government lighten this  so-called

burden of the employers with public funds that may

be  better  utilised for some  other  more  worthy

purposes?  I  cannot emphasise too  strongly  that

every  tax relief is tantamount to a payment  from

the  public funds, since the principal  source  of

public funds is taxation in one form or other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister has proposed that employers

are  entitled to use public funds to pay  part  of

their  workers'  wages for which they  are  liable

under  the  National Service Act. It appears  that

workers  are  expected, as a matter  of  fact,  to

sacrifice  two  or three years of their  youth  in

national service. But when it comes to the turn of

employers  to make a bit of sacrifice, it  appears

that  they are a different breed entirely, and  so

are  not  governed  by the same considerations  of

national   interest   as  their   less   fortunate

employees. It is of immaterial consequence to such

employers  that  the  whole and  sole  purpose  of

national  service is not for the martial glory  of

Singapore but for its defence and protection as  a

sovereign  political entity and the protection  of

the lives and property of the people of Singapore.

I  would have thought that employers stood to lose

most  if Singapore had no credible defence  system

to  deter any would-be aggressor. But the mind  of

employers,  obviously, functions  in  a  different

manner.  They  can  perceive no  contradiction  in

supporting  national service when  only  employees

are  affected, and in agitating against the burden

of  make-up  pay for their workers doing  national

service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should think that no one in this House, least

of  all  the representatives of employers, expects

employers  to  take  the lead  in  expressing  and

proving   their  patriotism.  But  their  churlish

reaction to the slight obligation they must incur,

by way of contributions towards the defence of the

country, comes as a definite surprise. The workers

are   making   great   personal   sacrifices    by

shouldering the burden of national service.  Apart

from  the sentiments of patriotism that cause them

to  respond with enthusiasm to the call of service

to  their country, they have no property or wealth

of  their  own  to defend. On the other  hand,  if

something  should  happen to Singapore,  employers

have  a  lot  to  lose apart from  their  valuable

lives. They apparently want to have their cake and

eat  it  too.  The petty attitude of employers  is

most  ridiculous, considering that their so-called

burden  under  the  National Service  Act  is  too

insignificant to talk about. The amount  of  money

that an employer has to give by way of the make-up

pay  is  probably  negligible in relation  to  his

total  profits or assets. Employers have no reason

to  grudge  the  payment of insurance  premium  in

respect  of their property. In fact, they consider

it  good and sound business practice to have  such

insurance   cover.  It  is,  therefore,  extremely

unreasonable  for  them  to  grudge  the  cost  of

national service which is, after all, the best and

most comprehensive form of insurance that they can

obtain  for  their property, their livelihood,  or

profit-making enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the question of training schemes

for  the improvement of skills of workers and  the

offsetting  of  their  training  expenses  against

their payroll tax. I find it difficult to believe,

by any stretch of imagination, that anyone has the

gall  to  claim  that any scheme  to  improve  the

skills  of workers is more a burden than a benefit

to  their  employers.  All  training  schemes  are

designed  for one primary objective -  to  improve

the  skills and efficiency of workers so that they

may  be able to contribute more effectively to the

profit-making



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



capacity  of their employers. Employers to  enable

their  workers to acquire greater skills for their

own   good  do  not  establish  training  schemes.

Granted  that it is true the Minister for  Finance

might  have been induced to allow such tax  relief

by  reason  of  the undertaking of a  few  foreign

investors  to  train  more workers  than  required

under  their own training schemes, but it will  be

most  unfair  for  such  employers,  who  are  co-operating  with the Government, to bear the  brunt

of  training more workers than is necessary.  This

inducement  to industrialists to train workers  is

not desirable as long as there is this problem  of

a  vicious  cycle  of  a  consequent  shortage  of

skilled  workers  resulting from the  practice  of

poaching of such workers. The solution proposed by

the Minister is not necessarily the most equitable

one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution of allowing employers tax relief

against  their  payroll  tax  liability  for   the

purpose   of  increasing  the  supply  of  skilled

workers  is  a negative approach since it  entails

the  use of public funds. It must not be forgotten

that  while  Singapore stands to  benefit  from  a

greater  supply of skilled workers, the  employers

themselves benefit directly from it. In fact, they

have  the  first  call upon the  services  of  the

skilled  workers  in  such  increased  supply.   A

positive  approach would be to apportion the  cost

of  training extra workers among all employers  or

those  employers  without  any  approved  training

schemes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers have done more than their share in

Singapore's  industrialisation  programme.  Seldom

does  a  day pass by without a report of a  worker

being   involved   in   an  industrial   accident,

sometimes   fatal.  Whether   he   dies,   or   is

permanently or temporarily incapacitated,  he  and

his   dependants   can   only   expect   miserable

compensation   under   the   Outdated    Workmen's

Compensation Ordinance. Even then, some  employers

try to wriggle out of their liability under it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have thought that if the Government is

embarrassed by the sum of money in the coffers  of

the  Treasury  accumulated from the  payroll  tax,

some arrangement could be made to dispose of it in

a  constructive  manner, such  as  to  help  those

persons who require assistance most, and not  give

employers  the  opportunity  to  use  the  savings

provided   by  the  tax  relief  to  employ   more

accountants  to think of more ways to  evade  tax.

What  I  have  in mind is the channelling  of  the

proceeds of the payroll tax into a special fund to

supplement  or  enhance  the  payments  under  the

Workmen's  Compensation  Ordinance.  The   crucial

question is, who needs tax relief most? Is it  the

employers, who are only concerned with  the  extra

sayings  from  tax,  or  the  employees,  who  are

concerned  with  their  livelihood  and,  perhaps,

their very own lives?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While incentives have to be offered to foreign

investors  to help our industrialisation programme

succeed,  it does not mean that we have to  pamper

them,  as  they  stand to benefit  more  from  the

industrialisation    programme.    Pampering    of

employers is more likely to create dissatisfaction

than  promote contentment among their own workers.

It is meaningless for workers to regard themselves

as contributors to Singapore's future progress and

prosperity when their employers make it a point to

taunt  them  to  their  faces  with  the  laws  of

Singapore  which, they say, preclude  the  workers

from  having  a  fair share of the fruits  of  the

prosperity to which they have greatly contributed.

The  problem  today  is not  only  one  of  simply

educating   our  workers  and  trade   unions   to

understand the realities of our economic life,  as

suggested  by the Finance Minister, but  also  the

much  more difficult one of educating some of  our

unenlightened employers to realise  the  folly  of

their persistent refusal to see beyond their  nose

that  their  true interest also lies in  the  fair

treatment of their workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point is the current industrial dispute

between  the Singapore Bank Employees'  Union  and

the   various  banking  corporations.   With   the

exception of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>



the Asia Commercial Bank and the Far Eastern Bank,

all  the other banks, both foreign and local,  are

exploiting the provisions of the Employment Act by

blackmailing  the Singapore Bank Employees'  Union

into  signing  away their right to  share  in  the

mounting profits for the next five years. Everyone

knows that there has been an enormous increase  in

the  turnover,  volume  and profitability  of  the

banking  business over the last  few  years.  This

increase  has resulted partly from the efforts  of

the  Government  to develop Singapore  and  partly

from  the co-operation of the workers. It  is  not

solely   due   to  the  genius  of   the   banking

management.  The Union is merely asking  that  the

additional month's bonus offered to bank employees

be  reviewed  annually by the banks in  accordance

with the continuing profitability or otherwise  of

banking  operations  in Singapore.  The  concerted

response of the banks, both foreign and local,  is

the offer of a once-and-for-all payment equivalent

to an additional month's salary, on condition that

the union signs a "no-change" collective agreement

for  the  next  five years. This is tantamount  to

blackmailing  the  Union  into  signing  away  the

rights of the bank employees in Singapore to  have

a share in the profits over the next five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you may be aware that the trade unions were assured in 1968 that the increase in the maximum duration of collective agreements from three to five years was intended to ensure wage stability in the pioneer industries. We had assumed, therefore, that old established

institutions  like  the banks would  not  seek  to

abuse  the Employment Act by taking full advantage

of  the provision intended for pioneer industries.

Local employers generally have up to now been much

more  ready  than  foreign employers  to  come  to

profit-sharing arrangements with their  employees.

In the recent past, the foreign banks have managed

to  infect several local banks also with the  same

virus of industrial blackmail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Lever" virus, also known as the `Gould"

virus, or the "Rattray" virus,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>



which manifests itself in an obstinate refusal  to

allow  bank employees even a minimal share in  the

exceptional profits the banks have been making  in

the  last  few  years  from  Singapore's  economic

growth and development, has also spread to several

local banks. The result is that a united front has

been  established  between the presidents  of  the

Chinese  Chamber of Commerce and the International

Chamber of Commerce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For employers such as those Shylock bankers who

construe the Employment Act as entitling  them  to

their   pound  of  their  employees'  flesh,   the

Government should not hesitate to exact from  them

a   similar  and  appropriate  penalty  for  their

avarice.  Perhaps  the  time  has  come  for   the

Government   to  consider  making  the   following

amendments to the present labour legislation:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Reducing the maximum duration of collective

agreements from five years to three years in  non-pioneer industries and enterprises;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Raising the maximum limit for the

negotiability of bonus payments from  one  month's

salary  to  a more realistic sum, particularly  in

the case of undertakings which, such as the banks,

have made exceptional profits; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Raising the employers' contributions under

the  Central  Provident Fund  Ordinance  from  the

present  10  per cent to 15 per cent and  reducing

the workers' contributions from the present 10 per

cent  to  5 per cent, thus increasing the  present

take-home  pay of the workers by 5 per cent.  This

may  be termed a "built-in" wage increase of 5 per

cent all round.



<br><br>3.32 p.m



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Minister for Finance has given us welcome

news  in  his well-presented budget. Economically,

we  have done better than we expected and  we  can

approach  the coming year with cautious  optimism.

Curiously, however, our performance over the  last

three  years of some 15 per cent of growth a  year

in the Gross Domestic Product, one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



of the highest growth rates in the world, has been

described  by many commentators as a mini-boom.  I

wonder  what a regular or a maxi-boom  would  look

like.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me comment first on the Minister's proposal

to  formulate an optimum investment policy. He has

rightly  emphasized  two  elements;  firstly,  the

attention   to   selectivity  in   promoting   new

industries,  where  priority is  to  be  given  to

industries  with  higher  technology,  established

world  markets, and the ability to utilize  higher

grades  of skilled labour. Secondly, the  Minister

raised  the important question of training skilled

labour. Contrary to the view of my colleague,  the

Member for Moulmein, I think that the proposed use

of  the  payroll  tax  is an excellent  idea.  The

payroll  tax  itself is an anomaly in a  situation

where we are trying to create employment, so  that

the  optimum policy is a subsidy rather than a tax

on  the use of labour. The use of the tax proceeds

to   finance  the  training  of  skilled   labour,

therefore,  makes economic sense. In  addition  to

the   specific   proposals  for  training   labour

outlined by the Minister, consideration should  be

given  to  proper vocational guidance in  schools,

and  at  the  Ministry  of  Defence  for  national

servicemen  who are about to be discharged.  I  am

told that one of the most keenly sought jobs,  for

example,  is  that of hotel toilet-attendants  who

can  expect  good  tips by  turning  on  taps  and

handing  out  towels.  Now I  cannot  imagine  how

productivity can increase in such occupations!  We

have  got to get our young people used to the idea

of forgoing some earnings during a training period

of two to three years, but with the expectation of

a  higher earnings profile later. The only way  to

induce such a sense of the long-term is to provide

vocational guidance, where lectures are  given  on

different career prospects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the two elements of industrial

selection  and  labour training mentioned  by  the

Minister, I would advocate attention to six  other

factors in framing an optimum investment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



policy:  First  of all is the nurturing  of  local

entrepreneurship. As I have indicated  on  another

occasion, our emphasis on export orientation poses

a  number  of challenges to our entrepreneurs.  In

the first place, an enterprise has to be efficient

in  order  to  compete successfully  with  foreign

goods in terms of price and quality. Secondly,  to

export  success-fully, entrepreneurs must  acquire

the  marketing  techniques of  advertising,  trade

missions and exhibitions abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign investors come in with a ready

technology,  managerial  capability,   and   well-established  marketing channels abroad.  Moreover,

the  kinds  of  foreign investment  we  have  been

getting  lately  are  large.  Indeed,  the  recent

amendment  to the Economic Expansion  Act  favours

the  bigger-sized establishments,  quite  rightly,

from  our economy's standpoint. However, we should

recognise that the local entrepreneur is put at  a

relative  disadvantage. He has limited  access  to

technology,   his   concept  of  organisation   is

relatively  primitive, his capital  resources  are

rather   slender,  and  he  does  not   have   the

established  marketing channels abroad.  A  purely

nationalistic reaction would be to close the doors

to   foreign  investment  and  adopt  an   import-substitution  policy. This would,  however,  be  a

tremendous disaster to Singapore. The key to  full

employment and higher standards of living  in  our

situation lies in our present open-door policy  to

both trade and foreign investment. But from a long-term point of view, it is desirable that we try to

nurture  a corps of local entrepreneurs. This  can

best be done by, first of all, helping those local

industries  which  are  thriving  and  which  have

potential   for   expansion   to   secure   better

technology   and   organisation.   There   is    a

distressing   propensity  on  the  part   of   the

Development  Bank  of  Singapore  and  the   Light

Industries  Services  to  waste  time,  money  and

effort  in  attempting to rescue industries  which

are incurable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also advocated more credit availability to

our  local industries and I note with approval the

provision  of  an additional $96  million  to  the

Development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>



Bank  of Singapore. Government  should  also

help   local  industries  in  learning   marketing

techniques,  promote mergers of existing  concerns

into bigger and more efficient establishments, and

help  local  industrialists to identify worthwhile

investment opportunities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second factor is what I call the avoidance of

wage distortions in the economy. In a situation of

rapid industrialization, wage patterns tend to get

grossly  distorted unless there is proper  meshing

of  supply and demand. Even if the general  policy

of  wage  restraint  is effective,  there  can  be

considerable  wage  movements  within  the   given

scales brought about by the mobility of labour and

the  variability  of  entry  points.  There  must,

therefore,  be  a national manpower  co-ordinating

body  monitoring  wage movements, checking  labour

supply developments, and attempting to synchronise

with  demand for various types of skills.  I  have

argued at Economic Development Board meetings  for

such a body, since we can assemble the information

on  projects in the pipe-lines, and we can require

prospective investors to indicate the type and the

volume of skills required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy with regard to wage increases has been

that   they   should  be  tied   to   productivity

increases.  The  problem of how to  implement  the

idea  fairly is still being worked out. Hopefully,

the  reorganisation  of the National  Productivity

Centre  should  help in this direction.  I  should

emphasize,  though,  that the  avoidance  of  wage

distortions   is   a   macro-problem   and   takes

precedence  over  intra- and  inter-industry  wage

adjustments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I come now to the third factor, and that is, attention to the cost of living. Singapore is probably the envy of other countries since our cost of living has been exceptionally slow in rising. However, we cannot expect this happy state of affairs to last much longer as

inflation in other countries is bound to have  its

impact  on us in due course, because we have  such

an open economy. Moreover, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>



an  academic colleague of mine has rightly pointed

out,  we  are  still using the budget  weights  of

1960!  Since then, our per capita income has  more

than  doubled.  As  people's  incomes  rise,   the

proportions   of  expenditures  spent   on   food,

clothing,  housing  and other items  change,  with

greater  weight being assignable to  more  luxury-type  goods.  We need, therefore,  to  update  the

weights  used in the construction of our  cost-of-living index. We can rightly demand sacrifices  of

our  workers in terms of moderating their  demands

for  wage  increases but, at the same  time,  they

must  not be made to sacrifice some of their  real

wages   through  inflation,  correctly   measured.

Ultimately,   the  success  or  failure   of   our

development efforts depends upon the exertions  of

our  workers; it goes without saying that they are

entitled to a fair return.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to talk about the fourth factor

in  our optimum investment policy. Here I will put

it as the avoidance of protection measures. I note

with alarm the almost casual note inserted by  the

Minister  at the conclusion of his budget  speech,

where  he  mentioned  that  protection  for   some

industries at their early stages of implementation

may  be  considered. I hope this will not  be  the

case  as  protection  via tariffs  and  quotas  is

counter-productive  in the context  of  our  small

economy. Let me emphasize once again what  I  have

said  on  other occasions, that the real  argument

for  protection  is for some kind of  subsidy  for

labour  training  or  marketing  or  organisation.

Protection itself tends to create inefficiency and

unhealthy dependence on the small domestic market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth factor concerns the quality of our

institutions.  In  the  decade  of  the   Sixties,

Government  did  much  by  way  of  the   economic

infrastructure  where,  in  addition  to  physical

facilities  for investors, services were  extended

from    new   institutions   like   the   Economic

Development   Board,  the  Development   Bank   of

Singapore,  the Singapore Institute  of  Standards

and   Industrial  Research,  and  so  on.  In  the

Seventies,  we  need  careful  evaluation  of  the

effecttiveness



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>



of these institutions. One or two are,  I

suspect,  white  elephants of an  expensive  kind.

While  they  undoubtedly have served a purpose  in

our  overall investment promotion efforts, we need

to  ensure  that  the  services  promised  to  the

investors materialize effectively. In many  cases,

there  is  a  need to upgrade the quality  of  the

professional  staff.  As our  economy  grows  more

sophisticated,  the  kinds  of  manpower  used  in

monitoring  and  servicing  industry   must   have

corresponding technical expertise. I  would  hope,

therefore, that adequate attention will be paid to

the  quality of our institutions, from  the  civil

service down to the statutory bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth factor is the control of speculative

capital.  Part of the blame for the escalation  of

housing  costs must be assigned to the  influx  of

what  is  known as `hot' money, that  is,  refugee

capital  from  countries suffering  political  and

economic  disturbances. Real estate is  a  natural

haven  for  such capital. Government  should  look

into  the  means  of controlling such  speculative

capital  as  otherwise the distortions created  in

our economy can be very severe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, next I would like to comment on our expenditure on social services. The Budget provides for only a 7.6 per cent increase in this item in the Ordinary Estimates. However, this niggardliness is counter-balanced by a substantial increase in the Development Estimates, giving an

overall  increase  of over 17  per  cent  for  the

social  sector.  This  perhaps  should  have  been

brought out in the Minister's presentation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, I would think that it is time that

we  thought  in  terms of a modern social  welfare

programme incorporating the more positive features

of such schemes from the advanced countries. Given

our  present  rate  of economic  development,  our

Gross  Domestic Product will double in five  years

and  quadruple in 10 years. A more modest rate  of

growth of 10 per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



cent would give us a doubling in seven years and a

quadrupling  in  14 to 15 years. In  other  words,

although we cannot yet afford the kinds of welfare

programme available in the more advanced countries

now,  we shall be able to do so in 10 to 15 years'

time  if  we  can keep up our present momentum  of

economic  development. For the present, we  should

concentrate  on the quality aspect of  our  social

projects. However, we should never lose  sight  of

our socialist goals of equality of opportunity and

a  fair  share for all. Today we rightly emphasize

the need for economic efficiency, as reflected  in

our  slogan: from each his economic best  to  each

his  economic worth. The time should come when  we

accord each person the opportunity for his optimal

development,  demand of him not only his  economic

but  his  social best as well, and compensate  him

for  his  economic and social worth.  Our  present

concern  for a clean environment and the call  for

gracious  living is a harbinger of such things  to

come. As we become more affluent, the cultural and

social   aspects   of  life  should   assume   due

importance alongside the purely economic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now go on to comment on the

development  of  tourism  in  Singapore.  As   the

Minister  has  pointed out, earnings from  tourism

constitute about 5 per cent of our Gross  Domestic

Product. The resources which have been invested in

the industry are already considerable if one takes

into   account   not  only  hotels   but   airport

facilities, night-clubs and public utilities. Even

more resources will be devoted, as can he seen  in

the   airport  expansion  plans  and  the  Sentosa

development project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is time we paused to examine two

important questions. The first is an economic one,

namely,  what is the optimal degree of development

of  the tourist industry? In other words, how many

visitors  can we optimally accommodate before  the

additional  return to our dollar invested  becomes

negligible or less than economic? We should  study

carefully  countries or states with tourism  as  a

major industry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



I  feel  that  beyond a point, the strain  on  the

infrastructure, in terms of demand for  utilities,

communications  and  transport  becomes  all   too

evident.  The  costs of providing such  facilities

will  undoubtedly rise, which, in addition to  the

rise  in  the cost of personal services,  means  a

rise  in  the  cost  of living.  Furthermore,  the

industry  is one which is particularly  vulnerable

to  social  and political disturbances -  visitors

may  be  disinclined  to come  here  if  there  is

trouble in neighbouring countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is a cultural one. So far, our

attitude  seems to be that virtually  anything  is

tolerable,   provided  it  helps  bring   in   the

tourists.  On  the one hand, we have  institutions

which frown even on a-go-go types of dancing, and,

on the other, in the name of tourism, we allow the

importation  of  the crasser types  of  night-club

shows  from western countries at great expense.  I

am  told  that more locals than tourists  frequent

such night-spots. Of more serious concern to us is

the  possible cynical reaction of our youth to the

apparent  adoption  of  double-standards  in   our

approach  to  cultural  matters.  Now,  I  am  not

arguing for a puritanical approach to such things;

rather, I am appealing for consistent standards to

be applied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would now like to touch upon the problem of urban renewal. I am concerned here about two things, one, the uprooting of business and, two, the question of adequate compensation. Many of the small businesses depend on the location and the goodwill built up among the

neighbouring  clientele.  I  would  expect  severe

economic   difficulties   to   arise   when   such

businesses  are  removed elsewhere.  The  solution

would  be  to ensure, first of all, that  suitable

alternative  sites be provided to the satisfaction

of  the  people concerned, and, secondly, adequate

compensation  be  given.  Government  has   argued

rightly  that  the  subsequent  rise  in  property

values   after  redevelopment  is   due   to   the

investment in roads and communications; however, I

do feel that we should err in favour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



of  people  uprooted  by urban  renewal.  In  many

cases,  people do not have the means  to  sue  the

Government. In other cases, they probably feel  it

is  a useless process because, to them, Government

appears   to  be  all-powerful.  In  the  advanced

countries  we  see  the  other  extreme  of  urban

renewal projects being held up because of numerous

law  suits brought against the authorities!  While

the  going is easy for us, we should try  to  bend

over  backwards  in accommodating people  who  are

affected  by our urban renewal schemes, especially

the poorer people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to talk about our balance of

payments.  The Minister for Finance  has  done  an

admirable job of analysing the trade deficit.  The

deficit is a good and healthy thing because it  is

stimulated  by  a  buoyant  economy  investing  in

machinery  and  plant, which will generate  output

and,  therefore,  the means for repayment  in  the

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, for the first time in several years,

our  growth in Gross Domestic Expenditure  exceeds

that of our Gross Domestic Product, reflecting the

fact   that   investments  exceed   our   savings.

Hitherto,  we  had  saved more  than  we  invested

locally,  resulting  in  accretions  of  Singapore

investments  and bank balances abroad.  Investment

in real terms requires not just a financial inflow

but  the  actual importation of the machinery  and

the tools required for the production process. The

ordinary layman's view is that balance of payments

surpluses  are  good  and  deficits  are  bad;  in

economic  terms, surpluses imply the  transfer  of

real  goods and services overseas in exchange  for

paper  claims redeemable at some future  date!  Of

course,  a  trade  deficit  would  be  bad  if  it

comprises  consumption  type  goods  so  that   no

productive capacity is added.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I want to comment on the Minister's reference

to  Mr  S. Okita's analysis of the causes of  the

high  Japanese growth rates. It seems to  me  that

the  nine points listed are more descriptive  than

analytical. Sir, two of the points, the  fifth  on

agriculture  and the ninth, are either  irrelevant

or unclear



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



as  to the line of causation. In our context,  our

rapid growth can be attributable to five factors:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Political stability: This is something which

people  should not take for granted. In  fact,  we

should use the period of relative calm to build  a

stronger   political  base  to  ensure   continued

stability  and progress. Investors  have  a  time-horizon  for their calculations and need a  degree

of  certainty  for their returns,  and  hence  the

importance of this factor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Economic infrastructure: We are now enjoying

the  fruits  of the extensive investments  in  the

economic  infrastructure which were  made  in  the

Sixties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Efficient administration: In countries where

bureaucracy  is  stifling and corruption  rampant,

much  entrepreneurial energy is wasted  in  merely

securing legitimacy. Although we have a relatively

efficient and non-corrupt civil service, we should

not   be  too  complacent.  The  current  courtesy

campaign  is a correct step, but we should  remain

watchful  against  corruption.  The  more  blatant

forms  of corruption are easy to detect,  but  the

methods  of  corruption can grow in sophistication

too  -  these  are  the more  insidious  and  more

difficult to identify.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Open-door policy on trade and investment: We

are  rightly  emphasising export  orientation  and

providing   a   hospitable  climate  for   foreign

investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Labour-force discipline: Last, but not least,

we  should  not  forget  the  discipline  and  the

exertions of our workers. The co-operation of  the

unions  in  restraining wage demands, in accepting

longer work hours, trimming of fringe benefits and

curtailment of their bargaining powers, has been a

major positive factor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now let me draw attention to the storm

signals which the Minister talked about. The  most

proximate one concerns the run-down of the British

military  bases  this  year  of  some  $250-   300

million. While the expenditure effects



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



per  se  can  be  met  by the counter-recessionary

measures  mentioned by the Minister, I think  that

in  addition to the efforts of the Bases  Economic

Conversion  Department,  a  more  direct  approach

towards  the  absorption of  the  15,000  civilian

employees and the 2,000 locally-enlisted personnel

is necessary. Many of these people, I suspect, are

in  clerical-type occupations and are  not  young.

Consequently, they would have great difficulty  in

finding   jobs  with  comparable  pay  and   their

adjustment  problems to new kinds  of  occupations

are  not inconsequential. I would propose that all

clerical  and  all  unskilled  job  vacancies   in

Government  and statutory boards in the  next  two

years  be  reserved for these retrenched  workers.

Government  bodies should refrain from  taking  in

young  people  for  such occupations  because  the

younger people are more adaptable. So let them  go

elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the decline in entrepot earnings

mentioned  by  the Minister probably reflects  the

reclassification  of  ship-repairing  services  as

manufactures.  However, so long  as  we  can  pull

ahead   in   manufacturing   activity,   decreased

dependence on entrepot earnings should  induce  no

undue anxiety.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now comment on the silver lining mentioned by the Minister. The hopeful factors raised by the Minister include the role of Japan in influencing the trade and investment in South-east Asian countries. Whether and how Japan will use her vast economic power to

help  South-east  Asia develop is something  which

depends  on  her calculations. If she fulfils  her

social   and  economic  responsibilities  to   the

region, we stand to benefit substantially  by  way

of increased trade and investment. Japan currently

ranks  as  our  largest supplier  of  imports  and

fourth as a market for our exports. The trade  gap

is  overwhelmingly in her favour. There should  be

ample goodwill on her part, therefore, in allowing

the  entry of Singapore manufactures and we should

take full advantage of this leverage. In terms  of

investment, we can benefit substantially as  Japan

moves on to higher technology industries; however,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



we  should exercise selectivity and  reject

those industries with major pollution problems and

cultivate  those  which build  up  our  technical,

managerial and marketing skills. In any event,  we

should  not  forget  that the  Japanese  are  hard

bargainers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I applaud the decision not to

raise  new  taxes  as  this  would  be  the  wrong

strategy  to pursue when we are trying  to  offset

the  expenditure reductions of the British  bases.

Our  credit  standing is strong, as  the  Minister

rightly  pointed  out. If past experience  is  any

guide,  I  suspect also that some of the estimated

tax revenues are under-estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget, however, that this is not yet

the  time  to relax. We should remain watchful  to

see  how our workers imbibe the new skills and how

our  managers  and executives learn the  ropes  of

modern organisation and sales techniques. The more

difficult phase of development lies ahead  because

quality   is   more  difficult  to  achieve   than

quantity.  Our  concern in the  years  ahead  must

increasingly  be  with  quality  of   skills,   of

products,  of  management, of  institutions,  and,

above all, of the political leadership. At a  time

of  relative  peace and prosperity, the  political

challenge  is  not  so  much  of  courage  hut  of

foresight in anticipating problems and of  patient

toil in the construction of an even better future.

In such a setting, the temptation unfortunately is

always to relax and grow flabby with age and over-indulgence.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the total expenditure  of  the

budget for the financial year 1st April, 1971,  to

31st   March,   1972,   is  $1,308,000,000.   This

represents an increase of 28.1 per cent  over  the

last  financial year's expenditure.  In  spite  of

this, there are neither new taxes nor any increase

in  the existing rates of taxation. All this shows

that,  as  a  result  of the co-operation  of  the

people  of Singapore, we have been able to  depend

on ourselves to grow



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



up  economically  and socially. It  is  worth  our

while  to  exert  ourselves  to  achieve  economic

prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Finance Minister's budget statement, the

Gross  Domestic  Product of  1970  has  increased,

representing a growth of 15 per cent.  This  is  a

great leap forward in our economic growth. But the

increase in taxi fares, in the prices of sugar and

bread will also mean a rise in the cost of living.

I do not know why in recent months the prices of a

whole  range of commodities have increased.  As  a

result of these price increases, the common people

are   very   worried.  In  developing   countries,

industrial  progress entails an  increase  in  the

cost of living. This is almost inevitable. But the

sudden  spate of price increases, resulting  in  a

rise  in  the  cost  of  living  overnight,  means

imposing  a great burden on the common people.  If

there is no check on this inflation, it will  lead

to  social discontent and grave anxiety among  the

masses.  As a result, many people will have  cause

to worry about their future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Minister concerned to take

immediate steps to set up a commission of  inquiry

to  look  into the unscrupulous behaviour  of  the

merchants and traders at large. We should be  able

to  bring  down the cost of living to  its  normal

level.  There should be no more squeezing  by  the

unscrupulous businessmen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that the Government is paying attention to the rising cost of housing. Perhaps action will be taken to halt the increase in the cost of building because it will affect our economic development. This is a very wise declaration of policy. But the increase in the

prices  of  land  and commodities should  also  be

checked.  At a time when the Government  is  going

ahead  with its urban renewal scheme, the building

trade   is   having   an   all-time   boom.   Many

manufacturers of building materials have cashed in

on  the  situation.  But has the  Government  done

anything to stop it?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government announces every week in the

Government Gazette the acquisition of lots of land

in various areas. This could perhaps be one of the

factors  contributing to the rise in the  cost  of

land.  Because  of this Government acquisition  of

land, there has been a lot of land speculation. In

the course of speculation, the prices of land have

been deliberately increased. This has caused great

hardship  to the poor and middle-class people  who

have  to  look  to  Housing and Development  Board

flats for their housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In implementing the Home Ownership Scheme, we

want  to  ensure that as many families as possible

own  their  own houses and flats. This  policy  is

welcomed  by  the poorer people of Singapore.  But

the  price  of the flats in the Kallang  area  has

been raised. This is a matter which we should  not

take  lightly. The reason given is that such flats

are  in the city area, so the prices tend to be  a

bit high, but the Housing and Development Board is

supposed  to be a servicing institution  to  build

housing  for the people, particularly  the  poorer

people. So we should not pursue the same policy as

private developers do, and that is to make  money.

There  is nothing objectionable if the high  price

is  due to the cost of building materials, but  if

the reason is that the area has been developed  or

is  nearer the city, it is open to question. Using

the  same  argument, the prices of all  the  other

Housing  and  Development Board flats should  have

been  raised because factories would be  built  in

these areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people registered for Housing and

Development Board accommodation many years  before

the  flats  were ready for occupation. But  during

the  period of waiting, there has been an increase

in  property values. Can this be used as an excuse

to  raise  the  price of flats  subsequently?  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  would like to  quote  a  letter

written by a so-called efficient public servant. I

will quote in English:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Representation to Mr...., M.P. for ...Constituency.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are hereby requested to pay up the sum of

$251  within two weeks of the date of this  letter

as  payment  for 1970 and 1971 licence fees.  This

offer of licence will be withdrawn if you fail  to

do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours faithfully, signed.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(In Mandarin)</i> Mr Speaker, Sir, the tone of this

letter more or less amounts to a threat and is  an

insult  to the Member of Parliament concerned.  In

other words, it amounts to this - "You can go  and

see  your M.P., but I warn you that if you do  not

pay  within  two  weeks,  your  licence  will   be

withdrawn." There are some civil servants who know

that  the requests of members of the public cannot

be  met,  but they deliberately tell them  to  see

their  M.P.s, knowing full well that such requests

cannot be met. In this way they are trying  to  be

difficult with the M.P.s, and create discontent or

misunderstanding between the Members of Parliament

and the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the few points that I wish to bring to

the attention of the Minister in charge. It is  my

hope  that proper attention will be given  to  all

these grievances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, I am happy that there have been no

tax  increases in the new budget. I am also  happy

with  the  economic growth which the Minister  has

reported in his budget statement. I support him in

this respect.



<br><br>4.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  all the people in  Singapore  were

greatly  relieved after they had listened  to  the

speech made by the Minister for Finance on the 8th

of  March  in this House. The reason is  that  the

Minister  was not going to introduce new taxes  or

increase the existing tax rates. From the people's

point of view, naturally they hope that each  year

the  budget  will  be balanced without  having  to

introduce new taxes, otherwise they will  have  to

tighten their belts no end. In recent months  -  I

think  the Minister is also aware of this  -prices

of  commodities have risen tremendously.  Although

the  price increases are often disguised  by  such

terms as "price adjustments", "price standardisation"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>



or  "price unification", the  people  know

that  it amounts to a rise in many of their  daily

consumer goods: coffee, sugar and bread; even  bus

fares are on the increase! It is only the wages of

workers   that  have  not  shown  a  corresponding

increase.  We are in a situation where  wages  are

forever  lagging behind prices. It  is  no  wonder

that  the people are distressed that the  cost  of

living  is  increasing every day.  Their  life  is

becoming  more and more difficult. I think  it  is

not  necessary for me to remind the Minister  that

P.A.P, is  supposed  to  be  a  socialist  party.

Therefore,  the  Government and the  party  should

have the welfare of the lower income group more at

heart,  and  prevent the income  gap  between  the

haves and the have-nots from becoming wider.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is also one of the originators of our industrialisation plans. Today, industries are playing an important role in the economic growth of our country. In Other words, the structure of our economy has been transformed from that of an entrepot trading port to an industrial economy. We

can  say that the Government has looked after  the

industrialisation   programme   very   well.   For

example,  the Economic Development Board  provides

local  and  foreign investors with  assistance  in

their  plans. The Jurong Town Corporation provides

prospective investors with suitable factory sites.

The  Development Bank provides the necessary loans

or     any     financial    assistance.    INTRACO

(International  Trading  Company)   provides   new

markets overseas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if we look at the agricultural

sector,  we  can see that the Government  has  not

done  enough.  In  the Finance Minister's  speech,

there is very little mention of it. The most  that

the  Government  has done is the establishment  of

the   Primary  Production  Department   which   is

supposed   to  provide  technical  assistance   to

farmers.    However,   whether   this    technical

assistance  is  efficiently  transmitted  to   the

farmers  is  rather  open to  doubt.  The  farming

operations in our country are becoming smaller and

smaller. The number



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



of people who are engaged in farming is  also

on  the decrease. If we do not take steps to  stop

this  trend,  we might find that we will  have  to

spend   something  like  $200  million   for   our

requirements  of  agricultural products.  We  have

nearly 200,000 farmers and their families who work

all  day long and who earn just sufficient to keep

them  going. If their crop is a failure or if  the

prices  of  their products fall,  they  will  lose

their  capital  outlay.  If  they  wish  to  start

afresh, they have to borrow money at high interest

rates  from  middlemen  or  from  tontines.  As  a

result,  they are forever in debt. The  Government

has  not  provided adequate assistance to them.  I

think  it should set up a farmers' bank to provide

low-interest  loans to them. With such  assistance

they   will  be  able  to  purchase  new   farming

equipment   and   so  maintain  or   raise   their

production  level. This assistance  is  especially

needed  because  we are trying to  develop  small-scale  concentrated  farming activities.  We  also

have to look after their production facilities  in

terms  of  hygiene. All this will cost money,  and

the Government should, therefore, help them at all

times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government assistance should not be limited only

to  times  of disaster. We know the Government  is

aware of the exploitation of farmers by middlemen.

The prices of agricultural products are subject to

violent  fluctuations, but the Government has  not

done anything to control this. Nor has it set up a

co-operative  scheme for the  farmers,  or  helped

them  to  find new markets overseas. As a  result,

they  have  to  go  on  their own.  Naturally  the

results are not encouraging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point. The Government is

spending a large sum of money each year to collect

statistics of agricultural activity for  research.

But  the findings have not been made available  to

the  farmers. We have been told that research  has

been  made on intensive farming schemes, but there

is  no  evidence  of  an  implementation  of  such

intensive farming techniques.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the problem of land. We know that

land  is a scarce commodity and yet much of it  is

being    used    for   military   purposes,    for

industrialisation, and for urbanisation. The  land

available for farming is becoming less and less.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must also take a look at the fishing

industry. In 1967 our fishermen caught 17,921 tons

of  fish.  In 1969 it dropped to 12,100 tons.  The

number of fishermen has also dropped tremendously,

and  we  cannot blind ourselves to this tact.  The

report of the Primary Production Department  shows

that  in  1968 there were 3,861 fishermen, whereas

in 1969 there were only 1,314. The kelong industry

has  also declined, because the fish available  in

the  off-shore  areas is limited.  The  fishermen,

therefore,  have  to go far out to  sea  to  fish,

thereby  running great risks. But  they  have  not

been  offered any protection from the  dangers  of

the  high  seas. Should they lose their  bearings,

they  might  be  blown off-course and  land  in  a

foreign  country  where they may be  subjected  to

humiliation. If they do come back alive, they  can

count themselves lucky. The Government should come

to  some sort of agreement on fishing rights  with

our   neighbouring  countries,  and   to   provide

adequate  protection  for our  fishermen  who  are

engaged  in  deep-sea fishing. But  if  Government

intends   to  promote  deep-sea  fishing   without

providing this protection, then nothing  much  can

be achieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I do not understand why the pioneer

industry  status  for deep-sea  fishing  has  been

withdrawn.  How can we encourage our investors  to

invest  their  money in deep-sea  fishing  if  the

Government  is doing all this? It should  adopt  a

positive attitude towards deep-sea fishing and not

indulge in empty talk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Government has not set

aside  a  piece of land for a fishing  village  to

accommodate    those   fishermen    affected    by

resettlement schemes. This is because they are not

classified  as  farmers,  and  are  therefore  not

entitled to a piece of land. As a result,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>



they  can only be settled in Housing Board  flats.

But  most  of these flats are at a great  distance

from  where they keep their fishing boats. Because

of  this, many of them are forced to change  their

occupation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although we cannot rely entirely on agriculture and fishing alone as we must also look after other industries, we must, however, not neglect these two industries because a large number of our people are engaged in them.

<br><br>4.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  this is the second consecutive year in which

a painless budget has been presented to this House

and  to  the people of Singapore. May I take  this

opportunity to congratulate the Government and the

Minister  on  the apparently happy  state  of  the

Republic's financial affairs?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in his budget statement, the Minister

introduced a cautionary note by drawing  attention

to  the  ominous  presence of  indicative  factors

making  for economic instability. The vagaries  of

the  International Monetary System and the British

withdrawal, for instance, are apparently  pointers

to  the  vulnerability of the  foundation  of  our

economic   viability  and  prosperity.   Sir,   we

Singaporeans pride ourselves on our realistic  and

pragmatic   attitude  to  life.  The  history   of

Singapore,  particularly during the  past  decade,

confirms   rather   than   refutes   Singaporeans'

awareness of and their capacity to cope  with  the

ups and downs of life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is not my intention to suggest that a

cautionary  note is out of tune in a budget  meant

to instil confidence, it would have been better if

the  Minister  had  run through  the  whole  gamut

rather than just a solitary note of caution. I may

be  wrong but the impression I receive is that the

Minister, after delivering himself of the note  of

caution,  merely contented himself with  a  "happy

budget".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my opinion, the Minister has over-emphasised the impact of the British Conservative

Government's  decision  to  maintain  a   military

presence  in  the  area on British  investment  in

Singapore.  No  doubt, British industrialists  and

businessmen may get a moral boost from being under

the very faint shadow of British arms in this area

even  after  1971.  But all the same,  hard-headed

investors, whether British or otherwise, look  for

something more substantial and tangible  than  the

ghost  of gunboat diplomacy. For British investors

in  Singapore, the recent statutory  assurance  of

the   Singapore  Government  to  guarantee   their

investment is more likely to appeal to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest that there are other important

reasons beside those mentioned by the Minister for

the  present economic well-being of Singapore. The

political stability of Singapore and its potential

for profitable economic investment undoubtedly are

contributive  factors  of  our  present   economic

health.  My great regret is that our hard-working,

adaptable  and responsible workers, who constitute

the  back-up  troops  as well  as  the  front-line

fighters in our drive towards economic success, do

not   merit  even  perfunctory  praise  from   the

Minister. The acceptance of the Employment Act  by

the  trade union movement against the grain of its

traditional  objective  is  in  keeping  with  the

avowed  policy of co-operation with the Government

in any matter of national interest. The Government

has   acknowledged  this  in  private,  but  after

listening to the Minister's speech, I was saddened

not  to hear a word of tribute to the contribution

by labour towards the prosperity of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The. Minister spoke confidently of "a record

number   of  very  large  projects  by  well-known

international    companies"    extending     their

operations to Singapore in 1971. I have  no  doubt

that  this desirable trend will contribute towards

the  continuing economic growth.  But  I  have  my

misgivings about the undesirable side-effects that

may  be generated by such large-scale invasion  of

foreign



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>



investment. Labour may be plentiful in  Singapore,

but    trained    and   skilled    manpower    is,

unfortunately, not plentiful. The result  is  that

harassed  employers are prepared to up their  ante

to secure their supply of such scarce manpower. As

more   and   more  foreign  industries   come   to

Singapore,  we  lose more and more  trained  civil

servants to the private sector which pays more for

their  services. My fear is that if we  allow  the

haemorrhage  of trained personnel from  our  civil

service  to continue unchecked, not only will  our

civil  service be unable to claim to be  the  most

efficient in South-east Asia, as it can today, but

also  our  socio-economic  infrastructure  may  be

weakened  to  that  extent. We do  not  match  the

private  sector  in  payment of  wages  and  other

fringe benefits, because we just cannot afford  to

match them. As a result, the cream of our citizens

are  not  attracted  to  a  career  in  the  civil

service.  Even  among serving civil servants,  the

temptation to leave is ever present. Those  senior

civil servants who remain in service do so because

of  their loyalty to the national cause and  their

dedication to the civil service. The bright  young

ones  will stay on to gain some experience  before

joining  the private sector where they expect  the

pasture to be undoubtedly greener. The trouble  is

that  very few in the private sector see a greener

pasture in the civil service. The question is, can

we afford to allow such a situation to continue to

deteriorate? At the moment, we are exploiting  the

few  dedicated arid loyal civil servants by making

them  do not just one full-time job but in certain

cases even three or four full-time jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have known of many experienced civil servants

who  would  not be so dedicated to and would  have

left  the service today to join private industries

which   are  crying  for  seasoned  and  competent

managerial  personnel, were it not  for  the  fact

that they stand to lose their pension rights.  The

situation would have been different if such  civil

servants   had  been  governed  by   the   Central

Provident Fund Ordinance rather than the  Pensions

Ordinance.  For the civil service  to  retain  its

trained and experienced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>



personnel  in  the  face of  blatant  poaching  by

private  employers, the terms  and  conditions  of

service and working conditions obtainable  in  the

civil  service  have to be revised and  made  more

attractive.  It is all very well to  say  that  we

want  only  civil  servants who are  dedicated  to

public  service  and that for such civil  servants

money  is of immaterial consideration. While there

are  undoubtedly civil servants who fit this bill,

the   vast   majority  are  only  human   or   too

susceptible.  Dedication  and  loyalty  to  public

interest  and national interest are two  qualities

which cannot appear to have carried much weight in

the  light  of  our  obvious  admiration  for  the

entrepreneur who can make a fast buck.  My  point,

however,   is   that  even  the   most   energetic

entrepreneur can constructively pursue his  money-making activities best in an economy with a stable

socio-economic infrastructure, of which the  civil

service must provide the vital skeletal framework.

I  should not think a painful budget is too high a

price to pay for that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that the time is ripe for a

complete  overhaul of our civil service terms  and

conditions of service so as to be able  to  arrest

the  continuing stream of resignations from  among

the  middle  and lower echelons of  teachers,  the

Police  Force, the Fire Brigade and other branches

of  our  civil service. Not only are such  trained

civil  servants hard to replace at once, but every

loss of trained personnel also means that there is

a wastage of public funds. I know that a committee

has  been  set up to look into the wage scales  in

our  police force and that the Teachers' Union has

had  one  discussion, as was pointed  out  by  the

Member  for Moulmein yesterday, With the  Ministry

of   Education  some  six  months  ago.  But   the

discontentment   among  civil  servants   is   not

confined to the teachers and policemen alone. I do

hope  the  Minister will look thoroughly into  the

matter  and  not  dismiss it with another  cursory

note.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has mentioned that there has

been  a  boom  in the building industry.  He  has,

however,   added   that  the  "smaller   increases

recorded  for  these  building materials  indicate

that  the  construction  industry's  36  per  cent

increase in earnings may be constituted partly  by

higher profit margins and only partly by increased

constructional capacity." Sir, this statement  has

borne  out my belief that the shortage of  skilled

building   and   construction  workers   and   the

consequent higher wage level of such workers  have

not been responsible for the fantastic prices that

the  developers  charge for their products  during

the  past  few years. While I am pleased  to  note

that the Minister has acknowledged the cupidity of

developers as the cause of the rocketing prices of

landed  property and am assured that he is keeping

his Ministerial eye on the situation, I would have

been  happier if the Minister had intimated a more

concrete  course of action against the anti-social

conduct  of  our developers. Sir, if  he  were  to

intimidate  the  developers, I would  be  happier!

Unless  the Government steps in and does something

drastic now, the ever-spiralling circle of  prices

extorted  by the building developers will  put  it

beyond  the  dreams, and means  of  ordinary  wage

earners  to  own their homes. Sir, the  developers

who  sold  small houses at $20,000 each two  years

ago are now demanding anything between $50,000 and

$60,000 for similar houses in the same estates. It

is  cheaper  in Jurong, I am told! The trouble  is

that   the   wage   level  has  not  significantly

increased  during the past decade.  While  a  wage

earner earning about $1,000 per month three  years

ago  was  in  a position to purchase a reasonable-sized  house  from  a private  developer,  now  he

cannot even own a smaller house. His best hope for

a  home  of his own is to turn to the Housing  and

Development  Board  which  is  subsidised  by  the

Government.  This, however, places a great  strain

on  the  resources of the Housing and  Development

Board  which  cannot  meet such  increased  demand

without  neglecting the needs of workers who  earn

considerably less than $l,000



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>



per  month  and  who constitute the  bulk  of  the

working  population. Thus, the  so-called  middle-class workers are caught between the devil of  the

developers  and the deep blue sea of  the  limited

resources of the Housing and Development Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rising prices of houses is a serious problem

today  and,  instead of continuing  to  watch  the

situation  further, I think the Government  should

take  action  now to prevent this  condition  from

deteriorating any further. With the present prices

of  houses,  even the Housing Loan Scheme  of  the

Government  with  its maximum of $40,000,  or  the

equivalent  of three years' salary,  whichever  is

lower,  becomes more of a mockery than an  aid  to

civil  servants  who  aspire to  be  proud  house-owners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While workers have responded to the call of the

Government to stabilize the wage level, developers

capitalise   on  the  apparent  neglect   by   the

Government  of  the deleterious effects  of  price

manipulations by developers. It appears to be  the

thinking  of the Government that, as long  as  the

Economic  Development Board can control sufficient

land  for  the construction and use of  factories,

and  the  Housing and Development Board  can  have

sufficient  land  for housing factory  workers  as

cheaply as possible, private developers are to  be

permitted to enjoy laissez faire. Thus our middle-class  workers are made to compete at a very great

disadvantage  with expatriate or foreign  managers

and  technicians  who, with the backing  of  their

respective  employers, are able  and  prepared  to

play along with the developers' game of jacking-up

housing  costs  beyond the reach of local  buyers.

The  supreme irony of this all is that the capital

gains  so engendered by private developers  cannot

be  syphoned off by the Government in the form  of

taxes to increase, for instance, the resources  of

the Housing and Development Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, tourism represents a source of further

economic growth. The Government should ensure that

such a source is not unduly prejudiced. There is a

need  for  action to be taken to prevent the  many

tourists from being fleeced by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>



some  shops which are only interested in making  a

fast  buck and being misled by touts operating  as

tourist  guides. Sir,. I am aware that  there  are

many  genuine and competent tourist guides, but  I

am  also aware that there are as many touts posing

as   bona  fide  tourist  guides.  Sir,  for  many

tourists Singapore is a byword as an international

shopping  centre  for  popular  items,   such   as

cameras,   watches,  transistors,  ornaments   and

curios.  I  appreciate that ours is a  free  trade

economy, but if it is possible we should institute

some  form of control of prices of goods  normally

purchased by tourists. Touts operating as  tourist

guides  take  the unsuspecting tourists  to  shops

that charge exorbitant prices, and the shops pay a

commission  to  such  touts.  While  the   Tourist

Promotion  Board  has directed  its  attention  to

undesirable practices among shopkeepers, it should

exercise  greater vigilance in the protection  and

promotion   of   Singapore's  reputation   as   an

international shopping centre. Sir, I even  notice

a   shop   in   Stamford  Road  with  a  signboard

proclaiming  itself to be a tax-free shop,  giving

the impression that goods purchased in other shops

carry purchase tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister claims that the price index has

risen  by  only 11.5 per cent since  1960.  A  few

Members  have taken up this question. This  figure

is  taken  from  the Monthly Digest of  Statistics

produced  by the Department of Statistics.  May  I

humbly  suggest that even the Minister's wife,  if

she   does  marketing  herself,  would  vehemently

disagree  with him. Statistics show only what  the

statistician  wants to show. The  presentation  of

statistics can be an exact science but it can also

be  a  very  refined art. While the cost-of-living

index  purports  to show the average  increase  in

prices of commodities of general consumption,  the

weights   given  to  the  respective   items   can

influence the final figure, that is, the  cost-of-living  index. For it must be remembered  that  of

all  the items used for computation of the  index,

not  all  the  items are of equal  importance.  In

computing an accurate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>



index,  more  weights have to be  given  to  items

which  are  consumed  in  greater  quantities.  By

playing about with statistical weights, the  index

can  be rigged to show an increase or decrease  in

the  cost  of  living. Let me  illustrate  with  a

practical  example, the prices of which have  been

taken  from  the  Government's Monthly  Digest  of

Statistics. If we are to compute on an index  with

disproportionately  greater  weights  assigned  to

items  (on  the  basis of the data  shown  in  the

Monthly Digest of Statistics) such as fish,  which

has  increased in price by 29 per cent since 1960,

sugar  products by 62 per cent, vegetables  by  20

per  cent, beverages by 18 per cent, furniture and

household equipment by 36 per cent and footwear by

16  per  cent, the cost of living can be shown  to

have  increased by more than double  the  official

11.5  per cent quoted by the Minister since  1960.

Conversely,      by     arbitrarily      assigning

disproportionately greater weights to  such  items

as  meat and poultry which have gone down in price

by  three per cent since 1960, oils and fats which

have gone up by one per cent, fruits up by two per

cent,  tailoring and laundering charges up by  one

per  cent,  transport  up  by  one  per  cent  and

entertainment  up by four per cent,  the  cost  of

living can be shown to increase by only less  than

half the official figure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that a publication of the cost-of-living index cannot be treated in the same manner

as  the  reading of a thermometer can be taken  to

measure a rise or a fall in temperature. I am not,

however,  imputing  any  sinister  motive  to  the

Minister  who  has shown such great faith  in  the

official  cost-of-living index,  or  any  lack  of

integrity   to   those  civil  servants   in   the

Statistics   Department   responsible   for    the

publication of the official index.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I wish to make is that the cost of

living  is  closely  related to  the  standard  of

living. Any improvement in the standard of  living

will  radically affect the pattern of weights used

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>



computing the cost-of-living index. As the  Member

for  Whampoa has pointed out just now, the pattern

has  not  been  changed in the  computation  since

1960. In the meantime, the standard of living  has

improved beyond recognition, judging by the number

of  cars, scooters, television sets and what-have-you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the cost of living remains a matter for

speculation,  profiteers can continue  to  thrive.

The  latest price hike is in respect of  bread.  1

was  shocked to read recently of the threat by the

Bakers' Association against bakers who may wish to

sell  their bread below the price dictated by  the

Association. The increased price of bread could be

understandable if the production costs  have  gone

up  as  a result of the increased costs of  flour,

labour, etc. Here, we have an Association ordering

its   members   to  increase  the  price   without

justification and threatening them with  reprisals

if  they  refuse to join in fleecing  the  hapless

consumers.  I  would have thought  the  Government

should  have  smacked  this Association  down  and

hard. What is more ominous is the thought that the

Association  would not be able to  make  good  its

threat of reprisals against public-spirited bakers

unless  they  have the backing of flour  producers

and    distributors.   The   increase   in   bread

consumption in the republic is a testimony to  the

effectiveness  of  the  Government's  campaign  to

persuade  Singaporeans to  eat  wheat  instead  of

rice.  The least the Government can do now  is  to

prevent a handful of local wheat and bread tycoons

from holding the rest of us to ransom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the risk of being accused of wallowing in self-pity, I have to round up my comments on the

Minister for Finance's speech with the observation

that  it  is  a  tough  job  being  a  worker   in

Singapore. As the bulk of consumers, workers  find

themselves  not  only at the  losing  end  of  the

battle against rising prices, but also tilting  at

some  quixotic windmills into the bargain, because

the cost of living has officially increased by not

more than one per cent per year since 1960. As the

principal source of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>



labour,  workers find that national  interest  has

not,  and  is  not  expected to have,  any  cogent

appeal for owners and developers of land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As trade unionists, workers are constantly

exhorted to be realistic and practical in  worldly

affairs  and,  towards  this  end,  are  urged  to

familiarise  themselves with the various  concepts

and  analyses  of  society. Thus,  the  Government

hails the decision of the trade union movement  to

reorganise  itself and to reorientate and  educate

its  officials  and members so as to  be  able  to

assist  in  the  development  of  Singapore.   The

Minister himself stated the other day that we  can

make Singapore the key location for industries  if

"our  workers and the unions are educated  to  the

realities of our economic life, keen to make their

contribution to the transformation of our  society

with high industrialisation and sophistication  in

technology". But, unfortunately, the vast majority

of employers do not seem to view national interest

or the urgency of national development in the same

light  as  the  Minister and the workers,  if  the

workers wish to attend enlightening courses,  they

can  do  so  in  their own time and  make  further

sacrifices  in  the national interest.  And  those

same  employers are the ones who benefit most from

the painless budget.



<br><br>4.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin(Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

coming  amidst  complaints of the rising  cost  of

living, the painless budget is indeed most welcome

and  public  jubilation is very much in  evidence.

During the course of the Minister's speech he has,

among  other things, made mention of the continued

inflationary  conditions  in  some  of  the  major

industrial   countries.  He  has  also   expressed

concern  over  the cost increase in  the  building

industry  and  has  promised to maintain  a  close

watch  upon the situation. However, touching  upon

the  question of the cost of living, I am inclined

to  agree  with Members who have spoken before  me

that the Minister has treated the subject some-what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>



too lightly and quoted the official Consumer

Price  index  to show that there has only  been  a

very  slight  fluctuation in the  monthly  average

between  1969 and 1970. Without knowing the  basis

upon  which  the  statistics are compiled,  it  is

difficult for me to quarrel with the figures,  but

from   regular   conversations   held   with    my

constituents and judging by the number of  letters

addressed to the press on the subject lately,  and

indeed  the complaints made by quite a few Members

who  spoke before me, I rather fear that there has

been a definite rise in the overall cost of living

affecting most, if not all, wage-earners in recent

months.  But  I  have  been  assured  by  reliable

experts that the increase in our cost of living is

comparatively mild if one considers the trends  in

other  countries, particularly some  of  the  more

affluent  countries  such as  the  United  States,

Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom. Sir, I am

not  a unionist but I think it is fair to say that

the  relatively  stable  situation  obtaining   in

Singapore  has been due, I think, largely  to  the

responsible attitude of our unions in not pressing

for   excessive  wage  demands  on  the  slightest

excuse,  as is the practice with unions  in  other

countries which have bad records of inflation  and

which   suffer  from  the  perennial  problem   of

spiralling wages and prices. However, the brunt of

keeping  inflation  in check  should  not,  in  my

opinion,  be borne entirely by the workers  alone.

Quite  apart  from  taking the appropriate  fiscal

measures,  it  is  the duty of the  Government  to

maintain  a close watch at all times on the  price

movements  of necessities, and where unjustifiable

increases  take place, it should not be  reluctant

to  take appropriate action. The Member for  Telok

Blangah,  who spoke before me, quoted  the  recent

price  increase  in  bread.  I  think  that  is  a

situation which I would strongly urge the Minister

to  look  into. The official Consumer Price  Index

does  not appear to be adequate to do the job  for

which  it  is  intended, and an early  opportunity

should be taken to work out a more realistic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>



formula  in line with the present-day standard  of

living  so  that it would reflect more  accurately

the ups and downs of our cost of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to make a few observations on

industrial   development.  If  success   in   this

direction is to be measured in terms of the number

of  foreign companies we are able to attract here,

there   is  no  doubt  that  we  have  been  doing

extremely well. One has only to look at the number

of international giants that have set up or are in

the   course  of  setting  up  here.  But  in  our

endeavour  to  attract these foreign companies  to

come  in, there is, to my mind, a danger that  our

entire  economy  may be so geared to  serve  these

giants  that  we  may, wittingly  or  unwittingly,

neglect the need to continue to encourage  and  to

assist in the development of the medium and  small

industries, particularly those started by our  own

nationals.  I  say this because I have  been  told

that   with   increasing  competing  demands   for

services  from these big firms, our smaller  firms

in  both  the manufacturing and other sectors  are

beginning  to  experience difficulty in  obtaining

financial support from their bankers who obviously

consider  it safer and more profitable to  finance

the  established  international  giants  than  the

small  companies with somewhat limited  resources.

The  plight of these small industries was  brought

up   during   a  recent  forum  held  at   Nanyang

University which was fully reported in the  press,

and  it  is unnecessary for me to repeat what  was

said.  What  has  prompted me to bring  forth  the

matter is the Minister's quotation of the analysis

made  by  Mr  S. Okita, President  of  the  Japan

Economic Research Centre. According to Mr  Okita,

as  quoted by the Minister for Finance, one of the

reasons that account for Japan's high growth  rate

is   the   "widespread  small  and  medium   sized

industries    developed    mainly    by    private

initiative".  If we agree with Mr Okita,  I  feel

that  more  should  be done by the  Government  to

assist in the development of small and medium



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>



industries  and,  in particular,  the  Development

Bank of Singapore should be directed to reserve  a

substantial  part of its available funds  for  the

specific   purpose   of  financing   these   small

industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, as a Member of Parliament from an

agricultural  area,  I  would  like  to  associate

myself with the sentiments expressed by the Member

for  Jurong  when  he  spoke on  the  Government's

policy,   or   lack  of  policy,  on  agricultural

development. I do hope that the Minister will take

the opportunity to assess the entire situation and

formulate a rather more realistic approach to  the

matter.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I propose to take the

suspension  now. I will take the  Chair  again  at 5.30 p.m.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>

<div align="right"><i>5.00 p.m, until 5.30 p.m.</i></div>



<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.30 p.m.</i></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wish  to  thank the Minister for Finance  for  his

Annual Budget Statement and to congratulate him on

his brilliant rendering of the budget, for despite

a  substantial  increase in expenditure  all  year

round and a reduction in revenue from the duty  on

cigarettes, he has been able to balance the budget

without  having  to  introduce  new  taxes  or  to

increase existing taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have a few points to bring forward. My

first  point  is  that the rising cost  of  living

during  the last one year or so has caused concern

among  the middle income group and hardship  among

the lower income group. This is further aggravated

by  the  declared increase in cost of  basic  food

commodities  such  as bread, and  basic  transport

services such as buses and taxis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am given to understand that the rise in the

cost of bread is due to an increase in the cost of

flour  in  the  world market.  This  is  something

beyond



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>



our  control.  But I would like  the  Minister  to

enlighten me on the actual increase in the cost of

flour, and whether it warrants an increase  of  as

much as five cents per loaf of bread.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Communications has declared that there will be a rise of five cents in bus fares per short trip, even for school children. He has explained that this rise is necessary in order that the bus service can be improved. At the same time, he has also announced the reorganisation of

the   bus   companies  so  as  to  improve   their

efficiency.  Increased  efficiency  brings   along

greater  profitability. The increase in bus  fares

seems  unnecessary at this stage. The  reorganised

system should be first tried out for one year  and

if  it  is shown that it is not profitable to  run

it,  then  the  increase in  bus  fares  would  be

justifiable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I want to bring up is the shortage

of  postmen  in the Postal Department. Our  postal

service  is  reputed  to  be  the  best  and  most

efficient  in  this region, and for  this  I  must

congratulate the Minister. With reference  to  the

budget  statement, it appears that  there  are  98

posts for clerical assistants and postmen. I  feel

that   unless   the  conditions  of  service   are

improved,  it  will not be easy to  recruit  staff

without  the  attraction of  better  salaries  and

better conditions in the private sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is the spate of resignations of

doctors,   particularly  the   more   senior   and

experienced ones, from Government service.  Whilst

I  am  not unaware that the private sector  offers

better financial gains for the specialist doctors,

I  do  not think that all of them resigned because

of  this.  I  feel  that if  their  conditions  of

service had been improved, some of them would have

remained in the service or would not have opted to

retire  at  the earliest available opportunity.  I

hope  that  the Minister for Health  will  try  to

improve  the conditions of service of the  doctors

and other professional officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth point is on the nursing service. I

understand  that the nurses have to do seven  days

of night duty



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>



at  a  stretch, and that they have to do this  one

week  of night duty once in five or six weeks.  It

would  appear to me that it is quite hard  on  the

nurses  having  to go on one whole week  of  night

duty.  I  would like to know if the  Minister  for

Health has considered reorganising the duty roster

of  the nurses so that they can do one night  duty

in five or six days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fifth and last point is on the improvement of

our   agriculture  and  husbandry.  Although   our

economic expansion has resulted in the building of

many  factories and new housing estates, we  still

have  plenty of land for the growing of vegetables

and  for  the  rearing  of pigs  and  fowls.  Most

probably  the Minister will say that there  is  no

land.  I  think Government can buy land  from  the

private  sector  so  that it  can  introduce  this

scheme.  In  last year's budget, I mentioned  this

matter but it has not been considered. I mentioned

earlier  about the rising cost of living  and,  of

course,  one  of the ways of keeping the  cost  of

living  down  is  to  increase the  production  of

essential foods and to ensure that they reach  the

consumers  at reasonable prices and  not  sold  at

high  prices because of the middlemen's  making  a

large  profit.  I  would  urge  the  Minister  for

National  Development  to look  closer  into  this

problem by allocating more land in the rural areas

for growing vegetables and for rearing of pigs and

fowls,  and at the same time to study the  methods

of   distribution  of  their  products  so  as  to

eliminate any possible racketeering.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Members of this House should not

forget   what   happened   during   the   Japanese

Occupation period. We must always be very careful.

Now we are preparing to store water in our island.

We  are also trying to arrange some storage places

for  our vegetables and other essential foodstuffs

in  case of trouble. God bless that there will  be

no trouble in the future.



<br><br>5.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

during the debate on the budget statement that has

been going



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>



on  this afternoon, I have been wondering, when it

came  to my turn, whether I would have to call  my

brief  address "What others say"! I hope, however,

that  I  can think of more interesting  angles  to

"What others say" than a broadcasting programme by

the same name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I first commend the Minister for Finance on

an  able, straightforward rendering of his account

to  Parliament.  The budget statement  reflects  a

balance  between  optimism  and  caution,  between

confidence  and  realism, and between  far-sighted

planning  and  attention to the  practical  ground

details of implementation. There is indeed much in

what  the  Finance Minister has said  that  should

give  rise to feelings of satisfaction. Yet  there

remains a fair bit over which reservations have to

be expressed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such aspect over which I cannot share the

Minister's  equanimity is what he has referred  to

as   the   "relative  stability  in  the   overall

(Consumer Price) index". This is where I  come  to

"What others say". I would like to reflect on  and

to  emphasize what has already been said. If  this

so-called relative stability means that there  has

not  been  a  general rise in the cost of  living,

especially in recent months, I am afraid thousands

of  Singaporeans will not agree, Singaporeans  who

go  to  the  market, to the barber,  who  buy  the

newspapers, who sit in the buses, who  go  for  an

occasional cup of coffee at the coffee-shop  round

the  corner, who buy stationery for the kids,  and

so on and so forth, including many Members of this

House,  especially  the Members  for  Thomson  and

Kampong  Kapor who have tabled questions  on  this

same topic. This budget has been described several

times  in this House as a painless one, and indeed

it  should be, considering the chafing the general

public  feel  as a result of the increase  in  the

prices of a horde of commodities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all this has not been reflected in the price

index, then I am afraid there is a credibility gap

between  the  price  index and the  experience  of

consumers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>



Or  it  may  be that the official price is  always

lower than the actual market price.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must therefore reflect a fairly common anxiety

that careful watch be kept over the situation. One

measure  that  comes soon to mind is the  possible

salutary   effect   of   a  consumers'   movement,

especially  in relation to commodity  price  rises

which  may  be unwarranted. I have been told  that

attempts   are  being  made  now  to  register   a

Consumers' Association. Would the Minister, at  an

appropriate time, consider giving some  assistance

to  such  an  association? I  would  imagine  that

initially  this association would be  in  need  of

premises   and  of  funds  for  full-time   staff.

However,   what   this  or   any   other   similar

association would need critically would be  strong

public  support. So perhaps the first  thing  that

could  be done should be the encouragement of  any

enterprise that seeks to educate consumers  as  to

the  role they may play in getting value for their

money.  I would also urge members to work  through

resident  associations and the like,  and  through

agencies  that have been suggested by  the  Member

for  Kampong Kapor towards generating consumer co-operation. In any case, it would be interesting to

note  what  the  Minister will  say  in  reply  to

questions  in the House about the rising  cost  of

living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allied to this feature of living costs is what

the   Minister  himself  has  alluded  to  as  "an

unprecedented  rise in the cost of new  buildings"

reflected  also in an escalation in the prices  of

property.  In view of this, it would  appear  that

thousands in the middle income group are in danger

of   being   excluded  from  our   property-owning

democracy.  I  think  it is  time  the  Government

looked  into  the  question of building  dwellings

that will be within the reach of purchase of those

who,  while  drawing  more than  $1,500  in  total

family  income  per month, do not  belong  to  the

ranks  of those who can blithely .pay phenomenally

high prices for houses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has rejected as a

suggestion  that Government should  go  into  this

area  of  building houses for those in the  middle

socio-economic   group.  He  has  suggested   that

perhaps  loans  could be increased  in  amount.  I

would say that if you borrow more, you would  have

to pay back more. I would prefer the Government to

go  into  this sector. The Jurong Town Corporation

is  itself going into this sector and I do not see

why  Government should not intensify their efforts

so  that people like the Member for Whampoa and me

could benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to turn to another aspect of the

budget statement. The Minister has remarked on the

necessity   for  export  orientation,  where   our

industries are concerned. And he has said that our

"traders  and  manufacturers should  make  greater

efforts  to penetrate more markets and  make  more

sales  in  higher  value goods. Greater  promotion

efforts,  including participation in trade  fairs,

would  help." I would venture to suggest that  the

best form of promotion lies in the quality of  the

goods  we produce. All other public relations  and

promotional   ventures  merely   follow.   It   is

important that we emphasise quality control in our

factories. It is true that a number of firms  have

voluntarily accepted the need for quality control.

Indeed  I believe that the Singapore Institute  of

Standards  and  Industrial  Research  has  already

awarded  45 quality control certificates,  and  an

additional  number of such awards is pending.  But

more encouragement and perhaps education has to be

given  to firms which may be a little deterred  by

the apparent cost of going in for quality control.

I say "apparent cost", for it would seem that with

proper and efficient introduction and operation of

quality   control,  production   would   be   more

economical in the long run. This would seem to tie

up  with  one of the functions which the  Minister

has  listed  as  contributing to a  high  economic

growth  rate,  namely (I am  quoting  one  of  the

conditions    listed   by   Mr    Okita)    "cost

consciousness  of  the business enterprises  about

their products".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I say that quality control has to be

further  encouraged.  I  would  like  to  ask  the

Minister  if he will offer tangible incentives  to

manufacturers   to   turn  to   quality   control.

[Interruption] That is one, certainly,  but  first

they  will have to be persuaded to go into quality

control in order to secure profits ultimately. So,

will  the  Minister offer incentives like allowing

an accelerated write-off on capital equipment used

for quality control. This has been referred to, if

I  recollect correctly, but not tangibly. And will

the  incentives include a tax allowance in respect

of  money  spent  in  other ways  besides  capital

equipment,  e.g., running costs  and  salaries  of

quality control personnel?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Government should set a

positive  example  of patronising  products  which

have   received  quality  certificates.  In   this

connection, if I may repeat what I have said at an

earlier  sitting, the sending out of instructional

circulars  is not enough. I think one has  to  see

that implementation is assured.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has referred to trade fairs and promotion of trade. Why not start a campaign to sell quality control here in Singapore? Why not have a mass campaign lasting over a reasonable period of time, so that the lesson could be driven home with some effect? If enough international

publicity  is given to this drive, and if  we  can

convey  the  impression that quality  control  and

reliability  of  products  constitute  matters  of

serious   national  concern,  then  our   overseas

promotion and participation in trade fairs will be

all the more effective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to touch briefly on one or

two  other points. The Minister has referred to  a

"fast  pace  of  investment  in  imported  capital

goods". I would like to refer to a recent analysis

in a local newspaper of why a leading manufacturer

of dressed leather has stopped production.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Conceicao, would you like to

tell  us  which newspaper it is, and when  it  was

published?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> This is the Business Times

(Commercial and Financial See-lion of the  Straits Times)  dated Monday, 15th March, 1971,  page  13,

and   the   article  is  headed,  "One  more   DBS

investment turns sour". It is interesting to  note

the  allegation that money was spent on  machinery

which  had  no particular purpose in  the  factory

right  up  to the demise of the firm. If  this  is

true,  the Minister will no doubt assure  us  that

greater  care  is  now  taken,  in  the  case   of

enterprises in which Government capital  is  sunk,

to  relate capital expenditure on machinery to the

need for such machinery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to remark that, now that

manufacturers' industries "comprise slightly  more

than  a  fifth of the national economic cake",  we

will  take augmented measures to ensure the health

and  safety of the workers in our industries. That

is  another form of quality control. We must  make

sure  that  our most important asset -  our  human

investment - is in the best possible shape.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Govindasamy, I believe you want

to clarify some point?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Yes, Sir, if you will now

permit  me.  I have never said that the Government

should  not go into housing for the middle  income

group.  My quarrel was that the incentive  to  buy

houses,  which  the  Government  offers  to  civil

servants, is no more an incentive, because housing

developers are charging too high. For the  benefit

of  the  Member for Katong, let me repeat  that  I

never mentioned that Government should not go into

building houses for the middle income group.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I am sorry if I was not so

good at hearing what others said just then!



<br><br>5.50p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in spite of a decline  in  revenue

from  Customs  duty  on liquor  and  tobacco,  and

notwithstanding   a  definite  drop   in   British

military spending by the end of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>



year, the 1971-72 budget does not propose any  new

taxation or any increase in existing taxes. It  is

quite  clear  that  this painless  budget  is  the

result of a series of far-sighted policies carried

out in the past few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Annual Budget Statement, the

Housing  and Development Board is going  to  build

more flats to house the people. I do not object to

the  proposal of building more flats, but what has

been troubling me is the manner in which flats are

allocated  and  maintained, and the negligence  on

the  part  of the Housing Board to look after  the

welfare of its tenants. I hope that those officers

in charge of the Board's flats do not get the idea

that  the place where the poor people stay  should

also look poor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many poor families are compelled to squeeze into

one-room  flats allocated to them  more  than  ten

years  ago.  Some  of  them  have  been  patiently

waiting for about three years for a chance to  get

an  alternative flat. It is not that they  do  not

like  a  change.  Most of these families  are  not

rich,  but they have a sense of propriety  in  not

wanting to sleep in the same room with their grown-up  children. Some of these families have  applied

for  a  change  on medical grounds, but  even  the

support  of a doctor's written advice attached  to

the  application  form  has  not  been  favourably

considered. Perhaps it has never occurred  to  the

Housing  Board officers that the size of a  family

may  increase in the course of time, or  that  the

children will grow up one day. We should not  wait

for  a  tragedy to occur, as was reported  in  the

press, before we dig out the old file in order  to

give  sympathetic  consideration,  with  a  guilty

conscience to an application.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board should play a

more  active  role  in  safeguarding  the  general

welfare   of  its  tenants.  Many  of  them   have

complained  to  the  Board's Area  Officers  about

noisy   and   troublesome  neighbours.   But   the

complainants have been told that the Housing Board

cannot  do  anything with these  culprits  because

they pay their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>



rents  regularly. Even the landlord of  a  private

house  knows how to deal with troublesome tenants.

If  the Housing Board cannot effectively deal with

noisy  and troublesome tenants, it is useless  for

the  Board to beautify the surroundings  with  all

sorts  of  flowers and trees, because the  tenants

will not be in the mood to enjoy or appreciate all

these beautiful surroundings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many young people have been seen gambling at staircases in the Housing Board flats. The Housing Board says that gambling is a police matter. Let me point out that the property belongs to the Housing Board and, as a property owner, it should play its part and help the police

wipe  out gambling inside its own housing estates.

it  is the duty of the Housing Board inspectors to

ensure   that  Housing  Board  flats  are  legally

occupied. They should also regard it as their duty

to   ensure  that  staircases  and  corridors  are

properly utilised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing Board should not only try to build

more  flats to house the people, but also try  its

best to look after the welfare of its tenants.



<br><br>5.55p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

during the last few days I went through the budget

statement  and the list of tables at  a  leisurely

pace,  and  I  must congratulate the Minister  for

Finance   on   having  acquitted   himself   quite

creditably    in    precision    and     accuracy.

Nevertheless,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  highlight

certain   issues   which  might  require   further

scrutiny,  and perhaps remedial measures  too.  If

the   Finance   Minister  will  take   them   into

consideration during the ensuing year, I  am  sure

they  will  contribute  to a better  understanding

between  the  Treasury on the  one  side  and  the

Backbenchers on the other. They will  also  create

an   atmosphere  more  conducive   to   a   better

appreciation of the salient features in the budget

among certain sections of the public. I would also

like  to  point out, with facts and  figures,  the

problems relating to labour,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>



especially if these issues have either a direct or

an  indirect bearing on the implementation of  the

budget proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year when I spoke on the budget

presented by the then Finance Minister,  I  raised several  points, and I feel extremely  obliged  to the  Treasury since they have considered them  and have also implemented certain proposals which they have considered to be pragmatic. I have in mind my reference  last year to industrial  accidents  and

the  necessity  to  take  sufficient  measures  to

reduce them to the minimum. In this respect, I  am

gratified to note that Government has responded to

my  suggestion  to  set  up an  Industrial  Safety

Council  at  a national level. I hope the  Council

will  sooner or later move in and propose measures

which  will bring the Republic into line with  the

western   countries  with  regard  to   industrial

safety.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year while analysing the total cargo

trade handled at our port, I did point out that it

might  increase at a faster pace if the  oil  boom

continued  and the manufacturing sector  responded

to  the  Finance Minister's treatment. I suggested

that  expansion  of  port  facilities  should   be

planned sufficiently early. Sir, subsequent events

have  proved  that  my analysis  of  the  expected

increase  in trade was quite correct. As a  matter

of  fact, it could be observed from Table IV  that

the   total  cargo  handled  increased  from  37.9

million  freight  tons  in 1969  to  42.1  million

freight tons in 1970. This is an increase  of  4.2

million  freight tons over a period of 12  months.

This  increase  can be further appreciated  if  we

compare the increase in 1969 over 1968, which  was

only 2.2 million freight tons. In other words, the

increase  in  1970 has doubled when compared  with

the  increase  in 1969. Mineral oil  continues  to

contribute the lion's share of cargo trade handled

at  our  port.  Nevertheless, the  1970  trade  in

general cargo has shown an upward trend, which  is

quite welcome. I have no hesitation in saying that

further encouragement to the manufacturing  sector

will  accelerate the growth of the  general  cargo

trade at a faster pace.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, within a decade the total trade handled at

our  port has increased from 14.89 million freight

tons  in  1960  to 42.16 million freight  tons  in

1970.  This,  in fact, amounts to an  increase  of

27.27   million  freight  tons  over  the  decade.

Perhaps our port needs further expansion, and  the

staff there might require training to keep up with

the  pace. I am eager to know whether the  Finance

Minister  will consider it necessary  to  allocate

more  funds to expand the port facilities, in view

of  the considerable rise in the cargo handled  at

our port.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister has also made a reference to

the balance of payments position. I am in complete

agreement  with the Member for Whampoa that  money

spent in importing capital investment is not a bad

thing. Sir, I fully appreciate that those who  are

not well equipped with the relevant data would  be

perturbed  by  the trade deficits and  those  with

questionable  motives would not hesitate  to  grab

the   opportunity  to  run  down   the   republic,

especially when they are not too pleased with  our

economic progress. They would not hesitate,  in  a

quixotic manner, to refer gleefully to the alleged

chronic   deficits  in  the  balance  of  payments

position.  I  am  very pleased to  note  that  the

Finance Minister has ably demonstrated that  there

is  no  necessity to feel perturbed at our  rather

large trade deficits, since he has proved that the

buoyancy  in  imports is mainly due to  the  rapid

pace  of  investment  in imported  capital  goods.

Further,  a substantial inflow of foreign capital,

and   an   appreciable  increase  in  our  foreign

reserves  along with the efforts made during  last

year   in  improving  our  markets  abroad,  would

indicate  to an impartial observer that  there  is

absolutely no necessity for us to view our balance

of  payments  position with apprehension.  On  the

other  hand, there is every reason to be satisfied

with our past performance and be confident of  our

future prospects.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to our export earnings, tourism

appears  to  have  contributed  substantially.   I

should congratulate the Tourist Promotion Board on

its   yeoman  service  in  increasing  our  dollar

earning  capacity.  Sir, may I  also  analyse  the

figures in Table IV and relate them to the Finance

Minister's  reference to the  economic  activities

with regard to tourism? In this respect, I confess

I am a little confused by the discrepancies in the

statistics  provided  by the Finance  Minister  in

Table IV and in his budget statement. According to

him,  the  passenger  traffic  to  Singapore   was

306,000  in 1965, but Table IV indicates  that  in

1965  the total figure for passenger arrivals  was

267,322.  I  really do not know  which  figure  is

correct.  These figures are important  since  they

will  enable  us to know to what extent  passenger

traffic  has increased during the period  1965  to

1970.   If   the  budget  statement  figures   are

accurate,  then  there has  been  an  increase  of

410,139 in, passenger traffic during 1965 to 1970.

On  the  other hand, if we turn to the table,  the

increase  in passenger traffic should  be  448,817

for  the same period.. In other words, there is  a

discrepancy in the statistics, and the  difference

between  the two increases appears to  be  38,678,

which is quite substantial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have no hesitation in, agreeing with

the   Finance  Minister  that  in  1970   we   had

approximately  25 per cent more visitors  than  in

1969 and the occupancy rate of 70 per cent for the

tourist hotels augurs well for our tourist  trade.

But  of late I have read in the press extracts  of

speeches of responsible leaders to the effect that

we have over-built hotels, and that we may have to

call  a  halt. Hence, I will very much, appreciate

it if the Finance Minister can state officially to

what   extent  we  can  give  credence   to   such

statements appearing in the press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to comment on the Finance

Minister's  reference to the textile industry  and

its  contribution to our export trade. I have gone

through in detail his reference to the United



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>



States  economy, the reintroduction of the  Mill's

Bill   and  the  position  of  Japan.  After   the

presentation of this budget we also  read  in  the

press President Nixon's statement in this respect.

Taking  into account the frequent changes  in  the

world textile trade, I wonder whether it might  be

necessary  for  us  to take  a  number  of  policy

measures  so  that the Singapore textile  industry

might not be caught unawares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that with a substantial increase in

production and consumption in synthetic fibres  in

world trade, Singapore might find it necessary  to

lay  more emphasis on the development of synthetic

fabric.  While  recognising  the  fact  that   the

imposition  of restrictions, or rather  the  quota

system  as  introduced by others might affect  our

export  trade, it would be perhaps more  pragmatic

to  venture into the possibility of entering  into

hitherto  unexplored markets and conduct immediate

bilateral    talks   simultaneously    with    our

traditional consumer countries in the west for  an

increase in export.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The textile industry is labour intensive; hence

we  have to work very fast so that there might not

be  any unemployment due to import restrictions by

other  countries. I do not think such a  situation

will  arise  since in the past the Government  has

assessed  the  situation far in advance,  although

not long ago the announcement of the British quota

restriction did catch us unawares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the Ministry of Education, I am

pleased  to note that with regard to the provision

of  expenditure, there has been an increase to the

tune of 9.8 per cent. It is quite substantial but,

at the same time, I would be failing in my duty if

I  did  not  point out certain problems which  are

likely  to  crop up during 1971 to 1972  when  the

Ministry intends to recruit more graduate teachers

in  order  to improve the standard of teaching  in

the   secondary   schools.  The  rapid   pace   of

industrialisation    has    created     employment

opportunities   for   our  young   graduates   and

emoluments paid in the private



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>



sector are more attractive than those provided  by

the   Education  Ministry.  Hence,  it  might   be

difficult  to fill the vacancies unless incentives

are created by the Education Ministry. It could be

in  the  form  of adjustments in total emoluments,

better    promotional   prospects   and    further

opportunity for oversea training programmes.  This

might result in further allocation of funds to the

Education  Ministry  if  the  main  objective   of

recruiting more graduate teachers in 1971-72 is to

be achieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at the very outset of my speech I did mention that I shall make pointed reference to problems pertaining to labour and, if possible, to highlight the issues which hitherto might not have received sufficient attention. I have no intention to cross swords with the Treasury bench

with  regard  to  the  quantum  of  funds  to   be

allocated  to  the  Labour  Ministry.  I  am  more

concerned with policy issues and labour laws since

there  is a necessity to analyse them with a  view

to  assessing their impact, positive or  negative,

on    the   successful   implementation   of   the

Government's   industrialisation  programme   with

adequate  emphasis  on human factors.  As  we  are

aware, our Prime Minister has often stressed  that

human    endeavour   should   receive   sufficient

attention  in any economic development  programme.

In this connection, I would like to point out that

the measures taken by the Government are bound  to

be  more  effective  and  the  Finance  Minister's

approach towards development expenditure would  be

more  fruitful if certain measures  are  taken  to

bring  some  of the labour laws in line  with  our

immediate requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, I have in mind the

Employment Act, and although by and large it might

be  a  necessity  within the overall  strategy  of

speedy economic development, of course it must  be

done  within the framework of healthy  labour  and

capital  relations. I have in mind the  fact  that

certain amendments are necessary, especially  with

regard  to  section  46  of  the  Employment   Act

relating to bonus



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



payment.  The Act stipulates bonus as one  month's

salary,  although it does not prevent any employer

from  paying more on a voluntary basis.  You  will

agree  with me, Sir, that an employer is not  much

concerned  with  paying  more  bonus,  since   the

concept  of  paying bonus is tied up  with  profit

sharing  or profitability. The only item  that  an

employer is really concerned with is the  cost  of

wages  bill. It is not so much the bonus,  because

you  do not pay bonus if you do not make a profit.

But  in  the  case of wages, whether  an  employer

makes  a profit or not, every year he is committed

to paying wages to the workers. Therefore, instead

of  making  a limitation on the bonus  payment,  I

would  rather  prefer that the union  should  take

this  point  into  consideration;  that  is,   the

members of a union should not revise their  salary

scale  whenever  a  collective agreement  expires,

because  in  the collective agreement the  `salary

scale  is projected to a period of, say, 12 years,

and  if  one has not reached the top of the scale,

there  is no necessity to revise the whole  salary

scale.  There  is  already an automatic  increment

every  year. If this can be accepted, I  think  we

will  be  able  to  attract  more  investors  into

Singapore.  But  certainly the  bonus  restriction

will  not  really cause the employer  to  be  much

concerned  about  it. I would  advocate  that  the

Government take this into consideration and remove

the  bonus  restriction as  quickly  as  possible.

Notwithstanding the restrictive provision of  this

section,  many employers continue to  pay  a  much

higher  bonus than what is provided  in  the  Act.

This proves that my statement is correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the passage of the Employment Act in 1968,

employers  who can afford to pay a bonus  continue

to  pay  more than one month's bonus.  That  shows

that the Act does not restrict the employer on the

question  of  bonus payment. It  depends  on  `the

capacity  to  pay,  and the profit-sharing  motive

apparently   dominates  the   approach   of   both

management  and labour on the bonus issue.  Hence,

the original fear which prompted the law-maker  to

include  section  46  in the  Act  appears  to  be

unwarranted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



except  for the fact that this particular  section

can  be  abused by a minority of well  established

employers in denying labour its legitimate rights.

For   example,  I  think  all  Members  must  have

received  copies  of a letter from  the  Singapore

Bank Employees' Union informing them how the banks

took advantage of section 46 of the Employment Act

to  coerce  the  Union into signing  a  collective

agreement. I feel very strongly that we should  do

something about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to refer to Table VA on the

Labour Department's figures. The Labour Department

figures indicate that the number of man-days  lost

in  strikes  in  1970 has been the lowest  over  a

period  of  10 years. Hence, there is no necessity

to   have  second  thoughts  that  if  the   bonus

limitation  is removed, there would be trouble.  I

do  not  think  so. Since within a period  of  ten

years,  the number of man-days lost in strikes  in

1970  has been the lowest, we should not be unduly

afraid of that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also referred in his budget statement to the expected complete British withdrawal and the possible retrenchment of 15,000 civilian employees in the immediate future. I feel that the majority of the workers cannot be re-trained or re-moulded to fit into our modern industries, since most of them belong to the 40-50

age  group.  Hence I might suggest that  with  the

assistance  of the workers, the N.T.U.C, and  the

Government, joint ventures could be established on

a  co-operative  basis with the  capital  provided

from  the provident fund and retrenchment benefits

of  the  workers and also with adequate assistance

from  the Government. The N.T.U.C, could take  the

initiative in setting up such enterprises provided

the Government could give the green light.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure that we need not have to refer to the pages of Paul Sweezy to know more about the approach towards the welfare state. As it stands now, our Gross Domestic Product is one of the highest in this region. Under such circumstances, it is only natural that as far as

possible  social amenities should be  provided  at

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



expense of the state so that the man in the street

will  derive the maximum benefit. But it is rather

strange  that  during the past few years,  as  the

G.D.P, bounces  forward, existing  free  benefits

have  been  slowly  and steadily  removed  by  the

state.  I  have in mind the disappearance  of  the

free medical benefits both for outpatients and in-patients  which  existed a few  years  ago.  Today

admission into a 3rd class ward costs S  1.50  per

day,  while SI is charged on the individual if  he

derives medical benefits as an outpatient. Sir, in

keeping with our welfare state concept and  taking

into  account  the  substantial  increase  in  the

G.D.P., the state should abolish medical fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I have only to add that in the turbulent

political  and  economic situation  in  South-east

Asia our young republic continues to surge forward

not  only  with political stability but also  with

sufficient economic nourishment as provided by the

Finance  Minister, who deserves appreciation  from

all sections of this House for presenting a budget

which contains no negative punches or pulls but  a

positive  thrust  which explicitly  expresses  the

desire  and determination to move forward  without

undue haste or hesitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to associate myself with the

sentiments   expressed   by   my   colleagues   in

supporting the budget.



<br><br>6.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir.

Members  will  recall  that  the  day  after   the

Minister  for Finance presented his maiden  budget

statement in: this Chamber, he received a  lot  of

praise and all-round applause from the tycoons  of

the  various  Chambers of Commerce,  the  business

community  and  the  big industrialists.  But  the

grouses  and  the views of the man in the  street,

the  wage  earners, the taxi drivers, the  hawkers

and  the workers still await a sympathetic hearing

from  the Minister for Finance. I am sure  Members

have already heard enough of this and perhaps more

will   be   spelt   out  by  my  colleagues,   the

Backbenchers, later on in this House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I am speaking mainly on the acute problems

which  are  facing my constituency. In the  budget

statement  of  the  Minister  for  Finance,  which

indeed  is  remarkable  and  impressive  for   its

contents  and length, I fail to see any  immediate

plan   being  mentioned  to  offset  the  economic

problems and hardships arising out of the  British

withdrawal  at  the end of the  year  from  R.A.F.

Changi  which  is the last leg of  the  operation.

Members will appreciate my deep concern over  this

matter.  The largest Royal Air Force  base  is  at

Changi  where  nearly 5,000 employees  earn  their

living  and where the livelihood of many thousands

of people of all walks of life will be immediately

and indirectly affected. Sir, the vacuum that will

be created by the British withdrawal, with nothing

to   cushion  the  ill  effects,  will  plunge  my

constituents into hardship and set them back. I am

afraid  it  may even be a source of social  unrest

and,  because  of its contagious  nature,  it  may

infect  other  areas  in the  republic.  Sir,  the

people who will be adversely affected are not only

those  citizens who .are directly employed by  the

British  services in Changi, but also others  like

domestic   servants,   petty   traders,   hawkers,

shopkeepers, taxi drivers, gardeners and a host of

others  who  in one way or another depend  on  the

British services' spending to earn their living at

present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reliably informed that more than 250

civilian  employees  and their  families  who  are

accommodated  in R.A.F, quarters  at  Changi  have

been  warned  recently that they  have  to  vacate

their quarters within two months of their becoming

redundant.  It  is  also gathered  that  civilians

affected  by  redundancy are  required  to  vacate

their premises even though the houses are going to

remain  vacant thereafter. Sir, these  unfortunate

employees will suddenly find themselves confronted

with  a  multitude  of problems  which  cannot  be

solved  by  their  own  efforts  alone,  and   the

apparent  absence  of Government  assistance  will

leave  them  in  a completely hopeless  situation.

True,  there  are talks of converting  Changi  Air

Base into an industrial complex whereby



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>



these people could be absorbed into industry.  But

this conversion can only be done after the British

have left. What happens in the interim?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disturbing silence on this matter in the

Minister's  statement raises  doubts  whether  the

much talked about conversion will actually come to

fruition. If the Government has devised plans  for

the  conversion of Changi Airport, why should  the

Minister  not  spell them Out  in  his  statement?

After all, to feed many thousands of hungry mouths

is  no  small  matter; that could not  be  lightly

ignored.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These civilian employees are unable to rent

private  estate  houses because these  are  beyond

their  financial  capacity. Still  less  can  they

afford  to buy their own houses as they are unable

to  draw their gratuity in a lump sum. Housing and

Development Board flats would be ideal  for  them,

but  there are none in Changi Constituency at  the

moment.  The  problem  of accommodation  is  their

biggest  worry:  it is haunting these  unfortunate

people.  It is more serious than being unemployed,

because at least they have their gratuity to  fall

back  on  for a hand-to-mouth existence till  they

find other alternative employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The education of the children of these

unfortunate  people  poses  yet  another   anxious

problem. There are bound to be adverse effects  on

the children's education. If they are to move from

Changi to other parts of Singapore, you will agree

with   me-  Mr  Sneaker,  Sir,  that  the  sudden

dislocation  is  bound to disrupt their  education

even if they are lucky enough to get admission  to

schools  in their new areas of residence. In  this

connection, I wish to know if it would be possible

to   leave  R.A.F, civilian  employees  in  their

present    accommodation    even    after    their

retrenchment  until alternative  accommodation  is

available to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is nearly four years now since the then

British Labour Government announced the withdrawal

of  British  forces from the republic. Surely  our

Government  must have plans concerning Changi  Air

Base which can be implemented



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>



immediately  so as to solve  the  economic

depression   in  Changi  Constituency.   Can   the

Minister enlighten this House on what solutions he

has  to relieve the people of their anxiety  about

their future.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise to join other Members on this side  of

the  House in commending the Minister for  Finance

on  presenting  his first budget speech  which  is

sensible, balanced and most welcome to the public.

It  is a painless budget without the necessity  of

introducing  new taxes or increasing the  existing

rates of taxes. As the Minister has mentioned, the

accelerated run-down of the British military bases

will commence this month, and will be completed by

the end of the year. This operation will result in

a loss of British military spending to the tune of

$300  million, yet the Minister does  not  foresee

any  necessity for additional taxation. This bears

testimony  to our healthy economic growth  and  to

the  success  of our industrialisation  programme.

This  happy state of our economy has been  brought

about  in a large measure, as reflected in the  15

per cent growth, by the wise and bold planning  of

his  predecessor, Dr Gob Keng Swee,  and  by  the

Minister's  own active and vigorous  execution  of

this  economic policy when he was the Chairman  of

the  Economic Development Board, and at  the  same

time  by the contributions made by the disciplined

and  very adaptable workers of our republic  under

the able leadership of the N.T.U.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I remind the Members for Telok Blangah and

Moulmein  that  not  every  employer  is   a   bad

employer. They have transformed the destiny of the

republic  from  one of utter gloom and  pessimism,

soon  after separation from a neighbouring country

to  one of healthy optimism and growing affluence,

which  promises a more equitable and just  society

with  equal  opportunities for  all,  and  with  a

higher  standard of living than at present,  which

is  already one of the highest in Asia in the `80s

given  political  stability and security  in  this

region. But with all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>



this  optimism  and  accelerated  growth  on   the

economic front, I wish to make one observation  in

regard   to   technical  training  and   technical

education in that part of his budget statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget for 1971-72 presented by the Minister is to promote greater growth in strong and export-oriented industries. To achieve this objective, every ingenious fiscal inducement is being thought out and legislated to attract large foreign enterprises which enjoy prestige in international markets like the giant corporations of Rollei,

Rockwell,  Plessey, Philips, etc. As a  result  of

the expanding economy and rapid industrialisation,

there are already ominous signs of a creeping cost

of  living and an escalation of the wage rates  of

semi-skilled  and skilled men in the manufacturing

industries. Unless measures are brought  forth  to

arrest this inflationary trend, the republic  will

soon  become priced out of the export  markets  in

the  services  we can offer. This trend  has  been

brought  about  by  the great  influx  of  foreign

management  and technical personnel  belonging  to

these  enterprises,  but these foreign  managerial

and  technical personnel are most welcome  to  our

republic  in imparting the technical know-how  and

expertise  to  their local counterparts  in  these

industries. Unfortunately, for the majority of us,

they have also large spending powers which have  a

direct   bearing  on  our  commodity  and  service

prices.  At  the  same  time,  there  is  a  great

shortage of skilled manpower, resulting in too few

men  chasing too many jobs. Although every  effort

is  being  exerted  to create  a  more  favourable

investment  climate, a shift of  greater  emphasis

has  been  necessary  on a new educational  policy

from  one  of  academic type  to  one  of  a  more

technical  bias  by training,  and  to  produce  a

greater number of tertiary and technician echelons

of  skilled personnel. But are we doing enough  in

the  technical education field, as industries  and

national services are competing for the output  of

tertiary  technician and vocational  graduates?  I

concur with the view of the Member for Whampoa for

a  co-ordinating manpower body to be set  up.  The

time is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>



ripe  and  necessary to establish  a  high-powered

national  central council to co-ordinate and  plan

the  manpower requirements of our republic so that

the  input  has a direct bearing on the output  of

the graduates. One can see from the estimates that

on  a tertiary level we have a situation where the

University  of  Singapore and the Polytechnic  are

under the Ministry of Science and Technology,  and

Nanyang University and Ngee Ann College under  the

Ministry  of  Education. Unless quick  and  urgent

steps  are  taken to centralise the  co-ordination

and  training  of skilled manpower, both  for  the

industries  and the military requirements  at  all

levels,  the republic may be caught on  the  wrong

foot  with all foreign investments coming in on  a

large scale, as predicted by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has mentioned in his speech that at the

beginning   of  1971  the  total  direct   foreign

investments in manufacturing industries will total

$1,700  million,  and will be in  full  production

from two to five years. Assuming an investment  of

$30,000  will create one job for one  worker,  the

total number of people who will find employment in

these  newly-created  industries  alone  will   be

56,000.  What  will  be the requirements  for  the

other sectors? From the figures obtained from  the

Year  Book of Statistics, 1969, the University  of

Singapore  and  Nanyang University produced  1,639

graduates at tertiary level in 1969, whereas  only

593  graduates at technician level passed out from

the  Polytechnic and Ngee Ann College in the  same

year. The technical and vocational institutes  and

the  Industrial Training Centre turned  out  4,129

graduates between the ages of 17 and 19  at  craft

and trade levels. As soon as they passed out, they

will  have  to be taken into national service.  In

advanced  and  developed countries, the  ratio  of

tertiary  to technician and craft level is  1:  5:

25, whereas in our case it is 3: 1: 7. Although  I

am aware that from now onwards national servicemen

who  have undergone two years of full-time service

will be discharged, I propose to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>







Government that before they are discharged  on  to

the  employment market, they should  be  given  at

least   six   months   of   industrial   training.

Therefore,  I  cannot  see  how  we  can   prevent

crimping   on  a  large  scale  in  the   existing

industries,  resulting  in inflated  salaries  and

wage rates to the detriment of the economy of  the

republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not want to sound an alarmist but I must warn this House that quick and concrete measures must be adopted to solve this manpower problem if we are to face our future with optimism, as outlined by the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to our progress and economic growth in

the  years to come is our human asset, which  will

play  the most important role in making our nation

a  viable,  independent and sovereign  country  in

which both men and women must play their effective

contributory part. Therefore, in this context,  we

must also induce more of our female population  to

take  up  skills and work side by side with  their

menfolk not only in the light industries but  also

in  the  heavy  metal industries as they  are  not

liable for national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the 1971-72 budget.



<br><br>6.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  people of Singapore are happy  to  know

that there will be no increase of any tax for  the

financial  year  1st April, 1971, to  31st  March,

1972, as announced by the Minister for Finance  in

his  annual budget statement in Parliament on  the

8th  of  March,  1971.  Since  there  will  be  no

increase of any tax for this period, it will  give

employers   the   opportunity  to   expand   their

industries  and make more profit. It will  attract

more  investors  to come here and will  definitely

create more jobs for the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the present industrial boom and several

employers making good profit, I think the time has

come for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>



amendments to be made to the Employment Act  which

was  implemented in 1968, particularly  about  the

bonus  payment. I would like to join other Members

in  this House and strongly request the Government

to  remove  the  limitation on the negotiation  of

bonus  payment  to  one month only.  I  think  the

bigger the profit, the bigger should be the bonus.

The workers should be given the right to negotiate

for a bigger bonus with their employers so long as

they have the capacity to pay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, prices of new and existing houses have been

rising  fantastically during the last five  years.

For  example,  the  price of a terrace  house  was

about  $30,000 five years ago, but if you  buy  it

now you will have to pay $55,000 for it. Prices of

houses  have  gone  up so high that  workers  find

difficulty  purchasing  them.  Luckily,  they  can

purchase Housing and Development Board flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the workers find difficulty in buying

houses  from the private sector on account of  the

fantastically high prices, may I suggest that  the

Government allow the family combined salary  limit

to  be $1,700 to purchase H.D.B, flats rather than

the present limit of $1,200?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order not to allow the private sector to keep

on  building houses and making fantastic  profits,

may  I suggest to the Government to build as  many

H.D.B, flats as possible and to limit the building

of  houses  by  the  private sector?  The  private

sector is the main cause of the fantastic rise  in

the prices of houses built by them. We must put an

immediate stop to it without further delay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad the Minister for Finance in his annual

budget  statement says that he is keeping a  close

watch on the unprecedented rise in the cost of new

buildings  and the value of the existing buildings

so as to prevent the cost increase from developing

to serious proportions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully agree with the views expressed by

other   Members  of  this  House  on  the  present

increase of prices



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>



of   various  commodities,  and  I  support  their

proposal that action should be taken to put a stop

to  it. I also request the Minister for Finance to

put a stop to the arbitrary increase of prices  of

commodities by business associations, for example,

the  increase in the price of bread by the  Bakers

Association  recently.  If the  Government  allows

these  business  associations  to  increase  their

prices arbitrarily, then the Government should not

stop  the  unions  from demanding  arbitrarily  an

increase  in  wages and bonus. Unfortunately,  the

unions  are  not  allowed to do  so.  Workers  are

requested to endure all the restrictions  enforced

in the Employment Act, for example, longer working

hours,  a  lesser  number of  public  holidays,  a

limitation  to  the annual bonus  to  one  month's

salary only, etc. But there are no restrictions on

the  employers and the business associations. They

can  increase  the  prices  of  their  commodities

arbitrarily.   This  is  most   unfair   and   the

Government must stop this squeezing on the public.

The  workers,  especially those with lower  wages,

are  suffering terribly. The Government must  stop

pampering  the employers too much,  and  pay  more

attention to the workers and relieve their  plight

as soon as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the budgetpresented by the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>6.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise to thank the Minister for Finance  for

his  budget  speech in Parliament  on  8th  March,

1971.  However,  I  would like  to  speak  on  one

subject,  appearing  in  col.  574  [Hansard,  8th

March,  1971], in connection with workers' safety,

as  my colleagues in the N.T.U.C, have dealt  with

the  other  aspects of Government policy  for  the

financial year 1971-72.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that Government has at

long last awakened to the fact that the number  of

industrial   accidents  resulting  in   death   or

permanent disablement has reached alarmingly  high

proportions. In this respect, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>



Government's  decision to strengthen  the  Factory

Inspectorate  in the Ministry of  Labour  is  most

welcome. While it is gratifying to learn that  the

Government  has  taken  a positive  step  at  this

juncture, it cannot be complimented at all on  its

utter  lack  of  foresight in providing  effective

legislation  to protect the safety  of  industrial

workers. Nor can it be complimented on its lack of

concern  and interest in enforcing the rudimentary

provisions  of the Factories Ordinance to  protect

the  safety of industrial workers. Nor can  it  be

complimented  on having shown any  awareness  that

the   number  of  industrial  accidents  has  been

increasing from month to month, from year to year,

in   the  last  ten  years  since  we  began   our

industrialisation programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will remember that on the 23rd December,

1969,  I  asked in this House [Hansard,  Vol.  29,

cols. 242-6] whether the Government would consider

increasing  the staff in the Factory  Inspectorate

as  a  matter of urgency and importance.  But  the

Government  was  not  too  responsive  then.  Time

passed and the situation became worse. During last

year's budget debate I had occasion on 20th March,

1970  [Hansard, Vol. 29, cols. 834-8], to propose,

among other things, firstly, to increase the staff

in  the Factory Inspectorate; secondly, to upgrade

the   skill   of  inspectors  to  enforce   safety

provisions;  and,  thirdly, to introduce  stronger

legislative  measures to promote  the  safety  and

health of workers. I am somewhat pleased that  the

strength  of  the  Factory Inspectorate  has  been

increased  by  30  last year, under  Establishment

Warrant, to meet the urgency of the situation. But

I  must  caution that it is hardly  reasonable  to

expect  dramatic  improvements  immediately   just

because   of  the  recruitment  of  six   untested

technical officers, 16 technicians, and others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is need for an overall change of attitude

from  all quarters in industry. Not only is  there

ignorance and apathy among the workers, but  there

is also utter disregard among employers in general

to protect the safety of workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>



What  is  most important in the month of employers

is  the  attainment of low cost and  high  profits

carried   out   in   the  name  of   productivity,

disregarding the safety of workers in  the  course

of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A typical example of, the general attitude of

employers can be cited from what happened  at  the

Mandarin  Hotel.  When the first  building  worker

fell  into  .a lift-well and died, the  contractor

was  advised  to  supply his workers  with  safety

belts. I do not know who advised him - it could be

the  Factory  Inspectorate - but  he  did  not  do

anything.  Then another worker fell and died.  But

still  no  safety belts were supplied. And  it  is

shocking  to learn that safety belts were supplied

only one day before the Coroner's inquiry into the

death of the second worker. The verdict was "Death

by   misadventure".  The  Coroner  said,  "Workers

working  in  such hazardous situations  should  be

provided with safety measures, and it is up to the

proper  authorities to enforce it." Sir, I believe

that  a  dozen  men working at this  hotel  downed

their tools when the second man fell to his death.

I  have  always thought that requests  for  safety

measures would be reasonable to ensure the  safety

of  lives.  When  life is at stake,  there  is  no

compromise.  What happened at the  Mandarin  Hotel

was not death by misadventure of accidental death,

but  homicide  -  a  clear  and  simple  case   of

homicide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The N.T.U.C, is embarking on a programme to

instil  safety  consciousness among  workers.  The

Government  on its part must give top priority  to

its  social policy of providing a better and safer

working  environment. The N.T.U.C, was  extremely

glad  that Dr Goh Keng Swee, the former  Minister

for   Finance,   creator  and  promoter   of   our

industrialisation  programme,  had  proposed   the

establishment  of  a Council of Industrial  Safety

and  Health. We welcome it and we agree  with  the

ever-wise Minister that the Council should not  be

just  another  forum. The N.T.U.C, has  taken  the

initiative to set in motion the final establishment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>



of  such a council. It has obtained  general

agreement  on  the  terms  of  reference  of  this

council. Besides the N.T.U.C., notably the  Jurong

Town  Corporation, the National Employers Council,

the  National  Productivity Centre,  the  National

Safety  First  Council,  the  Singapore  Employers

Federation,     the    Singapore     Manufacturers

Association,  the  Singapore Medical  Association,

the   Society   for  Occupational  Medicine,   the

University  of Singapore (Faculty of Engineering),

the  Institution of Engineers, and the  Department

of  Social  Medicine  and  Public  Health  of  the

University  of  Singapore, have all subscribed  to

the  principles  laid down in  the  memorandum  of

agreement. It is important to note that  never  in

the  past  have  all these organisations  come  to

general  agreement and resolution to  undertake  a

project  of  the  utmost  social  importance.  The

Director of the National Productivity Centre,  who

chaired  the  press conference  before  the  joint

memorandum  of  agreement  was  presented  to  the

Minister for Foreign Affairs and Labour, said that

there  was full, free and frank discussion on  the

feasibility of establishing an advisory  committee

on  industrial  safety and  health  and  that  the

report would be of benefit to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During last year's budget debate I drew the

attention  of the House to the number  of  workers

who  were  injured  and disabled  permanently,  or

whose  injuries had resulted in death. I think  it

is  worth while to quote these figures, so that it

can  register in our minds once and  for  all  the

seriousness of the situation. The number of  fatal

and  permanent  disablement cases for  the  period

1960-69 were:

<pre>

             1960      242

             1961      389

             1962      480

             1963      559

             1964      533

             1965      637

             1966      660

             1967      659

             1968      804

             1969      864

</pre>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



For  1970, I believe the average number  of  fatal

cases is not less than 12 a month. I do hope  that

each  and every Member in this House will  resolve

to  support whatever safety programme there is  to

ensure  the  safety  and  health  of  our  working

population.   I   wish   to   say   this   because

traditionally  Parliament has not  been  concerned

with   the   workers'  safety.  I   have   checked

Parliamentary records for the last ten years,  and

I do not think I am wrong here. The ball is in the

hands of the Government!



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Feet.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> And at the feet of

Parliament!



<br><br>6.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Ramaswamy (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, we are very glad to have a Budget for 1971-72

without  any  new  taxes or any  increase  in  the

existing  tax  rates. We are also  very  happy  to

learn from our Finance Minister that we have had a

favourable  year. This is, of course, evidence  of

our  political  stability, good  leadership,  able

administration, honest government, and  confidence

in  our  future.  We have solved our  unemployment

problem,  and we are now faced with a shortage  of

labour.  We  have heard from our Finance  Minister

that  the  Government intend to take  measures  to

meet  this  problem, and I am sure  this  shortage

will also be overcome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his budget statement our Finance Minister said

that  the  domestic  price level  remained  fairly

stable.  The housing sub-index moved up  by  about

two  percentage points because of a tax levied  on

Public Utility Board bills. The Minister said that

the  prices  of  rice and other cereals  showed  a

decline;  probably so. But we know that the  price

of  bread  has gone up. So has the price of  sugar

and  other necessities. The P.U.B, bills have gone

up because of the increase in the rates of charges

and  because of the new tax. Bus fares will go  up

from  next  month. There will be no more five-cent

bus  fare, and no more 25-cent fare from  terminus

to  terminus.  In sympathy with the  rise  in  bus

fares,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>



taxi  fares  have  gone  up  too.  The  price   of

vegetables  has  gone up. The  price  of  imported

foodstuffs  has  also gone up. In  short,  if  our

Finance Minister says that the price index shows a

decline, the fact is otherwise. The basic cost  of

living has gone up. The lower income group is  the

lot that suffers most. This is not a healthy sign,

and  if the Minister agrees with me that it is not

healthy, then what measures does he intend to take

to  counter the increases in the prices  of  basic

consumer goods and the rise in the cost of living?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I see that the proposed Science Centre is to

be  built  at Jurong. As it is, there is  a  heavy

shortage of land for our industries in Jurong.  If

the  University of Singapore is to be  resited  at

Kent  Ridge, why not build the Science  Centre  at

Kent  Ridge  too?  We  can then  have  one  single

administration for both institutions and so reduce

costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next I want to speak on the drainage and flood

alleviation  system. I see that the  drainage  and

flood  alleviation schemes will cost $4.5  million

in  the  coming  year. I also see that  the  first

phase  of the Bukit Timah Flood Alleviation Scheme

will  be  completed this year. Several  other  new

drainage  systems proposed include Geylang  Serai,

Toa  Payoh and Telok Blangah. Potong Pasir is  one

of  the worst flood-prone areas. Braddell Road was

flooded  up  to  10 feet during the December  1969

flood.  All  the kampong houses were under  water.

Even now whenever there are two or three inches of

rain,  the  area is flooded and there are  two  to

three  feet  of water. I do not see  Potong  Pasir

included  in any of the flood alleviation schemes.

Does  the Toa Payoh scheme include the improvement

of   the  drainage  of  Sungei  Kallang  and   the

alleviation  of flood? Can the Minister  elucidate

on this point?



<br><br>7.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I am very appreciative of the  great

interest  shown  by all Members in  the  financial

policy of Singapore. I would like to thank



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>



them not only for the kind remarks which have been

addressed  to  me, but also for the remarks  which

are critical, though in most cases constructive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am embarrassed by the riches - I think there is

a  French  phrase for it: embarras de richesses  -

which  have  been  disclosed  by  the  volume   of

information and comments which have come from  the

House.  If  I  do  not answer  all  the  questions

raised,  it  is  because, in  reading  through  my

notes,  I  have  found  that  some  of  them   are

indecipherable.  I  shall,  therefore,  take   the

opportunity of reading the Hansard when  it  comes

out and give the most thoughtful consideration  to

all  the suggestions made. I therefore propose  to

answer only the main points brought up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think many of the suggestions, questions and

criticisms  have  been  answered  by   the   other

speakers, so that some of the load has been  taken

off  me. One of the main points appears to be  the

rise in the cost of living. I shall deal with this

in  some detail, and also with the workers and the

conditions under which they are placed. There  was

also  some  comment  on the  protection  of  local

entrepreneurs  and the encouragement  of  national

capital.  Criticism was levelled at  tourism,  and

some   questions  were  raised  on   whether   the

investments which are being made on tourism would,

in  fact, bring an adequate return. There were, of

course, other general remarks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the main policy, I sense that there is general

support  although Members have some criticisms  on

the  details. For example, I was accused of having

left  out  one very important factor. That  factor

was  China  and  its effect on the development  of

this region. I am, of course, aware that China  is

a  very  powerful country and that it will have  a

very considerable effect upon the economies of the

area.  I  do  not, however, consider that  at  the

moment  it will play a very great role. As far  as

Singapore and perhaps Malaysia and other countries

in  this  region are concerned, I  am  afraid  the

effect is one of being ignored.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>



We  are not recognised. However, if the Member for

Crawford has a line to China, we shall be happy to

pursue  the  connections which might  benefit  the

economic development of Singapore. I think we  can

possibly ignore the effect that China has upon the

progress  of  Singapore in the  next  one  or  two

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also some criticism by the Member for

Whampoa  of Mr Okita's criteria for fast economic

development. I think he singled out the  criterion

for  agricultural development as one which was not

applicable to Singapore. I am not quite sure  that

that   is  so.  Although  we  have  a  very  small

agricultural  sector, I believe  it  is  a  fairly

efficient  sector. At one time, we were  exporting

pigs, poultry and eggs until certain barriers were

placed  against our exports of these  commodities.

If   I  have  not  given  very  much  emphasis  to

agriculture in my statement, it is not  because  I

do  not  consider it very important but because  I

consider  its  scope for future expansion  limited

and,  therefore, it is not one of the most dynamic

sectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong raised certain points about

agricultural  development. The estimates  do  show

that   we   have  given  the  Primary   Production

Department  adequate provision for improvement  to

our   animal   husbandry,   fisheries   and   even

agriculture of the kind which will be economic.  I

do  not  think there is any land which we can  use

for rice cultivation. In this respect, I think  we

are rather fortunate in not having large areas  in

which  to start the "green" revolution. The  price

of  rice has fallen in spite of what may have been

said  about the cost of living by certain  Members

of  the  House.  With  the miracle  rice  that  is

available for planting in many countries  in  this

region which have an economic advantage, the price

of  rice  is likely to fall further. Beyond  this,

the  feeling of the House appears to be  that  the

policy  which we have suggested is acceptable  and

that the emphasis on export-oriented manufacturing

is  correct and that we should proceed  with  this

emphasis on the very dynamic sector.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now try to deal with the various points of

criticisms  by Members. The first is the  rise  in

the  cost  of living. I was accused of  dismissing

the  rise  in  the cost of living in  a  very  few

sentences  in  my  report.  This  is  correct.  My

remarks,  of course, apply to 1970. It is  correct

that  the cost of living index for 1970 has  shown

very  little  rise  over 1969.  The  prices  which

Members have most in their minds today are  really

connected  with 1971. For instance, the  price  of

bread was mentioned; also the price of sugar which

was  recently  raised; the rise in bus  fares  and

perhaps taxi fares - all raised in 1971. I am  not

saying  that  this is not important.  It  is  very

important.  The two paragraphs in  my  report  are

related  to  1970.  I  did  say  that  in  certain

respects there have been increases. In the case of

housing,  for example, there has been an  increase

in  price. But in the case of rice and foodstuffs,

there have been some decreases in price.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to deal with the nature of the

cost-of-living index. The cost-of-living index was

framed in 1960 or thereabouts - quite a long  time

ago  -  so  there  is no question  of  our  having

designed  it - there was some accusation  that  my

statisticians perhaps designed it - so that we can

mislead  the  House as to the actual rise  in  the

cost  of  living. The basis on which the  cost-of-living  index  was formed, as was rightly  pointed

out,  is as shown in the Digest of Statistics.  If

anyone  is  interested, he can see the weights  in

the   consumer  price  index.  The  weights   were

designed  so that the basket of goods belonged  to

the  workers in 1969 and at that time,  there  was

considerable  unemployment.  The  conditions  then

were quite different from what they are today. The

basket  of  goods, therefore, consisted mainly  of

foodstuffs. Naturally, when you are from the lower

income group this is the range of commodities  you

buy  most  rather  than  furniture,  T.  V, sets,

refrigerators  or  other things which  have  risen

greatly   in  prices.  Even  on  this  basis   the

foodstuffs  have not really increased  in  prices.

The figures are in the Digest of Statistics.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>



They can easily be compared by anyone who goes  to

the  market  place.  Of course,  if  standards  of

living have increased, as Members have emphasised,

it  may be considered whether our present cost-of-living   index  is  really  appropriate   to   the

conditions  of  today,  in which  case  we  should

consider whether we should change the whole system

and  construct  a  new cost-of-living  index  with

different weights. If you are one of the  overseas

personnel  who come to Singapore, for example,  if

you  are  one  of  those who  are  concerned  with

offshore  oil exploration and you want  to  get  a

house  in  the Tanglin area, you cannot expect  to

pay the same rent that you would pay in 1960. That

is  quite clear. At the same time, I do not  think

that is the criterion on which the Singapore cost-of-living index should be constructed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the increase in prices in 1970-71,

Members  are  quite rightly concerned  about  what

should  be  done.  There was a suggestion  that  a

commission of inquiry should be constituted. I  do

not   know   whether  this  suggestion  was   made

seriously. The investigation which has to be  made

is  really into the basis of the index. As far  as

the  prices are concerned, this is a fairly simple

matter. It is very easy to get inspectors to go to

the  markets  and find out the prices  of  various

types of foodstuffs. In fact, it is being done all

the time. If Members are interested in the details

and which markets sell the cheapest foodstuffs, it

will   be   very  easy  to  make  the  information

available to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Why not publish it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> It will be possible to publish

it   if  there  is  enough  interest  in  it.  The

information  is  valuable to some extent,  but  in

most  cases you will find that the housewives shop

near  their homes, it being more costly to take  a

bus  or  a  taxi  to  do  shopping.  In  practice,

whatever  may be the difference in prices between,

say, Changi market and Orchard Road market, it  is

not  very likely that housewives will go to Changi

and buy their foodstuffs there.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the ways in which the Government has tried

to  prevent an increase in the cost of living  has

been  to  ensure  that the social services  remain

relatively the same as they were in 1960. I  think

the  rents for flats, for example, have not really

gone  up  in all this time. The standards  of  the

flats have improved so that if you now live  in  a

Housing and Development Board flat and pay  $20  a

month, I believe that the standards have increased

so  that  for  $20  you  probably  have  a  higher

standard  of  living without an  increase  in  the

cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of medical services also remains, to a

great extent, the same. There was mention of  some

charge now being made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> A

token charge!



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> My colleague says a token

charge. In any case, if you are seriously ill, the

token  sum which may be considered more than token

would  be  negligible as compared with the  actual

cost to the Government for providing the services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, the cost of education remains

relatively  the same. The number of bursaries  and

scholarships  has all increased in  number.  There

again   the  cost  of  education  has  not  really

increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has, therefore, been some isolation of the

citizen  from the increase in the cost  of  living

over  the last ten years. While it may be  correct

that  prices  have  risen to a  great  extent  for

certain  sectors of the population,  I  would  say

this would be for the higher income group. To  the

worker  in the same position as in 1960,  I  would

say that the increase has not been really all that

great.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the position of workers today.

I  am obliged to Members who have reminded me that

I  have  not  paid tribute to the  workers  in  my

budget statement. I hasten, therefore, to say that

the  progress which Singapore has made  would  not

have been possible



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>



without  the hard work and self-sacrifice  of  the

workers.  Table VA referred to by the  Member  for

Bras Basah, shows a considerable reduction in  the

number   of   man-days  lost  through   industrial

disputes. I therefore believe that the trade union

movement  has played a very responsible  role  and

has  been instrumental in a very large measure  in

making   Singapore   more   attractive   to    the

international  companies  which   have   come   to

Singapore.  The  industrial peace which  has  been

maintained  has been reinforced by  the  restraint

which  the  National  Trades  Union  Congress  has

exercised in demands for wage increases. This very

responsible  attitude will, I hope, meet  with  an

adequate response from employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been some reference to the matter of

bonus  payments,  the attitude  of  the  banks  in

negotiations  on  bonus payments, and  suggestions

that  certain  amendments should be  made  to  the

Employment Act. These matters are being considered

at  present  and it is hoped that some  reasonable

solution  will  be found to the whole  problem  of

what should be done in regard to bonus payments as

against an increase in wages. I think it would  be

desirable that the effects of the British military

run-down  should be gauged before any  adjustments

are  made  to the present equilibrium between  the

employers and the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many considerations in promoting the

economic  development of Singapore when suggesting

that  bonus  payments should be greatly increased.

There   are  certain  countries  which   are   not

accustomed  to  the idea of bonus payments.  There

are  others,  like Japan, which  have  made  it  a

practice  to pay bonuses. These have in  the  past

been  considered  to  be  of  value  in  promoting

savings  and in promoting fixed capital  formation

in  Japan.  At the same time, it may be  advisable

that  the practice in Western countries that there

should be a relationship of wages to productivity,

which  is  more  direct and  the  yearly  increase

payment  should be instituted. I believe that  the

setting up of a wages.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>



council, where the employers and the employees get

together  and  settle  what  may  be  a  desirable

increase year by year, may be the best solution to

the  problem. I hope it will be possible that some

solution   to  this  problem  can  be  found   for

implementation after the British military  rundown

which will take place this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain Members have emphasised the effects of

the  rundown  upon  the workers.  The  Member  for

Changi was very concerned about what could be done

for  the  workers in Changi who would  be  greatly

affected by the run-down in 1971. His concern  was

that the conversion to commercial operation of the

Changi  facilities would not be adequate  to  deal

with  the loss of employment in the area. I  think

the successful conversion of Sembawang Dockyard to

commercial  operation shows that where  there  are

skills,  there would be no difficulty in absorbing

workers.  If  there  are skilled  workers  in  the

Changi area who can be absorbed into the aerospace

industries,  the Lockheed and the Grumman  Pacific

organisations  which are trying to develop  repair

facilities would take any number of these  skilled

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for domestic workers, the problem seems to be

that,  from  a general consensus among  employers,

there is a shortage of them and that there need be

no concern about what is going to happen to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real crunch would be for the clerical

workers,  the  storekeepers and other white-collar

workers  especially if they are of the age  of  40

and  above  when  it  would be very  difficult  to

retrain them for industrial jobs. The response  to

the  training courses which have been started  for

these  workers has been rather poor,  and  it  has

been  decided to discontinue the course  specially

arranged for them and to allow them to make use of

the  ordinary facilities. This is a very difficult

problem  and  I  confess that  it  would  be  very

difficult  for us to place redundant  storekeepers

and  some of the clerical workers, though not  all

of  them, in industrial employment. I do not think

that the suggestion which has been made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>



that  jobs in the civil service should be reserved

for  these workers is feasible. In any case, there

are  not  enough  storekeeper jobs  in  Government

service. In addition, our national servicemen have

also  some claim to preferential treatment in  the

choice of Government jobs. But we shall do what we

can for these workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, until 1969, our concern was to see that

there were enough jobs and the conditions did  not

seem  quite so important. Now that we have reached

the   position  of  almost  full  employment,  the

conditions  of  workers are  quite  rightly  given

greater  consideration. In my budget statement,  I

gave  emphasis  to training. This is  one  way  in

which we can improve the conditions of workers  so

that  they  can  have an increase to  their  wages

through greater productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a suggestion by the Member for Moulmein

that  it  was not desirable that I should use  the

payroll  tax for the purpose of giving  incentives

to  employers for training workers. On  the  other

hand,  the Member for Whampoa disagreed with  this

suggestion.  My  own  opinion  is  that,  as  this

payroll  tax  is  collected  in  connection   with

workers employed in industry, it is a very  proper

basis for using the tax collected to reimburse the

employers  who  are creating the skills,  and  who

may, after having given a lot of training to their

employees, find that they may be lured to  another

similar industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some concern was expressed in connection with the

safety   of  workers.  On  this  I  am  in  entire

agreement that we should increasingly emphasise to

all  employers that they should implement  schemes

to  ensure greater safety for their workers. I am,

however,  informed  that  the  workers  themselves

sometimes  prefer  not to employ safety  measures.

Helmets are provided for them, but they do not use

them.  Guards are provided to prevent the  workers

from  being hurt, but, in some cases, in order  to

improve the speed of working, they are removed  by

the  workers themselves. This is therefore  not  a

matter for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>



employers alone to pursue, but also for the

workers to be educated. A lot of industrial

accidents are due to carelessness on the part of

the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Then enforce safety standards!



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> If the employers enforce safety

standards and the employees are prepared to  adopt

them,  it will be to the benefit of all concerned.

From  the  economic development point of  view,  a

skilled  worker has had a lot of capital  invested

in  him  by  his  employer, by the  state  and  by

himself, because any investment which is  made  in

learning skills ought to produce a return and  the

worker  should  not jeopardise his  investment  by

being careless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another point regarding the protection

of  local industry. The Member for Whampoa thought

that  we  were over-protecting certain industries.

In  my  budget  statement I  made  it  clear  that

protection  would be accorded only if  a  case  is

clearly established. I used the word "clearly" and

I  mean  clearly. I do not mean that any  industry

could  call for protection in the early stages  of

establishment. In the case of dressed leather -  I

think  the  Member  for  Katong  read  some  press

statements in connection with it - we have  lifted

the  import duty and in many other cases  we  will

probably do the same. We do not intend to  protect

an  inefficient  industry even  where  investments

have  been  made either by Government  or  by  the

Development Bank of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Would you like to give way to Dr Tan, Mr Hon?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a point of

clarification. May I know what the criteria for

"clearly" are?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think

it is possible to establish criteria applicable to

all  industries.  There is a committee  on  tariff

matters  in which the Economic Development  Board,

the   Trade   Division   and   my   Ministry   are

represented. The committee considers  all  aspects

of  the  industry.  We will consider  all  aspects

before  making  any  decision.  In  many  of   the

industries which are established in Singapore, the

failures have been due more to the effect  of  bad

management  than to lack of markets or  of  proper

equipment. In some cases, the Development Bank  of

Singapore tries to save an industry which could be

viable with good management, and it is proper that

we  should  try  to rescue these industries  where

there   is  some  possibility  of  their  becoming

viable.  This  is  the reason  why  we  have  also

promoted light industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know why the impression has been created

that  there  has  been no encouragement  given  to

local  industries.  The Light Industries  Services

still remain. The D.B.S, has a fund for lending to

light  industries. Its total has run  to  over  $3

million.  I think more money is readily  available

where  applications are made. The impression which

the  Member  for Crawford has that  we  appear  to

encourage  foreign industry and give  very  little

encouragement to our local industries is not quite

correct. I can assure him that if he has any local

industry wanting any assistance, we shall give  it -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Would you like to give way to Mr Low, Mr Hon?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> Can I clarify, Mr Speaker? I

think the impression must have been carried by the

interpreter.  Definitely I have not made  such  an

implication.  I  only said adequate  encouragement

should  be  given in proportion to the  amount  of

encouragement given to foreign investments. I have

not queried the Government's attitude on this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> All right. Since the Member for

Crawford  has  clarified  this,  I  hope  that  my

statement  will  be of some use to any  hesitating

local   entrepreneurs.  In  some   respects,   the

assistance we are prepared to give would be in the

nature  of  assisting local industries to  produce

more  local entrepreneurs. Even on that basis,  we

would  be  prepared to go beyond what we might  be

prepared  to  go  with the foreign industries.  We

would consider this as part of the process of  the

education of local entrepreneurs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the question of tourism. The

Member  for  Whampoa raised a number of questions.

He questioned whether the amount of money which we

are   going   to  spend  on  tourism  was   really

justifiable.  There was another Member  who  asked

about  the  over-investment which he read  in  the

press. The estimate which has been made on tourism

is  that  there would be one million  visitors  in

1975,  so  that in our development of Sentosa  and

other  tourist infrastructure, we have taken  this

into  account.  I stressed in my budget  statement

that,  as  the  amount we would spend  on  Sentosa

would  be very large, we would make a very careful

assessment  of the viability of the  projects  and

ensure  for  ourselves  that  there  would  be  an

adequate  return  on  the capital  which  will  be

spent.  I  do  not  think I need  go  beyond  this

statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as over-investment in the tourist industry

is  concerned,  I think this is a  very  difficult

question. I have said elsewhere that in many cases

in the past, in Japan, for example, at the time of

the  Tokyo Olympics and Expo `70, it was suggested

that  there  was  over-investment in  the  tourist

industry.  It  was  also said in  connection  with

investment of hotels in Bangkok and Hong Kong.  If

you went to Hong Kong, Tokyo or Bangkok, you would

have  some  problem in finding hotel accommodation

in these areas. I myself do not consider that from

the  Government point of view there has  been  any

over-investment in the industry. The  availability

of accommodation sometimes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>



stimulates  the  hotel entrepreneur  to  get  more

business for Singapore, and from the point of view

of  the  Minister for Finance, this  is  certainly

very  desirable.  In  individual  cases  of  hotel

investment,  some entrepreneurs  might  find  that

their  particular hotel is in a district which  is

not  very  popular.  In  those  cases,  the  over-investment  is  very obvious. In other  areas,  in

spite  of  the  number of hotels  that  have  been

built,  there  may  still be a  need  for  further

investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further point which has been made is the effect

of  urban renewal, the problems created by it, and

the  cost  of shop-houses in the areas which  have

been rebuilt. There was also some criticism of the

construction  industry,  the  increased  cost   of

building, and the price of flats, even those built

by  the  Housing Board. Mention was  made  of  the

increased  price  of the Housing  Board  flats  in

Kallang. I think I went into this matter  in  some

detail  in my budget statement on the construction

costs.  There  is  no question  that  construction

costs  have risen. There is also no question  that

the  prices  which  are now  being  asked  for  by

private  housing developers are much  higher  than

what  they were even two or three years ago.  This

is  merely  a symptom of the shortage  of  private

housing which has been created by the presence  of

large   numbers  of  people  who  find   Singapore

attractive as a base for their drilling operations

in  this  region.  This  phenomenon  may  be  only

temporary. At the same time, I recognise that even

if it is temporary, some hardship is caused to the

middle income group who find the purchase of  even

a  semi-detached unit beyond their means. With  an

increase  in  the  housing loan  which  Government

might make to civil servants, I think it would  be

very difficult for them to pay for a $60,000 unit.

I  therefore consider that the solution really  is

in the suggestion which one Member has made, i.e.,

that  the  Housing  and Development  Board  should

build flats or units for sale to the middle income

group.  I believe that the present eligibility  is

limited  to  a total family income of $1,200,  and

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>



the  Member's  suggestion is  to  increase  it  to

$1,700.  Of course, we will consider it,  but  for

the  time being I think $1,500 is an adequate cut-off  point.  In fact, I believe that consideration

is  already  being given to raising the  limit  to

$1,500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think that deals with the main points raised by Members in the House. The final point which was made was that all these developments, the growth rate and so on, are really intended for the people of Singapore. Of course, I endorse the feeling that the whole

purpose  of economic development is to  provide  a

higher  standard  of  living  for  the  people  of

Singapore, and that the creation of a more just



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



and equal society is the real reason why we

believe in the economic development of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
