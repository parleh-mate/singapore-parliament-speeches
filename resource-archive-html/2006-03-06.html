Anyone who wishes to make an AMD should discuss it with his or her doctor, including getting the doctor to help complete the form. Singaporeans can also download the form from the MOH website.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 998</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOH will make periodic efforts to raise public awareness and support for the AMD.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will leverage on events such as the tragic case of Mrs Terri Schiavo to educate the public on such issues.&nbsp; That was how AMD adoption rate increased sharply last year.&nbsp; But, realistically, we should not expect overwhelming subscription to AMD.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making an AMD is a serious and voluntary decision. Our efforts will continue to focus on increasing access to the AMD forms and providing the necessary education.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOH, together with the National Medical Ethics Committee, is currently reviewing the AMD Act.&nbsp; We will see if any amendments are needed in the light of experience.</p></div></span>		          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</B>:&nbsp; Sir, the Prime Minister's National Day Rally Speech last year was entitled "A Vibrant Global City Called Home".&nbsp; The aim is to <p align=left>Column: 999</p>create an outstanding living, working and recreational environment for all Singaporeans.&nbsp; Yet, Sir, there appears to be many detractors of whether Singapore can ever achieve its aim - which I recently learned to have originated from the wonderful late Mr S Rajaratnam - of becoming a "Global City", comparable to the likes of New York and Tokyo.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many global cities evolved organically from the industrial and transport hubs of the past, largely through the entrepreneurial drive and energy of their populations.&nbsp; Singapore has done well through excellent urban planning and execution.&nbsp; But - and this is the intriguing question - can Singapore continue to use a largely top-down approach to move to the next plane on its quest to successfully transform itself into a global city?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is widespread perception that Singapore is too well-planned, even over-planned, and that this accounts for the relatively sterile environment relative to other major cities.&nbsp; I fully appreciate that our planners have become more accommodating, more private enterprise driven and more flexible.&nbsp; But I submit that more needs to be done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the "Duck Tours" example, cited by PM Lee, is consigned to history.&nbsp; But a number of businessmen and developers have told me that if their idea is not one that can fit into any of URA's current planning drive, it would be difficult to get planning approval.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what other plans, going forward, has the Ministry to help turn Singapore into a truly Tier One global city.&nbsp; What does it consider are the necessary ingredients of a global city?&nbsp;What challenges does it foresee?&nbsp; How can the Ministry allow for more organic, bottom-up ideas to germinate and take root?</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</B> Sir, Dr Amy Khor has <p align=left>Column: 1000</p>asked what are the plans&nbsp;we have to develop Singapore into a global city and how we can meet the new challenges and competition.&nbsp; I agree with her that developing a global city is not something that we can do overnight or easily.&nbsp; In fact, there are many cities in the world that are vying for the same position, in the same way, to attract investors, talents and visitors.&nbsp; So, many cities around the world are embarking on major development projects, building new attractions, and actively marketing themselves as global cities.&nbsp; No idea is too far-fetched, too bold, or too crazy for them.&nbsp; Recently, I read that in Shanghai, there is a developer that intends to jack-up or lift the 20-odd conservation buildings along the Bund.&nbsp; If you know about the conservations along the Bund, it is equivalent to us saying that we are going to jack-up City Hall.&nbsp; He was going to put a row of high-end shops underneath those buildings after he had jacked them up by something like seven metres.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not intend to do the same with our City Hall - to jack it up and put a shopping mall underneath.&nbsp; But, I think, that is an illustration of what cities around the world are thinking of doing.&nbsp; Whether they proceed with it or not, I do not know.&nbsp; But the very fact that somebody is thinking along these lines illustrates that people are all vying to attract the same pool of talents and visitors to their shores.&nbsp; That is the kind of competition&nbsp;we are up against - to be an international city and&nbsp;a global city.&nbsp; So, to be in the game, we need to have bold strategies, innovative plans, and we also need to think, to use the clichÃ©, out of the box.&nbsp; How do we intend to do so?&nbsp; Let me&nbsp;outline three areas we intend to focus on in the years ahead, in order to achieve this vision.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is to touch on what Dr Amy Khor mentioned, and that is land use planning.&nbsp; How do we provide for greater flexibility in our land use planning to meet <p align=left>Column: 1001</p>very diverse and rapidly changing needs?&nbsp; Sir, we know that the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has got a comprehensive Concept Plan which is updated every 10 years, and then, in the interim, there is a Master Plan which is updated every five years.&nbsp; These regular reviews of the plans ensure that the plans will always remain relevant to our needs and&nbsp;the changing aspirations of our people. In recent years, we have introduced the White Zones, the Business-White Zones, other schemes such as the Warehouse Retail Scheme, the Home Office Scheme, and so on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of all these schemes, I think businesses and entrepreneurs now find that they are able to make better use of the facilities and infrastructure that they have. But, having said that, I think we also have a responsibility to maintain a certain orderliness and&nbsp;a certain quality of&nbsp; the living environment that people have come to expect.&nbsp; We need to provide a little bit of certainty to businesses and home-owners, so that when somebody buys a home in the neighbourhood, he does not find suddenly that next to him there is a&nbsp; factory or&nbsp;a childcare centre, a place of worship or a shopping mall.&nbsp; There is a need to balance between flexibility on the one hand and that sense of certainty, that when you buy a piece of property in Singapore, you know what it is that you are buying; you know, to a certain extent, at least within a certain reasonable timeframe, what is it that is going on around you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, that is the kind of balance that we need to strike.&nbsp; Of course, on top of that, we also need to worry about our long-term land use needs.&nbsp; I think this is one of the strengths of Singapore.&nbsp; While Dr Amy Khor may cite complaints of our top-down planning being a burden, it is, I submit, a strength that has allowed us to make better use of the limited space that <p align=left>Column: 1002</p>we have.&nbsp; So, when you talk about Changi Airport -&nbsp; although Changi Airport was&nbsp;completed in the 80s - the land for Changi Airport was actually set aside many years before that. When we finally decided that the time was ripe for us to move the airport from Paya Lebar to Changi, the land was already available.&nbsp; You compare that with other situations in other major cities.&nbsp; Every time they try to shift an airport to a new place, they have got to fight with the farmers, like they did in Tokyo.&nbsp; They have got to fight with the residents, like they are doing in Sydney or many other big cities. And they simply cannot move, and airports which are urgently needed infrastructure take years and years to develop.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we have to bear these considerations in mind.&nbsp; It is not just a top-down approach that we need but it is, I think, a consultative approach that we would need, with industry players and the population, and this is the kind of approach that we have taken in reviewing the Concept Plan and the Master Plan.&nbsp; But one of the things that I would like to emphasise is that whatever it is, whichever approach we take, and we will take whatever approach is necessary, in land use planning, we must bear in mind that this is our home - that this is a home that is dear to us, this is a home that is beautiful, that has character,&nbsp;life and&nbsp;memories which we want to keep.&nbsp; The Prime Minister, at last year's National Day Rally speech, painted this vision of Singapore as a very distinctive global city, with beautiful residential towns, thriving communities in the heartlands, and exciting events that will enliven the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is&nbsp;the first area that we will focus on -&nbsp;a more flexible land use planning approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second area that we will focus on is to make Singaporeans proud of our city.&nbsp; Last year, we had a seminar and some prominent Singaporeans were invited to speak at the seminar.&nbsp; One of them said <p align=left>Column: 1003</p>that we must make Singaporeans love our city, and for that the city must love us back.&nbsp; I think "love" may not be the right word to use in this context.&nbsp; But I think we must make Singaporeans proud of our city.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; Deepen their rootedness; foster a spirit of creativity; foster a sense of celebration among our people through better use of urban spaces, preserving some of the memories that&nbsp;we hold dear.&nbsp; And this is where URA can play a part.&nbsp; They can actively promote architecture and urban design excellence to encourage distinctive buildings and public places.&nbsp; URA is making a concerted effort in this direction and it has started to hold exhibitions to showcase good local as well as overseas architecture, working with DesignSingapore Council on the President's Award for Architecture and Urban Design Excellence, and promoting Singapore's urban design and architecture by participating in overseas exhibitions such as</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>the Biennale and through the mass media.&nbsp; I do not know whether Members here managed to catch CNA broadcast last night. It was called "City Lights", and it featured a selection of significant buildings in&nbsp;Singapore's central area.&nbsp;This is part of a series which will showcase some of the most significant developments and buildings in Singapore, showcase the people behind them,&nbsp;the history, the meaning of all these urban spaces and designs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>12.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third area of focus would be to focus development on strategic areas in Singapore,&nbsp;that will create new competitive advantage for us.&nbsp; I am talking about Orchard Road, which is one of the world's premier shopping streets and which brings in tourists as well as locals alike.&nbsp; I am talking about the Bugis and Bras Basah area,&nbsp;our arts and civic area, which is also going to become our educational hub.&nbsp; And finally, the greater Marina Bay area, which will&nbsp;be home to <p align=left>Column: 1004</p>financial centres,&nbsp;the Integrated Resorts, and so on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me talk a little bit about the vision for Marina Bay.&nbsp; Marina Bay is fast taking shape.&nbsp; The future of Marina Bay is an exciting one.&nbsp; Last New Year's Eve, 200,000 Singaporeans gathered around the Bay to witness&nbsp;and to celebrate New Year's Eve Countdown. They saw the spectacular fireworks&nbsp;and they saw the lighting displays, and I think they&nbsp;were very excited, not just by the event itself, but by what that event can become, and I hope that one day, that celebration will be seen, not just by thousands of Singaporeans, but also by many millions all around the world&nbsp;"live" on New Year's Eve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many new developments that are coming up around the Bay.&nbsp; As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words, so I have prepared a pamphlet that will give Members a better idea of some of these developments.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may ask the Clerk to please assist to distribute the folders. [<I>Copies of pamphlet distributed to hon. Members.</I>]&nbsp;One development that is going to make a major impact on Singapore's financial landscape and the city's skyline is the Business and Financial Centre (BFC).&nbsp; If I may refer Members to picture 1, the BFC is one of the buildings that would be surrounding the Bay, together with the Integrated Resort and the new bridge, which I will talk about later.&nbsp; The BFC is positioned as the new financial hub of Singapore because it will contain state-of-the-art office, residential and retail space.&nbsp; It will meet new needs and it will also enliven the Bay. The tender for the BFC site was awarded last year.&nbsp; I understand that planning for the buildings is now at the design stage, and completion is expected before 2010.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Integrated Resort, the tender is also expected to be awarded by the middle of this year.&nbsp; I look forward to receiving strong proposals that will <p align=left>Column: 1005</p>differentiate the Singapore Marina Bay IR from any other IRs in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To support the new developments at the Marina Bay, the URA, as the Development Agent for the area, is now coordinating the infrastructure, implementation of the infrastructure for the area, like the Common Services Tunnel, the road, rail network and also the electrical substations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to this, a new vehicular and pedestrian bridge will be built this year to link the Bayfront area in Marina South to Marina Centre,&nbsp;in other words, to link that part&nbsp;of the&nbsp;land where the IR is going to be situated with the Marina Centre area where the hotels are - Marina Mandarin, Ritz-Carlton, and so on.&nbsp; The pedestrian component of the bridge will complete the walking loop around Marina Bay and link up the necklace of public spaces and attractions around the Bay.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; URA staged an International Design Consultancy Competition to secure the best possible design for this bridge, and it attracted many proposals, both local and international.&nbsp; We have selected the design, it is&nbsp;very spectacular,&nbsp;very unique and very distinctive.&nbsp; If you refer to picture 2, I think you will be able to see what I mean. The pedestrian component of the bridge,&nbsp; there will be a vehicle component as well to the left of that, but the pedestrian component alone will be of a unique design.&nbsp; In fact, it is a world-first because it will resemble the structure of a DNA, the bridge featuring a double helix steel structure, symbolising "life and continuity", "renewal" and "growth".&nbsp; At night, the bridge can be lit to bring out the beauty of the double helix structure and it can&nbsp;also be programmed with different colours to create different moods for different occasions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new pedestrian connection at Bayfront will be more than a bridge.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1006</p>There will be art works that will be integrated into the design&nbsp;to provide a unique crossing experience, and we are inviting some of our young artists, together&nbsp;with our other prominent local artists, to create the artwork.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The completion of this iconic bridge in 2009 will add to the exciting developments in Marina Bay.&nbsp; It will be functional and yet aesthetic.&nbsp; It will complete the loop around the Bay area, and it promises to be another unique attraction in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new bridge will not be the only structure that will be lit up at night.&nbsp; URA has developed a lighting master plan to guide new developments and existing buildings within the CBD and the Marina Bay.&nbsp; If I may refer Members to picture 3, this lighting plan serves to enhance Singapore's city skyline by highlighting various unique architectural features of prominent buildings, as well as the greenery and the waterscape.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the lights from the pedestrian bridge, as well as developments around the Bay, can bring out the beauty of the city at night, and create a whole new image for Singapore.&nbsp; In fact, we can create different images for different&nbsp;times of the year&nbsp;in the same way that other cities are able to celebrate different moods through different seasons.&nbsp; We too can&nbsp;celebrate&nbsp;different&nbsp;times&nbsp;of the year by celebrating different festivals, and through the lighting effect&nbsp;create such a difference in mood.&nbsp; So URA will have to&nbsp;look into measures to persuade owners to provide such lighting.&nbsp;&nbsp;More details will be announced later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another major attraction that will be developed at Marina Bay is the Gardens-by-the-Bay.&nbsp; Please refer to picture 4 where there are certain artists' impressions of the various gardens around the Bay.&nbsp; NParks has already launched an international design competition to try and <p align=left>Column: 1007</p>bring in the best designers from all over the world to give us the concepts and designs for the three waterfront gardens.&nbsp; Each of the gardens will feature a design and a character of its own.&nbsp; And when these three gardens are completed and surround the Bay, they will help us to achieve our vision of a City-in-a-Garden.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further our greening efforts at Marina Bay, a Lanscape Masterplan has been drawn up to guide the planting of trees and shrubs along the key streets and boulevards and within the public open spaces in the Bay area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; URA will also encourage all new developments in the area to provide sky terraces, viewing decks and roof gardens.&nbsp; Landscaped open spaces will be the hallmark and the distinguishing feature of developments at the Marina Bay area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, let me talk about the Bay itself.&nbsp; The Bay itself is the centrepiece for our celebrations at the Bay.&nbsp; Some architects I talked to have likened it to, what they call, a piazza,&nbsp;in many traditional European cities.&nbsp; But in our context, I believe it is more like a Padang, except that instead of grass, it will have water.&nbsp; Just as we enjoy sports like football,&nbsp;rugby, cricket, and so on, on the Padang, we can have water sports on the water Padang.&nbsp;&nbsp;URA has worked with partner agencies like the PUB, STB, SSC, to develop activities for the Greater Marina Bay area by way of an activities masterplan.&nbsp; We have already organised some notable activities in Marina Bay area.&nbsp; Last year, we held the F1 Powerboat Championships and the Marina Bay New Year Eve Countdown, and some of these activities are shown in picture 5 of the handout.&nbsp; With the city skyline as the backdrop, the Bay and its waterfront&nbsp;can be a one-of-a-kind venue for major events in Singapore, truly a Bay of Celebration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1008</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, distinctive architecture, well-integrated landscaping in buildings and public spaces; internationally renowned Gardens; varied public attractions; tasteful lighting; exciting water-based activities and events - all these can contribute to making Marina Bay and Singapore unique and special.&nbsp; If we couple this with sound land-use planning, we can take Singapore even closer towards our vision of a vibrant global city.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Marine Areas</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Geh Min (Nominated Member):</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I heard from the Minister that Singapore is land scarce, so we have optimised what little we have through a comprehensive Master Plan, and the result has been very impressive.&nbsp; I agree.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Singapore is&nbsp;far more than a garden city or even "a city in a garden".&nbsp; We are actually 64 tropical islands set in Singapore waters.&nbsp; And our seas are as much an integral part of Singapore as our land; but while we have done very well on land, I believe that our marine and coastal areas have suffered from the lack of more integrated planning and protection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I therefore propose that we develop a Master Plan for all coastal and marine areas, not just Marina Bay.&nbsp; In this Master Plan, we incorporate a detailed and comprehensive Blue Plan for marine conservation that is based on regular surveys of our seas.&nbsp; This should be under an agency with overall authority and responsibility which will work with other agencies and stakeholders to coordinate and integrate the planning, implementation and regular review of the Master Plan,&nbsp;like the URA does, but of course not dominated by urban planners. This agency should also coordinate project and <p align=left>Column: 1009</p>research future challenges and threats, such as climate change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, we must have our port, petrochemical industry, land reclamation, but I believe a Master Plan will improve on our present rather patchy approach, which has resulted in the negative impact or neglect of certain aspects of our marine resources and environment.&nbsp; In addition, we are going to face new challenges to our marine and coastal areas and their management and protection as a result of climate change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the areas that I feel, despite what the Minister said about Marina Bay, that has suffered neglect is leisure and recreational facilities.&nbsp; I think it is fair to say that a generation ago, a larger proportion of Singaporeans used to live and play in our seas and offshore islands than they do now today.&nbsp;This is not due to a lack of interest on the part of Singaporeans.&nbsp; For example, East Coast Parkway is always packed, especially on weekends; trips to Chek Jawa are snapped up and even oversubscribed the moment they are announced; we have&nbsp;100,000 certified divers, 3,000&nbsp;amateur boaters and sailors and about 250,000 fishermen, and Singaporeans are estimated to spend about $32 million per annum on overseas dive trips.&nbsp; But increasingly, Singaporeans have had to look overseas or within our restricted inland waters to pursue water sports and hobbies,&nbsp;because our marine areas are out of bounds, difficult to access or degraded. For example, divers in Pulau Hantu and the southern islands tell me it is perpetual haze down there.&nbsp; And this compromises their safety as well as their enjoyment.&nbsp; Yet, Pulau Hantu was and still can be ideal for beginners who want to learn to dive; if we work for a creative co-existence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1010</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, we have ambitious tourist and leisure developments.&nbsp; We have just heard some of them.&nbsp; But these need to be supported by a rich menu of choices, both for tourists and locals.&nbsp; I believe that most successful tourist destinations and activities exist in symbiosis with local patronage.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another area of neglect is the scientific and educational area.&nbsp; When I wrote to the Forum page, asking for Chek Jawa to be saved, URA replied initially that they did not think the area merited it as there were no coral reefs.&nbsp; We have 73 patch reefs and 35 fringing reefs in the southern islands but still no marine conservation area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>12.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their potential for research and advancement of our life science industry is enormous, as well as the ecological,&nbsp;education and recreation services&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

We are likely to have to face the impact of global warming and possible sea rises, and this will have serious implications not just on the environment but social and economic impacts as well.&nbsp; Surely, this requires a proactive multi-agency approach in an integrated manner.&nbsp; Many countries already have done comprehensive studies on this issue.&nbsp; Has Singapore done research on this and, if so, can we know the results or the findings?&nbsp; How will our land reclamation be affected?&nbsp; How will projects like Marina Bay be affected?&nbsp; Will erosion be a problem?&nbsp; I believe it is better to know <p align=left>Column: 1011</p>what we have and what we can expect and plan accordingly, rather than not know or ignore it just to make planning easier.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Yet, we still describe ourselves as a country with no natural resources.&nbsp; I believe the statement is only accurate in a very narrow sense and timeframe which is now outdated, ie, a natural resource is&nbsp;something that is immediately translatable into hard cash in a manufacturing-based economy.&nbsp; In this era of a knowledge-based economy with large investments in the life sciences, I believe it is high time we made the long overdue connection with nature, and value our biodiversity as a precious natural resource.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, 62% of all cancer drugs are said to be created from bioprospecting discoveries, and the patenting of bioprospecting discoveries has exploded from less than a dozen in 2000 to over 100 in 2005.&nbsp; But experts tell me that it is actually in the realm of biomimetics, where the gains are enormous and the potential is endless.&nbsp; Bioprospecting, not just for molecules but for ideas and solutions from nature which can be replicated or redesigned in the laboratory by reverse engineering, is where the real value is.&nbsp; But this requires close collaboration between the biologist, engineer and, of course, nature, and we have all three.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The richer our endowment of biodiversity, the larger our capital for investments and spin-offs.&nbsp; Many countries which are rich in biodiversity, <p align=left>Column: 1012</p>eg, India, the Philippines, Malaysia, now have strict laws protecting them from commercial exploitation by other countries, and they also have multilateral agreements.&nbsp; But Singapore still lacks laws that are designed to protect our biodiversity.&nbsp; Yes, we have laws that protect our nature reserves, but these cover only a very small fraction of the island, ie, less than 3%,&nbsp;and our primary forest, less than 1%.&nbsp; Biodiversity in other parts of our island is not protected.&nbsp; In particular, marine biodiversity is at risk.&nbsp; We have no marine reserves, we have high biodiversity, and they are exposed to high risks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This lack of adequate laws is particularly surprising when we consider that Singapore is exceptional and, I believe, even unique.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a rich biodiversity.&nbsp; We have the capability to develop it, both the infrastructure and expertise in life science research, unlike most biodiverse countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;And we have them concentrated in a very small area.&nbsp; It takes less than an hour to go from the field to the laboratory.&nbsp; Which other country has this?&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a "3-in-1" in a highly concentrated form.&nbsp; Moreover, our geographical location in Southeast Asia near the epicentre of global biodiversity provides us with regional opportunities to develop our shared biodiversity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, therefore, urge the Government to:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) &nbsp;recognise our biodiversity as a valuable economic and scientific resource;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; give it the legal protection it deserves and desperately needs; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) &nbsp;leverage on our unique position, both locally and regionally, to develop the use of it in a sustainable manner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we fail to recognise and respond to this window of opportunity, we will end up as a nation with no natural resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will then be a small consolation to <p align=left>Column: 1013</p>realise that this description is not a result of a lack of natural endowments or&nbsp;a lack of ability and opportunity to use them, but a lack of foresight.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, Singaporeans who have grown up with greening programmes started by Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew in 1963 are happy to&nbsp;learn that the&nbsp;Government has announced a plan for the Garden City by the Bay at Marina South, East and Centre.&nbsp; Looking at the pictures circulated by the Minister earlier,&nbsp;we are quite excited to know what is coming.&nbsp; Indeed, this is a major undertaking that will complement the existing Botanic Gardens.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being an avid gardener myself, I am fascinated by the unstinting efforts&nbsp;of the National Parks Board (NPB) people who scoured the tropical and sub-tropical forests in Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin&nbsp;America to identify and bring back unique species previously unknown here.&nbsp; They had enriched our flora collection and made Singapore an attractive place.&nbsp; So, every time I drive along a canopy-covered road and slopes lined up with shrubs with unique&nbsp;species of trees adorning our roadside and road dividers, I am reminded of their hard work and creativity in enriching our natural heritage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a refreshing experience being able to enjoy the shade, greenery and beauty of the rain trees and <I>pueh&nbsp;poui</I> that we brought from tropical America and the yellow <I>pinda</I>&nbsp; from Australia.&nbsp; One day, as I was driving near Grange Road, I was pleasantly surprised to find even some "Tongkat Ali" trees among the shrubs by the roadside.&nbsp; I hope the plants will be allowed to grow and achieve&nbsp;their <p align=left>Column: 1014</p>optimum potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had planted a number of similar species in our gardens in Tampines without labelling them - to hide them from the eyes of the public -&nbsp;but they were found missing&nbsp;less than a year later!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what strikes me in reading about the new botanical garden and the upgrading work of our parks is that the concept tends to be restricted to work done on land only.&nbsp; In areas where there are both land and water bodies, such as East Coast Park, Sembawang Park, Seletar, MacRitchie and Bedok Reservoir Parks, the gardens or park developments often end at points where the land meets the water.&nbsp; This does not seem natural, as the geographical landscape forms a continuum between land and water, regardless of whether it is the coastal or inland features.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we are successful in creating and beautifying the landscapes, we tend to disregard the waterscape, as&nbsp;Dr Geh Min just mentioned earlier.&nbsp; In some places, such as at Bedok Reservoir, it is painful to our eyes to see the cold, solid grey granite lining up the watermarks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have seen the works of park planners and designers in the UK, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Holland where there were major reclamation works done.&nbsp; The planners take both land and water as an undivided continuum and the results are fascinating.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I ask the Minister whether his Ministry will consider extending the greening programme to cover the water areas as well, especially our southern islands?</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Heng Chee How)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Heng Chee How):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, I would like to thank Dr Geh Min and Mr Yatiman Yusof for their views on the greening of Singapore and&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1015</p>the conservation and protection of biodiversity.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let me speak on Singapore as a Garden City.&nbsp; Indeed, we are well-known as a Garden City, and this is the result of 40 years of deliberate national planning and effort, not by chance.&nbsp; The result has provided a pleasant and high quality living environment for our people.&nbsp; But we cannot become complacent about these achievements.&nbsp; We must continue to innovate and remake our city.&nbsp; Our vision is to evolve Singapore into "A City in a Garden" that is characterised by a matrix of parks, gardens and green spaces interconnected to form a green mantle throughout the island.&nbsp; To achieve this goal, we would do so through a four-pronged strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we will build on and expand our greenery capital through developing our parks, building a park connector network, extending it, intensifying streetscape greenery and, as Mr Yatiman Yusof suggested, better integrating greenery with our water bodies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we will strengthen the public, people and private sector partnerships in greening efforts, so that it would not just be a Government effort but it would be a national, community and total effort.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we will showcase our horticultural excellence through developing signature parks, including waterfront gardens and staging a world-class garden festival.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, we will work with industry to upgrade the skills and competencies to sustain our City in a Garden.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, allow me to elaborate on some of the key areas.&nbsp; On signature gardens, we are developing a distinctive collection of "Gardens by the Bay"&nbsp;in the heart of Marina Bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister Mr Mah Bow Tan has elaborated on&nbsp;the three inter<p align=left>Column: 1016</p>connected waterfront gardens totalling 94 hectares around&nbsp;Marina Bay, and has actually provided us with&nbsp;the artist's impression of those three gardens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Garden at Marina South, which will be adjacent to the Integrated Resort, we believe, would be a wonderful location to showcase tropical blooms and foliage colours at their best.&nbsp; We are also studying the feasibility of a conservatory that can house flowering plants from cooler climates.&nbsp; The Garden at Marina East will comprise water-theme gardens and have a staging area for water sports in the Bay, while the one at Marina Centre will be a waterfront promenade linking the cultural core at the Esplanade Theatres to Kallang Basin.&nbsp; These waterfront Gardens will complement the developments around Marina Bay and offer a new, exciting experience for Singaporeans and visitors.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In designing our regional and neighbourhood parks, NParks also gives due consideration to the development of the interface between land and water.&nbsp;&nbsp;In deciding&nbsp;the appropriate treatment, NParks will consider the site conditions, intended uses, and surrounding features.&nbsp; For example, the Ecolake at the Botanic Gardens incorporates a natural grass embankment, while mangrove areas line Sungei Tampines.&nbsp; The Boardwalk at Pulau Ubin allows us to get close to nature without spoiling the ambience or damaging the surrounding&nbsp;ecosystems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other efforts to beautify our waterbodies are underway.&nbsp; PUB has initiated an Active, Beautiful and Clean Waters Programme to develop our waterbodies into clean and vibrant attractions.&nbsp; NParks will work with PUB and other relevant agencies to realise the full potential of our waterbodies as quality recreational destinations, and to strengthen our greenery infrastructure.&nbsp; I think this would be encouragement to both Mr Yatiman Yusof as well as to Dr Geh Min.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1017</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, for example, NParks and PUB are working on a preliminary masterplan to revitalise the Kallang riverscape.&nbsp; There are exciting ideas to transform the entire length of the&nbsp;Kallang River and its canals into beautiful recreational and lifestyle venues that will enhance the quality of life for Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision is to create a river system with clean and fresh waters, integrated with landscaped banks, where there can be swimming, fishing, boating and other sporting activities in the waters, and&nbsp;recreational activities along the banks and connected gardens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I will now move on to speak on the conservation of biodiversity.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are, as the Government, indeed&nbsp;mindful of the need to conserve our natural heritage and biodiversity.&nbsp; As the Minister has pointed out earlier, we are not just talking about building a city, but&nbsp;about an entire experience of what it means to create a national outcome that takes into account the richness not only of the buildings and infrastructures but of the natural gifts as well.&nbsp; We recognise the importance of doing so, including the potential value that a rich biodiversity can contribute to bioscience research, education, tourism and leisure.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yatiman Yusof's illustration just now of the "Tongkat Ali" tree is one example where&nbsp;the right kinds of vegetation&nbsp;with&nbsp;medicinal and other properties could be exploited.&nbsp; The need to conserve our natural heritage is, therefore,&nbsp;taken into consideration as we plan for the use of our land, coast and&nbsp;sea in an integrated manner.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of this process, key coastal and inter-tidal ecosystems at Labrador and Sungei Buloh have been gazetted as Nature Reserves.&nbsp; Sisters' Islands were identified as a marine nature area.&nbsp; These are actual steps taken and they reflect this Government's commitment to conserving biodiversity.&nbsp; And we will continue to keep as many areas in their <p align=left>Column: 1018</p>natural state for as long as possible.&nbsp; But as a small country with limited land and waters, we also have&nbsp;to take a pragmatic approach. &nbsp;So nature conservation will have&nbsp;to be balanced with other competing needs - not to be sacrificed, but to be balanced.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NParks,&nbsp;URA, the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources and PUB will&nbsp;undertake other efforts to conserve our natural heritage and biodiversity:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;NParks collaborates with NGOs and academic institutions to monitor the biodiversity and health of our ecosystems;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;NParks maintains a repository of information on Singapore's natural habitats, both marine and terrestrial, and, as Dr Geh Min will know, has also recently commissioned a survey in order to update the knowledge and information in that repository;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;URA works with NParks to assess the environmental impact of development projects near our islands and, where necessary, will mandate that protective measures be put in place to&nbsp;minimise&nbsp;adverse impact.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>12.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But I also raised the question of new challenges, such as global warming.&nbsp; I saw in the <I>Straits Times</I> today an article on land erosion off East Coast and Pasir Ris Park.&nbsp; If I may have Mr Speaker's&nbsp;permission to briefly read, "When the beaches were first reclaimed, the elevated breakwaters&nbsp;were intended to protect the shore immediately behind them.&nbsp; However, it now appears that in some parts of beaches, including East Coast Park, erosion may have occurred even behind breakwaters. This could be because the height and force of the waves have been greater than anticipated."&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a strong possibility that we will have even stronger waves even though we are immune from the&nbsp;tsunami, or if we think we are.&nbsp; With all these plans, including Marina Bay, what studies have&nbsp;we done as to the impact, maybe not now, maybe not 10 years, but 20, 30 or 40 years?&nbsp; I think any developments we have, surely we want them to last and not going to be re-remade every five years, even though we review them every five years.

AVA conducts 100% inspections on poultry imports, and works with ICA and Police to guard against the smuggling of birds.

Not one of those&nbsp;full of dead things, but one which is alive, with real people, real boat building.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can bring in the craftsmen from the region.&nbsp; Let us help to sustain some of these skills and let our children, tourists and&nbsp;businesses understand where we came from and where we will be going.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, I thank Prof. Png for raising two issues, although the second one is not directly related to building maintenance as stipulated in the Order Paper Supplement.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just address the first part first.&nbsp; Prof. Png raised the issue of building maintenance, specifically in reference to the Golden Mile Complex.&nbsp; Generally, let me just say that the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (BMSMA) provides for effective maintenance and management of strata development.&nbsp; It empowers the management corporations (MCs) and subsidiary proprietors (SPs) to make decisions concerning their own estates.&nbsp; This places greater responsibility on the owners to take pride in their own estates as well as their own buildings.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the responsibilities of MCs and SPs, under the BMSMA, is that the MC is charged with the responsibility to ensure that common property is well maintained, clean and tidy.&nbsp; MCs can also introduce by-laws to regulate works to be done by SPs on private units that could affect the facade of the building.&nbsp; If the common property of a development falls into serious neglect, then the Commissioner of <p align=left>Column: 1027</p>Buildings (COB) has the authority to issue a notice to require the MC to take action to spruce up the property.&nbsp; Enforcement action could be taken if the MC does not comply.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me touch on the&nbsp;Golden Mile Complex.&nbsp; I think Members who drive along Nicoll Highway would be able to appreciate the point raised by Prof. Png, that Golden Mile Complex is an eyesore.&nbsp; It is true that external walls of the Golden Mile Complex were not adequately maintained.&nbsp; However, in February 2005, last year, the Commissioner of Buildings (COB) has issued an advisory letter requiring the MC of Golden Mile Complex to paint up and spruce up the building facade and to encourage the SPs to do likewise for their private balconies.&nbsp; The MC has been cooperative in addressing the situation.&nbsp; Works are currently in progress and I hope that when the works are completed, the complex will be more pleasing to the eyes.&nbsp; As I understand it, it is due for completion by the end of this month.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to Prof. Png's second question on Marina Bay, I think those are very good suggestions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the development of Marina Bay and the whole concept of a Garden in a City, all suggestions are welcomed.&nbsp; As we are&nbsp;still in the planning process,&nbsp;whatever suggestions that come along, the ultimate goal is to make sure that Singapore achieves the objective of a Garden in a City, that the projects and programmes do attract&nbsp;tourists and&nbsp;more people to come to Singapore and enjoy the so-called concept of Garden in the City.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> I take it that&nbsp;that was Prof. Ivan Png's clarification on my speech earlier and so maybe I should respond.&nbsp; I will&nbsp;add on to what my Parliamentary Secretary has said.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, we have to remember that Marina Bay is actually a reservoir.&nbsp; So <p align=left>Column: 1028</p>when you talk about boat-building, maritime museum and so on, we have to bear in mind that as a reservoir, access to the open sea would be restricted.&nbsp; Although there will be provisions made with a boat-lift to allow small yachts to come in, the big boats will have difficulty traversing from Marina Bay into the open sea.&nbsp; That is the first point that needs to be considered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point is that when you talk about boat-building, etc, again coming back to the point that Marina Bay is a reservoir, the impact on the quality of the water will have to be considered.&nbsp; In fact, if&nbsp;the&nbsp;Member will&nbsp;recall, there actually were boat-building activities in the Kallang area.&nbsp; In the Tanjong Rhu area there were boat-yards and shipyards all along that area before URA changed it into a residential area.&nbsp; So I think the idea of having boat-building in the Marina Bay area is probably something that is no longer relevant.&nbsp; But, having said that, as my Parliamentary Secretary said earlier, all sorts of suggestions have come in, including I must say the idea of a maritime museum and, obviously, the commercial as well as the technical feasibilities will have to be undertaken.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Will the Parliamentary Secretary please acknowledge that it is also a matter of all those unsightly extensions, glass, wood and so on?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Responding to the Hon. Minister, I was not thinking of commercial boat-building, but just demonstrative boat-building.&nbsp; All those boats are non-engine boats. They are all sail boats and so there is very little pollution.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman--><p align=left>Column: 1029</p><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</B> Sir, the issue of Golden Mile Complex is, as Prof. Png mentioned, an extreme example. It is an issue of a building that was built in the 70s and, at that time, the conditions were slightly different.&nbsp; The history of Golden Mile Complex is one.&nbsp; We have confirmed with URA that, at that time, planning approval was not required for enclosing of balconies because the balconies were included as part of the GSA at that time.&nbsp; Because of that, the BCA allows these structures to be regularised now under the Building Control Act as long&nbsp;as they do not impact on the structural safety of the building.&nbsp; The MC had actually approved&nbsp; such enclosures and facilitated their regularisation.&nbsp; It is within those constraints that right now what the Commissioner of Buildings has done is to try to make the best of what we have at this point in time.&nbsp; And sprucing up is really indeed one of the things that we could do.&nbsp; Hopefully, with sprucing up, with better facade, things would be better.&nbsp; It may not be the ideal that we want with regard to what we can see from Nicoll Highway, but&nbsp;certainly it is better than what it is today.&nbsp; Why do we not wait till they complete their work, take a look at it and see how else we can further enhance the view from Nicoll Highway as we drive up there?&nbsp;</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

That the total sum to be allocated for Head V of the&nbsp;Estimates be reduced by $100.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both MNCs and SMEs have played a significant role through the various phases of Singapore's economic transition.&nbsp; Both occupy an important position in Singapore's enterprise ecosystem in terms of generating economic growth and providing employment to Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among others, SMEs have played a pivotal role in providing support in many aspects to the MNCs and are continuing to do so to this date.&nbsp; However, with increasing competition from both developed and developing countries, many MNCs, especially manufacturing industries, are pressured by rising costs and are forced to locate to countries with lower cost.&nbsp; As a result, the dynamics in MNC-SME relationship is changing rapidly, more so with the forces of globalisation integrating the economies of the world to unprecedented level.&nbsp; However, Sir, with Singapore upgrading and transforming itself into a knowledge and innovation-driven economy, to enhance its <p align=left>Column: 1031</p>competitive and comparative advantages, combined with Singapore's excellent infrastructure, stable political environment, a steady supply of well-educated workforce and a strong intellectual property protection regime, many MNCs are finding Singapore attractive to conduct their high-end activities here.&nbsp; I believe our SMEs could leverage on these evolving changes provided that they are wary of the changing needs of the MNCs.&nbsp; Similarly, SMEs could also continue to be relevant to the MNCs even as the latter relocate their business activities to other countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we need to ensure that the special and trusted relationship between MNCs operating here over the last several decades and our SMEs is not only preserved but also strengthened.&nbsp; As such, I believe creating a platform for the two groups to meet and interact regularly will be beneficial to strengthen this relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to propose that a private sector-led initiative like the Action Committee for Entrepreneurship (ACE) be initiated for the MNC-SME segment.&nbsp; As noted by Mr Inderjit Singh during the Budget Statement debate, the progress made by ACE has been encouraging across the private sector there.&nbsp; Although a Minister chairs the Committee, his role is primarily to facilitate rather than to dictate what should be done.&nbsp; Hence, I propose that we should embrace a similar model like ACE for the facilitation of MNCs and SMEs to connect and to come together.&nbsp; Along the same lines, Spring Singapore or IE Singapore could function as a secretariat to coordinate such activities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am not speaking on the second topic on SMEs as the issue I wish to raise has been clarified under the Ministry of Law cut last week.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio)--><p align=left>Column: 1032</p><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>as what&nbsp;my colleague, Dr Ahmad Magad, just mentioned.&nbsp; As I said many times before, we need a Government agency to play this role, one with equivalent&nbsp;resources given to do a good job.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had in last year's debate talked about a LEDB,&nbsp;or&nbsp;local EDB.&nbsp; I am very confident that the results will far outweigh the cost to the Government.&nbsp; Just as the efforts of EDB have yielded the results in the area of FDI attraction and the efforts of ACE have helped in entrepreneurship, an organisation that dedicates its support to the growth of SMEs will yield similar results.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, I am worried about the type of FDIs we have been attracting lately.&nbsp; My impression is that the value add of these investments might not pay for the cost that the Government incurs, because&nbsp;the number of jobs created by these FDIs and also the amount of tax revenues the Government collects might be zero for the lifetime of such investments.&nbsp; Perhaps the Minister can share with the House the value add of the $8 billion or so FDIs that we had attracted last year, and also in&nbsp;previous years.&nbsp; I am sure that for every dollar that we spend on local companies' development and support, it&nbsp;will yield a bigger value add and return for the Government.&nbsp; I am not asking the Government to kill the efforts of the EDB but to redistribute the resources to do both jobs optimally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1033</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also do not want to belittle the efforts put in by Spring and IE Singapore in supporting SMEs.&nbsp; In fact, I sit on the board of Spring and we know that a lot of good work is done there.&nbsp; I can see the passion of the people in both of these organisations at the board and management levels, and also the staff of these two organisations.&nbsp; But I know that unless the drive starts from the top, these two organisations will not get the right level of resources to allow them to do their jobs well.&nbsp; I see the opportunity to&nbsp;merge these two organisations as a combined entity, and perhaps this may be the equivalent of the local EDB that we are asking for.&nbsp; I am sure, with the rationalisation of the efforts and the combined resources and realignment of focus, we will see greater success in our efforts to create an environment conducive for the support and growth of SMEs into large multi-nationals of the future.&nbsp; If properly funded, this enlarged entity will be able to fulfil the needs and answer the call of the equivalent agency that we have been talking about, and this call has been going on for many years.&nbsp; And if it continues for many years, it just says that we need to do a lot more, and not enough is done in this area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also like to say that in the last few years, we have done a very good job in addressing the cost issues for SMEs and companies in general.&nbsp; Now that we have restructured our economy - and companies which are surviving today are perhaps the stronger ones, and the weaker ones have probably collapsed by now -&nbsp;our next focus should therefore be on the other part of the equation, ie, the numerator side or the demand side to capture greater business opportunities from around the world.&nbsp; So, the Ministry's next focus should be on how to enable companies to capture a bigger pie of global opportunities that exist.&nbsp; The various FTAs could help show us how we <p align=left>Column: 1034</p>can do this.&nbsp; Perhaps the Minister, therefore, can clarify and share with us what successes we have had with the many FTAs that we have already signed.&nbsp; The impression that we have is that these are, so far, paper agreements with no net benefits to companies in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am also happy to note that we are increasing our efforts in promoting R&amp;D in Singapore.&nbsp; We also have had many five-year R&amp;D plans and the main beneficiaries for this have been either Government research institutes, big multi-national companies or Government-linked companies.&nbsp; We have had a very poor reach to SMEs.&nbsp; And I have talked many times in this House about how the equivalent jobs done in SMEs may not get the type of funding that MNCs may get for the jobs that they also do.&nbsp; I, therefore, ask the Minister to share with us how he hopes to ensure that the SMEs will capture a greater pie of this R&amp;D budget that the Government is setting aside.&nbsp; I hope that, this time, we will distribute the funds in a more equal manner so that our local companies have a greater chance of accessing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps we can create a focus group, quite along the lines of what Dr Ahmad Magad mentioned just now,&nbsp;that can help cultivate the development of R&amp;D in SMEs along with many other things that we want to do.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</B> Sir, there about 100,000 SMEs in Singapore and they contribute a quarter of the total value added generated in our economy.&nbsp; Clearly, they are an important sector of our Singapore economy.&nbsp; However, when it comes to Government's policies and support, they feel like&nbsp;the neglected child.&nbsp; When the multi-national companies were providing all the job opportunities up to a decade ago, SMEs were, by and large, left to their own devices.&nbsp; However, during the last recession, when MNCs shuttered their factories, closed their offices and <p align=left>Column: 1035</p>packed their bags, we started to realise the value of the SMEs in&nbsp;keeping jobs in Singapore.&nbsp; We discovered that being Singapore companies, boom or bust, they stay in Singapore.&nbsp; Unlike multinational companies, which have the EDB to look after them, there is no single Government agency championing the causes of SMEs.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Economic Development Feedback Group of the Feedback Unit, under the leadership of Mr George Abraham and Mr&nbsp;Kwek Theng Swee, has highlighted the need of the SMEs researching around the world for examples of how other governments take care of their SMEs.&nbsp; Again, at the Feedback Unit annual conference, they proposed the following recommendations&nbsp;geared towards enhancing Singapore's pro-business environment and enabling entrepreneurship.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, setting up industrial specific SMEs in industrial parks to group businesses together in a&nbsp;given location.&nbsp; This move will allow businesses to save cost.&nbsp; For instance, food and beverage companies could be grouped together for greater clout.&nbsp; For the food and beverage industry, this is important as the companies in this sector tend to be small and lack the critical mass.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, making it compulsory for small companies to join the trade association of their specific industry.&nbsp; With a bigger pool of members, such association would then muster sufficient resources to help members cooperate among themselves and look for new markets.&nbsp; This follows the principle behind the setting up of the Singapore Business Federation.&nbsp; The Federation has bigger clout but its focus is not on the SMEs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, many SMEs are small only in relative terms.&nbsp; Some SMEs, in fact, hire up to 200 people and have well-thought-out business plans.&nbsp; In executing their plans, they are often hampered by the <p align=left>Column: 1036</p>obstacles to obtain good financing.&nbsp; This matter was brought up repeatedly in the House and the Government has reacted in some way, which Mr Inderjit Singh had mentioned, and these are well appreciated by the SMEs.&nbsp; However, the Economic Development Feedback Group still feels that more could be done.&nbsp; For instance, the Feedback Group looked at Japan and discovered that there is a government-sponsored financial institution specifically set up to provide financial loans to SMEs and start-ups.&nbsp; I hope the Singapore Government could also adopt the same model of helping SMEs, especially the start-up companies.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Chairman--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

(1) <p align=left>Column: 1044</p>Increase national R&amp;D spending to 3% of GDP; (2) Increase the private sector share of R&amp;D to two-thirds; (3) Increase research manpower to catch up with Sweden and Japan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a researcher, I applaud investments in R&amp;D.&nbsp; However, as an economist, I worry about two aspects of the R&amp;D plan.&nbsp; First, the key targets&nbsp;are&nbsp;inputs.&nbsp; I and,&nbsp;I think, most economists and other policy makers would rather aim at output targets.&nbsp; Let me propose the following alternative, increase our growth rate of multi-factor productivity to the top quartile in the OECD.&nbsp; Sir, please refer to the chart which is being distributed by Parliament staff.&nbsp; You will see Singapore's multi-factor productivity growth right at the end on the right hand side.&nbsp; It leaves much to be improved.&nbsp; Over the period, 1990 to 2002, we were placed just above the OECD median, at about slightly under 1%.&nbsp; Sir, we are much more flexible and dynamic than many of these OECD countries.&nbsp; Yet, our productivity growth pales by comparison.&nbsp; So&nbsp;instead of aiming at national R&amp;D spending be 3% of GDP, let us aim that our growth rate of multi-factor productivity be in the top quartile of the OECD.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my second worry.&nbsp; The Science and Technology Plan 2010 increases A*STAR's budget by over 20% from $4 billion to $5.15 billion. It creates a National Research Foundation on a budget of $5 billion.&nbsp; I worry about the ability of our research organisation to make good use of a sharp increase in funds.&nbsp; Let me give an analogy.&nbsp; Suppose that we are running at 7 km&nbsp;an hour, and we want to accelerate to 10 km&nbsp;an hour. Yes, if we want to run faster, we must eat more.&nbsp; But the additional food must be calibrated according to how fast we are running, not just stuffing in food and hoping we can run faster. Indeed, I have heard talk of a "feeding frenzy" as foreign researchers swarm to Singapore for the rich research funding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1045</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, A*STAR's performance indicators include the number of patent applications and industry funding.&nbsp; Again, the number of patents has the flavour of an output target.&nbsp;It is just a matter of how much money you put into filing applications.&nbsp; Let me propose an alternative indicator which, I think, would be more reflective&nbsp;-&nbsp;the royalty income from patents and commercialisation. After all, we are not interested in collecting pieces of paper but rather their economic impact.&nbsp; So let us measure the royalty income.&nbsp; I do applaud A*STAR's focus on industry funding as a performance measure.&nbsp; That is great!&nbsp; But let me suggest another one. Besides industry funding, let us also measure A*STAR by the amount of co-funding of A*STAR's research by foreign national agencies and international agencies, for instance, the US National Science Foundation, the US Defence Advance Research Projects Agency, the European Union and the various UN organisations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

It is necessary to look into how these research resources will be used to transform Singapore into an R&amp;D driven economy with the outputs that we wish to achieve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, in attracting and recruiting world-renowned scientists to Singapore, it has been reported recently in the local media that what attracted these scientists were Singapore's offer of "direct funding, less restrictive rules for research and the freedom to commercialise their science".&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1046</p>A web-based magazine, however, reported that Singapore offers "unrestricted research, top-notch equipment and limitless funds" to these scientists, as long as they agree to relocate to Singapore.&nbsp; How contrasting this is!&nbsp; It has also been reported that Singapore promises these foreign renowned scientists world-class laboratories and more than enough money to pursue work that is not fundable, or is too controversial back in the home countries of these scientists.&nbsp; So far, this has worked and many "whales" have been caught by our local research agency.&nbsp; They are renowned researchers from the US, Japan and&nbsp;UK who have made their names in cancer and life science research, including Sirs and a Nobel Laureate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is nothing wrong in attracting renowned foreign scientists to Singapore, and I agree with the Prime Minister that we should attract foreign R&amp;D talents.&nbsp; But I think we have to ask ourselves a few questions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) If a world-renowned scientist is not able or faces certain difficulties to find grants to support a certain research work back home in his own country, there must be some reasons and important factors to it, and we should analyse carefully before we throw in&nbsp;huge amounts of money for this scientist to come to Singapore and conduct the research work here.&nbsp; A different angle to view this is: is the Singapore Government offering them huge sums of research grants without requiring them to clearly state their research objectives and deliverables in the form of writing research grants?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In attracting these world-renowned scientists with huge research grants and salaries, what are the key performance indicators that we have set for them to meet, and within what kind of a timeframe do these scientists have to deliver what they promise?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1047</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Have excessive money and research grants been paid to "catch these whales"? Will these "whales" turn into "ikan bilis" after a while?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Is "buying scientists" the right approach for Singapore to put us on the world map of R&amp;D?&nbsp; How many such scientists can Singapore "buy" as each may cost at least a few millions, considering the salaries and&nbsp;research grants that have been paid to them?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Have we given a different treatment to the foreign scientists as compared to home-grown researchers in research grant application and approval?&nbsp; Many foreign scientists have echoed in the various media reports that Singapore's quick access to funding, speedy grant approvals and lack of burdensome paperwork are the attractions for them to relocate here.&nbsp; This seems to contradict what local researchers have experienced.&nbsp; Often, we hear from local researchers that they need to write grant applications to the research agency, fulfil burdensome paperwork and the grant approval, if successful, will usually only come maybe nine months or a year later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have no quibble over these measures or quick access to funding, speedy grant approvals and less paperwork.&nbsp; My plea is only for equal treatment, not to favour the foreign scientists and therefore discriminate against the local R&amp;D talents.&nbsp; We are not asking for special favours, we are only asking for the chance to compete equally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scientific research today is increasingly about access to grants and rewards, such as fame, prizes and commercial spin-offs,</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

We will make sure it is well spent."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, as the Prime Minister has said, we need to get the appropriate performance measures, because how we measure influences what people will do.&nbsp; We need to have a coherent set of KPIs to measure the achievement of the comprehensive R&amp;D strategy that will be implemented.&nbsp; We should not be relying on winning awards and competitions alone, or the total&nbsp;number of research publications and citations count.&nbsp; We should also not be too skewed towards commercialisation of technologies and ideas as this would influence the research towards a more downstream development work.&nbsp; What we need is a range of indicators, such as the number of publications, citation counts, patents filed, patent commercialised, research dollar attracted from industry, investment dollar attracted for IP commercialisation, etc.&nbsp; This whole range of indicators should not be applied equally to all institutions conducting research work.&nbsp; Rather, it should depend on the institution, whether it is a university, polytechnic or RI.&nbsp; A different combination of these indicators should be applied to measure the research output.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1049</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, much funds set aside for R&amp;D have been spent on development of expensive iconic buildings, such as the $500 million Biopolis and the $700 million Fusionpolis.&nbsp; In the Science and Technology Plan 2010, 3% of the total R&amp;D budget will be spent on such infrastructures.&nbsp; Sir, what will put us on the world map of R&amp;D is not the iconic building that costs millions to build and millions to maintain, but the research output in terms of breakthroughs, patents, commercialised products, IPs and technology transfers from RIs to the industry.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Wang Kai Yuen--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The Singapore Government has earmarked some $12 billion to finance public sector R&amp;D activities for the five-year period starting from 2006 to 2010.&nbsp; This is more than double the amount of the previous five-year period.&nbsp; Of this amount, $5 billion has been allocated to the National Research Foundation.&nbsp; This seems like a lot of money.&nbsp; After all, the Progress Package that we just announced for every Singaporean only amounted to $2.6 billion.&nbsp; Yet, compared to what other nations spend on R&amp;D, it is still small change.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, in my view, Sir, picking up the winners in the early phase of the game becomes very important.&nbsp; Yet, doing so is extremely difficult, especially when civil servants picked to do the job need to ensure that public money is properly accounted for.&nbsp; Thus, in the past, we tended to allocate funds to the public sector R&amp;D institutes affiliated to the various universities.&nbsp; So, perhaps our culture and mindset need to be changed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1050</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have just noted that Dr John Chen spoke with the aid of a computer.&nbsp;

Many Members&nbsp;have spoken about how we can help our&nbsp;local enterprises, as well as the importance of research and development (R&amp;D).&nbsp; These are indeed two areas that will strengthen our competitiveness in the coming years, and where we will be giving more emphasis over the next five years.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to divide the issues raised into two levels.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the macro level, Members have suggested ways to improve our competitiveness and adjustments to our economic policies.&nbsp; I think all of us&nbsp;agree that the Singapore economy has recovered and the prospects are&nbsp;positive.&nbsp; We are ranked very high in terms of competitiveness, effective tax rates, ease in doing business, quality of infrastructure, and our connectivity.&nbsp; We also have a strong pipeline of investments, our trade growth is robust and our tourism receipts are growing.&nbsp; Furthermore, with our focus on R&amp;D and investment in&nbsp;our talent, I am confident that our competitiveness would be reinforced.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, at the second level, I sense that Members would like to see how our economic policies and programmes can be <p align=left>Column: 1051</p>effectively implemented to help our companies grow and create jobs.&nbsp; I agree completely with Members.&nbsp; We must ensure that our strong GDP is translated into growth opportunities for our companies, that more FTAs mean more export opportunities, and&nbsp;that higher R&amp;D spending results in technology upgrading in our companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate as I respond to the comments raised by Members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all,&nbsp;Dr Ahmad Magad has suggested a platform for the MNCs and SMEs to regularly meet and interact.&nbsp; I agree with him that we should strengthen the economic linkages between the MNCs and the SMEs.&nbsp; One such platform is the EDB's Local Industry Upgrading Programme (LIUP), where MNCs form strategic partnerships with their SME suppliers and other companies.&nbsp; It is a win-win partnership.&nbsp; MNCs can build up a strong supplier base supporting their requirements, while the SMEs can avail themselves of the MNCs' technical and managerial expertise to upgrade and be more competitive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last five years, the LIUP has assisted some 670 local companies.&nbsp; One good example is Baxter Healthcare SA and its group of local suppliers.&nbsp; Baxter manufactures medical products, such as intravenous sets and renal pumps.&nbsp; Under the LIUP programme, Baxter has worked to develop the suppliers' capabilities through knowledge transfers and promotion of quality standards.&nbsp; Last year, for example, it conducted two training sessions for 24 of its local suppliers to equip them with the ability to supply quality predictive tools to streamline their manufacturing processes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Members will remember, this is how we built up the electronics industry over 30 years.&nbsp; The MNCs provided the base that led to the development of the local precision engineering industry, which comprises many SMEs serving the tooling <p align=left>Column: 1052</p>and component needs of the MNCs.&nbsp; Some of our SMEs later grew and internationalised, such as Unisteel and Seksun.&nbsp; Others became contract manufacturers, such as MMI.&nbsp; The vibrant local precision engineering industry in turn attracted more electronics MNCs, and further strengthened our electronics cluster.&nbsp; The supply chain management for electronic products gave the logistics sector a boost, with several SMEs growing to become sizeable regional logistics players, such as Accord Express Holdings.&nbsp; Not only that, it has also given rise to a huge electronics international wholesaling and trading cluster in Singapore, creating more&nbsp;business opportunities for additional&nbsp;local companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This same story is repeated in our chemicals, transport engineering and biomedical sciences (BMS) clusters.&nbsp; Increasingly, we are seeing the spill-over of such linkages across clusters.&nbsp; For instance, the local precision engineering industry, which started off supporting the electronics industry, is now also serving new growth areas like the medical technology, aerospace and automotive industries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second suggestion put up by several Members, such as Dr Tan Boon Wan, Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Lawrence Leow, is how to help our companies go overseas.&nbsp; They have suggested&nbsp;two approaches:&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;by banding together, such as through consortiums; and&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;Mr Lawrence Leow suggested going together, also as a cluster, in the same location.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is something that IE Singapore fully supports.&nbsp; By banding together, our companies&nbsp;increase their chances of success.&nbsp; Through the iPartners programme, IE encourages the formation of strategic alliances among our local&nbsp;companies, both the large and the&nbsp;small enterprises.&nbsp; Last year, for example, IE supported 12 new alliances, comprising <p align=left>Column: 1053</p>60 companies, which are expected to generate over S$415 million in overseas sales.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such alliance is the Singapore Building and Infrastructure Consortium (SBIC).&nbsp; Led by SembCorp Engineers and Constructors Pte Ltd and DP Architects Pte Ltd, the consortium is targeting the Middle East market.&nbsp; Collectively, the 14 consortium members represent the complete value chain for the building and construction sector, from master-planning, engineering, consultancy, construction to procurement.&nbsp; This enables the SBIC to present an integrated team capable of delivering complete solutions, thereby boosting their chances of success, especially&nbsp;in securing larger contracts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LIUP programme and the iPartners programme illustrate that our approach to developing our SMEs is a painstaking one, involving sector by sector, consortium by consortium.&nbsp; We cannot just wave a magic wand and every SME will be helped.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh proposed establishing a Local EDB, while Dr Wang Kai Yuen suggested also centralising help to the SMEs.&nbsp; I remember reading in the newspapers&nbsp;that Dr Ong Chit Chung, during the Budget debate, had said that SMEs were like Cinderellas and called on the Government to send in a Prince Charming to transform Cinderella into a princess.&nbsp; But we have 120,000 SME Cinderellas in all shapes and sizes, and&nbsp;they all wear different sizes of glass slippers.&nbsp; They range from our neighbourhood stores, to bigger names like Osim, Inter-Roller and HTL.&nbsp; It is hard to imagine that a&nbsp;single agency can be a&nbsp;Prince Charming, with the full breadth and depth of sectoral knowledge and domain expertise to fully cater to all our SMEs' needs.&nbsp; For example, we need BCA's involvement to help our&nbsp;SMEs in the <p align=left>Column: 1054</p>construction and renovation sector;&nbsp; IDA's help&nbsp;for IT and media development; and WDA's help&nbsp;for workforce upgrading and retraining.&nbsp; Hence, the more sensible approach of developing our&nbsp;SMEs is to adopt a&nbsp;"whole-of-government" approach rather than a single agency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have done is to appoint Spring as the overall champion for SMEs.&nbsp; Spring will leverage on the strengths and expertise of the other agencies to provide holistic and integrated services to our SMEs, in line with the vision of "Many Agencies, One Government".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A concrete result of this integrated, multi-agency approach is the recent launch of EnterpriseOne, which stands for "One Network for Enterprises".&nbsp; The portal at www.business.gov.sg is a Government-wide initiative managed by Spring in partnership with business chambers and industry associations.&nbsp; It enhances the SMEs' access to business information, Government e-services from more than 30 agencies, and advisory and consultative services.&nbsp; I urge Members to give it a try and I welcome your feedback on the effectiveness and&nbsp;usefulness of this portal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second pillar of the EnterpriseOne initiative is the network of Enterprise Development Centres (EDCs) that are being set up.&nbsp; These EDCs are run by the various business chambers and associations, and they offer business advisory and consultancy services.&nbsp; Today, SMEs can visit any one of the&nbsp;three EDCs at the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises, the Singapore Manufacturers' Federation and the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lawrence Leow has asked about the Government's long-term plans for these EDCs.&nbsp; The idea of EDCs was actually prompted by industry's calls for a consultancy or advisory panel which <p align=left>Column: 1055</p>SMEs can turn to for business advice, be it to upgrade, expand or venture overseas.&nbsp; Recognising that most SMEs will not be able to afford</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

As each chamber and association has a specific business focus, the EDC so formed will similarly have its own focus and area of specialisation.&nbsp; For example, the EDC at the Singapore Manufacturers' Federation focuses on mainly manufacturing-related diagnostic and consultancy services, while the one at the Singapore Chinese Chamber provides comprehensive advice on doing business in China.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, as Mr Lawrence Leow has pointed out, the Government has provided co-funding support to defray the set-up costs for the EDCs.&nbsp; In the longer-term, we hope that the EDCs will evolve into thriving centres for business information and knowledge exchange, sufficiently valued by the SMEs that they become an integral part of the chambers and the industry associations. The Government will thus work closely with the EDCs to help them succeed and be commercially viable and sustainable over time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, the next level of our support is working with the industry associations to develop vibrant industry clusters. The industry associations know the business environment, the challenges and issues faced by the SME members much better than the Government does. Thus, by working with them and&nbsp;through them, we can better reach out and target our assistance to our SMEs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp;was with&nbsp;this in mind that the Government launched the $50 million <p align=left>Column: 1056</p>Local Enterprise and Association Development&nbsp; (LEAD) programme to support able and willing industry associations in spearheading industry development efforts.&nbsp; The LEAD programme has had very good success to date. So far, the Government has approved grants of more than $20 million to six associations in industries such as the restaurant industry, the food manufacturing industry, furniture, textile and garment, process industry and the precision engineering sector.&nbsp; These projects are expected to add more than S$800 million to the economy and create more than 4,000 new jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have given examples of these previously in the House of the work done by the food manufacturers and the textile and garment and furniture industry associations.&nbsp; I think Members would also have read newspaper reports, the most recent one by the Furniture Association of&nbsp;their plans to develop Sungei Kadut to improve design and to increase their export opportunities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me today give you another example, the Print and Media Association of Singapore.&nbsp; Some may perceive printing as a sunset industry in Singapore because of our high labour costs.&nbsp; But our printing companies have been very resilient, surviving downturns and strong competition by finding niches for themselves and moving towards high value print jobs.&nbsp; For example CS Graphics prints fine quality art books for key clients such as the Metropolitan Museum of Arts.&nbsp; Another group of local printing companies has come together, such as Fabulous Printers, COS Printers and Markono Print Media, in order to support Blackwell Publishing, one of the world's leading scientific, technical and medical journal publishers.&nbsp; Blackwell is drawn to our local printers because of their quality and their competitive prices, as well as Singapore's strong supply chain capabilities, which enable them to quickly <p align=left>Column: 1057</p>distribute their journals worldwide.&nbsp; Some of our printers not only do the printing, but also maintain a website and fulfil the orders for Blackwell.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, let me now turn to specific areas where SMEs need help. The first area is financing. We have been systematically improving the financing infrastructure for enterprises by plugging the funding gaps through a mixture of loans and equity schemes.&nbsp; For this, I would like to thank Mr Inderjit Singh and the Financing Crucible of the Action Community&nbsp;for Entrepreneurship (ACE) for their contributions and effort.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year alone saw the launch of several new financing schemes.&nbsp; Among them&nbsp;is the SME ACCESS Loan to help SMEs, especially under-served enterprises without collateral or with a limited track record.&nbsp; To date, over S$100 million in loans have been extended to more than 400 SMEs.&nbsp;&nbsp;To spur greater angel investments, EDB has also recently launched the $30 million Business Angel Scheme. This was launched in September last year.&nbsp; In October last year, IE Singapore started the Trade Credit Insurance Programme, which offers premium trade credit insurance rates through the pooling of demand. The scheme has already benefited more than 270 companies with&nbsp;a total volume of sales insured amounting to over $45 million in just three months.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to work on improving the access of our enterprises to financing.&nbsp; I think in PM's response in the Budget debate, he gave&nbsp;Members a printout of several sheets of all the schemes and we welcome feedback from Members on how to improve these financing schemes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Wang Kai Yuen suggested that the Government could consider a single Government-funded institution to provide <p align=left>Column: 1058</p>financing to the SMEs. Currently, there are already many private sector financial institutions which are providing loans to SMEs.&nbsp; In fact, more banks are recognising the potential of the SME market and&nbsp;have set up specialised teams to focus on SME customers.&nbsp;For the Government to set up its own SME banking or financial institution to compete against the private sector will be against the "Yellow Pages Rule".&nbsp; The Government has instead partnered some 16 financial institutions to administer the loans to our SMEs, so that we can leverage on their market expertise as well as to foster the start of hopefully a lasting banking relationship between the SMEs and the financial institutions. This win-win arrangement has worked well so far.&nbsp; Over the past five years, Spring and IE Singapore have worked with financial institutions to facilitate more than $3.1 billion worth of loans to more than 12,500 companies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What the Government in fact can do is to designate more financial resources to help our local enterprises grow.&nbsp; This is indeed what we are prepared to do.&nbsp; I am happy to announce that the Government will set aside $3.9 billion over the next five years&nbsp;(FY2006-2010) for this purpose.&nbsp; Grants will take up $900 million, an increase of 35% over the previous five years. &nbsp;The remaining $3 billion will be in loans, and&nbsp;through partnerships with our various financial institutions, this is expected to catalyse more than $6 billion worth of loan financing, almost 60% more than the previous five years.&nbsp; So we are prepared to put more resources to support our local companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second area in helping our companies is to encourage them and facilitate them to expand overseas.&nbsp; I mentioned just now about the consortiums.&nbsp; Let me also briefly outline what IE Singapore is doing to help our companies go overseas.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1059</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IE does so through a 3C framework - Competency, Capital and Connections.&nbsp; For example, last year, IE Singapore helped some 32,000 companies through its services and its activities.&nbsp; Let me highlight some of the key initiatives under each of these 3Cs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Competency involves helping our companies to build up capabilities so that they can compete more effectively in overseas markets.&nbsp; Last year, some 1,900 companies leveraged on IE's capability-building programmes, particularly in branding, design and international manpower development.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important that companies formulate a viable market strategy before entering any new market.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internationalisation Roadmapping Programme was launched early this year to help companies develop long-term business planning strategies as part of their internationalisation plans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The second "C" is Capital.&nbsp; Coupled with other inroads that we have made on supporting financing, we have also promoted the Regionalisation Finance Scheme, which is a fixed interest loan scheme.&nbsp; Since 2001, it has committed over $54 million in loans, benefiting some 43 companies as at end 2005.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The third "C" is Connections.&nbsp; SMEs, in particular, need help to enter into overseas markets. To build connections, SMEs can participate in outgoing missions and fairs organised by IE Singapore as well as IE Singapore's networking platforms, namely, Network China, Network Indonesia and Network India.&nbsp; Companies can also tap on the International Marketing Activities Programme which supports the activities organised by trade associations and chambers, or the Pathfinder Scheme for Distribution, which helps exporters by <p align=left>Column: 1060</p>matching them with overseas intermediaries who have extensive local business networks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Lawrence Leow suggested that our SMEs can go together and find suitable locations when they go overseas.&nbsp; I think this is indeed what many have done, not directly through the Government but indirectly.&nbsp; As you know,&nbsp; Singapore companies have helped built industrial estates&nbsp;in Batam, Bintan, Vietnam, China and India. Many of our SMEs find comfort in operating in many of these industrial estates developed by our local companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, there are other plans to develop SEZs, both in Indonesia, in India and further afield&nbsp;also in Russia.&nbsp; If companies find that this is sensible strategy to locate in business districts and industrial estates developed by Singapore companies, then this is one strategy they can pursue.&nbsp; But I would be loath to concentrate all our resources just in one or two industrial estates and encourage or direct all our companies to go there.&nbsp; We should allow our companies to diversify and go to different industrial estates and different countries to pursue their opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to another area which is the FTAs. So far, we have signed 11 FTAs. Mr Inderjit Singh asked exactly how our companies have benefited from the FTAs.&nbsp; I would say in several ways. First, the FTAs gave our companies a competitive advantage through the elimination or reduction of the tariff as well as non-tariff barriers.&nbsp; Second, the FTAs can help our companies gain access to emerging markets such as India and the Middle East.&nbsp;Finally, our&nbsp;FTAs contain safeguards to provide our companies with better protection when they venture overseas. This protection can include guarantees on repatriation of capital and profits, as well as investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms.&nbsp; But I believe we can do more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1061</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to help our companies take advantage of all these benefits, MTI and its partner agencies have been reaching out to the business community through various activities and programmes, eg, seminars, workshops and guide books.&nbsp; A dedicated FTA website has also been set up.&nbsp;This year, IE Singapore has established a special unit to help companies leverage on&nbsp;FTAs. This special unit will not only organise seminars and provide general information, but also provide the individual company with consultations, to show them exactly how they can make full use of the FTAs for the products that they are producing and exporting.&nbsp; I therefore encourage our businessmen to take advantage of these resources and make full use of these FTAs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr John Chen has also asked whether the FTAs have been successful or helpful for us in bringing investments into Singapore and he&nbsp;mentioned&nbsp;particularly the case of China.&nbsp; I would say that Singapore's extensive FTA networks have added to our overall value proposition in attracting investments to Singapore.&nbsp;</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>In fact, when EDB officers approach the various clients, they&nbsp;actively market our strong network of FTAs when highlighting&nbsp;our strengths to potential investors.&nbsp;When they make client calls on the&nbsp; companies they will, in fact, work out what the FTAs can offer these companies and talk directly with the company executives on how if they invest in Singapore they can take advantage of these FTAs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also&nbsp;work with companies to identify the areas where our FTAs are able to offer a preferential edge over other competing investment locations, be they in terms of tariff savings or investment protection.&nbsp; And we have had some successes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an illustration.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1062</p>A leading US manufacturer of oilfield drilling equipment doubled its manufacturing plant capacity in Singapore.&nbsp; It did so because the tariff savings from the US-Singapore FTA, combined with Singapore's logistics infrastructure and our competitive costs, made it more economical for it to manufacture here and export to the US.&nbsp; So, even though the tariff saving is only a few percentage points, this has increased its margin and swayed the decision for it to expand in Singapore rather than in the US.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, overall, I would say the FTAs have added value to Singapore's attractiveness as an investment location.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to some of the other issues raised by Members.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching has asked for an update of the SBF.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will remember&nbsp;that the SBF was set up in 2002&nbsp;to create an apex organisation to represent Singapore's business interests more effectively, locally and abroad.&nbsp; SBF membership was made mandatory as the earlier practice of voluntary membership by business chambers and associations had not been effective.&nbsp; Compulsory membership will ensure that SBF has a strong membership base, and has the mandate of the entire business community.&nbsp; Compulsory membership of business chambers or business associations at the apex level is not uncommon.&nbsp; France, Germany and Brazil also have this practice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However,&nbsp;only local companies with paid-up capital and foreign companies with authorised capital of $0.5 million and above are required to be members of the SBF.&nbsp; Small companies, partnerships, sole proprietors and companies without any employees are exempted.&nbsp; As a result, SBF has exempted some 142,000 companies and another 140,000 partnerships and sole proprietors.&nbsp; In fact, SBF has only a membership of 15,046 which constitutes just 9.6% of all companies in Singapore.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1063</p>So, even though we make it compulsory, through this exemption process, the membership profile of SBS only constitutes 10% of all companies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, if you look at these 15,000 companies, about 11,500 of them&nbsp;have paid up/authorised share capital of less than $5 million.&nbsp; And, therefore, their annual fees range from $300 to $400 per year, or&nbsp;about $1 a day.&nbsp; So I do not think this is a very heavy financial burden.&nbsp; As you know, the SBF has had only&nbsp;four years of operation.&nbsp; It is young by any standard of a business association.&nbsp; So I urge Members and other businesses to give SBF a chance to develop.&nbsp; In due course,&nbsp;we will do a stock-take and&nbsp;encourage the SBF to find ways where it can provide value to its members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the question raised by Prof. Ivan Pang&nbsp;about the performance measures that we use to evaluate the Economic Development Assistance Scheme (EDAS) and also Mr Inderjit Singh's comment about the value of the FDIs that we have attracted to Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you know, attracting FDIs is a very important component of our investment and development strategies. Even though Singapore is a capital-surplus country we believe that the foreign direct investment into Singapore is very important because it not only brings in capital but, more importantly, it brings in technology and gives us access to export markets.&nbsp; The Prime Minister also explained during the Budget response that we are in a very different environment nowadays.&nbsp; We are competing for foreign direct investments not just with the other emerging economies but also with the developed countries as well. So the Economic Development Assistance Scheme (EDAS) is a very important&nbsp; tool by which the EDB uses to bring in foreign investments to Singapore.&nbsp; And EDB goes about it in evaluating whether the EDAS is to be used through four key indicators.&nbsp; EDB <p align=left>Column: 1064</p>will look at, for manufacturing,&nbsp;the Fixed Asset Investments that the foreign investor is bringing in and,&nbsp;for services, the Total Business Spending arising from investor's commitments in Singapore.&nbsp; In the evaluation, EDB will also estimate the value-added and also the number of new jobs generated as a result of these investments.&nbsp; As the Prime Minister indicated, as long as all these items are in the positive, generate jobs, create value-add, then we are prepared to provide EDAS and other incentives to bring in the investments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So over the last five years, EDB attracted $42.5 billion in manufacturing Fixed Asset Investments and $10.6 billion in services Total Business Spending.&nbsp; These investment commitments will create a total value add of $50.4 billion per year and 110,000 new jobs when fully realised.&nbsp; Of the 110,000 jobs created, 71% will be skilled and professional.&nbsp; So it is very important for us that this pipeline of investments continues to give strength to our economy, add to the value-add and help generate jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Ivan Png has suggested that we consider a tax revenue budget to manage revenue loss through tax incentives.&nbsp; As I have explained earlier, we are in a&nbsp;very competitive environment.&nbsp; We have to&nbsp;compete with both the developed countries, as well as with the emerging countries for such investments.&nbsp; Our tax incentives are also granted by tying the companies to new investments.&nbsp; If we had not provided these incentives, the companies could have taken their investment to competing locations.&nbsp; We would, therefore, not have collected the taxes to begin with.&nbsp; But, nevertheless, we will look at his idea of a tax revenue budget to see whether it can be used to complement our methods of evaluating the investment proposals that we want to attract to Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1065</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final question I would like to address is research and development.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Prime Minister highlighted in his Budget debate round-up speech, R&amp;D is a major effort and we are undertaking to transform our economy by building a strong foundation for our sustainable growth and competitiveness.&nbsp; Going forward, in a global knowledge-based economy, competition will not be simply&nbsp;about lowering costs but, increasingly, it is about talent and creating value. &nbsp;So, I think all Members are agreed that building up our&nbsp;R&amp;D capability is, therefore, a crucial piece of securing our economic future.&nbsp; There will be risks, but it is something we have to do.&nbsp; I think what Members are more concerned about is how do we go about investing our R&amp;D funds in a way that will deliver the output that we desire.&nbsp; If you look at R&amp;D, and this is a very complicated subject, based on the interventions by Members, you can see that there is&nbsp;great difficulty in measuring the output of R&amp;D because this is a very long term process.&nbsp; But we have to be bold and we have to take this step to invest heavily in our R&amp;D effort.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically, if you look at comparisons among various countries, it is always easier to compare the inputs, the percentage of GDP devoted to R&amp;D or the amount of funds or resources, both the public and private sectors, put into R&amp;D.&nbsp; When you start looking at output, I think the indicators are more difficult to arrive at.&nbsp; The easy output indicators will be, for example, the number of research scientists and engineers that are active in the country.&nbsp; I think, on this measure, Singapore has done well through our successive Science and Technology Plan (S&amp;T).&nbsp; The number of research scientists and engineers in Singapore has progressively been increased.&nbsp; I think that puts us in a very strong position, going forward, because R&amp;D is all about talent <p align=left>Column: 1066</p>and we need to build up our local talent to undertake&nbsp;R&amp;D.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Ivan Png also suggested other measures.&nbsp; Let me just go through some of them.&nbsp; He suggested&nbsp;using the Multi-Factor Productivity as an indicator.&nbsp; Prof. Ivan Png is an economist, I am not, but my little knowledge of MFP indicates that it is not really a measure of productivity alone.&nbsp; So the table he showed is not a measure of the low productivity of Singapore economy.&nbsp; If you look at the productivity parameter, in fact, Singapore has done fairly well.&nbsp; But when you look at Multi-Factor Productivity, this factor is really any GDP growth that cannot be attributed to changes in labour or capital inputs and so it is a very illusive concept and an illusive parameter to measure.&nbsp; Perhaps what we need is a research grant to see how MFP can be used as a way of measuring the competitiveness or the productivity of the economy.&nbsp; But I know that MFP does not specifically measure R&amp;D output.&nbsp; That much I know.&nbsp; But how we can use MFP to measure the effectiveness of R&amp;D, that is something that we have to study further.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Ivan Png also suggested that we look at the grants that we are able to secure from overseas R&amp;D agencies as one way of measuring performance.&nbsp; I think this is a valid point and, in fact, A*STAR agencies and research institutes have been fairly successful in securing fundings from other national and international agencies, such as the US National Institute of Health, the US Defence Advance Research Project Agency (DARPA), and also from the European Commission.&nbsp; I think this reflects well on us on several counts.&nbsp; One, it shows that our standards of research are high.&nbsp; Two, it shows that some of the areas that we are collaborating in are also in areas which these agencies are interested in.&nbsp; But I will be concerned if we use this as a primary factor of the <p align=left>Column: 1067</p>effectiveness of research because if we send the wrong signals to our research agencies, if they pursue this factor, then I think what they will be doing is that they will be aligning our research objectives in line with all these agencies in order to get their funding.&nbsp; And I am not sure this is entirely the right thing for us to do because, as a small country with competencies in different areas, we do want our research directed at different sectors.&nbsp; So, this ability to secure fundings from international and other national agencies is a useful way to collaborate, that we are&nbsp;reaching certain standards and that we are doing things right, but I would not want to make this the primary output factor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the main issue that we need to address, going forward, in R&amp;D is, one, we must put in more resources, if we want to be in the game.&nbsp; We have to take the risk.&nbsp; If we are very cautious,&nbsp;we run the risk of losing out.&nbsp; Two, we want to make sure these&nbsp;resources are invested in the right areas and this requires both a bottom-up as well as a top-down process.&nbsp; The bottom-up process involves us tapping a big panel of research experts to draw upon the expertise and to understand which are the areas that we should invest in.&nbsp;

And if we can get by without giving the potential investor the incentives,&nbsp;the Member can be assured that EDB and JTC would not do so.&nbsp; So, if&nbsp;we look at our track record, MTI and EDB would generally ask for a significantly large EDAS budget, because we need a fairly significant war chest to be able to go out and promote Singapore and to attract investments.&nbsp; But if&nbsp;we look at the actual expenditure, in terms of equity, grants and loans,&nbsp;we will find that, in fact, it is a very small percentage of the budget that is granted to MTI and EDB.&nbsp; I think this should reassure Members that we adopt a very disciplined&nbsp;and focused approach in our attempts to bring in investments.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We try not to give specific numbers because, as I said, we are in a very competitive environment.&nbsp;

Beyond easier access to funds and beyond stepped-up education about entrepreneurship, radical entrepreneurship initiatives require strong persistence and encouragement.&nbsp; For example, in the creative industry, cost of talent and developing commercialisable products are high, and developing such may cut across the ups and downs of business cycle.&nbsp; We certainly would not want to see our entrepreneurs giving up all their efforts when they are just ripe on the edge of success but do not go on.&nbsp; This is where I would like to ask the Government to do more by providing them the necessary support, which includes mentoring for business continuity, helping connect them with appropriate sources of funds and providing them with grants for protection of their intellectual properties.&nbsp; Provisions of such support will ensure that the entrepreneurs could be focused on their product development and, subsequently, successfully bring their products to the market in the shortest possible time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Inderjit Singh:</B> Sir, the Government has had a significant impact on the economic landscape of the country, and in the promotion of entrepreneurship, when the Government decided that creating local companies was as important as attracting foreign MNCs. Our effort has resulted in the creation of ACE, and we have seen very good successes in&nbsp;a number of areas.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a few questions in this regard.&nbsp; One is very specific and it is on the issue <p align=left>Column: 1071</p>of the 60-plus Government incentive schemes. I had taken on the task, together with my committee, to review them, and we have made proposals to MTI.&nbsp; Perhaps the Minister can give us an update on whether some of the recommendations made are useful and will be adopted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue of financing has also been widely discussed.&nbsp; Many Members have always brought this up in any discussion that we have during feedback sessions.&nbsp; This comes out as a big issue.&nbsp; As the Minister has mentioned, I&nbsp;also believe, from my latest feedback, that we have a tremendous progress in this area, the latest being the approval of the OTC and also the Business Angel Fund that the Minister mentioned a while ago.&nbsp; But I believe that one area that the Government could do better is the way that risk capital is looked at and utilised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We spent about US$1 billion some years ago to attract foreign VCs into Singapore.&nbsp; I am not too sure if we have achieved the desired outcome.&nbsp; The reason I say this is because the&nbsp;anecdotal evidence seems to indicate that many of the VCs that we attracted into Singapore seem to be more actively investing in companies outside Singapore, and they have made very few investments in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;Could we, therefore,&nbsp;have designed things a bit differently to achieve better results in creating and supporting more local enterprises?&nbsp; But, as in most cases, caution seems to be the order of the day when it comes to support for local SMEs and local entrepreneurs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, risk capital is risk capital, and the Government should be contented if it does not make too much returns, not as much as what typical VCs make.&nbsp; And this has been the example that was brought up by some Members, the model that Korea and perhaps in the US where the government spends more money to do a developmental type of role.&nbsp; When it <p align=left>Column: 1072</p>comes to putting money into GLCs and VCs, the Government has been more gung-ho than putting it into local companies.&nbsp; And we seem to have also made some spectacular losses in investment in VCs as well as some GLCs.&nbsp; Whereas in the area of LEFS, which is the loan scheme that the Minister mentioned, I think the Government has made good returns when they should have been contented with just breakeven type of returns since, again, it is a developmental type of&nbsp;role that the Government plays.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, in the area of economic planning, I feel that it has been too much of a one-way process where we have the Government thinking&nbsp;and deciding the type of industries to develop.&nbsp; Of course, EDB and the planning agencies in the Government have done a good job over the years.&nbsp; But I think&nbsp;we could have a greater involvement of the private sector in planning the future of our economy.&nbsp; And perhaps a two-way process,&nbsp;instead of deciding what the Government wants to focus on and communicating it to the private sector, we have greater involvement earlier on in the whole process.&nbsp; I think if we can do this, we will have a greater chance of creating an even stronger economy for the country.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Tan Sze Wee (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In other words, if the non-profit&nbsp;sector were a country, they would be the fifth largest economy in the world.&nbsp; In the US alone, the non-profit sector employs nearly 11 million Americans, or about 7% of the workforce, and contributes more than 9% of GDP with a total asset of US$1.7 trillion in 2003.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, most of the fees and dues were the greatest generators of income followed by government payments, private contributions and other sources.&nbsp; But this income composition is about to change with the rise of for-profit social enterprises.&nbsp; For-profit social enterprises are legally incorporated entities explicitly designed to pursue a social mission.&nbsp; Often, for-profit ventures identify social gaps and look for innovative market means to create system change and sustainable organisations.&nbsp; While their primary objective is social impact, their for-profit structure requires paying attention to a double bottom line, ie, dual social and financial objectives that guide <p align=left>Column: 1074</p>managerial decision making and determine success.&nbsp; Some examples are Grameen Bank, Shore Bank Corporation, Easybeinggreen and a listed company called Free Play, which help to create jobs in difficult sectors and cultivate self-reliant societies. I believe the Minister would agree with me that encouraging for-profit social enterprises to bloom can help redefine our people sector economy from one that is charity or Government driven to one that is sustainable and profitable in the long term.&nbsp; This, of course, can be translated to less tax dollars needed to fund social programmes.&nbsp; I see the for-profit social enterprise as a main business table agenda item, and not a CSR after-thought.&nbsp; It is a potential new engine of growth.&nbsp; Growing this sector possibly with favourable fiscal measures and Government incentives, like funding from SPRING, subsidised land rent, or even a special business zone, as&nbsp;mentioned by Dr Wang Kai Yuen, and even staff secondment from public agencies will help social needs as well as contribute to GDP.&nbsp; I urge that MTI&nbsp;take an enlightened view on the for-profit organisations and help kick start the for-profit people sector and help move Singapore towards a vibrant and connected people sector economy.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In order to attract more tourists to Singapore, the Singapore Tourism Board mobilised a lot of resources to prepare some guide books with rich local flavours, and they have introduced a lot of lesser-known local attractions to the tourists, for example, the elaborately produced "Walking Guide to Katong/Joo Chiat".&nbsp; Unfortunately, in the Chinese version of this guidebook, owing to some mistranslation, there was a piece of material that is really laughable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1075</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In introducing Joo Chiat and Katong, it states, "Many people do&nbsp; not know the difference between Joo Chiat and Katong.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, Joo Chiat is situated within Katong, and Katong is Chew Joo Chiat's grandfather.&nbsp; It represents a very large area."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On reading this, I have a doubt on the statement of Katong being the grandfather of Chew Joo Chiat.&nbsp; Who is this Katong?&nbsp; I believe the editor was deliberately trying to create a suspense.&nbsp; In another page, I found the answer.&nbsp; It says, "Do you know that Katong is named after a species of sea turtle found in Singapore?"&nbsp; This is to say that Chew Joo Chiat's grandfather, Katong, was a sea turtle.&nbsp; If this is brought to the knowledge of Chew Joo Chiat's descendants, I am sure they will go after the Singapore Tourism Board for turning them into descendants of a sea turtle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

But 10 years ago, in 1996, we made even more in tourism receipts, $11 billion, with fewer tourists, 7.3 million.&nbsp; This calculates to 1.6 million less tourists but $200 million more in tourist receipts, in my opinion, a better performance, in terms of cost-effectiveness.&nbsp; And yet, we are now targeting to double our tourist numbers in <p align=left>Column: 1076</p>10 years' time, in order to triple our tourist receipts.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The advent of two IRs and the surge of tourists from China and India should enable us to ride this new wave of tourism growth and achieve these targets, but I would like to ask the Minister: is this the best and most sustainable way to grow our tourism industry?&nbsp; Or is it just the easiest way?&nbsp; Does it value add?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The exponential growth of tourists and tourist infrastructure can exceed the limits of healthy growth and tilt us towards a malignant growth if we just continue crunching numbers.&nbsp; Are we creating new markets or&nbsp;are we just chasing old ones?&nbsp; Does Singapore have the land and resources to cope with this pressure?&nbsp; How many hotels will we need?&nbsp; And where is the land for them to come from?&nbsp; What types of jobs will be created?&nbsp; What percentage of these will be skilled jobs?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mass tourism is notoriously fickle and susceptible to fashion, economic downturns, currency changes, epidemics, terrorism or the fear of any of these.&nbsp; And not only does it put a heavy strain on a country's resources but it also negatively impacts on the residents by increasing petty crimes&nbsp;- we read about that recently -&nbsp;drug trafficking, prostitution, the risk of&nbsp;diseases and their quality of life in general.&nbsp; It also deters the more discerning and discriminating visitor.&nbsp; In my opinion, it would be easier to revive Singapore from a reputation as backwater than to rescue a tarnished down market tourist reputation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, I think Singapore should resist the lure of numbers and focus on value-added tourists like students, long-term or repeat visitors, people who come for a specific purpose - cultural and arts tourists, medical tourists, even eco-tourists.&nbsp; We should also focus on the silver tourist industry.&nbsp; These people will have brand loyalty and integrate with	<p align=left>Column: 1077</p>rather than compete with locals, and they will add value.&nbsp; They will create high-end rather than low-end jobs.&nbsp; In my opinion, a truly cosmopolitan global city is one where locals and foreigners can interact in a meaningful and mutually beneficial way, not pass&nbsp;like ships in the night.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I therefore recommend&nbsp;a more comprehensive and sustainable long-term tourist policy that builds on our core strengths and that deepens our rootedness.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Global competition among cities is intense for technology investments, and the EDB has a long history of success in doing this for Singapore.&nbsp; In the past, we could just offer land, engineers, tax incentives and reliable logistics to win.&nbsp; Today, as PM Lee said in his Budget debate's closing speech, we need to meet or beat an ever growing list of the best of breed items.&nbsp; But chasing and winning&nbsp;the race for foreign investments is only one part of the success equation.&nbsp; The receptacles or factors of operations for the conduct of successful business must be available, ready and also competitively best of breed.&nbsp; This includes our hard and soft infrastructures, our human capital and our overall social environment.&nbsp; We have proven that we can build, run and maintain our hard infrastructures.&nbsp; We are now being tested whether we can educate, train and retrain our human capital to meet the challenges of the future. We are now also showing that we <p align=left>Column: 1078</p>are able to invest or wanting to invest heavily in R&amp;D to generate the future technology that will hopefully have a strong economic impact on Singapore and indeed the world.&nbsp; There are no guarantees for economic returns, but without the bold attempt to engage the future possibilities, we will surely be out of the race and lose our significance.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The point I am trying to make is in today's incredibly noisy world, getting noticed is a "must have" first step.&nbsp; Dubai, through&nbsp;its mega-tourism project, is a good example.&nbsp; Getting visitors to the doorstep and trying the product is the next step,&nbsp;then having a memorable experience and a good outcome must surely be the objective for repeat and sustainable business.&nbsp; Achieving&nbsp;the memorable experience and the "wow" outcome is a collective effort of all Singaporeans in product knowledge and customer service culture.&nbsp; It also requires the concerted effort of private and public partnerships and inter-agency coordination to make the entire business value chain a viable and sustainable one&nbsp;in a challenging and small domestic market.&nbsp; I think we need to nurture&nbsp;domestic tourism and local consumption spending in our own tourism products.&nbsp; The Esplanade would never be successful if Singaporeans are unwilling to pay for entertainment.&nbsp; The S-League would not&nbsp;succeed if we do not support and pay admission charges to watch the matches.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the budgets are prepared and segmented by Ministries,&nbsp;my questions are: Is there a budget for promotion of domestic tourism and for ideas creation, product generation and origination of services and products, just as we have for technology R&amp;D?&nbsp;

In addition, in order to give the digital media&nbsp;a further boost, the Economic Development Board has committed $500 million over the next five years, with long-term plans for another $500 million over&nbsp;the subsequent five years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MDA's efforts with industry players have translated into production value of&nbsp;at least $7 million in 2005 alone, and the value of work done in Singapore, we estimate, will grow over&nbsp;the next two to three years to as much as $30-$40 million.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Magad has also suggested that the Government explore offering grants for patenting product creations.&nbsp; I would like to highlight that the EDB manages the "Patent Application Fund (PAF) Plus" scheme, which offers grant assistance to help cover part of the cost of professional and official fees for filing a patent.&nbsp; Since its inception in 2002, we have had 348 successful applications and given out some $2.6 million in grants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Sze Wee was concerned with the low take-up rate of the Entrepreneurial <p align=left>Column: 1081</p>Talent Development Fund (ETDF).&nbsp; The ETDF aims to nurture entrepreneurial talent by providing matching funding for business ventures started by students in the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), ie, the three universities and five polytechnics.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The programme only began&nbsp;in 2004, and the&nbsp;IHLs needed time to set up their internal mechanisms to administer it.&nbsp; Consequently, the money disbursed in 2005 was not high.&nbsp; Some funds disbursed to the IHLs have also not yet been fully utilised.&nbsp; SPRING has taken this into account when estimating a lower draw&nbsp;for FY 2006.&nbsp; This is in no way an indication that the programme is slowing down.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, I am sure Members of this House would agree with me that we should be more concerned with quality rather than quantity.&nbsp; Thus far, we are heartened by its results.&nbsp; Just the other day, I was shown an example of a student venture under this scheme.&nbsp; It is called&nbsp;MXR Cubes.&nbsp; It offers "mixed reality" or "augmented reality" books and toys, in which two-dimensional texts and pictures are converted into three-dimensional&nbsp;interactive products.&nbsp; This product has been described as "the next generation of children's book", and their work has been featured internationally by CNN, CNBC and BBC.&nbsp; These are the types of products and enterprises from our universities and polytechnics that we want to support.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPRING is currently working with the IHLs to further promote this programme to more students.&nbsp; We have received feedback.&nbsp; So we&nbsp;will fine-tune some of the criteria so that there will be&nbsp;more flexibility in administering this programme, but without lowering quality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1082</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Mr Inderjit Singh and his taskforce in the Finance Crucible of Action Community for Entrepreneurship (ACE) for their sterling&nbsp;work in reviewing a whole host of our programmes and grants in order to help provide more financing options for our start-up companies and enterprises in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;He submitted, I think, a total of about 34 recommendations for change, and I am glad to note that two-thirds of the recommendations have been accepted or are still in the process of being reviewed.&nbsp; For those for which our agencies have had to say no,&nbsp;we will write back to Mr Singh to give him explicit reasons why we could not say yes at this point in time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One recommendation which SPRING will be following up on is the recommendation to streamline some of our&nbsp;capability development schemes into a single&nbsp;umbrella so that it becomes easier to access.&nbsp;&nbsp;IE Singapore will also take into account the recommendations of the taskforce in its review of the Regionalisation Finance Scheme.&nbsp; This is all&nbsp;work currently in progress.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh also mentioned the over-the-counter trading platform which would provide another avenue for start-up enterprises to access equity funding.&nbsp; Largely because of his work and prodding, the legislation was changed in September or October last year to provide an exemption in the Securities and Futures Act, and I am glad to inform Members that I think within the next two to three months, we should see Phillip Securities roll out an over-the-counter platform, and this will be a welcome addition to the financing options available to our enterprises.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Singh also brought up a more generic point about the Government's use of risk capital.&nbsp; He was concerned that perhaps we were more willing to take risk and put investments in MNCs and GLCs, <p align=left>Column: 1083</p>and not enough in local companies.&nbsp; I have checked on this.&nbsp; The Government does have risk capital in local enterprises.&nbsp; Examples are&nbsp;schemes such as the Start-up Enterprise Development Scheme (SEEDS); the Business Angel Scheme, which really was&nbsp;initiated because of a discussion over tea that Mr Singh started; and, of course, the recently launched Enterprise Fund.&nbsp; We have seen some success in the SEEDS programme, with 11 SEEDS-supported companies having now crossed the $1 million mark in terms of revenue, and six of them have won international awards.&nbsp; This is why we have injected further funds into SEEDS and&nbsp;the Business Angel Scheme.&nbsp; So we have put in an additional $60 million.&nbsp; The Enterprise Fund, which currently stands at S$35.5 million, will grow to a $100-million fund, and this will provide additional financing for start-ups and SMEs to tap into.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, of the total investments made by the Technopreneurship Investment Fund (TIF), 50% or $600 million have been invested in Singapore-based companies.&nbsp; This means, for every dollar of the $1 billion which the Government invested in TIF, 50 cents has been channelled back to Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have two other schemes which have helped our companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; The Research Incentive Scheme&nbsp;for Companies (RISC), in which 25% to 30%&nbsp;of the awards in&nbsp;this scheme are for local companies; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; The Innovation Development Scheme, in which&nbsp;70% of the beneficiaries are Singapore-based companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I would like to correct the&nbsp;misperception out there that the Government does not put risk capital into local companies.&nbsp; We do.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1084</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Singh has also asked about the role of the private sector in the formulation of the Government's long-term economic plans.&nbsp; Mr Singh is the Vice Chairman of ACE.&nbsp; I happen to chair it because I am supposed to be the Minister-in-charge of Entrepreneurship.&nbsp; But&nbsp;I am happily outnumbered by 29 other members, every single one of whom is a private sector individual.&nbsp; Those who have served on the Committee, which include Mr Inderjit Singh and Dr Loo Choon Yong, will agree that we have had extremely useful exchanges of perspectives and information.&nbsp; Rules, regulatory and&nbsp;cultural changes,&nbsp;educational programmes and a whole host of things have been done so much more effectively because of the access to private sector input.&nbsp; This is not the only forum at which the Government takes private sector input.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members may have heard of the Pro-Enterprise Panel (PEP).&nbsp; This is the panel&nbsp;which, over the last five years, has reviewed&nbsp;1,500 suggestions on rule changes, and has accepted&nbsp;more than half for&nbsp;implementation.&nbsp; This panel is chaired by the Head of Civil Service but, again, has very strong representation by the private sector.&nbsp; This has made our ability to change rules so much more responsive to private sector needs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPRING itself, as my Minister has said earlier, which we are using as the champion for interfacing with the&nbsp;SMEs,&nbsp;has significant private-sector representation on its Board of Directors, starting from the Chairwoman onwards.&nbsp; Moreover, Members will recall that when the Prime Minister announced the establishment of the Research, Innovation and Enterprise Council (RIEC), if you&nbsp;look at the list of the people who have been invited to serve on that Council, you will see here, again, evidence of clear private sector involvement, and we hope therefore to be able to tap their perspectives and wisdom as we formulate our long-term economic plans.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1085</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me move on to social enterprises.&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low gave a good speech explaining the benefits and potential growth of social enterprises.&nbsp;&nbsp;Social enterprises are basically businesses with a social mission.&nbsp; As she pointed out in her speech, they can be not-for-profit and they can also be for-profit.&nbsp; Our interest in them - and I would say it is still early days yet - is that, if they could succeed in creating new jobs or in providing additional revenue streams for charity, so that they would not have to be absolutely dependent on the charity dollar, then this would be a welcome addition to our economic landscape.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry, MCYS, has the ComCare Enterprise Fund (CEF),&nbsp;which provides seed funding for up to 80% of the total project cost, up to a&nbsp;limit of $300,000, for&nbsp;new social enterprises.&nbsp; But they must have&nbsp;viable business plans.&nbsp; Since the launch of the CEF in March 2003, a total of 48 projects&nbsp;have been approved and around $4.7 million committed.&nbsp; The nature of the CEF-funded social enterprises varies very greatly, depending on the interests of its founders.&nbsp; Some provide direct employment to the needy, whilst others aim to generate profits to support programmes for the elderly and the&nbsp;needy. &nbsp;The sectors&nbsp;range from food and beverage to consultancy, retail and home-based services.&nbsp; Yesterday, at the lunch with the Singapore Action Group for Elders (SAGE), they said they wanted to start putting a group of retired electricians and plumbers into another social enterprise.&nbsp; So, there will be lots more ideas which will be generated, and we will look for opportunities to support them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, social enterprises are also welcome to tap on the existing Government assistance schemes which are extended to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), such as the Local Enterprise Technical Assistance Scheme <p align=left>Column: 1086</p>(LETAS) and the Micro Loan programme from SPRING.&nbsp; But I want to emphasise that they must clear the hurdle as viable businesses, which is why I would also disagree with Miss Penny Low's suggestion that we provide subsidised land for them.&nbsp; If we were to provide subsidised factors of production for social enterprises, then we are creating an uneven playing field and unfair competition for all our other SMEs out there which, I believe, would be a step in the wrong direction.&nbsp; But having said that, we will look for&nbsp;legitimate, competitive and fair ways for social enterprises to develop in our economic landscape.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to&nbsp;tourism.&nbsp; The World Tourism Organisation has projected that global tourist arrivals will grow at 4% per annum over the next decade, with the growth in Asia alone exceeding 6%.&nbsp; It is a choice for us whether to exploit this growing market.&nbsp; Yes, there may be some downsides, but there is a&nbsp;significant upside,&nbsp;and this is not something which we should sniff at and give up without a fight or without making a significant attempt to tap into.&nbsp; The Singapore Tourism Board (STB), therefore,&nbsp;plans to triple tourism receipts&nbsp;to $30 billion annually and to double visitor arrivals to 17 million.&nbsp; We estimate that this will&nbsp;create an additional 100,000 jobs for the tourism sector by 2015, and this is what&nbsp;our vision for&nbsp;tourism in 2015 is.&nbsp; The tourism sector will, therefore,&nbsp;be one of the major growth engines for our&nbsp;economy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Dr Geh Min that we should not&nbsp;aim blindly just to increase the absolute number of tourists, although having said that, that is still useful.&nbsp;&nbsp;But what we are really interested in, a better&nbsp;indicator, is tourism receipts, because an increase in tourism receipts directly translates to a higher value-add or a better Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for our economy and, if I may add, jobs.&nbsp; It is thus not enough to just&nbsp;increase&nbsp;arrivals, <p align=left>Column: 1087</p>but we need to&nbsp;put in place strategies, as Dr Geh Min suggested,&nbsp;to extend&nbsp;the length of stay and to encourage high yielding repeat visitors.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give an example of&nbsp;this.&nbsp; Traditionally, many of our PRC visitors&nbsp;to Singapore have come as part of a tri-destination tour which&nbsp;includes Malaysia and Thailand.&nbsp; They&nbsp;tended to stay not more than one day here, sometimes not even in a hotel in Singapore.&nbsp; So they would&nbsp;generate a lot of tourism numbers, visitor arrivals, but the yield, in terms of tourism receipts,&nbsp;was low and there was a very short&nbsp;length of&nbsp;stay.&nbsp; STB is now promoting more single-destination Singapore tours that generally span three or more days.&nbsp; In fact,</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>I have just checked the statistics. The length of stay for visitors from PRC has been going up significantly and so has their tourism expenditure.&nbsp; Despite the fact that there has been a 2.5% fall in Chinese visitors last year, the revenues have gone up significantly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me therefore elaborate on some of our key strategies to increase tourism receipts. Firstly, we need to have a range of tourism attractions and products in order to increase and enhance our competitive advantage as a destination for business and leisure visitors.&nbsp; I agree totally with Mr Alex Chan that we must be noticed, we must get mindshare on international media so that when people are looking for their next place to visit, they think of us, they think of Singapore. And, therefore, we need attractions which are compelling and unique, and it is not just a matter of building hardware, as many of you have said.&nbsp; In fact, in order to appeal to more sophisticated travellers, we need software, we need new marquee events, programmes, novel ideas, marketing packages, arts and culture, entertainment, education and sports.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1088</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this should be executed by the private sector rather than provided by the Government.&nbsp; Let me give you a few examples. The Singapore Flyer observation wheel and the two Integrated Resorts are examples of private sector-led projects that will bring world-class attractions and creative concepts to Singapore. The Government's role is to paint a compelling vision, provide the regulatory environment and enable these things to happen, but the actual creative push and&nbsp;business imperative must come from the private sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a $2 billion Tourism Development Fund which has been set up in order to catalyse this private sector investment into our tourism infrastructure.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was also a question on which agency is responsible for tourism.&nbsp; Members of this House will know that we do not have a tourism Ministry <I>per se</I>.&nbsp; I oversee tourism in my capacity within MTI, but I will tell you the key advantage which we have in not having a separate Ministry is precisely the fact that it depends on so many other agencies and Government.&nbsp; We need to work with MND, within MTI, we need to work with MICA and, sometimes, we need assistance from MFA.&nbsp; It is really one of those Government multi-agency projects.&nbsp; I can say, with hand over heart, having done this now for some time, that this approach works.&nbsp; So you do not need to worry that the lack of a single Ministry, or point of focus agency, in any way detracts from our efforts in tourism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thank Mr Low Thia Khiang for pointing out&nbsp;some inaccuracies in the brochures.&nbsp; I am sure the people in Joo Chiat are not descendants of sea turtles.&nbsp; But my good friend, Mr Chan Soo Sen, has said that in China, "<I>hai gui</I>" refers to entrepreneurs who have made good overseas and come back home.&nbsp; I think if we have more of such people in Singapore like that, that is not necessarily a bad thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, we will make sure those things are corrected and it is <p align=left>Column: 1089</p>not an excuse for inaccurate translations to occur.&nbsp; But it is better that translations are made, or that we at least attempt to make translations, than for us to say that we are so concerned&nbsp;with accuracy that we do not even take the risk for making translations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of translations, I think Mr Low would also agree with me that we have made a lot of progress in ensuring multi-lingual signs at airports, MRT stations and other places, so that Singapore is now much more friendly for tourists who are coming here from various destinations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me briefly touch on Integrated Resorts which Miss Penny Low asked about. The two IRs will widen the range of leisure and entertainment options available in Singapore and will generate significant economic benefits.&nbsp; During the submissions of the Request for Concepts last year, we estimated that the two IRs are expected to add about $1.5 billion for annual Gross Domestic Product and create some 35,000 jobs, direct and indirect, throughout the economy. We believe these figures are still valid.&nbsp; Of course, the actual numbers will depend on the actual proposals selected and how things work.&nbsp; It is obviously a fluid and competitive field that these two Integrated Resorts will be entering.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low highlighted the fact that the winning IR proposal should be selected on the basis of our long-term strategic interest.&nbsp; Obviously so.&nbsp; We have calibrated the four main criteria. The main criteria are tourism appeal, 40%; architectural concept and design, 30%; development investment, 20%; and strength of the consortium partners, 10%.&nbsp; The criterion with the highest weight is tourism appeal and contribution.&nbsp; We are not just talking about the number of tourists that will visit in the first year of <p align=left>Column: 1090</p>its arrival. This is a long-term project, and I want to remind Members of the House that when the private sector puts in such a significant amount of resources, they are going to want to make sure that this succeeds in the long term. So in the long term, I think we will get significant numbers of visitors, significant expenditures by those visitors, and we will get new and innovative entertainment concepts in those places, even the architecture.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people have asked why we have put such high weight on the architecture for the Integrated Resort at Marina Bay.&nbsp;First, it occupies a very central location within our new downtown and will, to some extent, be a defining feature of the area of that district. Secondly, unique and compelling architecture is a tourism attraction in its own right, and you only need to think of museums around the world which have had such an impact on tourism arrivals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me conclude by saying that for the tourism sector, things are looking up.&nbsp; Our visitor arrivals last year reached a record high of 8.94 million, an increase of 7% over 2004. Tourism receipts grew by 10% to $10.8 billion. And we are well on our track to achieving our Tourism 2015 vision.&nbsp; But we will continue to be responsive to the needs of the industry, rethink&nbsp;old assumptions and take calculated risks.&nbsp; In the past year, we have&nbsp;taken many steps which will change our tourism landscape for many years to come.&nbsp; While we push new boundaries to make ourselves an appealing destination for visitors, we will ensure that we take appropriate social and security safeguards to make sure that we do not kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> Sir, I would like to seek&nbsp;clarifications from the Minister.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know what concrete steps have been or would be taken by STB on the accuracy of tourism materials, <p align=left>Column: 1091</p>especially pertaining to the Chinese Language materials.&nbsp; We had a year or two ago of this wrong translation on the Hungry Ghost Festival where it becomes "<I>Xiong Ya Li Gui Jie</I>".&nbsp; Now we have a Chinese translation making sea turtles grandfather of&nbsp;Chew Joo Chiat.&nbsp; I think it will do well to make sure that it will not happen again.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether the Minister is aware that when his good friend, Minister of State, Mr Chan Soo Sen, told him about "<I>hai gui pai</I>" , ie, the return of the entrepreneur from overseas, the&nbsp;same as the "hai gui" (sea turtles)&nbsp;is wrong.&nbsp; The "<I>gui</I>" in&nbsp;"<I>hai gui pai</I>" means "return",&nbsp;which has the same sound of "<I>gui</I>" as in "<I>wu gui</I>" (sea turtles).&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;it means a different thing.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B> I am certainly not an expert in the Chinese Language, and I can assure the Member that STB does not rely on me to vet their translations. Having said that, one mistake is one too many and we will have to do our best to ensure that this does not happen again.&nbsp; The point I want to make is&nbsp;that I can never guarantee that there will be no mistakes in the future.&nbsp; But&nbsp;I would rather&nbsp;have a situation where we are making our best efforts to ensure that we translate material accurately and that it conveys interesting messages to tourists and also to our locals who read that material.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank&nbsp;Members of the House who, from time to time, if they see any error in our signboards, brochures, publicity materials or things on television,&nbsp;let us know, and we will fix it.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Geh Min--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Geh Min:</B> Mr Chairman, I would like to thank the Minister for his very comprehensive reply and&nbsp;emphasis that it is not numbers alone that we are pursuing, but it is tourism receipts.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to just clarify.&nbsp; I understand from what he said that&nbsp;we <p align=left>Column: 1092</p>cannot increase the receipts without a certain increase in volume and that is why we are aiming to double our tourist numbers in 10 years' time, because there is no way we can increase the receipts to the desired level if we do not do that.&nbsp; Is that correct?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would just like to follow that up and say that if we double our tourist numbers, at a conservative estimate, especially if we hope that they will stay a little bit longer and that they do not stay outside of Singapore, we will need 30,000-50,000 more hotel rooms, unless maybe we create "B and B" in HDB.&nbsp; This, to me, seems to be something that you cannot just create overnight. You have to put the land aside.&nbsp; Even if you involve the private sector, the private sector cannot act if URA does not give the land.&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that, for example, Shangri-La only has about 800 rooms. So if we are creating 30,000-50,000 more rooms, this will be a big commitment in terms of land and resources. Of course, it will create jobs, yes, when we are developing, but do we want that many more hotel rooms?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this not something that we have to plan in advance?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B> The Member is&nbsp;absolutely right.&nbsp; This is not something which will happen overnight.&nbsp; That is why I said this has to be a multi-agency effort.&nbsp; In order to double the tourist arrivals, in order to lengthen the length of stay, we will need many more hotel rooms.&nbsp; But frankly, this is a good problem to have.&nbsp; It is much better to have a problem where I have a shortage of hotel rooms, and we have to ask URA to see whether there are more sites available or, indeed, to increase&nbsp;the intensity on development in those sites so that we can have those hotel rooms.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also other innovative solutions.&nbsp; As she has said, there are some people who are using homestay as an option.&nbsp; There will&nbsp;also be further spin-<p align=left>Column: 1093</p>offs to hotels and places of residence around Singapore, outside Singapore as well ,&nbsp;the use of ships, berths, in the national waters around Singapore.&nbsp; There have to be many more innovative ideas on how to house them. But the more important point is whether you are going to say that because we do not want so many tourists in Singapore, we turn our backs from an economic opportunity which is expanding right in front of our eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;My attitude&nbsp;is this&nbsp;is too good a thing to turn away from.&nbsp; Let us find a way, sensitively, rationally and innovatively to tap into this opportunity without, at the same time, losing the greenery and&nbsp;security -&nbsp;the very reasons that bring people to Singapore in the first place.&nbsp; We will do this sensitively.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lawrence Leow Chin Hin--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><I>Government-linked Companies</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lawrence Leow Chin Hin:</B>&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, the Government's move to divest businesses that are non-strategic and non-core is to be lauded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On first look, the impending divestment&nbsp;of JTC's business to the private sector appears to be another move in this direction.&nbsp; However, on closer examination, it is a divestment that has raised several concerns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in my opinion, the impending divestment of JTC's business is a divestment of a strategic business.&nbsp; JTC was established with the objective of making available industrial land and space at competitive rates to promote our economy.&nbsp; I feel that such a role of JTC cannot be replaced by the private sector and the divestment of JTC's business will bring with it wide-ranging implications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, what will happen to the price of industrial land and space after JTC diminishes its role as an agency that supplies industrialists with land and space <p align=left>Column: 1094</p>at competitive pricing?&nbsp; Will it then lead to a rise in business cost?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the next concern relates to control and usage of industrial land and properties.

Since the liberalisation of the electricity market by the Government, Town Councils have been able to achieve some savings in electricity costs through directly purchasing electricity from retailers in the market.&nbsp; Sir, but this is limited to the larger utility accounts, ie, accounts with consumption of more than 10,000 kilowatt-hour per month.&nbsp; However, savings achieved to date by Town Councils are minimal as most of the utility <p align=left>Column: 1095</p>accounts under the Town Councils do not exceed 10,000 kilowatt-hour per month consumption.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with oil prices on the up trend and increases in electricity tariff, Town Councils have been facing increasing electricity cost in the upkeep of their estates.&nbsp; It will certainly help Town Councils cope with the increase in utility costs if the Government would expedite the liberalisation of the electricity market to include accounts with consumption below 10,000 kilowatt-hour per month.&nbsp; I, therefore, wish to ask the Minister if he would expedite the liberalisation of electricity market to include the smaller accounts and, hence, allow Town Councils to enjoy lower rates of electricity consumption through economies of scale.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Under the Act, financial services are expressly excluded.&nbsp; I hope MTI could amend the Act to include financial services this time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is also a need to look at the setting up of a framework on proper disclosure of information relating to the sale of time-share club and resort membership.&nbsp; In this regard, there is no need for a private Member's Bill to push for new legislation if we could just extend&nbsp;CPFTA to include regulatory framework to enhance transparency in this area.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp;enforcement and effectiveness of CPFTA, Sir, CASE would like to highlight that businesses are now taking things lightly as they know that it is expensive for a specific body, like CASE or STB, to take up legal actions against them.&nbsp; Many ignore our invitation for them to sign the Voluntary Compliance Agreement (VCA).&nbsp; As the Act is silent on such delay, errant <p align=left>Column: 1096</p>businesses are taking advantage of such a loophole.&nbsp; We should review the Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Act should also be amended to protect&nbsp;specific bodies, like CASE and STB, from legal action when&nbsp;they publicise such unfair acts in the media.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another CASE proposal is to include the introduction of the opt-in practice under CPFTA.&nbsp; I hope MTI could respond positively to all the proposed amendments to strengthen our&nbsp;CPFTA to better protect consumers' interest overall.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last&nbsp;but not least, CASE would like to urge MTI to consider looking into the possibility of introducing what is commonly called the "Lemon Law".&nbsp; We propose that the "Lemon Law" applies to all&nbsp;consumer goods.&nbsp; Such a law would give the right to consumers to require the business to replace goods that are defective and are beyond repair.&nbsp; We could incorporate the&nbsp;"Lemon Law" into the Sale of Goods Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Soo Sen)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chan Soo Sen):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, Mr Lawrence Leow asked the Government to ensure that when we divest companies, we do not create dominant market players that would undermine&nbsp;competition in the marketplace.&nbsp; As a general rule, the Government would observe the yellow pages rule and divest out of business where there is active private sector participation and there is no strategic value to the Government&nbsp; owning such businesses.&nbsp; The state of competition in the industry post-divestment would be a key consideration in any decision to divest Government holdings, so we proceed with a lot of caution.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of JTC, we have announced on 21st November 2005 that JTC would divest its ready-built industry facilities in certain market segments, including 71 high-rise factory blocks,&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1097</p>three business park buildings,&nbsp;one warehouse and 800 units of workshops.&nbsp; Since then, JTC has appointed a financial consultant to formulate a divestment plan, which includes exploring the possible modes of divestment and the implementation timeline.&nbsp; The plan will factor in the need for competitive market forces to work well post-divestment.&nbsp; We expect the divestment plan to be finalised by the middle of this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The divestment of these JTC properties will enhance market competition in the provision of industrial space over the long term.&nbsp; Companies will have more choices in the supply of industrial space to meet their various needs, especially in the high-rise factory segment where JTC would divest its 25% market share.&nbsp; Private sector industrial developers will be able to operate flexibly to&nbsp;accommodate industry needs and to provide good customer service.&nbsp; We will monitor the supply of industrial space and provide for an orderly release of industrial land sites through the Government Land Sales programme.&nbsp; This will help ensure that prices do not escalate unduly due to tightness of supply.&nbsp; In other words, we understand all your concerns.&nbsp; We will proceed carefully so that there will not be undue increase in business costs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chew Heng Ching asked for a speedier liberalisation of the electricity market so that Town Councils can benefit from choosing their retailers.&nbsp; I believe this call would have resonance in many other sectors too.&nbsp; Since the electricity retail market started progressive liberalisation in year 2001, about 10,000 electricity consumers have become contestable.&nbsp; This includes about 172 electricity accounts that belong to the Town Councils.&nbsp; Town Councils may approach EMA on how to apply for contestability as there are criteria that they have to meet, such as a <p align=left>Column: 1098</p>consumption of at least 10,000 kilowatt-hour per month and other technical requirements.&nbsp; Town Councils with contestable accounts have generally been satisfied with the utility savings achieved.&nbsp;&nbsp;EMA is currently exploring how to leverage on new technology to achieve cost savings in retailing electricity to smaller consumers so that they can also benefit from contestability.&nbsp; EMA will announce the details once they are ready.&nbsp; Hopefully, it will not take too long.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr&nbsp;Yeo Guat Kwang spoke on the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act&nbsp;(CPFTA).&nbsp; I would like to assure Mr Yeo that anything to do with protecting consumer's interest will be positively taken into consideration by my Ministry.&nbsp; In fact, following Mr Yeo's suggestion&nbsp;in the Committee of Supply last year to review&nbsp;CPFTA, MTI has set up a taskforce to do so.&nbsp; The taskforce is co-chaired by MTI and CASE and it includes representatives from consumer and business bodies as well as public agencies.&nbsp; The taskforce has made several useful recommendations, one of which is to extend the scope of CPFTA to cover financial services.&nbsp; So MTI supports this recommendation and is currently working with MAS on the implementation details.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo also highlighted the difficulties faced by specific bodies, such as CASE, in dealing with errant retailers.&nbsp; The CPFTA has clearly laid out the circumstances under which specific bodies can file an injunction order.&nbsp; If an errant retailer refuses to cooperate or sign a Voluntary Compliance Agreement (VCA), I would encourage the specified body to follow through with the enforcement procedures and obtain an injunction order against the retailer.&nbsp; I think this may be a little bit troublesome, but it will send a clear and strong signal that the specified body will not hesitate to act against such retailers.&nbsp; So he may look for a good case on which to implement this procedure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1099</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo also raised a matter on the so-called "Lemon Law".&nbsp; This was something that the taskforce had also considered.&nbsp; But, given the extensive effect of this law and the recent developments in other countries, the taskforce has recommended that further studies be done.&nbsp; MTI will take into account the taskforce's various recommendations and conduct&nbsp;public consultation for the proposed changes to CPFTA regulations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as the regulations on time-share are concerned, complaints against time-share companies have remained high, with 158 complaints lodged with CASE last year.&nbsp; MTI agrees with Prof. Ivan Png's workgroup that there should be proper disclosure of material information by time-share companies so that consumers can make informed choices.&nbsp; But MTI does not believe that the solution lies in incorporating a code of governance for time-share companies within CPFTA.&nbsp; Such a code is better set by the industry or a consumer body like CASE.&nbsp; The CPFTA is also not designed to have an on-going monitoring mechanism to ensure that the&nbsp;time-share company will continue to abide by a code of governance after a sale.&nbsp; This is better undertaken through an industry, or consumer-led scheme like CaseTrust, where there is an accreditation system to ensure continued compliance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, in short, I want to assure Mr Yeo again that, through the mechanism of consultation with CASE, we will continue to improve on measures to protect the interests of our consumers.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

There are, however, trouble spots in the region that still remain.&nbsp; The Taiwan Strait, North Korea, maritime boundary dispute in the South China Sea and Japan Sea, global terrorism and maritime security in the Straits of Malacca are all of concern.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, India and China are actively pursuing diplomacy and strengthening their military capability by increasing their defence spending and expanding their blue water navy capabilities.&nbsp; Their energy needs and a strong economy will inevitably push them to new corners.&nbsp; The enthusiasm shown by these two major powers in ASEAN, ARF and the new East Asia Summit clearly shows that ASEAN and Singapore are high on their economic and strategic considerations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the US in its February 2006 quarterly <I>Defence Review</I> highlighted that the rise of China, as an emerging global military power, is a matter of concern.&nbsp; The US maintains an active military presence in the region and in North East Asia.&nbsp; It has shown its commitment to the region by entering into the SFA with Singapore last year.&nbsp; It has recently resumed IMET with the TNI in Indonesia.&nbsp; It has various facilities and military arrangements with other countries in the region.&nbsp; The recent decision by the Bush administration to enhance US partnership with ASEAN clearly shows the strategic importance of South East Asia for the US in the coming years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Japan is also taking an active role in redefining its military role. It has started to relook at its constitution and has already started deploying its SDF for peaceful and humanitarian purposes overseas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ongoing North Korea <p align=left>Column: 1103</p>nuclear issue, the hot and cold relationship between Japan and South Korea and between Japan and China, and the rise of a strong China with a big economy and a strong military, will clearly push Japan to define a new role for the SDF in the long run.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It is therefore important that we share the benefits of our prosperity with our NSmen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Special Bonus also demonstrates the importance that is placed on our national defence and the concept of Total Defence, which has gained greater currency and relevance, as the sources of threats have changed from largely military aggression only to also the scourge of maritime terrorism and piracy, as well as the need to respond to disasters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When somebody calls us "a small red dot" or "a little red dot" and somebody threatens to cut essential supplies to Singapore and one looks at the history of Kuwait, how it was overrun by a huge military in a short space of time, I think it bears lesson to us that we must always invest well and invest adequately so that when the time comes, we can all sleep in peace and rest assured that we have a strong defence force to protect us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, S3G is the way that our armed forces have gone along because that is where the warfare plans are all going.&nbsp; I am proud that we have adopted the right strategy to implement and operationalise the 3G concepts.&nbsp; As I visit our SAF component units, I can see the fruits of our investment.&nbsp; In fact, one clear dividend of the 3G SAF is the ability of our SAF to cut the NS tenure of our NSmen from 2 1/2 to two years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the bigger budget this year, I expect the SAF to accelerate the conversion of the SAF to 3G.&nbsp;

(2) to ask the Minister to give an update on the changes, impacts and improvements made in SAF following the implementation of the new two years NSF, as compared to the previous 2 1/2 years NSF; and (3) to request the Minister whether he can assure the House that the SAF has implemented measures of internal control and checks and balances to ensure that <p align=left>Column: 1110</p>funds used by SAF for upgrading and purchase of new equipment and weapons are based on cost-effectiveness and value for money.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that&nbsp;MINDEF's defence budget is based on 6% of the GDP, correct me if I am wrong.&nbsp; As our current GDP is about $160 billion, therefore, the annual budget for defence is nearly about $10 billion.&nbsp; I do not agree with Mr Steve Chia that this amount of money spent is not worthwhile and should be cut.&nbsp; In fact, I think in principle I am in favour of spending sufficient funds to ensure that we&nbsp;are extremely combat effective in the&nbsp;defence force which serves as a strong deterrent against any potential intruders.&nbsp; It also helps to comfort our people and foreign investors to sleep well at night.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As MINDEF is asking our young men to spend two years of their lives to do National Service, I would like to ask the Minister whether the time spent by the NSmen while in service is employed fully and meaningfully.&nbsp; For us to have an effective and modern 3G SAF, MINDEF is spending billions of dollars annually on the defence budget.&nbsp; I wish to know whether there are checks and balances to ensure&nbsp; that our generals do not go out and buy weapons and defence systems as toys and playthings,&nbsp;and&nbsp;which may not be best suited for our&nbsp;use, or great value for money.&nbsp; I would like to know what has been done by MINDEF to ensure that the above control measures are in place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that MINDEF is not under the normal annual budget allocations and controls of the Ministry of Finance.&nbsp; If this is so, what internal checks and balances are in place to ensure that proper spending procedures are adopted?&nbsp; I wish to let the Minister know that we do not just want to be dazzled by promises and visual impact of the new weaponry.&nbsp; We want to be sure that these new weapons costing billions of dollars would be effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister may&nbsp;wish to clarify.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang)--><p align=left>Column: 1111</p><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

New security threats, such as terrorism, or new fighting environment, such as heavily built-up cities, have posed new challenges to fighting forces.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, the Ministry of Defence is presently transforming our SAF into a third-generation (or 3G) fighting force.&nbsp; The purpose of this transformation is actually to enhance the fighting capability of our soldiers through harnessing advanced technology.&nbsp; In today's environment, we can exploit information, command and control technologies to integrate and enhance the fighting capabilities of the SAF.&nbsp; In terms of hardware, modern weapon systems can be procured and modified to suit the defence needs of our country.&nbsp; At the same time, our SAF soldiers are better educated and trained to handle more sophisticated fighting system. Thus, the combination of both modern weapon systems and better trained soldiers will provide a good platform for our SAF to build a strong and capable integrated fighting force.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following questions: (1) What is the status of transformation of the 3G SAF?

I would like to ask the Minister how the SAF intends to provide for more safety.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</B> Sir, year after year, families have to send their sons for National Service, believing that a strong SAF is necessary for this country's continued survival.&nbsp; They do this knowing that there are inherent risks in military training and operations.&nbsp; Given <p align=left>Column: 1114</p>the spate of training deaths in recent years, we need to reassure parents&nbsp;that adequate safety measures are being put in place even as their sons go through tough&nbsp;and realistic training. Sir, I am for tough and realistic training but we need to make sure that there are safety audits being put in place, being done, and that there are actions being taken when there are lapses.&nbsp;Can I also ask the Minister&nbsp;what has the progress been since two years ago, when the Minister told us that the SAF would benchmark their safety standards against those of other armed forces?&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we realise that no military in the world, not even the best armed forces, has a zero training death rate.&nbsp; Indeed, it has been documented that since the SAS British elite force was formed in 1957, it had lost more men in peace time practice manoeuvres than in combat.&nbsp; The tougher the training, the higher the risk, and the same goes for our SAF.&nbsp; In Singapore, we have NSmen who have never fought in a war, but we have men who have lost their lives in training accidents while in service.&nbsp; They were training for the sole purpose of defending this country.&nbsp; Their deaths are not&nbsp;a loss to their families but also to the country.&nbsp; We should not allow their sacrifice to be just another accident statistic.&nbsp; I would propose to the Minister for Defence that as the SAF celebrates its 40th anniversary next year,&nbsp;we consider building a memorial to recognise the sacrifice and to commemorate them,&nbsp;to honour all those who had died while in service, including those who had died while training.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, RECORD IV has proposed a slew of measures to recognise the sacrifices of NSmen who are still alive.&nbsp; But I think we would be remiss if we do not also think of those who have sacrificed their lives - it can be through training, it can be through other operational exercises.&nbsp; During MINDEF's visit to France last year, led by the Defence Minister, I noticed that its <p align=left>Column: 1115</p>elite anti-terrorism troop commemorated their comrades who had died in training on a memorial plaque, and it did not matter how they died, under what circumstances they died, but the fact was that they died while they were in training, in service to the country.&nbsp; While the commander stopped to show us that plaque, I could not&nbsp;help noticing that he had this moment of reverence and respect, and it shows that he remembered those who had died, his comrades who had fallen while training.&nbsp; And it also signifies a higher value, the sacrifice for the nation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have several war&nbsp;memorials in Singapore&nbsp;-&nbsp;Kranji War Memorial&nbsp;and the Cenotaph - and they are there to commemorate our war-time sacrifices, mainly World War II, World War I.&nbsp; And most of those who had died are not Singaporeans who had fought for the country, but the British troops,&nbsp;Australian troops and&nbsp;New Zealand troops, foreigners.&nbsp; But we have yet to have a memorial for NSmen who have died.&nbsp; Sir, I would hope that the Minister would consider this.&nbsp; It is not too late and it is not&nbsp;too early, and I think the 40th anniversary is a good time for us to start this ritual to do so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.30 pm</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tan Soo Khoon--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

When he was sent to a medical centre at Changi Naval Base, what was even more surprising to find out was that there was no medical officer at the Changi Naval Base.&nbsp; So, what is the point then, if we have a medical centre and the most important personnel, a doctor, is not available?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I do not doubt that at the very top of the command chain there is an urgency to maintain this safety consciousness.&nbsp; But, I think, somewhere down the line, there is what we call a lack of the safety culture and it is probably that which says, "Oh, don't worry, it won't happen to me."&nbsp;

The Minister for Defence (Mr Teo Chee Hean)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Chairman,&nbsp;Sir,&nbsp;I would first like to thank the hon.&nbsp;Members for their comments and questions, and for their support and robust commitment to defence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ravindran, Mr Hawazi Daipi and Mr Steve Chia have asked for an assessment of our regional security environment.&nbsp; Sir, the geopolitical landscape of the Asia-Pacific region is in a state of flux.&nbsp; The shifts which are now taking place will lead to significant changes in the geostrategic balance.&nbsp; The US remains pre-eminent, with its superior military power, economic strength and political influence. &nbsp;But <p align=left>Column: 1118</p>alongside this is a new reality - China and India, the two Asian giants, are now on the rise.&nbsp; This is reshaping the strategic contours of our region. &nbsp;What is less clear is what shape our region - and indeed the world - will take in the future.&nbsp; The situation will be made more complex by the greater assertiveness of Japan, and perhaps also a resurgent Russia, in the coming years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China and India have both abandoned autarky and are seeking economic linkages with the world.&nbsp; They are now both major trading and energy importing nations, and their search for foreign sources of raw materials and markets, as well as their dependence on them, can only grow.&nbsp; As a consequence, both China and India now have an interest in the security of sea routes, and of their energy sources.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Southeast Asia is situated at the confluence of major sea routes, and at the crossroads between India and China.&nbsp; The Straits of Malacca and Singapore are now vital lifelines for these two emerging powers, as they are for the US, Japan and the countries in our region.&nbsp; Our region is also a major source of oil and gas.&nbsp; So we can expect that the issues of maritime security and energy security will loom larger in our region and become more critical for the major powers.&nbsp; Singapore, therefore,&nbsp;must have the wherewithal - military and diplomatic - to play a role to contribute to regional security and stability, and also to protect our national interests and ensure our security as the geopolitical landscape evolves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore and the SAF have, therefore, been playing active roles in multilateral efforts to enhance maritime security.&nbsp; Over the past year, we contributed to developing a consensus among the three littoral states of the Straits of Malacca that while we, the littoral states, have the primary responsibility for the security of the <p align=left>Column: 1119</p>Straits, major user states and other stakeholders have a role to play as well.&nbsp; Also, whatever measures are undertaken to enhance security must be in accordance with international law and respect the sovereignty of the littoral states.&nbsp; Dr Ong asked about the measures to safeguard the Malacca Straits.&nbsp; In the last two years, the littoral states have jointly launched air and sea patrols to demonstrate our commitment to safeguard this strategic waterway.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also working with the international community through, for example, the IMO and member states, to focus on maritime security in straits, such as the Malacca Straits.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major threat to our security is - as Mr Hawazi has noted - that of trans-national terrorism.&nbsp; The list of countries hit by terrorist attacks continues to grow.&nbsp; The danger is by no means over. &nbsp;In fact, with the terrorists exploiting modern technology to their advantage and organising themselves better to evade detection, the fight will be a&nbsp;long and arduous one.&nbsp; This is a fight that may take many generations, for it is an ideological war that they are waging.&nbsp; The fact that Azahari Husin was killed in Indonesia does not change that.&nbsp; The personalities might change, organisations might morph, but the ideology and objectives remain the same, and there are others, eg, bomb-makers like Nordin Top and their disciples, those who have learnt from them these dark arts, who are still at large.&nbsp; So we still have to remain on our guard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Ong Chit Chung has asked if new security threats have brought any changes to our defence policy, and Mr Ravindran asked about the state of our defence relations and defence diplomacy.&nbsp; The fundamentals of Singapore's defence policy are determined by our geography and environment.&nbsp; We are a small island with no strategic depth.&nbsp; We have no hinterland to absorb an attack, and there is no natural buffer between the external <p align=left>Column: 1120</p>environment and our populated areas and economic infrastructure.&nbsp; We are also a maritime nation, critically dependent on the security of sea lines of communications and the freedom of navigation.&nbsp; Our geography - both in the contours and size of our island and in our location in a sometimes turbulent region - is immutable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given these realities and the uncertainties of the regional environment, we continue to pursue deterrence and diplomacy as the twin pillars of our defence policy.&nbsp; We have invested considerable resources into building up a defence force that can deter aggression. &nbsp;And, should deterrence fail, the Singapore Armed Forces must be able to defeat the aggressor swiftly and decisively.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we have also been enhancing our security by pursuing active defence diplomacy.&nbsp; The objectives of our defence diplomacy are to develop positive and mutually beneficial relationships with friendly countries and armed forces, to contribute to a stable and cooperative regional environment and international order.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bilateral level, good defence relations also enable us to overcome our land and air space constraints.&nbsp; Today, the SAF trains in about a dozen countries around the world. &nbsp;We are very grateful to our friends for extending this assistance to us.&nbsp; These overseas training facilities, along with the exercises that the SAF conducts with foreign armed forces, bring significant benefits in terms of enhancing the SAF's operational and professional skills, improving inter-operability with friendly forces, and offering opportunities to benchmark ourselves.&nbsp; Our defence diplomacy also affords us valuable technology cooperation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Strategic Framework Agreement we signed with the United States last year provides the framework for <p align=left>Column: 1121</p>Singapore and the US to expand the scope of defence cooperation and work together to enhance regional stability and peace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also nurturing newer defence relationships.&nbsp; Having signed the Defence Cooperation Agreement with India in 2003, we have since been expanding interactions with the Indian Armed Forces.&nbsp; The regular naval exercises over the past decade have now been augmented by air and land exercises for the last two years.&nbsp; With China, my visit last November at the invitation of my Chinese counterpart provided a useful opportunity for developing a better understanding of each other's perspectives on security issues of mutual concern, and it was agreed that we would step up defence interactions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilateral defence cooperation with our ASEAN partners, Thailand and Brunei, continues to be substantive and strong, and from which both sides benefit.&nbsp; We look forward to strengthening the mutually beneficial defence cooperation with Indonesia when the Defence Cooperation Agreement is concluded.&nbsp; This will stand as a strong symbol of cooperation between two close neighbours.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore also continues to play an active role in regional groupings which enhance security, such as ASEAN, the Five Power Defence Arrangements, the ASEAN Regional Forum and, more recently, the East Asia Summit.&nbsp; We support the creation of the Asean Security Community and will work together with our ASEAN neighbours to realise it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Asia opens up, multilateral engagements will become even more important for confidence-building and facilitating dialogue, not just among <p align=left>Column: 1122</p>regional parties but also to engage countries beyond the region which have a stake in the stability and prosperity of Asia.&nbsp; Open platforms, such as the ASEAN Regional Forum, will become increasingly important, now that greater cooperation is required to deal with transnational security issues like terrorism, counter-proliferation and maritime security.&nbsp; The Shangri-la Dialogue, held annually in Singapore since 2002 and which will be held again in the middle of the year, brings together defence ministers and strategic thinkers from around the region and beyond to discuss security issues, to create greater understanding and, hopefully, better consensus as to what can be done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has also been an active participant in such multilateral efforts as the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), and we work closely with other countries in the fight against terrorism. &nbsp;The SAF organised the first PSI exercise in Southeast Asia last August, which involved 13 participating countries, sending ships, plans and observers.&nbsp; The RSN organised the first sea exercise and other professional exchanges on maritime security issues involving 19 navies of the Western Pacific Naval Symposium.&nbsp; Last year also, the&nbsp;Army hosted a Special Forces conference involving 19 Asia-Pacific countries to enhance regional cooperation in counter-terrorism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the SAF has also continued to participate in&nbsp;humanitarian relief and peace support operations.&nbsp;

Closer to home, SAF monitors are working alongside their ASEAN and EU counterparts in support of the Aceh peace process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1123</p><p>4.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF has also kept up a high operational tempo with various relief missions. After assisting in post-tsunami relief in Aceh and Phuket at the beginning of last year, the SAF deployed again for relief efforts in Nias in March, and when Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans in August. Last October, an SAF medical team was sent to Bali after the terrorist attack, and two C-130s delivered aid to Pakistan after the earthquake.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all these missions, the SAF demonstrated its operational readiness and professionalism. Their swift response and effectiveness in executing these missions were the result of years of steady investment in our people and equipment, and in building up a robust system capable of rapid and flexible responses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance missions are roles the SAF undertakes to enhance Singapore's national interests and contribute our part as a responsible international citizen. But the SAF's core mission remains the defence of Singapore's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and our vital interests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both Prof. Ivan Png and Mr Steve Chia have pointed out that the defence budget takes up a significant proportion of national expenditure. That is so because the Government considers it vital that we have a defence capability which can effectively deter potential adversaries. The Government's strong commitment to ensuring Singapore's security, the calibre of our defence force, and the determination of Singaporeans&nbsp;to protect what is theirs, is the key to our security and survival as an independent country.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A strong defence allows us to pursue the best interests of our country and our people, and to chart our own course steadily and confidently.&nbsp; It is, unfortu<p align=left>Column: 1124</p>nately, the lot of small nations to come under external pressure&nbsp;- as we have from time to time. We would not want to have to succumb to such pressure. When there are loud voices raised&nbsp;against us, we must be able to take them in our stride and remain quietly confident. The SAF gives us the political space to chart&nbsp;our own destiny.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Png has asked why our percentage of GDP expenditure on defence is higher than most other countries in Asia.&nbsp; As I had pointed out last year in response to a similar question, numerical comparisons of defence expenditures are not particularly meaningful.&nbsp; For instance, to say that Vietnam spent almost 7% of GDP on defence while Japan allocated only 1% tells us very little, almost nothing, of the relative defence capabilities of these two countries. And, most importantly,&nbsp;no two countries have exactly the same strategic circumstances. There is geography and history to consider, the surrounding environment to look at. Finland, Sweden and Switzerland believe that they should reap the peace dividend after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The situation in Europe today is very different than it was in the 70s and 80s.&nbsp; At the end of the day, each country has to forge its own path, taking into account its security environment and the unique combination of resources and attributes that geography, demography and history have conferred on it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should also point out that military expenditures in Asia have been rising steadily.&nbsp; According to the US Congressional Research Service, Asia is now the largest arms market in the developing world.&nbsp; From 2001 to 2004, five of the top&nbsp;10 buyers,&nbsp;according to the US Congressional Research Service,&nbsp;were from Asia, namely, China, India, South Korea, Malaysia and Pakistan. Since 2000, some countries have doubled their military spending to modernise their armed <p align=left>Column: 1125</p>forces. Western European and Russian defence companies are finding that the Asia-Pacific is a significant market, not just in terms of quantity, purchasing power but also for increasingly sophisticated hardware.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Png has made the point that there is no need to spend more money simply because the economy is growing.&nbsp; Indeed, MINDEF does not take a feast and famine approach. We do not suddenly ramp up spending just because we have a good year nor do we squeeze it down sharply when the economy turns downwards. Our policy has been to put in consistent investments, both in good times and lean years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be too late to start buying weapons and to raise and train forces only when an obvious threat confronts us. Building an effective defence force takes many years and cannot be done in fits and starts. It takes more than a decade to bring a major new capability into service&nbsp;- from conception to bringing the system into operation with fully trained servicemen and supporting infrastructure. MINDEF draws up long-term multi-year plans so that the SAF is built up as a coherent and integrated force.&nbsp; There are checks and balances in the system to make sure that the money is well spent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the development of our defence capabilities cannot be directed only at what appears to be the most imminent threat. We should not lose sight of the fundamentals of our geostrategic circumstances just because terrorism is the most obvious threat today. We must remember that our most critical need is still to have a defence force which can deter threats to our sovereignty, enable us to withstand external pressure, and prevail over the aggressor should there be a conflict.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish to assure Dr Ong, Mr Hawazi and Prof. Png that at the same time, the <p align=left>Column: 1126</p>SAF has also been strengthening its capabilities for homeland security, and we will continue to do so, working closely with the Home Team to deal with terrorist threats. Among these capabilities, let me mention two. One is the Island Defence Headquarters and, the second, our Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosives (or CBRE) units. It is important to know that both these units are not new creations. We did not create them after&nbsp;September 11, 2001.&nbsp; Both&nbsp;have been in existence or development for some two decades. The possibility of low-intensity, unconventional attack was one which we never dismissed and, hence,&nbsp;we prepared for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;We made contingencies to deal with them. When the threat of catastrophic terrorism reared its ugly head in 2001, we were able to build on the existing Island Defence Headquarters, augment it with certain capabilities,&nbsp;and stand it up quickly as a 24/7 headquarters. &nbsp;We had started building up our CBRE capability in the late 1980s&nbsp;- almost 20 years ago. This included seeking the expertise of some of Prof. Png's colleagues in NUS so that we painstakingly built up a complete capability with operational units suited to operate in our climatic conditions, backed up by laboratories and experts, and based on a solid scientific foundation. This goes to show how important it is to take a long-term view when it comes to developing our defence capabilities; we cannot afford to wait until a threat is upon us.&nbsp; If we had not built up the ID HQ and CBRE units over a long time span, when September 11, 2001 struck us, we would have been&nbsp;scrambling around trying to get things put into place. And I am not even sure that today, just four or five years later, whether we could say that we were satisfied with what we have when we have just spent three or four years doing it .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, MINDEF is fully conscious of our responsibility to use the money allocated to defence prudently and stringently. <p align=left>Column: 1127</p>MINDEF has rigorous checks in our budget process. Acquisition programmes are carefully scrutinised at various levels to determine need, evaluate options, and decide on the most cost-effective solutions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rigour and integrity of our system is widely acknowledged by defence analysts. Singapore has acquired a hard-earned&nbsp;reputation as a reference customer. This was why our decision on the RSAF's Fighter Programme was watched so closely around the world. Let me quote a recent observation in the 21st February 2006 issue of <I>Flight Daily News</I>, which says, "Singapore's evaluation was widely praised as being thorough, in-depth and comprehensive." In fact, a number of countries, who are&nbsp;considering fighter purchases, have come to our procurement agency to ask us about&nbsp;the processes by which we went through our evaluation.&nbsp; &nbsp;Another article, in the 23rd February issue of <I>Aviation Week</I>, noted that for the contenders in the current competition to supply the RSAF a trainer aircraft, &nbsp;"a win . . . will be valuable not only in financial terms. Singapore's preference may well go on to influence other prospective customers worldwide."&nbsp; We could not have gained such a reputation if MINDEF did not have the highest standards of prudence and stringency in our expenditure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, history has no lack of examples of nations which have fallen to aggressors because they were not prepared or not prepared to be prepared. We all know what happened to Kuwait in 1991.&nbsp; Singapore has no buffer. If deterrence should fail and the SAF is called into battle, it cannot afford to fail in its mission. We will not have a second chance. This is what we mean when we say that our defence spending is our insurance policy. We have to maintain a strong defence now so that we will not have to pay a much higher price in the future. At another level, as the Minister <p align=left>Column: 1128</p>for Defence and, I am sure, this is true for all Singaporeans, we should make sure that if our soldiers, sailors and airmen ever have to go into battle, they have the best equipment and training that we can provide them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Ravindran, Mr Leong Horn Kee, Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Sin Boon Ann have asked about the progress of the SAF's transformation efforts. I would like to report that we are well on the way to developing the capabilities of the 3rd Generation SAF.&nbsp; The SAF has been experimenting with new operational concepts, capabilities, technologies and training methods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I pointed out last year, transformation is a journey and not a static goal. This ensures that the SAF is always ready to face new challenges and can fight and win the wars of tomorrow, not get stuck in the fighting concepts of past wars. As one set of capabilities is delivered, there will be a spiral development to deliver the next set of capabilities. These are the demands of the modern battlefield as armed forces leverage on technology to enhance their edge over potential adversaries. We are fortunate that MINDEF and the SAF have the science and engineering resources in our Defence organisations and industries; and that more than 80% of each cohort coming into National Service are tech-savvy soldiers with A-level, Polytechnic, or ITE qualifications.&nbsp; Our National Servicemen in our reserve forces are also very well qualified and have no difficulty converting to these new equipment and concepts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Leong Horn Kee asked about the impact of the reduction in full-time NS to&nbsp;two years, for those who previously had to serve 2 1/2&nbsp;years. As Members are aware, the transformation of the SAF was the key driver that made this feasible. The two-year NS system has been implemented smoothly since December 2004.</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><p align=left>Column: 1129</p>Incidentally, the drive to a 3G SAF also allows us to reduce the ICT call-ups for our NSmen from 13 years to 10.&nbsp; So, it is not just the full time NSmen; but also our Operationally-Ready&nbsp;NSmen have benefited from it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The training of our commanders and for our units has been adjusted to factor in the shorter deployment period of our National Servicemen. Our transformation efforts also mean that more of our National Servicemen will be deployed in positions which are more challenging and make better use of their education and training in utilising the capabilities of the 3G SAF.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have sought the Speaker's indulgence, so please allow me now to share with Members a video which illustrates one of the key capabilities of the 3G SAF. &nbsp;This shows the integrated sensor-shooter network which was exercised in two major exercises the SAF conducted just last year in&nbsp;November - Forging Sabre in the Mojave Desert in California, and Wallaby in Shoalwater Bay in Queensland.&nbsp; In these exercises, the SAF linked a series of sensors - manned and unmanned, airborne and ground - to form a tight network to watch over the battlefield.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see, once a sensor detects a target, the information is sent to the HQ in real time. A UAV can track the enemy and relay a continuous stream of target information to the HQ and a network of shooters. &nbsp;The most appropriate shooter is quickly assigned to take out the target, or a suite of shooters can launch a synchronised attack. &nbsp;Fighter aircraft can come in quickly with precision bombs. The Apache attack helicopters, which can detect more than 200 targets with their Longbow radar, can take out many tanks <p align=left>Column: 1130</p>rapidly with Hellfire missiles, rockets and guns. The artillery guns will wipe out what remains of the enemy.&nbsp; Multiple sensors can confirm the effects on the enemy forces and the HQ can quickly decide what follow-on strikes are necessary. &nbsp;With information technology and networking, the SAF has brought the sensor-to-shooter cycle down to a matter of minutes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will show it to you again so that you can have another look, if you have missed some of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see, we can find the target by multiple means and we can attack it by multiple means as well. This makes it difficult for the enemy to hide or run.&nbsp; It also makes it difficult for him to counter-attack effectively as there is no single point of vulnerability that he can hit and cripple our systems. In conventional warfare, the commanders are often faced with a dilemma, the trade-off between dispersion and concentration of forces is a key challenge. Networking allows us to disperse our forces so that we are less vulnerable, and yet be able to bring together a concentration of fire, force and effects to deliver a massive blow to the enemy.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can see that the strength of the 3G SAF is not from superior platform numbers or specific platform capabilities alone.&nbsp; Rather, the strength of the 3G SAF will be multiplied by the ability to network our various systems and capabilities together to achieve a quantum leap in total capability. &nbsp;For example, the way to combat tanks is no longer by fielding more and bigger tanks.&nbsp; These are necessary, but this is not the only way to solve the problem. &nbsp;Our anti-tank capability will comprise a network of unmanned sensors, precision missiles delivered by Apache attack helicopters, smart bombs delivered by fighter aircraft, and armoured forces on the ground. The whole, as the saying goes, will be greater than the sum of the parts.&nbsp; I have distributed a DVD and some MINDEF and SAF publications <p align=left>Column: 1131</p>showing Exercise Forging Sabre and Exercise Wallaby to give Members a clearer concept of networked warfare.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Sin Boon Ann asked what the SAF has learned from the US experience in Iraq.&nbsp; First, let me say that the SAF is constantly learning from many other armed forces and not just the Americans.&nbsp; In doing so, we do not merely copy, but apply what we learn to our own circumstances.&nbsp; Technologies will not solve all the problems in the urban environment or, for that matter, any environment. &nbsp;But we will equip our soldiers with technologies that can make a significant difference to their fight in the urban environment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here with me an example of such technologies. This surveillance ball was developed by ST Engineering for fighting in built-up areas (FIBUA).&nbsp; It has embedded sensors, and our soldiers can roll it round a corner or throw it into a room so they can see behind walls. &nbsp;This will improve situational awareness and minimise casualties.&nbsp; 3SIR, our urban operations battalion, is now conducting trials with this FIBUA surveillance ball.&nbsp; The SAF will be fielding more of such technologies to help our soldiers overcome the many complexities of the battlefield.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the SAF continues its transformation journey, it will continue to maintain a high state of operational readiness. The operational readiness of the SAF may not make headlines everyday.&nbsp; But the SAF is constantly at work quietly behind the scenes - whether conducting regular naval and air patrols in the Malacca Straits, securing major international events like the International Olympic Council meeting, or escorting high value ships through our sealanes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the operational readiness of the SAF requires sustained hard work and rigorous training. The training has to be <p align=left>Column: 1132</p>rigorous, as pointed out by Mr Ravindran,&nbsp;and it has to be realistic. We have to prepare our servicemen well because&nbsp;military operations are very demanding and victory or defeat hangs in the balance. &nbsp;We also owe it to our servicemen that we prepare them adequately so that they have the ability and confidence to fight, survive and win, should they ever have to go into battle.&nbsp;&nbsp;Training has to be tough and realistic, but it also has to be in strict accordance with safety regulations and safety procedures. &nbsp;There is top-level focus on safety in the SAF, as Mr Tan Soo Khoon has pointed out,&nbsp;and we do expect the highest safety standards from our commanders, all the way down the line. &nbsp;Safety requirements are systematically integrated into all SAF activities, and safety systems and processes are continually being improved.&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF has also strengthened its safety inspectorates and, in addition to safety officers, formations have been augmented with Formation Safety Warrant Officers who have extensive experience and knowledge of safety and risk management. &nbsp;There are regular safety audits of the units, including surprise audits.&nbsp; The previous work year and the last work year, there were about 1,000 such audits per year.&nbsp; It works out to about 20 such audits by the various groups per week.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High-risk activities are audited more frequently. The results of the audits are reported to the respective Service Chiefs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever there is an incident, whether or not it involves injury, the safety inspectorate of the particular Service will review what happened and draw lessons, and these lessons are then disseminated to all personnel. The SAF also reviews near-misses as valuable lessons can be drawn from them. We want to develop an open culture where people are encouraged to report near misses and share the lessons. This requires a change in mindset.&nbsp; We are working on that.&nbsp; The SAF is also drawing lessons from the safety practices of other <p align=left>Column: 1133</p>established armed forces like the US, UK and Australia.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng asked about comparisons with other armed forces.&nbsp; Yes, we do benchmark against them.&nbsp; We compare the systems and the procedures which we have in place against those in other armed forces and we are comparable, if not better than best practices.&nbsp; We are not able to compare data because the basis of collecting the data, the numerators and the denominators are different and there is no standardised basis for this, except for the air force, where air forces use the number of incidents or accidents per 100,000 hours as the norm by which they compare against each other.&nbsp; On that comparative basis, our air force does as well as, if not better than, the air forces of advanced developed countries.&nbsp; Our safety systems are there and in place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two dimensions to safety, both equally important - the system and the individual. We must have rigorous safety systems and processes and there must be strong command emphasis and command responsibility. Our servicemen must also have a high level of safety consciousness and alertness, so that the entire safety chain remains strong and unbroken. We will do our best, but even with the best efforts, it is not possible to entirely eliminate training incidents.&nbsp; However, we must ensure a rigorous system, minimise human errors, and learn from the mistakes and not repeat them and reduce to an absolute minimum and eliminate, if possible, such incidents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Tan Soo Khoon and Dr Ong Chit Chung asked about the training deaths last year.&nbsp; There were&nbsp;four training incidents last year&nbsp;that resulted in fatalities.&nbsp; In the first incident in June 2005, a regular serviceman in training for the Special Operations Force drowned during maritime counter-terrorism training. <p align=left>Column: 1134</p>This is very demanding training to carry out the extremely difficult mission of approaching a ship which may be in the open sea, and then taking it over, by force if necessary, with minimum casualties to any hostages. Only specially selected regular troopers who volunteer for this Force undergo such training and they are rigorously prepared in a step-by-step progressive training in order that they may be able to conduct such a mission.&nbsp; It is a very, very demanding mission.&nbsp; These are things which ordinary human beings do not do and these are very special men and, Sir, I am certainly and deeply grateful, and the nation should be deeply grateful that there are Singaporeans who are prepared to volunteer for such missions and to put their lives on the line at any time, 24-hours a day, if they are called upon to undertake a rescue hostage mission.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Attorney-General's Chambers, after reviewing the facts of the case, the investigation reports by the Police, and the findings of the Coroner's Court, found no legal grounds for proceeding with criminal charges against the four servicemen who were conducting the training. &nbsp;AGC has now referred the matter to MINDEF for possible action under military law. MINDEF will conduct further investigations before we decide on the next course of action. If our investigations show that any of the&nbsp;four servicemen has failed to perform his duties as required, we will take the appropriate disciplinary proceedings against the serviceman under military law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second incident in July 2005 involved two servicemen - an SAF serviceman and a foreign serviceman. They were doing helicopter rappelling training when they fell after their ropes disengaged from the rope attachment device on the helicopter. The Police investigation is still in progress. This training has since been&nbsp;resumed after a thorough review has been done and <p align=left>Column: 1135</p>improvements were made to the rope attachment device and dispatch procedures.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other two cases were of two servicemen who collapsed while taking part in runs and subsequently died. The autopsies revealed that these were cases of Sudden Cardiac Death.&nbsp; Our investigations showed that the medical responses in both cases were appropriate and adequate.&nbsp; The SAF has a regime for screening for cardiac risk factors, starting before a serviceman is enlisted. But it is not always possible to detect a heart ailment before a person suffers a heart attack. Over the last five years, there were&nbsp;six cases of Sudden Cardiac Death in the SAF that occurred during training.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the SAF will continue to strengthen its safety systems and procedures, as well as its safety culture. Even as we proceed with tough and realistic training - as we must, to enhance the SAF's capabilities and operational readiness - MINDEF will continue to make sure that we do so without compromising safety.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Ms Irene Ng's suggestion to erect a memorial to commemorate servicemen who lost their lives in the line of duty, MINDEF recognises that the servicemen who lose their lives have made the ultimate sacrifice while serving the country.&nbsp; We will consider her suggestion.&nbsp; During the SAF Day Parade on the 1st of July each year, a minute's silence is observed to pay tribute to the servicemen who lost their lives in the course of duty. This is a deeply significant segment of the annual parade. &nbsp;MINDEF believes that this is a meaningful and solemn recognition of SAF servicemen who lost their lives during training.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, technology is critical for the 3G SAF. But the human spirit in any fight is perhaps even more critical. &nbsp;Our soldiers must be well-trained and disciplined, and <p align=left>Column: 1136</p>they must have in them the fighting spirit to overcome adversity and defeat the enemy regardless of the conditions or odds. &nbsp;I fully agree with the observation that ultimately it is the people who make the difference - people who are well trained and who have the determination to fight and win.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans should be grateful for the commitment and sacrifices of our National Servicemen. They form the backbone of our defence.&nbsp; Our nation is fortunate that Singaporeans understand the need for National Service, and that our NSmen are committed to their duty to the nation and their families give them their support as they do so.&nbsp;</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>It is only right that we show our appreciation for the efforts and contributions of our NSmen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am, therefore, pleased to inform Members that after careful study of RECORD IV's recommendations, MINDEF has accepted all the recommendations.

First, to provide clarity of rules on early disruption from full-time NSF, on NSF deferment and deferment on NSF <p align=left>Column: 1140</p>reservist training.&nbsp; Secondly, more specifically, to allow early disruption of up to three months from full-time NSF for servicemen to proceed for their tertiary education.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As MPs, we constantly receive appeals from our residents to assist them in&nbsp;matters concerning NSF deferment and disruption.&nbsp; May I suggest that it will be a great help and very useful all round and to&nbsp;all parties concerned&nbsp; -&nbsp; MINDEF itself, the SAF, the combat units, the servicemen and their families as well as to the MPs&nbsp; -&nbsp; if MINDEF can spell out very clearly the rules concerning deferment and disruption.&nbsp; At the moment, we do not know very much about the rules ourselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have the impression that such matters are not clearly explained by MINDEF to the servicemen and their families.&nbsp; Otherwise, they would not have a need to refer to their MPs for help.&nbsp; Often, the rules are general and appear to be more like "hit-and-miss" to the servicemen.&nbsp; Therefore, I would like to suggest that MINDEF publish a handbook or at least some form of written explanation or guidelines for reference by servicemen and their families regarding the application for NSF deferment, early disruption and reservist deferment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow me to quote a few examples.&nbsp; For NSF deferment, generally, it is known previously that a young man can be approved for NSF deferment if he could gain entry into a recognised university before he reaches 17 years old.&nbsp; However, I understand that this rule has now been changed some while ago to a lower limit of 16 1/2 years old.&nbsp; This is probably not very well known.&nbsp; And there are constant requests to allow students for NSF deferment if they could gain entry into very prestigious universities like Oxford, Cambridge or Harvard, which may not hold the places for them if they cannot get deferment, since the universities&nbsp;can only hold&nbsp;the places&nbsp;for one <p align=left>Column: 1141</p>year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if they can get NS deferment,&nbsp;they could save time and&nbsp;can enter such prestigious universities and&nbsp;have a good career after graduation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, why such hide-and-seek game and guess work for the people?&nbsp; Why not be clear, direct and open about such rules?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example is early disruption.&nbsp; I had a resident who appealed very earnestly for two months early disruption for his son to enter a local university.&nbsp; If approval is granted, his son could save 10 months of waiting time.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; MINDEF had disapproved his son's request on the ground of equitability to all other students in his son's cohort who could not gain entry into a local university at the same time as him.&nbsp; But why such a need to be equitable?&nbsp; In the end, why do we make some of our servicemen wait around for 10 months, if&nbsp;we can give them&nbsp;an early disruption of two months?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I wish the Minister could clarify such matters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Chit Chung--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, does this two-year policy lead to any consequential changes in the granting of deferment or early disruption for further studies?&nbsp; We have come across many such requests and problems at the meet-the-people sessions.&nbsp;

It is this camaraderie that will hold the unit together in times of war and operation.&nbsp; I, therefore,&nbsp;believe this series should be viewed by all National Servicemen and be used as a training tool.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Loo Choon Yong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But, from time to time, I also hear people saying that $400 is too little.&nbsp; I agree it is not a very big sum.&nbsp; It cannot be equated to the sweat, blood and tears or the climbing, jumping, crawling, and sometimes, humiliation.&nbsp; But I think it is a great gesture.&nbsp; I think it can never be enough.&nbsp; So people should not look at the numerical value, but this is a token on behalf of the nation to say we thank&nbsp;them and we recognise&nbsp;their efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope some National Servicemen out there will understand that it cannot be a decimal equal compensation for all their years in NS.&nbsp; It is meant to be a gesture.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, women in NS again.&nbsp; Sir, from time to time, in this House, outside this House, people call for enlisting women into NS.&nbsp; I understand and accept the Minister's explanation in a previous debate.&nbsp; He will use the Enlistment Act only for critical missions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can we then have a volunteer corps for women?&nbsp; For instance, we have women in SAF hospital units.&nbsp; We have the Special Constabulary, where women serve as policewomen.&nbsp; I think this will be good because it is a common experience serving the nation, nation building objectives and, of course, bonding with peers&nbsp; -&nbsp; male and female&nbsp; - and it might <p align=left>Column: 1143</p>even help us procreate and have more Singaporeans.&nbsp; I wonder whether the Government will look at this with a fresh pair of eyes and see whether there is scope to enable people either in the gap year or working women&nbsp; -&nbsp; professionals and non-professionals&nbsp; - to volunteer for various activities within the Armed Forces or the Police Force, and perhaps, later on, &nbsp;they may even sign on.&nbsp; Let us not forget that many women are taking leadership positions in industry and&nbsp;commerce, and they all become mothers at one time or other.&nbsp; So I think we should look at this issue carefully and we study the situation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>clear fundamentals in which we base our policies on these issues.&nbsp; Recently, this House debated the issue of NS defaulters&nbsp;following the Melvyn Tan episode.&nbsp; It was a useful debate because it allowed MINDEF to explain the fundamental basis for National Service.&nbsp; It also caused Singaporeans to examine what right we have to call NS-liable men to service and under what terms do we implement the Enlistment Act.&nbsp; To refresh Members' memories, let me summarise what Minister Teo then articulated.&nbsp; There were three fundamental principles.&nbsp; First,&nbsp;National Service must be for meeting&nbsp;a critical national&nbsp;need of national security and survival.&nbsp; We repeat it, but&nbsp;it should not be largesse.&nbsp; Because we recognise, and Members of this House often say, that NS imposes considerable cost, both to the individuals and&nbsp;the nation.&nbsp; So it is not something that we call upon our Singaporeans to do unless it is for&nbsp;a critical national need of national security and survival.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second and third principles are universality and equity in implementing the liabilities and duties of NSmen.&nbsp; Why universality and equity?&nbsp; Because, otherwise, it is very difficult to impose these liabilities on Singaporeans.&nbsp; These&nbsp;same three principles also govern our approach to issues related to deferment, disruption, flexibility in call-ups and women in NS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me first touch on deferment and explain the basis.&nbsp; For deferments that we have previously allowed -&nbsp;Mr Leong alluded to them -&nbsp;and the recent changes that have been put into place,&nbsp;under the Enlistment Act, any NS-liable male can be called up for NS as soon as he turns 18 years old.&nbsp; There is a reason for this enlistment age.&nbsp; We should be clear that the SAF must be able to maintain and <p align=left>Column: 1145</p>project a credible force to achieve the critical need to ensure our security and survival at all times.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;the <I>raison d'etre</I>.&nbsp; And it has to do so with a conscript army because of our small population. In other words, when the button is pushed, who do we depend on?&nbsp; We depend on operationally-ready (OR)&nbsp;NSmen.&nbsp; They form the backbone of our SAF.&nbsp; Therefore, not only do we require them to be trained to be soldiers and leaders within the two years of NSF, they also play a critical role as operationally-ready soldiers during their remaining NS liability.&nbsp; For many, this would mean that they are required to serve up to the age of 30-plus.&nbsp; By enlisting them around 18 years of age, we optimise the ability of the SAF to fulfil its mission with an energetic and able-bodied defence force.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the legislated enlistment age and operational requirements, MINDEF had exercised flexibility in the past by allowing some groups of students to complete their studies before serving their national service full-time&nbsp;(NSF).&nbsp; We&nbsp;were not&nbsp;rigid.&nbsp; MINDEF had granted deferment to those who could start their full-time course of study before the age of 18 for local courses and before 17 1/2 for overseas courses, and this was assuming that such courses would not last more than three or four years.&nbsp; Similarly, pre-enlistees are granted deferment for 'A' level and polytechnic diploma courses if they are below 19 years old as at 1st January of the year of the commencement of the course.&nbsp; Such exceptions are workable if the majority of NS-liable males entered into a few institutions with fixed starting terms.&nbsp; We could predict quite reliably the proportion&nbsp;and number of students that would be deferred.&nbsp; But educational opportunities have expanded exponentially in the past few years.&nbsp; We now have a proliferation of institutions with a variety of modules in Singapore.&nbsp; New compressed integrated courses have <p align=left>Column: 1146</p>also been introduced so that students could theoretically start any time within the year.&nbsp;The opportunity to study abroad and at different times of the year have also increased as Singaporeans have become more affluent.&nbsp; Many Singaporeans would be able to start universities or other courses before ages 17 1/2 abroad or 18 locally.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is, therefore, no longer tenable to grant deferments based on past criteria.&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF has therefore decided to get back to basics, rationalise our deferment policy based on operational needs and the primary goal of National Service.&nbsp; This is the starting principle, and it is a fundamental one.&nbsp; In rationalising our policy, it is understood that NS is a sacrifice which may mean that Singaporeans have to defer their university studies till&nbsp;after they have completed National Service.&nbsp; We apply the key principles of universality and equity to ensure that everyone within the same cohort could receive more or less the same treatment in allowing them to attain their educational qualifications.&nbsp; Therefore, MINDEF will only grant deferment for pre-enlistees to gain their basic educational qualifications.&nbsp; Let me define "basic".&nbsp; Basic is 'A' levels, polytechnic diploma, or below.&nbsp; This is reasonable as most of our 18-year-old NS enlistees would either have completed their basic qualification programme or about to complete it.&nbsp; As university degrees are considered high educational qualifications, deferments for university studies will no longer be allowed.&nbsp; This new policy for deferments has been in place from the end of last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vast majority of our enlistees will not be affected by this rationalisation.&nbsp; Our past records showed that under the old previous deferment policy, less than 100 a year were granted deferment for university studies in the past.&nbsp; This was a special 100 in that sense.&nbsp; Moving forward, this will no longer be allowed.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1147</p>For those who are affected, what it means is that they have to serve NS like the rest of their peers before going&nbsp;for university studies.&nbsp; This is, indeed, the norm.&nbsp; Even for those who do their pre-university studies overseas, more than 75% of those granted deferment for pre-university studies in the past returned to serve their NS before proceeding to university.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of our rationalisation, ITE students will now be able to proceed to undertake a polytechnic diploma course -&nbsp;a basic educational qualification - &nbsp;before enlisting for NS.&nbsp; Even then, we will only allow such deferment if they are below 20 years old as at 1st January of the year of commencement of the course.&nbsp; I know there are many National Service full-time men with ITE qualifications who are already currently serving in the SAF. We will allow early disruption to all those who have completed their BMT to pursue their polytechnic diploma in April 2006 or April 2007, provided that they qualify for the deferment under the new policy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me talk about disruption.&nbsp; Mr Leong, Dr Ong and Dr Loo called for greater flexibility in granting disruption from full-time NS for tertiary studies; in other words, someone is enlisted for National Service and then allow him to disrupt to enter university.&nbsp; I have previously spoken on deferment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have asked that disruption be granted for&nbsp;all scholarship holders, or for some people who can enter into prestigious universities.&nbsp; Let me clarify that disruptions not only affect the training and operational readiness of the individual but it also impact the unit as a whole, because the army fights as a unit.&nbsp; It will compromise unit standards and its operational readiness. This is especially so because the duration of NS has been reduced to two years.&nbsp; MINDEF therefore allows disruptions only in selected cases,&nbsp;based on the same three principles.&nbsp; First, it must be subject to the operational <p align=left>Column: 1148</p>readiness of their units being compromised.&nbsp; For equity, we will allow disruptions for those who are enlisted for NS in&nbsp;later intake batches so that they are able to start university in the same year as their peers, or of the same school cohort who&nbsp;were enlisted earlier.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give some&nbsp;examples so that&nbsp;Members can understand what I am saying.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;National Servicemen serving full time, belonging to the same 'A' level or polytechnic cohort, are typically enlisted over two intakes.&nbsp; We cannot bring them all over&nbsp;because there is the problem of the flow. So they are typically brought over two intakes, due to capacity constraints at the training schools.&nbsp; 'A' level holders are typically enlisted in December and March intakes&nbsp;- there are basically two intakes&nbsp;- while diploma holders are typically enlisted in the June and September intakes.&nbsp; In each of these cases, MINDEF will allow disruption of up to two months to those who were called up in the later intake so that they could enter university in the same year as those who were enlisted in the earlier intake - the principle of&nbsp;equity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow me to illustrate this with&nbsp;an example because it can get quite confusing.&nbsp;An 'A' level NSF enlisted in December 2005 will complete his two years' NSF liability in December 2007 and will be able to commence his university studies, if he wanted to, say, in&nbsp;February 2008 if he starts, let us say, in an Australian university.&nbsp; But his classmate, who was &nbsp;enlisted in April 2006, &nbsp;will only complete his NS liability in April 2008.&nbsp; In other words, the classmate was enlisted late and his peers now start university in February 2008.&nbsp;For such cases, because it was due to a different call-up date, MINDEF may grant a two-month disruption to pursue his university studies. However, MINDEF does not allow disruption to those who are trying to start an overseas course or a local course one academic year ahead of their male peers <p align=left>Column: 1149</p>within the same cohort.&nbsp; This is the very example that Mr Leong brought up.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Leong suggested that we disrupt them to allow them to enter the university.&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the same example, we would not allow disruption for an 'A' level NSF enlisted in December 2005 to start&nbsp;university in September 2007.&nbsp; This would be unfair to&nbsp;his peers of&nbsp;his cohort in Singapore who can only commence their studies in 2008.&nbsp; It is, in fact, untenable because of the expanded choice of universities, both here and locally, where almost all students could find a place to start at some university earlier, and apply for disruption.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for disruption for scholarship holders, only PSC scholars have been given special consideration for disruption, after serving six to 10 months of NS to do their university studies before returning to complete the remainder of their full-time NS.&nbsp; Annually, only about 30 are granted such early disruptions.&nbsp; This is not extended to other scholarship holders as early disruption has a significant impact, and this should be minimised.&nbsp; Such special consideration is only given to PSC scholarship holders as it is an important conduit for bringing key talent into the public service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Loo asked for greater flexibility with regard to deferment for in-camp training (ICT) for NSmen.&nbsp; There is already a high degree of flexibility and we have granted deferments for those who have just started a new job or getting married during the ICT. But for operational reasons again, such deferments cannot be free for all.&nbsp; Every NSman has a role to play and the unit is affected if he is deferred from in-camp training.&nbsp; There is thus a need to strike a balance between the inconvenience caused to the NSman by the in-camp training and the impact on the unit, if the NSman is granted deferment.&nbsp; The <p align=left>Column: 1150</p>commander on the ground is in the best position to make the judgement, and rightly so,&nbsp;because it is the commander who is held accountable for the readiness of his unit. All requests for deferments are therefore decentralised and put up to the unit commanders for consideration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Loo,&nbsp;as in his perennial wish, also asked women to be called up for NS in non-combat roles.&nbsp; As stated by my Minister before, we currently have no operational need for women conscripts to serve in the defence force.&nbsp; NS, yes, must be for the critical need of security and survival.&nbsp; While National Service can help in national education and character building, these are not sufficient reasons in themselves to call up women for NS.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Loo will also be interested to know that, indeed, there are women volunteers in the SAF, as well as in the Civil Defence (CD). There are currently about 5,666 active CD volunteers, out of which 36% are women.&nbsp; So they do serve a useful role and they can volunteer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now move&nbsp;on to RECORD IV, and I have spoken at length on how MINDEF balances its operational and training requirements.&nbsp;All male Singaporeans are called to serve National Service.&nbsp; Despite many competing demands for their time, our National Servicemen understand the need for NS and have&nbsp;remained committed in fulfilling this duty to the nation.&nbsp; I am therefore happy to note that the Government and MINDEF have accepted all recommendations put forth.&nbsp; We have circulated our report, but I will not go into all the recommendations.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just highlight the key ones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Dr Loo eloquently pointed out, this is not a&nbsp;<I>quid pro quo</I> way of registering our thanks. It is a simple way of saying "thank you" for all their sacrifices and efforts.&nbsp; The key recommendation is to give more&nbsp;to NSmen in the next</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

This is a strong recognition of the role our NSmen have played in the defence of Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.45 pm&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also announced acceptance of various other recommendations, and this is the Operationally Ready NS (ORNS) Completion Award, where NSmen who complete their training cycle from 1st January this year will receive a monetary award of $300.&nbsp; The first payment will be made in April 2007.&nbsp; Thereafter, MINDEF will give this award on an annual basis to those who complete their training cycle in the previous work year.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MINDEF has accepted RECORD's recommendation to relax the MINDEF Notification Centre requirement.&nbsp; Currently, NSmen going overseas for more than 24 hours or less than six months are required to notify MINDEF of their trips.&nbsp; Henceforth, NSmen who have already completed their ORNS training cycle and have been phased into the MINDEF Reserve will now be exempted from this notification, even if they are below the statutory age.&nbsp; MINDEF has also agreed to relax exit control measures for full-time National Servicemen.&nbsp; Currently, NSFs are required to apply for an exit permit when they travel overseas, regardless of the trip duration.&nbsp; With the change, they will be required to apply for exit permits only for overseas trips of three months or more.&nbsp; MINDEF will also improve the convenience of other exit control measures recommended by RECORD, as these changes to exit controls take time to implement.&nbsp; Details will be announced in the next four months or so.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also strengthen the Total Defence effort and, as a start, the role of the Advisory Council for Community Relations and Defence (ACCORD) will be <p align=left>Column: 1152</p>expanded to engage more Singaporeans in Total Defence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the area of recreation, RECORD IV has recommended a SAFRA clubhouse be developed in Jurong to cater to the needs of NSmen living in the west, and this has been accepted.&nbsp; In addition, the committee has also recommended that the existing Toa Payoh Clubhouse be upgraded.&nbsp; By fully accepting all the RECORD IV recommendations, we hope to underscore again the Government's and the people's appreciation of the role of National Servicemen and the contributions they have made. &nbsp;They are the bedrock of our defence, and they remain as critical as ever in the light of the changes in the security environment.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now address the comments raised by Dr Teo Ho Pin on defence research and development.&nbsp; Apart from its key function of acquiring systems to meet the SAF's requirements, the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) undertakes R&amp;D in building protection and developing critical real-time command and control (C2) systems for the SAF. &nbsp;It also manages the defence R&amp;D budget for MINDEF by investing in promising R&amp;D activities with potentially high payoffs for defence in the DSO National Laboratories, our universities,&nbsp;defence industry and other research institutions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the&nbsp;DSO which does the bulk of our front-end defence R&amp;D.&nbsp; It undertakes R&amp;D to sharpen the cutting-edge for our defence in areas such as sensors, electronic warfare, guided weapons, information systems, and chemical and biological defence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An excellent illustration of how our R&amp;D capabilities have multiplied the fighting capabilities of the SAF is in the development of the Combat Management System (CMS) for our frigates.&nbsp; The ship may have been designed and developed in France, but the CMS, which is the brain <p align=left>Column: 1153</p>of the ship, was developed locally by our own defence scientists and engineers from DSTA and DSO.&nbsp; This Combat Management System fuses the information from a myriad of combat sensors, evaluates the threats faced by the ship and matches the appropriate weapons to neutralise any threats.&nbsp; The CMS enables the commander to make superior decisions to deal decisively with&nbsp;operational situations.&nbsp; Without it, the commander would have required a much larger crew, taken much longer to understand the situation and decide on the appropriate response, and thus put the ship and its crew at greater risks.&nbsp; The force-multiplying effects of a system like the CMS is therefore clear.&nbsp; And this explains why&nbsp;we have been&nbsp;able to reduce the ORNS full-time National Service from two-and-a-half to two years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DSTA also works closely with our defence industry to produce platforms and capabilities to meet the unique requirements of the SAF. &nbsp;Some examples of such successes are the Bionix vehicle, the Primus self-propelled howitzer and the Pegasus Lightweight howitzer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These products, together with the CMS of our stealth frigates, are&nbsp;some of the examples of&nbsp;high-payoff capabilities which have made possible&nbsp;the transformation of the SAF into 3G SAF. &nbsp;Such capabilities have resulted in sensors and weapon systems which are more effective and better networked, resulting in platforms and combat systems with&nbsp;better survivability, enabling our commanders to have better situation awareness and make better decisions, and&nbsp;our soldiers to enhance their combat effectiveness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, defence R&amp;D is about building up expertise in our people and building up intellectual capital.&nbsp; It is a long-term investment.&nbsp; Therefore, we have <p align=left>Column: 1154</p>committed about 4% of our defence budget to defence R&amp;D and a further 1% to experimentation of new operational concepts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo also asked&nbsp;whether there are plans to commercialise the output of our R&amp;D efforts.&nbsp; Let me just say that the primary purpose is&nbsp;to create knowledge and build up our defence capabilities.&nbsp; While there are dual-use technologies that we have built up and that have commercial potential, we will&nbsp;indeed exploit them.&nbsp; Such examples include&nbsp;a portable biochip system to detect pathogens which&nbsp;was&nbsp;originally developed jointly by DSO and NTU for biodefence, and an intelligent information search and analysis software developed jointly by DSO and a US research institute.&nbsp; A consortium comprising&nbsp;DSO, NUS and two A*STAR institutes have also successfully developed a multi-layer substrate packaging technology that can be commercialised.&nbsp; However, in pursuing such commercial spin-offs, we are mindful that our engineers and scientists must not be distracted from their primary mission of defence R&amp;D.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We, therefore,&nbsp;rely upon our defence industries to produce the commercial spin-offs.&nbsp; Indeed, ST Engineering now earns more revenue from their non-MINDEF work than they do from MINDEF.&nbsp; But ST Engineering would not have the capability to successively win non-defence contracts if not for the core competencies they have built up in developing systems for MINDEF.&nbsp; For example, ST Engineering has made breakthroughs in selling C2 systems to customers in Hong Kong in recent years.&nbsp; Its C2 capabilities grew due to C2 work done for MINDEF.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, we have strong R&amp;D capabilities&nbsp;in DSTA and DSO to ensure that SAF's unique requirements are met.&nbsp; Commercial spin-offs will be generated&nbsp;when there are opportunities.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Leong Horn Kee--><p align=left>Column: 1155	</p><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

First, I would like to ask the Minister whether it is correct that MINDEF does allow two months of early disruption, as the Minister&nbsp;has just said&nbsp;that&nbsp;MINDEF does not allow two months of early disruption.&nbsp; But it does allow two months of disruption as a general rule.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B> Sorry, "may".</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Leong Horn Kee--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</B> All right, "may" allow two months of disruption.&nbsp; But in terms of cohort, after the students have left school, they are no more in the same cohort.&nbsp; They actually enter enlistment at different times of the year.&nbsp; So this issue of relating cohort to enlistment period may not be valid.&nbsp; Therefore, why not just have a clarity of rule?&nbsp; As I said earlier,&nbsp;simply allow for two months' disruption, ie, whichever time of the year they are enlisted, and apply from there a two-month disruption, if it is possible, and let the NSmen plan their own careers and education.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B> Sir, as I have explained, the&nbsp;rules are very clear.&nbsp; If we allow two months' deferment for NSmen, it would indeed be untenable,&nbsp;because, for example, if&nbsp;half the pre-university cohort who had finished their A-levels were called up in December,&nbsp;two years from then, all of them, that same cohort, would apply for two months' deferment to start university in September, ie, a deferment for the whole cohort.&nbsp; So, indeed, it is untenable.&nbsp; It means shortening NS and it does not make sense.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, I have said that we need to base our deferment policy on a clear reason why we call people up for NS, and this is a strategic reason.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;for a critical need to serve NS.&nbsp; We had allowed disruptions or deferments for selected <p align=left>Column: 1156</p>cases where the university landscape&nbsp;more or less had&nbsp;fewer choices and we could control the numbers.&nbsp; But now that the educational landscape is indeed open and students can find choices to start university any time of the year in essence, we have limited it to basic educational qualifications near 18 years, and the starting point is 18 years.&nbsp; In other words, by right,&nbsp;for operational needs, we should call up every one when he turns 18.&nbsp; But we have allowed some flexibility and&nbsp;will continue to allow flexibility, based on the aspects that I have explained earlier.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Can I ask the Minister to study and monitor the situation, especially since we have increased the penalties for defaulters and it might mean that they might not be coming back at all?&nbsp; It would be counter-productive because that will affect our operational readiness.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second point is on disruption when the Second Minister made a very strong point about equity and universality.&nbsp; May I ask the Minister:&nbsp;why then is an exception being made for PSC scholars?&nbsp; If we want to apply that principle, should it not be applied equally as well?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B> Sir, let me first address the point about disruptions.&nbsp; The disruptions for PSC scholars are confined to 30-odd scholarships, and it is a signal that these are key talents, they are limited, and this is a number that can be controlled.&nbsp; We are quite fixed on principles, but neither are we completely inflexible.&nbsp; And, as we have done, we have allowed certain groups a certain latitude, to pursue also other national policies.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1157</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On defaulters, even as we have rationalised our policies on not allowing deferments for universities, I do not want to give an impression that it is a major shift which affects thousands of people.&nbsp; As I have said, from past records, this policy affected only about 75 to 100 people every year.&nbsp; As I have pointed out in my reply, for most students who did their pre-university education overseas, the majority of them actually came back in the past to complete NS here before going to universities overseas.&nbsp; So, I do not want to give the wrong impression when indeed it is not so, ie,&nbsp;that many students who went overseas for pre-university actually did pre-university education&nbsp;overseas before coming back to do NS.&nbsp; In fact, under the old policy, we have only granted deferments for about less than 100 students every year, which now means that this 100, the same numerical number, will have to do their NS first.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Leong Horn Kee--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</B> Sir,&nbsp;on this issue of&nbsp;early disruption of two months,&nbsp;we should actually look at it not from the two months' point of view of early disruption, but from the 10 months of waiting time.&nbsp; The servicemen will have to mope around waiting for 10 months for his tertiary&nbsp;education.&nbsp; In the scenario that the Minister has painted, where there may be a whole batch of NSmen who have to ask for two months' early disruption, why not consider that as well?</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B> Sir, MINDEF recognises that, because certain batches will finish earlier and not synchronised with university timetables, there will be a greater lag before&nbsp;the next starting term.&nbsp; My sense is that the higher education&nbsp;landscape is quite competitive and the institutions&nbsp;will also change their timetables to accommodate.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Members know, we have foreign universities which are setting up here, and <p align=left>Column: 1158</p>some of these universities are used to the southern hemisphere timetable and they may very well decide to start their term in January or February.&nbsp; Singaporeans can do their calculations.&nbsp; Our local universities will be hard-pressed not to compete.&nbsp; So I am quite confident that our universities will adjust to this and also make allowance for students to start earlier.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that is a different proposition from saying that we should disrupt them early, shrink our NSF from two years to one-and-a-half years, ie, 18 months, because they want to go and study.&nbsp; As we have said, we understand this is a sacrifice, something that we ask our young men to do and, therefore, which was one of the reasons why we said it must be only for a critical need.&nbsp; But it must be applied across-the-board.&nbsp; Otherwise, as I have said, you can easily find a university to start term any time before you finish your NSF liability.&nbsp; The education landscape now offers you that choice.&nbsp; And we cannot grant two months' deferment&nbsp;for this first batch&nbsp;and&nbsp;five months' deferment for a second batch.&nbsp; Then, it will just effectively mean that NSF has been shortened even further.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Since our servicemen are our greatest asset, I would like to ask the Minister if we have also in place a programme to prevent degenerative joint problems and allow for rapid diagnosis and treatment of problems as they occur. Has MINDEF looked into this, in terms of primary and <p align=left>Column: 1159</p>secondary prevention?&nbsp; How effective are these programmes? Besides the very welcomed improvement in servicemen's boots, has there been improvement in personal equipment and methods of training?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a system which produces very fit young men for our military service. But as happens worldwide, as people age, degenerative knee problems such as&nbsp;chondromalacia patellae&nbsp;will start to supervene.&nbsp; Others may tear ligaments and cartilages in training and on the playing field.&nbsp;Debussing&nbsp;from&nbsp;three-tonners&nbsp;by jumping down used to be a significant&nbsp;cause for knee injuries, ankle injuries and back injuries.&nbsp; Has this improved?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, early arthroscopic&nbsp;surgery may save the torn&nbsp;meniscus&nbsp;cartilage and prevent later disabilities.&nbsp; But proper rehabilitation means eight weeks of limited mobility and intensive rehabilitative exercises.&nbsp; This represents a loss of valuable manpower and training time. Could we not include simple focused flexibility, agility and strength workouts to strengthen servicemen's knees?&nbsp; Have we looked into, for example, providing knee pads or modify our training regimens to include stretching and strengthening exercises that can prevent injury? Perhaps we can learn from specialised sports, such as skiing, which may not&nbsp;be popular in Singapore.&nbsp; I believe the US Army has tried service research studies looking into these areas and I hope our SAF would do the same.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Preparedness Against Infectious Diseases</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Sir, during World War II, losses due to malaria and other preventable diseases among allied forces operating in the China-Burma and&nbsp;India theatre far exceeded the number of casualties inflicted&nbsp;by enemy action.

Sir, has the SAF prepared itself for coping with such diseases outbreaks during peacetime and in operations? What are we going to do about this and can we cope?</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</B> Sir, on behalf of the Minister for Defence, I would like to thank Dr Warren Lee for raising these questions on injury prevention and the SAF's preparation against infectious diseases.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, we fully agree with Dr Warren Lee that manpower resources are scarce and precious for a small military like the SAF. As such, the SAF adopts a multi-pronged approach to minimise training injuries, in other words, we look at the issue on a holistic approach and there are three parts to this holistic approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first part is proper categorisation, in other words, medical classification; the second part is progressive&nbsp;training, in other words, we put soldiers in jobs which they are fit, and also&nbsp;we train the fit to be fitter, and those&nbsp;not so fit to become fit for the job; and&nbsp;the third part of&nbsp;this holistic approach is proper equipping,&nbsp;giving them the right&nbsp;tools to do the job.&nbsp;Sir, let&nbsp;me illustrate and elaborate.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, prior to enlistment, all enlistees&nbsp;undergo thorough medical check-ups to ascertain their medical status and medical history. Enlistees are assigned to different vocations according to their medical <p align=left>Column: 1161</p>status.&nbsp; Over the years,&nbsp;Sir, the SAF has continually refined the medical classification process. For example, the category of combat appointments has been further refined to differentiate between combat forces and combat support functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the course of the two-year National Service, if a soldier's medical status changes, for example, like injuries, the SAF will re-assign him accordingly to another appointment that allows him to best contribute to the country.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second part of the holistic approach to injury prevention is progressive training.&nbsp; For example, enlistees who do not attain a Silver Award in their physical fitness test prior to enlistment will undergo a Physical Training Phase to condition their fitness prior to the start of Basic Military Training. Similarly, Sir, obese soldiers undergo a specially designed BMT programme to cater to their fittest level to minimise injury.&nbsp; This modified BMT package includes progressive training like aqua jogging to condition them before they graduate to more demanding physical programmes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third part of the holistic approach to injury prevention is the equipping of our soldiers. The SAF,&nbsp;DSTA and DSO work closely together to develop the systems that meet our soldiers' ergonomic demands.&nbsp; For example, the auto-loader of the new generation artillery guns have alleviated much of the strain on the artillery soldiers. For running shoes and boots, some MPs may recall that we used to only have very limited choices, very poor choices indeed.&nbsp; Nowadays, boots come not only in many different sizes, but also shapes and width to cater to the different needs of our soldiers.&nbsp; The new load-bearing vest is yet another example.&nbsp; It distributes load more evenly to minimise the strain on our soldiers' bodies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1162</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond all these measures, Sir, the key to injury prevention must include personal responsibility to be physically and mentally fit and healthy.&nbsp; This is both an individual responsibility as well as a command responsibility.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We also have a comprehensive medical system including medical specialists, physiotherapists, exercise and fitness experts and rehabilitative equipment to help our soldiers recover fully and return to their training and duties as soon as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;With these proactive measures, Sir, I would like to inform Members of Parliament that over the years, the number of soldiers that has to be medically reclassified due to training injury, especially for orthopaedic reasons, has remained stable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now touch on infectious diseases prevention and management in the SAF.&nbsp; The SAF is constantly working with other domestic international health agencies to monitor any possible outbreaks of infectious diseases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For disease like Avian flu, the SAF has put in place various levels of response according to the medical threat level. At the baseline, Sir, the SAF has issued directives to all our servicemen on the precautions to adopt for self-protection.&nbsp; The SAF is also closely monitoring the situation in our training areas to minimise the chances of our soldiers being exposed to these risks.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once an outbreak has been identified, the SAF will implement the necessary active measures to safeguard the health of our servicemen. The SAF has stockpiled&nbsp;anti-viral medications and&nbsp;individual protective equipment.&nbsp; The SAF also has contingency plans to isolate and manage any outbreaks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides safeguarding the health of our servicemen, the SAF also has plans to <p align=left>Column: 1163</p>safeguard our operational readiness.&nbsp; Business continuity plans have been formulated to ensure that the MINDEF/SAF chain of command can continue to operate in any outbreak of infectious diseases.&nbsp; Likewise, critical operational units have also developed contingency plans to ensure that any impact on&nbsp;our operational readiness will be minimal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the management of any infectious disease outbreaks or pandemic will be a national, if not international effort. To this end, MINDEF and&nbsp;SAF will work very closely with our domestic international counterparts.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Warren Lee--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Warren Lee:</B> Sir, may I seek clarification from the Senior Parliamentary Secretary?&nbsp; I was actually thinking in terms of lifecycle, ie, the maintenance of our soldiers, and whether the SAF would consider focused research.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know MINDEF has got beautiful new gymnasiums and so on as I read the <I>Pioneer</I> magazine.&nbsp; But could we develop short, sharp, simple, focused strengthening exercises which, I believe, are the preferred way of preventing long-term joint injury?&nbsp; We may actually learn a lot from specialised Olympics sports.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</B> Sir, I have visited the DSO and DSTA.&nbsp; Part of their research is to improve the soldier-equipment interface. All the equipment that we either source off the shelf or we develop in-house are ergonomically designed. This helps to lessen the load on the soldier's muscles. At the same time, we build up the soldier's fitness, in other words, we train him to be fit in order to do the job. So with this man-equipment interface, we find that the impact on a soldier, in terms of&nbsp;injury, is very minimal.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now, Dr Warren Lee talked about training soldiers on ski machines but we have no ski machines here to minimise impact.&nbsp; Did I hear him correctly?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Warren Lee--><p align=left>Column: 1164</p><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Warren Lee:</B> May I clarify?&nbsp; I was not recommending that we all go skiing.&nbsp; What I am saying is that, if you think more laterally&nbsp;and look at the world of professional sports,&nbsp;we may learn lessons from sporting&nbsp;activities because they have developed ways to strengthen and go for peak performance in their athletes.&nbsp; I&nbsp;believe that is the way that we can look at lifecycle performance for our soldiers.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</B> Dr Warren Lee talked earlier about the new gymnasiums.&nbsp; In fact, in the latest issue of <I>Pioneer</I>, which was just circulated by the Minister, on page 8, you will find these brighter, better gymnasiums. There are 12 of them, the latest ones, across the SAF camps. There are also the latest gymnasiums in the SAFRA clubs.&nbsp; Some of the machines emulate what Dr Warren Lee has been saying. There is one machine called the multiple movement machine, which allows the machine to simulate different exercise impact on army equipment. For example, this machine can emulate the movement on a soldier on artillery, so that helps him to build up his muscles that he needs to&nbsp;work on the machine. Certainly, the DSTA and DSO will continuously focus their research on how to further improve this man-machine interface.&nbsp; But we have never forgotten that the fitness of a soldier must be built up from the beginning.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ravindran--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ravindran:</B> Sir, on behalf of all Members who raised various cuts under this amendment, I would like to thank the Minister for Defence, the Second Minister for Defence and the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for their detailed explanations.&nbsp; I would like to withdraw the amendment.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sum of $9,691,055,520 for Head J ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sum of $355,000,000 for Head J ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates.</p></P></span></div>													<!--TITLE_NAME:COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY REPORTING PROGRESS--><p align=left>Column: 1165</p><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY REPORTING PROGRESS<BR></B></span><div><BR>											 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:The Deputy Leader of the House (Mr Mah Bow Tan)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Deputy Leader of the House (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, may I seek your consent and the general assent of hon.

Prof. Ong Soh Khim </B>asked the Minister for Trade and Industry with regard to promoting energy efficient green vehicles such as those using hydrogen as fuel, what are the Ministry's efforts in (i) finding commercially viable ways of supplying hydrogen safely on a larger scale; and (ii) sourcing for hydrogen refuelling projects in Singapore.</P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, hydrogen as a transport fuel is still very costly compared with traditional fuels like diesel and gasoline. This is due to the high manufacturing cost of hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles, technological barriers in hydrogen storage, and start-up cost of the hydrogen distribution infrastructure. While the technology to supply hydrogen safely on a large scale is available, it is still not commercially viable.<p class="QnWritten" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0cm; tab-stops: 28.1pt 2.0cm">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite its advantages in being more energy efficient and environmentally friendly, hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles still cost on average 10 to 20 times that of conventional vehicles. The automotive industry expects to produce commercially viable hydrogen fuel cell vehicles only 10 to 15 years from now. Similarly, hydrogen refuelling is also not commercially viable at present due to the lack of a critical mass of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.&nbsp;</p><p class="QnWritten" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0cm; tab-stops: 28.1pt 2.0cm">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are being promoted more for research and test-bedding activity rather than for wide-scale adoption. For example, automotive firm Daimler Chrysler is currently test-bedding six hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s tropical urban environment. &nbsp;BP Singapore has also set up two hydrogen refuelling stations to evaluate the commercial application of hydrogen infrastructure.</p><p class="QnWritten" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0cm; tab-stops: 28.1pt 2.0cm">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, the Economic Development Board (EDB) will continue to attract investments that will reinforce <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s position as a global centre for test-bedding new technologies, including that of hydrogen infrastructure.</p></p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P></P></span>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P>	        <!--MP_NAME:--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B> </B></P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:--><p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P></P></span>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P>	        <!--MP_NAME:--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B> </B></P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:--><p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag --><!--SECTION_NAME:APPENDICES--><P><div align=center><B>APPENDICES</B></div><P>	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> 	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">	<div align=center>		  			        		<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> 	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">	<div align=center>		  			        		<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> 	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">	<div align=center>
