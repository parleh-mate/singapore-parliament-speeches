  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Leader of the House (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> May I, on behalf of the Members of this House, extend to you our congratulations on your re-election as Speaker.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you have by now been elected for the fifth time as Speaker of Parliament. You are now in your 1&amp;h year as Speaker, the longest of any Speaker of our Parliament. I do not see your record being broken for a long time to come.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have presided over proceedings in this House and ensured order, decorum and fairness in our business. You have helped in ensuring that debates shed light and not merely generate heat. Some may say that this makes for a dull Parliament. Parliamentary debate is a serious
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> business. We are here to explain, probe, question, defend and criticise laws and policies. What we do here affects the daily life and fortune of our citizens to an extent that many of our citizens may not realize. Thus, while wit, humour, anger (real or feigned) all serve to liven up debate, Parliament is not an institution to provide entertainment. You have been greatly instrumental for upholding the high prestige and distinction of this House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot let this occasion pass without a few words about the Member for Tanglin who was Leader of the House for 16 years. He has quietly and with a deceptively casual air been a firm Leader of the House. At the last meeting before the dissolution of Parliament, he; asked:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you not had enough of me as Leader of the House?"
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the Prime Minister has heard his hint to want to step down as Leader and I now find myself as the Leader. We shall miss Mr Barker as Leader of the House, but Members can rest assured that he will continue to give us the benefit of his experience and wisdom. It is not by chance that I asked for him to be seated next to me.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a clearly perceptible change in the complexion of this, the sixth, Parliament compared to the fifth Parliament. We have in the Government benches 24 new Members. We have also two Members from the Opposition parties, the first Opposition Members to be elected in a general election since 1963. To all Members I can do no better than to repeat the advice of the previous Leader of the House, and I quote: "No Member will stray from the straight and narrow path if he always lets his conscience be his guide."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members should speak their minds freely, having the courage to agree and disagree without playing to the gallery. Ministers and office holders expect the most rigorous examination of their policies. They will have a ready ear for suggestions and constructive criticism. They do not claim infallibility. But Members must expect that we will give no quarter in defending policies we believe to be vital for our nation's well-being.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my pleasure, on behalf of the older Members, to extend a warm welcome to all the new Members. We look forward to their maiden speeches and to their future contributions to this Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I, as it were from the other side of the House, give you my very sincere and hearty congratulations on your election. We have heard from the Leader about your long reign in this House, but I, Mr Speaker, Sir, have only been under your rule for three years after I entered this House in December 1981. But may I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that during that short time of three years you have gained greatly my respect and admiration for the charm and tact which you brought to bear to this high office that you have hold with such esteem and honour. It has not always been easy for you and sometimes it has been made trying, and my only hope is that I did not contribute in any way to your trials.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it only remains for me now to wish you another very pleasant four years in office.
  <br>3.33 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is indeed a great honour to be re-elected as Speaker of this august House and I am grateful to honourable Members for according me the privilege of continuing to serve in this high and responsible office.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to thank the honourable Members for Kim Keat and Boon Lay for proposing and seconding me for this high office.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to thank the Leader of the House and the hon. Member for Anson for the kind things they said about me. I am afraid I am getting old and let us hope your forecast will come true.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of you present today have been with me in Parliament for many years and I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to them for all their goodness to me. During the past 15 years in which I have served the House in this Chair I was indeed fortunate in being helped by their indulgence and forbearance.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I acknowledge with gratitude the assistance which I have received from Mr E W Barker, the former Leader of the House. I shall miss Mr Barker's easy style, great patience and understanding which never fail to exude confidence when it is most needed. He has indeed been a true friend to me and, I think, to all honourable Members. We are therefore fortunate that we will continue to see him around in Parliament for a long long time yet.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to extend a cordial welcome to the new Members. It is indeed a refreshing change to see three lady Members among us, after having been without them for about 15 years. Their participation in our deliberations will no doubt contribute to lively debates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am slow in matching up faces, names and constituencies of the new Members, I hope that they will forgive me. I notice that out of the 24 of you only six do not wear spectacles and I find it very difficult to identify spectacles. I shall endeavour to get it all right as quickly as possible in recognizing them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may find our rules of procedure a little perplexing at times. May I explain that these rules are drawn up to secure the proper, expeditious and effective transaction of parliamentary business in an orderly and decorous manner.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Speaker, it is my duty to see that this House conducts its business with dignity and decorum. I will not allow the House to degenerate into a free-for-all. I shall adhere to the Standing Orders as fairly and rigidly as is humanly possible. Like an impartial referee on the soccer pitch, I shall be sitting in this Chair as a neutral Chairman. My sincere hope is that I shall never find it necessary, to use soccer parlance, to flash the yellow card or, worse still, the red card!
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many honourable members are versed in matters of procedure and whoever is called on to fill this Chair must know that he would be performing in the presence of a critical and vigilant assembly. With this in mind, I assure honourable Members that I will do my utmost to be worthy of your confidence in me and to uphold the rules, dignity and decorum of this House.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Leader of the House (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I seek your consent and the general assent of the Members present, under Standing Order 33, to move that, at its rising today, Parliament do stand adjourned till Friday, 1st March, 1985, at 11.00 am and that at the sitting on 1st March, 1985, the moment of interruption shall be 4.30 pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> I give my consent. Is it the pleasure of hon. Members that the Motion be moved?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr S. Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, notwithstanding the provisions of Standing Order No. 1, at its rising today Parliament do stand adjourned till Friday, 1st March, 1985, at 11.00 a.m. and that at the sitting on 1st March, 1985, the moment of interruption shall be 4.30 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this motion is to change the present sitting times of Parliament in the first instance for the meeting on 1st March, 1985, but I shall be giving notice for a motion to change the sitting times for future sittings of Parliament. This change is necessary because we intend to give television coverage of Parliamentary sittings. Parliamentary proceedings will be recorded in full and every evening of the day when Parliament sits, a 30 to 45-minute programme of the day's business will be telecast by SBC. These telecasts will be in English and in Chinese,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general public have been informed about Parliamentary proceedings through the press and through SBC newscast. Except for ceremonial occasions, like the President's Address this evening, the people do not have a direct visual and aural impression of Parliamentary debates. When it is possible for TV to bring events occurring in remote places under very difficult circumstances right into the living room, Parliament cannot continue to ignore taking advantage of TV to communicate with the people. Parliaments in other parts of the world have already started using television. Television coverage will inform Singaporeans not only of the content of Parliamentary proceedings
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> but also the cut and thrust of debate or the lack of it. Reading speeches in cold print is not the same as actually seeing and listening to an argument or an idea being put across. The printed word cannot convey the sincerity, passion and quality of the argument. To produce the kind of programme that we envisage, SBC will need time to edit and summarize four to five hours of parliamentary business into a 30 to 45-minute programme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present Standing Orders, the House rises at 8.00 pm or 8.30 pm if there is an Adjournment Motion. This gives no time for SBC to edit and produce a programme to go on the air between 9,00 pm and 10.00 pm. It is therefore necessary for sittings of Parliament to be changed. It is proposed that Parliament sits from 11.00 am to 1.00 pm with a break from 1.00 to 2.30 pm for lunch; sittings will resume at 2.30 pm and finish at 4.30 pm. If there is an Adjournment Motion, sittings will carry on to 5.00 pm.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we may have to modify these times in the light of actual experience. When we are more certain about the most suitable time, we can change the Standing Orders.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

   <h4>PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS</h4>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The President (Mr C V Devan Nair):</b> Honourable Members, the political leadership of Singapore has passed on to a new team of younger leaders. In Cabinet, 9 out of 12 were elected after 1968. In Parliament, of the 77 Government MPs, 61 were elected after 1968, and 24, or nearly one-third, in the recent General Election.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>NEW GOALS</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Government's first duty is to safe-guard what Singaporeans have achieved.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its second duty is to improve upon what has been achieved by building a better society.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In pursuing these higher goals, my Government will pay particular attention to those who find it difficult to keep up with the pace of change - the 15 to 20% in the lower income group and the aged.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next five years, my Government's objectives will be:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. to reach an accord on the character of the society people desire, and involve the young in working towards its achievement;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. to strengthen the driving force of our progress, namely, the urge each citizen has to develop his potential to the fullest and to achieve his rewards in accordance with the worth of his contribution to our economy or society;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. to target for economic growth rates of between 5-7% per annum, and an increase in the productivity rate of between 3-5% per annum;
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. to aim for 80% home-ownership by 1989, as the next stage towards a 100% home-owning society by 1999;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. to help working mothers by providing well-run nurseries, creches and play schools for their young children;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. to provide support for a socially-active life for the aged.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Greater Participation by the Population</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Government will seek the participation of our people both the young and the old in these tasks. Everyone has an honoured place in Singapore society. Everyone has a valuable contribution to make. All must participate in the big decisions which will re-shape their lives.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are examining ways to devolve control of the now towns by investing authority over the management in town councils or estate committees, which may include Members of Parliament and community leaders. Such autonomy should lead to speedier response to local problems and needs. Shared responsibility is good for neighbourliness and community solidarity. Each new town can develop its own distinctive character.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Equal Opportunities For All</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A better life for all requires the creation of more wealth. Governments do not create wealth. They can only create the pre-conditions for fruitful efforts. These pre-conditions are an efficient and honest administration, a strong defence, political stability, social and racial harmony, good industrial relations, and a free market economy. Under these conditions, equal opportunities to every citizen for education and health will lead to the maximum individual effort and the highest team spirit.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>100% Home-Ownership Society</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;81% of our population live in public housing. 60% own their homes. Few countries in the world have achieved such a high percentage of home-owners. We can do better. At the end of five years, we are confident we can increase the percentage of HDB home-owners in our population to 80%. By then, close to 90% of our population will live in HDB flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB will build 180,000 units in the next five years. About 113,000 out of 500,000 HDB households are in old rental flats. Only 17,000 of the rentals have registered to buy their own. The rest may need help to buy their flats. This Government will offer self-help schemes which with an extra effort in thrift and self-discipline can enable them to own their homes. In the next five years, we hope annually 7,000 to 10,000 families who now rent flats can become home-owners.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Working Mothers and Upbringing of Children</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women have become important contributors to our economic growth. There is a danger that their children may not receive enough parental care and guidance to grow up as moral and upright citizens.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign maids whose social backgrounds are different from ours, cannot be the imparters of cultural values to our young. The best care comes from parents and grandparents. The next best are creches and child-care centres under the charge of professionally trained child-minders. An important part of community development for a generation of working mothers is to provide high standards of care for pre-school children.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Special Attention for the Aged</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our senior citizens, those over 65 years, need better facilities to keep them socially active and healthy. Their numbers are increasing. The young must adjust their attitudes to make our senior citizens feel that they are participating members of society, and not left to be objects of charity, outside the mainstream of life.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Achievable Goals</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we achieve our goals we shall develop and mature as a society. Our people can be encouraged to find satisfaction and fulfilment beyond material pursuits. A more vibrant cultural environment can make living in Singapore more fun. This we can achieve if we set higher goals for ourselves, if we dare to achieve. Our performance in the last 25 years gives us confidence that we can succeed.

   <b>A BETTER SOCIETY</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our people have achieved their basic needs. Now we can set out to achieve higher goals.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our people can enjoy a better quality of life by 1999. There will be no unsewered households, slums or environmental pollution. Every family will own a home for we shall help the 15-20% lower income group to do so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roads will be free-flowing. The MRT will be complemented by an efficient bus and taxi service. A new city will rise from the reclaimed land at Marina Bay.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advances in technology will bring about a new future of comfort and convenience. We are about to enter a new age of instant information.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be ample facilities and support for music, the arts, for sports, recreation and leisure activities. Life in Singapore can be fun.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans will participate in and actively run their own community services. They will manage their own towns. They can place the collective interests of society above self.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans will be knowledgeable, well read and rounded. They can be gracious as well as socially disciplined and confident. They can find fulfilment in non-material pursuits. They can have the attributes of a mature people: cohesive, tolerant, charitable and compassionate. The old will not feel unwanted and the young will grow up as upright citizens.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore can be a cultivated society. The pursuit of excellence, especially in our schools and universities, will be the distinctive hallmark of Singaporeans. Talents of the people will be developed to the fullest. For that we need a creative, stimulating and culturally vibrant environment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will be honest and effective. The people will be hardworking, keen to upgrade their skills and to increase
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> their productivity and to be rewarded accordingly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on our record, we can, if we work together, realize these goals of a better society.

  <i>Building a City of Excellence</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will plant more freeflowering trees and shrubs to make the city cool, green and bright with flowers. Fruit trees will be cultivated in public housing estates and private condominiums. More play-grounds, neighbourhood parks and town gardens will be developed. We will build four new regional parks at Bukit Batok, Sembawang, Pasir Ris and Eng Neo.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will build a city served by expressways for free-flowing traffic. In the next five years, the Public Works Department will build the Bukit Timah Expressway (linking the north to the south), the Ayer Rajah Expressway (connecting the east to the west) and the Central Expressway (joining Seletar to Jurong through the urban corridor).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will prepare the plans and lay the foundations for the creation of a new city on the reclaimed land at Marina Bay while continuing the redevelopment of the existing Central Area. We will preserve our heritage in conservation and rehabilitation schemes in areas of architectural and historical merit.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Homes for Everybody</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours will be a society where all families not only own their homes, but have the chance to upgrade to bigger and better homes. We will introduce schemes to assist and encourage the 15-20% lower income groups to become home-owners.

  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end of the decade, public housing will accommodate close to 90% of the population. In the next five years, the HDB will build 180,000 units, mostly of bigger flats to meet the demand for upgrading.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB will work closely with grassroots organizations and residents to promote and foster the development of cohesive communities in our housing estates.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Construction Sector</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to upgrade the construction industry by promoting mechanisation and system building. A corps of well-trained, highly skilled and well-paid construction workers will be built up for the construction industry.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans will earn higher wages and have more leisure time. They will need outlets in sports, recreational and cultural activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can build a cultivated society which is culturally vibrant. We will nurture local talents by creating opportunities for their artistic expressions. We will send the very talented ones for training, both locally and overseas and provide financial and administrative support to local cultural organizations. We will also bring in internationally renowned artistes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The renovation of the Kallang Theatre will be completed by the end of the year. Planning will then start on a cultural complex of international standard to provide the much-needed practice studios, galleries, theatres and concert halls to further the flowering of the arts. Steps will be taken for the Singapore Festival of Arts to blossom into an international showcase of the performing arts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will continue to promote the "Sports for All" policy. We will encourage all Singaporeans to participate in sports and fitness exercises.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be more and better sports and recreational facilities. By 1990, we will have an addition of seven swimming complexes, five athletic centres, three sports halls and several tennis and squash complexes. We will also build a multi-purpose international indoor stadium to accommodate international sports tournaments and conferences, family-type entertainment shows and mass displays and concerts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will provide the opportunities and environment for the disadvantaged, the disabled and the aged to develop and express their potential and abilities. We will do this by working closely with the families and the community.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry and the Singapore Council of Social Service will assist the voluntary organizations to play a more effective role. Education and vocational rehabilitation of the disabled will receive particular attention from the Ministry.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior citizens must be allowed to continue living with their families and in familiar environments for as long as possible. Care for the aged is more than an attitude of tolerance on the part of the children. The Ministry will conduct programmes for the social care and integration of the aged with their families.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will physically upgrade or relocate existing institutional homes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will spearhead the setting up of more child care facilities so that mothers can work and increase their family income. We will provide the necessary incentives and assistance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cater for the social and recreational needs of the Muslims, work on a new Islamic Centre will commence in 1985. In addition, we will build eight new mosques by 1990.

   <b>MINISTRY OF DEFENCE</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Introduction</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's defence policy is peace through strength. We will be friends with any nation which respects our interests and our right to exist. Our defence doctrine
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> is Total Defence encompassing the whole population and all aspects of defence: military, economic, psychological, social and civil.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next few years, MINDEF will be concentrating especially on the operaional readiness of the SAF reserves, the absorption of new hardware, and the non-military aspects of Total Defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Readiness of Reserves</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reservist components of the SAF have been building up steadily. Not only are there more and more reservists, but in an emergency, the troops can be mustered, armed and committed to battle in the shortest possible time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of particular concern will be the training of units and the grooming of commanders and staff. The time available to train a reservist is short - at most only 40 days a year. The SAF will be systematically exploring better ways to train reservists and reserve units. Training circuits will be designed to practise individual military skills in the minimum possible time. training villages will be constructed so that units can conduct realistic and worthwhile field exercises in land-scarce Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many reservists have attended upgrading courses together with regulars. They now occupy most of the key appointments in their units. More will follow.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Absorption of New Hardware</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite our many full-time National Servicemen and reservists, the SAF can never expect to prevail in combat by force of numbers. Our troops must be better trained, better led, and better equipped. We must become a capital and skill-intensive armed force, and not a manpower-intensive one.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must exploit high technology to the full. The SAF will have to assimilate each individual piece of technology, like the E-2Cs, and fit them all together into a potent winning combination. To do this, the SAF will build up its manpower base, preparing its technical staff and developing its operational doctrines, and exercising its combat units.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Total Defence</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we master the problems of military defence, we shall give more emphasis to the non-military aspects of Total Defence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public will be involved in practical ways. More and more HDB residents will learn the basic skills of civil defence - first aid, firefighting and rescue work. Ways will be worked out, and exercised, to allow the SAF to tap the vast resources of the civilian economy - vehicles, equipment and services - and put them to military use should the need arise. Total Defence is much more than a slogan.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Conclusion</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no enemies today, but we cannot wait for some to appear before starting to prepare our defences. A threat to our security can develop within months. An armed force takes many years to train and nurture. That is why we have been building the SAF ever since Singapore became independent. That is why we are secure today, and why we shall continue to strengthen our defences in the years to come.

  <i>Aim, Objectives and Policies for the Next Five Years</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next five years present both challenges and opportunities. With uncertainties about a sustained economic recovery in the industrialised Western countries, the protectionist trend in trade is likely to continue. Singapore will also be facing greater pressure from the developed countries to "graduate" from its developing country status as its economy continues to grow at the targetted rate of 5-7%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have set our goal to make the big leap by 1999 into the first division of developed countries. We will have to be alert and sensitive to international and regional developments that affect our economic interests and take action whenever possible to protect these Interests and progress towards our goal. Our major
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> trading partners in the West and Japan must be persuaded to understand that the process of "graduation" to developed country status for Singapore should not be hastened prematurely and that there should be mutual consultation to allow for orderly adjustments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore together with the other ASEAN countries will continue to contribute to greater economic cooperation, security and stability in the region. We will cooperate actively in ASEAN to counter protectionism and promote an open international economic system. Institutional and personal links with our ASEAN neighbours will be strengthened,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The established order in some neighbouring countries is facing more pressures and challenges. There are flash-points for conflict on the Thai-Cambodian border created by the Vietnamese military suppression of the Cambodian resistance. We need to monitor the gravity of these trends and work out ways to deal with the repercussions on us. We shall continue our efforts with others to bring about a political settlement in Cambodia.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conduct of foreign policy depends on rapid access to information. In the course of the next few years the Ministry will be implementing its computerization programme. Computerization will result in more productive use of limited manpower and enable better policy formulation and implementation.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not be able to achieve our City of Excellence if there is a breakdown of law and order. It is essential that our streets are safe and homes secure so that we can enjoy the fruits of our labour.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Law and Order</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Police Force will shift its emphasis from law enforcement to crime prevention and detection through active involvement of grassroots organizations and the community. We shall extend the Neighbourhood Police Post system nationwide. We shall build six new headquarter
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> police stations over the next five years of which four will replace the existing ones.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall inculcate crime prevention consciousness in our population. The National Crime Prevention Council will encourage the commercial and industrial sector to adopt more effective crime prevention measures. The Neighbourhood Watch Scheme will be extended to cover the entire island.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More Boys' Clubs to provide an outlet for the young will be set up.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall recruit Police Officers of better calibre. A computerized system for speedier police responses will be available by 1988.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Internal Security</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) remains a long-term threat to internal security. The Internal Security Department will guard against its subversive activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religious extremism and racial chauvinism are also threats to internal security. We shall act against any group or individual found exploiting racial, religious or linguistic issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Drug Abuse</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drug abuse continues to be a serious threat. The very basis of society will be eroded if we lose the fight against it. The situation is under control. Our enforcement, treatment and rehabilitation efforts have produced the desired results. A new phenomenon, glue sniffing among youths, is on the rise. This menace has to be stamped out.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Immigration Control</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's talent pool is limited. We must encourage skilled and talented persons who can be an asset to Singapore in various sectors to come and strike roots here. Immigration policies will reflect this objective.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stern measures will be taken against overstayers, illegal immigrants, and people who harbour them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Services to the public will be improved through computerization and decentralization of immigration facilities.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision of Singapore as a City of Excellence and Society of Distinction can only be realized through good public services and enhanced economic and social development. The private sector must complement public sector programmes and be encouraged to take the lead in economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>BUDGET DIVISION</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Programme and Performance Budgeting System now in use in the Government will be improved to provide better allocation, management and control of the financial and manpower resources of Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Productivity and efficiency of Government operations will be increased so that new or expanded services may be provided with minimum rise in operating costs and manpower levels. Organizational structures and work procedures will
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> be reviewed and improved. The National Computer Board will step up the planned computerization of Government operations. Computerized management information systems will be developed for all Ministries and departments. Proven high technology systems will be extensively used in the public sector in keeping with the vision of Singapore as a centre of high technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>REVENUE DIVISION</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monetary policy will be geared towards maintaining confidence in the Singapore dollar and supporting non-inflationary economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial sector will be encouraged to innovate further. A futures exchange has recently been established and fiscal incentives for loan syndications, futures trading and fund management given. The promotion of fee-based financial services will be the next stage in the development of Singapore as an international financial centre.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater efficiency and better service to the public will be achieved through automation of banking operations. The automatic teller machine network of commercial banks and the Post Office Savings Bank will be extended. Electronic fund transfers and telephone banking will be promoted as steps towards a cashless society.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial and other institutions and companies will continue to be closely supervised by the regulatory authorities. The Registry of Companies and Businesses has been placed under the Ministry of Finance and a new Commercial Affairs Investigation Department has been established under the Ministry. These measures will help to maintain high standards of integrity in the corporate sector and safeguard the interests of the public.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxation policy will be directed towards developing a strong, internationally competitive and dynamic Singapore economy. Steady economic growth and stringent control on recurrent Government expenditure through higher productivity and efficiency should provide sufficient funds for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> infrastructural development without major new taxes or significant change to existing tax rates. Efforts will be made to ensure that the overall burden of taxation is not onerous. Wherever possible the tax structure will be simplified. Incentives will continue to be provided to encourage industries to upgrade, restructure, diversify and adapt to the changing world economic environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>PUBLIC SERVICE DIVISION</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector must be staffed by properly qualified, skilled and highly motivated men and women to provide the level and type of service that will be required and expected. In particular, a core of officers of exceptional ability, integrity and dedication must be maintained.to lead the effort. To guard against a deterioration in the quality of the staff in the public services, it is important to ensure that public sector employees are adequately remunerated. Salaries and other conditions of employment in the public service will therefore be regularly reviewed to be competitive with those in the private sector. Priority will be placed on staff welfare and training in order to enhance morale and productivity. Training programmes will be reviewed so that they are relevant and help officers achieve their full potential.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make Singapore a developed country by 1999, we will strengthen and broaden our economic base. Singapore will remain a free and open economy, and overseas investors welcomed, but we foresee increasing reliance on our own resources.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are our most valuable resource. We will emphasize education and training so as to produce a skilled and adaptable workforce.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We rely on exports. Our businessmen must compete more aggressively in the world markets. We will expand our network of overseas trade offices and provide up-to-date commercial information to support them.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to offer tax and other incentives to encourage industries to move into new technologies. We shall offer assistance schemes and tax incentives to both private companies and public institutions, to promote research and development.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will build new generation industrial estates and upgrade existing ones. They will have child-care centres so that women may pursue a career and remain close to their children.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will develop Singapore into a major tourist destination, creating new attractions while enhancing existing ones such as Chinatown, Haw Par Villa and Sentosa. We will promote conventions and exhibitions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Board (PUB) will continue to look for alternative sources of fuel like natural gas and coal to diversify energy sources. It is willing to buy natural gas on fair commercial terms, and will negotiate for a long term contract to ensure security of supply at prices competitive with fuel oil. It will spend about $3.5 billion on development projects in the next five years. It will continue to strive for greater efficiency in electricity genera!ion, treatment of water, and production of gas. As we have to import all our energy supplies and most of our water, we must relentlessly push for energy and water conservation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore imports almost all her food, raw materials and consumer products. We cannot escape inflation if prices of these imported goods increase. But we can minimize it by encouraging imports from the cheapest sources, and ensuring fair and free competition in the market place. Regulations governing trade practices will be formulated to discourage profiteering.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must preserve our excellent industrial relations climate. The Ministry will build up a team of professional labour officers to work towards this goal through the promotion of more harmonious labour-management relations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Productivity Board will promote positive work attitudes - pride in work, a sense of responsibility, self-improvement and teamwork. It will train managers in people-centred management, so that they will treat workers as their most important asset. It will emphasize training to upgrade the workers' skills and productivity.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Foreign Workers and Manpower Utilization</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will progressively reduce our dependence on foreign workers. Only those who have critical skills of economic value to Singapore will be considered for employment on a longer basis. We will encourage our workers to work beyond the present retirement age, stay healthy and be financially independent. Employers will be encouraged to employ them. We will encourage more married women to remain in the workforce.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Social Security</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides schemes to finance homeownership the Central Provident Fund Board will introduce other schemes to allow Singaporeans a wider choice to securely invest part of their CPF savings without, however, eroding the fundamental objective of providing financial security for old age.

  <i>Industrial Safety and Health</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will strive to reduce the number of accidents, especially in the construction and the shipbuilding and repairing industries. It will promote self-regulation in industries, where management and workers will draw up and observe their own safety rules and practices. It will step up education and promotion programmes to foster greater awareness of safety and health at workplaces. More workplaces where workers may be exposed to occupational health and safety

   <b>MINISTRY OF EDUCATION</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our education policy will be directed towards establishing a flexible education system which will bring out the best in every child and develop in each pupil sound moral values and a strong foundation in the basic skills necessary to earn a living in Singapore's modern economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key factor which will determine the success of our educational programmes is the quality of our principals and teachers. The Institute of Education had in 1984 started a new course, leading to a Diploma in Educational Administration, to provide training for those with the potential to become principals and vice-principals. The Ministry will help teachers to raise their professional standards through in-service training and scholarship programmes. The Ministry will also recruit more teachers into the Education Service. In particular, more qualified teachers of English Language will be recruited locally and overseas.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full cycle in our streaming system was reached when the first groups of pupils streamed to the slower courses sat for their PSLE, PSPE (Primary School Proficiency Examination for those in the monolingual course) and GCE 'N' level examination in 1984. Our five years' experience with streaming showed that the weaker pupils, especially those who otherwise would have dropped out, benefited from streaming. In 1978, the year before streaming was introduced, 20% of the Primary 1 cohort dropped out of primary school without getting any educational qualification. In 1984, the number who dropped out was reduced by half to 10%. Similarly, in 1978, 20% of a cohort dropped out of secondary school before sitting for the 'O' level examination. After the introduction of streaming, the number who dropped out with no secondary school qualification was
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> reduced fourfold to 5%. Streaming will continue to be based on the performance of pupils but the streaming procedures will be further improved to allow greater flexibility. The Ministry will also introduce better teaching methods and teaching materials. This should improve the performance of pupils in all streams.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will strive to improve the proficiency of English among pupils at all levels. This task is especially important because English will be the principal language of instruction for all pupils from 1987. Many of our pupils come from homes where English is not used. Special programmes, such as listening comprehension, a special reading programme and a supplementary phonics package are being introduced at the primary levels to improve the learning of English.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1970, less than a fifth of our young people were bilingual. Today, the majority of our young people are bilingual. As Singapore develops, it is important for us to preserve our cultural heritage and retain proficiency in our mother tongues. Therefore, our bilingual policy will remain an essential feature of our education system.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the important area of moral education, all primary schools have implemented either the "Good Citizen" programme or the "Being and Becoming" programme. Religious Knowledge subjects are taught in upper secondary levels; A lower secondary "Being and Becoming" programme has been introduced in most schools and will be implemented in all secondary schools. Extra-curricular activities can reinforce the teaching of moral education. The Ministry will continue to encourage secondary school pupils to join uniformed organizations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improving pupils' health and physical fitness will be a major concern of the Ministry. The College of Physical Education, set up in 1984, will provide properly trained teachers to teach physical education in schools and organize extra-curricular activities in sports. Other extra-curricular activities (like drama and dance) will nurture aesthetic appreciation in our children and help them develop a wide range of interests.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet the new needs of the economy, Singapore Polytechnic and Ngee Ann
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Polytechnic will introduce new subjects such as industrial automation, computer-aided design and manufacturing and industrial robotics. The Vocational and Industrial Training Board (VITB) will incorporate computer-based and high-technology skills into existing courses as well as improve opportunities for trainees and workers to progress from one skill level to the next. Both Polytechnics and the Vocational and Industrial Training Board will increase the opportunities of continuing education and training for our workers. Studies show that we will need to train more technicians to meet the needs of employers. The Ministry will look into how the Polytechnics and the VITB can be further expanded to meet this need.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of education and research at the National University of Singapore will be raised. Efforts will be focused on high-technology, including computer and software development, molecular biology and biotechnology. The University will be considering the introduction of 3-year Honours courses in the Arts &amp; Social Sciences and Science Faculties.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nanyang Technological Institute (NTI) will produce its first batch of graduates comprising 570 engineers in April 1985. This output of practice-oriented engineers will suit the requirements of our industries in their effort to take off to a new level. NTI will continue to monitor the needs of the industries, thereby fulfilling its role as the industry's university. The new NTI complex will be completed by 1986.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1988, we will be able to ride the first Mass Rapid Transit trains from Yio Chu Kang to Outram Park. Bus services will be

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will maintain our liberal policy of encouraging more airlines to fly to Singapore. We will expand and upgrade airport facilities to ensure a smooth and expeditious flow of aircraft, passengers and air cargo through Singapore. We shall build a second passenger terminal and a third cargo agents building.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will ensure a comprehensive range of efficient services to port users at competitive prices. An eighth berth at the Tanjong Pagar Container Terminal will be completed in 1985. A multi-million dollar container freight station complex will be built to meet the anticipated increase in container traffic. We will increase our productivity and improve our international competitiveness.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will upgrade our postal services through the use of more sophisticated mail processing machines. Post offices will be fitted with computerized on-line counter terminals to increase efficiency in handling transactions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to expand our telephone network. There will be a telephone for every two persons in Singapore by 1989. We shall upgrade the network to handle digital signals and optical fibre cables. This will prepare the way for introducing the sophisticated telecommunication services of the new information age into our homes and businesses. All our 25 fully automatic national telephone exchanges will be linked by optical fibre cables by 1987. We will continue to enhance our communication links with the rest of the world via satellite and submarine cable systems.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will improve the public relations work of government to keep our people well-informed and knowledgeable.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBC will strive for better quality in its radio and TV news and current affairs programmes through higher standards of reporting, editing and presentation of local, regional and international news. More specialized information of interest to the business community will be provided.

  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A review is being made of our patent and copyright laws to make them more relevant to the sophisticated and technologically advanced Singapore of the 1990's. Patent registration should be less cumbersome and expensive under the new laws which would allow patents to be registered directly in Singapore on the basis of search and examination reports from overseas patent offices. This should also encourage local Research and Development and the multi-national companies to bring new technology to Singapore. The now copyright laws should extend protection to computer software, microfilms, tapes, broadcasts and the other new forms that copyright works take. The products of such intellectual endeavour must be adequately safeguarded for creativity to blossom and flourish in our future Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is computerizing its operations for higher efficiency and productivity. A computerized land data bank is to be established. Speedier processing of land and property transactions and production, reproduction and updating of plans and maps would be the consequence, with a better service to the public. Greater automation and computerization of such public services would also enhance the development of Singapore as a centre of high technology.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet the increasingly sophisticated legal requirements of the Singapore of the future, all laws would have to be continually reviewed and revised where necessary. A new Revised Edition of the Laws of Singapore containing all unrepealed Acts enacted before 31 December 1985 will be published by the Law Revision Commission. The new edition of laws will

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry's aim is a healthy and physically fit nation. It will emphasize activities to promote health, prevent diseases and educate the public to stay healthy. The Ministry will devote greater attention to the prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of the major prevailing diseases like cancer, heart disease and strokes. It will upgrade hospital and primary health care services and provide more specialized services. Better and more sophisticated health services will inevitably increase costs. Singaporeans must be prepared to pay their fair share of the higher costs of specialized health care they seek.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preventive medicine is the most effective way of ensuring that Singaporeans remain healthy. The Ministry has extended its comprehensive immunization programme to groups which are susceptible to measles and rubella. It will introduce Hepatitis B immunization to the population in stages. We shall further develop maternal and child health services to ensure a good start for future generations. We shall sustain health screening for school children and expectant mothers and expand the school dental health services.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will continue to provide effective and easily accessible outpatient services to children, the elderly and the poor. It will improve services at the out-patient clinics. The working population will have the choice of seeking outpatient care from the public or private sector.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will promote community based health care services to serve the health care needs of an ageing population. It will transfer the care of the aged sick from costly hospitals to the home and community hospitals. The Ministry shall expand the Home Nursing Foundation's activities to cover a wider range of medi-

  <br> cal, rehabilitative and nursing services for the aged population.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will improve the quality of hospitals and their supporting facilities. The new 750-bedded hospital at Kent Ridge, when fully completed in 1986, will be a modern teaching and research hospital. The older government hospitals will be redeveloped to offer a higher standard of medical care and accommodation. The Ministry will build a modern pharmaceutical factory to meet its own and the country's needs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will restructure and modernize the administration of its hospitals to make them more efficient. A large scale computerized Hospital Information System for patient management, hospital administration and planning is currently being installed. We will train more hospital administrators overseas to strengthen hospital management and to allow government hospitals greater autonomy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry aims to develop Singapore into a regional medical centre of excellence. We shall recruit and train more medical specialists in different disciplines and supporting paramedical personnel. We shall establish new subspecialities in selected fields of medicine and surgery. We will further raise the standard of the existing specialities of Neurosurgery, Cardiothoracic Surgery, Paediatric and Plastic Surgery and Renal Medicine.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall forge closer association and exchange programmes with internationally renowned medical centres in the United States, Europe and Australia. This will enable our doctors to acquire more advanced medical skills and techniques from their foreign counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will extend the Medisave Scheme to payment of the full Class A government hospital bill. It will extend the Scheme to private hospitals at a later date. The self-employed, who constitute about 13% of the total labour force, will be brought into the Scheme. This will ensure that Singaporeans will have the means to meet the cost of hospitalization in later years when they need it most.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to maintain a high standard of public health and environmental cleanliness and protect our vital water resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Water Pollution Control</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will continue to clean up the Singapore River/Kallang Basin and water catchments. The sources of pollution include the squatter colonies, unsewered premises, street hawkers, motor repair activities and boatyards. Many of the sources of pollution in the Singapore River have been cleared and the water quality has improved significantly making the River a venue for recreational activities. The Kallang Basin also has significant potential for recreational use. However, the presence of boatyards and motor repair activities will not be compatible with this development. We will look into appropriate measures to control pollution from these sources, including their resiting, if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programme will be extended to cover all other drainage catchments, commencing with the Katong, Bedok and Siglap catchments which drain into the sea off the East Coast Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Air Pollution</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ambient air is clean and pollution levels low. The emission standards set out in the Clean Air Act will be reviewed to ensure that it continues to be effective in maintaining the quality of our ambient air.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standards foremissions from newly registered petrol-driven cars will be upgraded in 1986 and will be comparable with that of the European Economic Community (EEC). Existing motor vehicles may be subject to periodic emission tests and a test laboratory will be set up for this purpose.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lead level in petrol will be further reduced from the present 0.4 grammes per litre. We will monitor the move by the developed countries to introduce unleaded petrol to assess its consequential problems.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diesel piling hammers cause significant air and noise pollution. They may be phased out, if feasible.

  <i>Environmental Public Health</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will review the existing Code of Practice on environmental public health requirements to ensure a high standard of cleanliness and hygiene, particularly of food establishments, and to streamline procedures.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end of 1985, most of the street hawkers would be relocated into permanent centres. The Ministry will now emphasize on the management of these centres and food hygiene.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also review and rationalize the refuse collection system in housing estates to improve productivity, particularly as manpower is expected to be more difficult to recruit.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Drainage Control</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will implement flood alleviation measures to reduce localized flooding.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are studying the feasibility of alleviating flood at Bukit Timah valley by a diversion canal to Sungei Kallang with a barrage at Kallang Basin.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Dangerous Chemicals</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Control and legislation on the import, storage, transportation and disposal of dangerous chemicals will be reviewed with other Ministries to prevent major accidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Primary Production</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pig farms, which are highly pollutive, will have to phase themselves out as they find they cannot compete against imported live pigs and keep up anti-pollution standards. We will meet our pork requirements by importing live pigs and frozen pork from diverse sources to ensure a steady supply at competitive prices. These will have to meet high standards of quality and hygiene.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Available farmland will be for non-pollutive agricultural uses. We will encourage farms which are commercially viable and use the latest farming technology to produce high quality and value-added primary produce. We will continue to diversify sources and facilitate import of fresh food, including fish and vegetables.
