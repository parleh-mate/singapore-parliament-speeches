<div align="center"><b>(Registration)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lim Ching Siong</b> asked the Chief Secretary what

were  the  reasons  for  the refusal  to  register  the

Singapore Seletar Chinese Old Boys' Association.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. D. Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. D. Higham:</b> The hon. Member is misinformed. The

Registrar  of  Societies is awaiting a reply  from  the

President of the proposed Association to a letter dated

19th September.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is the Chief Secretary aware that

the  Registrar  of Societies had, in fact,  refused  to

register  this Association unless some conditions  were

accepted?



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> As far as I am aware, the Registrar has

not  refused. He has requested the President  to  amend

one of the rules of the proposed Association and he has

had no reply to his suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is the Chief Secretary aware that

the  proposed  Association has refused to  comply  with

this condition?



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> No, Sir.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE BUS WORKERS' UNION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Strike-Breaking)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b> asked the Minister for

Communications and Works what action he  has  taken  on

the  complaint  by  the Singapore  Bus  Workers'  Union

regarding  a  certain  Bus  Company  employing   excess

workers for the purpose of strike-breaking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I have informed the Singapore Bus

Workers'  Union  that bus workers are licensed  by  the

Registrar of Vehicles - a City Council employee.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> Will the Minister consider

asking  the  City Council to stop providing badges  for

the  new  recruitment  because, to  my  knowledge,  the

recruitment  of  new  hands  is  entirely  for  strike-breaking?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is entirely a new question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> May I ask a supplementary question, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Will the Minister for Transport

inform us what he considers is a just solution to  this

dispute?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> That is asking for an opinion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Has he made up his mind on what he proposes to do about this dispute?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> If the hon. leader of the People's Action

Party  cannot  inform  himself of  my  title,  he  will

continue to make mistakes as to my functions. I am  not

the  Minister for Transport. He might have learnt  that

if  he  had  studied his Estimates. If he  had  studied

anything,  he  might have learnt  that  I  am  not  the

Minister for Transport, that I have no powers  to  deal

with  transport-strikes, disputes, issue  of  licences.

They  are  all  matters  which  are  handled  by  other

authorities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT POLICY IN LABOUR NEGOTIATIONS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Lim Ching Siong</b> asked the Minister for Labour

and  Welfare  whether he will explain  what  policy  he

adopts  towards  employers  of  labour  who  refuse  to

negotiate  with Unions which represent the majority  of

their  employees and give recognition only to  a  Union

representing a minority.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> The recognition of trade unions by

employers is a matter for employers themselves. I  have

no  powers to compel an employer to negotiate with  any

union,  whether the union can substantiate a  claim  to

represent  a  majority  of employees  or  not,  to  the

exclusion  of  other  unions. It  is  a  policy  of  my

Ministry,  however, to encourage employers to negotiate

with trade unions which clearly represent effectively a

majority  of  their employees, or even clearly  defined

sections  of  their  employees. The  ultimate  decision

rests  with the employer who may be faced with all  the

damaging  results of inter-trade-union  warfare  if  he

comes  to  a wrong decision. I would mention,  for  the

information  of  this Assembly, that  the  question  of

recasting  the  law affecting industrial  relations  is

under consideration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>UNITED ENGINEERS STRIKE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Court of Inquiry)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Lim Ching Siong</b> asked the Minister for Labour

and Welfare whether he will reconsider his decision not

to appoint a Court of Inquiry to investigate the causes

of  the  dispute between the United Engineers Ltd. and

its striking employees; and whether he will order such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>



an  immediate Inquiry, and cause the  findings  of

this   Inquiry   to   be  published   for   public

information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> In order to answer this

question, Sir, I have reconsidered my decision not

to  appoint a Court of Inquiry to investigate  the

causes of the dispute between the United Engineers

Ltd. and its striking employees. I consider  that

the   facts   of   the   dispute   are   generally

sufficiently   well-known  not  to   require   the

appointment  of  a Court of Inquiry  to  establish

them.  I  also consider that the dispute does  not

involve   any   matters  of  vital   interest   to

Singapore, and that the circumstances do not merit

the setting up of a Court of Inquiry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Does the Minister for Labour

consider that a peaceful strike is a matter  which

does not affect the vital interests of Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> As I have said, Sir, the

circumstances  that led to this strike  are  well-known  to  the  public  of  Singapore,  and  those

circumstances  do not merit the setting  up  of  a

Court of Inquiry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Does the Minister for Labour

propose  to wait until there is a riot  before  he

institutes a Court of Inquiry?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, there is no existing

issue  of  a  vital  character  that  affects  the

interests of the public.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>TRADE DISPUTES ORDINANCE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Picketing)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Lim Ching Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Labour  and Welfare whether he is aware that  from

the workers' point of view the provisions relating

to picketing in the local Trade Disputes Ordinance

are  susceptible of improvement;  and  whether  he

will consider introducing legislation to bring the

provisions  of the local Trade Disputes  Ordinance

into line with the Trade Disputes Act in force  in

the United Kingdom.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> I would explain that the Trade

Disputes  Ordinance legalises  strikes  and  other

actions by trade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>



unions and striking employees which, because  they

do  damage  to  an employer's trade  or  business,

might otherwise be criminal offences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of this Ordinance is that it

codifies   the  powers  of  picketing.   In   this

connection,  I  note  that  certain  pseudo  trade

unionists  are repeatedly blaming the  Police  for

interfering   with   what   they   call   peaceful

picketing.  I should like to take this opportunity

to  stress  that  in their interpretation  of  the

Trade  Disputes  Ordinance, which is  a  perfectly

clear  law, the Police are not depriving  strikers

of  their lawful right to carry on picketing in  a

peaceful   manner,  and  that  they   are   solely

concerned  with  the enforcement  of  the  law  on

obstruction, intimidation, or behaviour calculated

to  lead  to a breach of the peace. The Government

will  carefully consider not only any constructive

suggestions for improvement of the Ordinance  from

the point of view of the workers, but will also be

obliged  to take into consideration the  views  of

employers   and  also  considerations  of   public

safety.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the second part of the question, I

can  assure  the Member for Bukit Timah  that  the

question  of amending the Trade Disputes Ordinance

has  been occupying my mind for some time.  But  I

must  say  that  I am only prepared  to  introduce

amending  legislation if I consider the  interests

of  Singapore  require it, and not merely  because

the legislation has been enacted elsewhere.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Does the Minister for Labour

realise that the legislation which is now in force

in  this  Colony was enacted here because  it  was

enacted elsewhere, copied therefrom?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, two wrongs do not make one right!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Will the Minister for Labour tell us what he meant by a pseudo trade unionist?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Please look up the dictionary!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It does not answer the question.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SECURITY OF TENURE FOR FARMERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Lim Ching Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Local  Government,  Lands and Housing  whether  he

will  consider introducing legislation  to  obtain

security  of  tenure for farmers  who  at  present

occupy   Crown  Land  under  temporary  Occupation

Licences,  in  order to put such  land  into  more

productive use.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Authority to

issue leases for Crown land exists under the Crown

Lands Ordinance and the rules made thereunder. The

Master Plan for Singapore, which will be published

on  the  3rd  of January next, will indicate  what

areas  of  the  island  are  to  be  reserved  for

agriculture,  and  it  is the  intention  to  give

security of tenure to all farmers occupying  Crown

land  in these areas by issuing to them leases  on

such  terms  relating  to development  and  proper

cultivation as may be considered necessary.

<div align="center"><b>COMMERCIAL TELEVISION IN SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Establishment)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Chief Secretary)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. D. Higham(Acting Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr J. D. Higham):</b> Copies  of

Government's   invitation  to   tender   for   the

provision  of  a  television service  and  tenders

received in response to this have been laid before

the  Assembly  for the information of  Members  as

Sessional  Paper Cmd. 32 of 1955.  The  Government

will  provide an opportunity for a debate  on  the

question   of  the  establishment  of   commercial

television  in Singapore on the 8th  of  February, 1956.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>ADJOURNMENT TO A LATER DAY MOTION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  would like  to  move  that  the

Assembly, at its rising today, do adjourn, if  the

business is uncompleted, to tomorrow, the 25th  of

November,  and,  if  completed,  to  the  8th   of

February, 1956.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Sir, I second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  may I move that that motion be taken in  two

parts? The Chief Minister is suggesting that we

give  a vote on the wishes of the Government that,

if  the business is not completed, we will  go  on

tomorrow,  but  that  if it  is,  then  the  Chief

Minister would not like to proceed to business, of

which notice has already been given, for tomorrow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask that the motion by the Chief

Minister be put in two parts so that those Members

of  this  House,  who feel that in  any  case  the

Assembly should go on till tomorrow, could vote on

that motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, may I speak on that?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, certainly.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It is not the intention on

the  part  of the Government to try to  avoid  any

business that was laid down. The business for this

sitting, Sir, has been adumbrated a long time ago.

Hon.  Members have had opportunities to place such

motions  and questions as they wished for  Monday,

Tuesday,  Wednesday and Thursday. They  wished  to

place  it for Friday and took the risk that  there

is no business on Thursday. Surely they take their

own risk, but I would like to add this: that  if  the  leaders  of  the  Parties  on   the

Opposition Benches feel generally that they would,

in spite of the fact that there is little business

to  be  done  tomorrow, nevertheless like  to  sit

tomorrow to consider the little business  that  is

set  down for tomorrow, Government wishes to  take

no  exception  to that procedure. I  would  rather

that  there should be agreement on this than  that

we  should  take  a vote on the  subject.  If  the

leaders  of the Opposition Parties would  indicate

their wishes, I am quite prepared to fall in  with

them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I can speak on behalf of

the  Opposition Members on this side of the  House

that  they are of the opinion that, in any  event,

the business which is down for tomorrow should  be

proceeded with.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> In that case, Sir, may I

then withdraw my original motion which should now stand,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That at its rising today the Assembly do stand

adjourned till Friday, 25th November, 1955.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Have I the assent of the Assembly

that the original motion be withdrawn?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original motion, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I have a seconder to the

substituted motion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> I second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That at its rising today the Assembly do stand

adjourned till Friday, 25th November, 1955.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We were on Head 46 when the moment

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $1,046,870 for Head 46 stand

part of the Schedule."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,046,870 for Head 46 ordered to

stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 47 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood in the name of Mr Lim Koon Teck -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $3,600 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 2 (4), Transport and

Travelling, on page 163 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $2,000 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 3, Entertainment Expenses, on

page 163 of the Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir, I withdraw the two amendments standing in my

name under this head.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member is not proposing

the amendments?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $104,950 for Head 47 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 48 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Lee Kuan Yew -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $600 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 1 (3), Chief Inspector of Schools, Grade E, on page 164 of the Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, Standing

Orders stand in the way of my amendment being

proceeded with, and I do not propose to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is this the one affected by

Standing Order 31 (3) ?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> On a point of order, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Mr Chief Secretary?



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> I think there may have been some

misapprehension yesterday as to under which of the

Standing Orders your ruling in respect of some  of

these  motions that were mentioned en-bloc  by  my

hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General (Mr

Butterfield) is being taken. I think there was, in

fact,  only  one motion mentioned yesterday  taken

under  Standing Order 33 (1) (b) and one under  33

(1)  (c),  on the grounds that His Excellency  the

Governor's consent had not been obtained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other motion under Head 32, which was to

reduce  by $600 the sum to be allotted in  respect

of  Deputy  Secretary to the Ministry of  Commerce

and Industry was under Standing Order 31 (3), as in

the  case  of  the motion under Head 48.  Standing

Order  31  (3)  does, of course, bar the  Assembly

from  reconsidering  any  specific  question  upon

which the Assembly has come to a conclusion during

a  current session except on a substantive  motion

for  rescission; whereas Standing Order 33 (1) (b)

is  designed  for  the protection  of  the  public

service, not, I would emphasise, of the expatriate

service,  but  of  the  public  service  from  the

humblest peon to the highest officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $46,676,910 for Head 48 stand

part of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, when

speaking  in this House on the Second  Reading,  I

made   three   main  points  when   referring   to

education.  Firstly,  that the  Government  should

find  ways  and  means  of reducing  the  cost  of

primary   school  buildings  so  that  the   money

available   can   be  made  to  stretch   further.

Secondly,  that the absence of any  new  provision

for  the  building  of  secondary  schools  was  a

glaring omission; and thirdly, that there  was  no

indication  in  the  Government's  programme  that

there  was  to  be  any  early  reorientation   in

educational policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the first point, I do not think that

there  is  any need to repeat myself or elaborate,

except to make quite clear that we are against the

cutting   down  of  the  primary  school  building

programme  as  far  as the number  of  schools  is

concerned.  What we feel convinced about  is  that

there  can be a considerable reduction in building

costs, but I cannot believe that plans are too far

ahead,  as far as the 1956 programme is concerned,

to  prevent the necessary action being taken.  Let

me  repeat once more, that this problem should  be

the  special concern of an Estimates Committee  of

this  House, and for some reason or another, which

needs  explaining, the Government appears to  have

been extremely reluctant to set up this Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> That is not true.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> As far as secondary education is

concerned, Sir, I am still not convinced that  all

is  well.  A  fortnight ago  the  Minister  stated

categorically that six schools would be  completed

in  1956.  On Monday last he was candid enough  to

say  that  only  two  would  be  completed,  if  I

understood him, and later the Financial  Secretary

corrected  him  and  made it  four.  Whatever  the

meaning of these apparent contradictions,  we  are

faced  already this year with about 2,000 students

having to be failed in an examination for entry to

secondary  schools, not because of lack of  skill,

but because there is no accommodation for them. It

is true, of course,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>



that  some  of these rejected students  will  find

their  way  into  the new technical  schools,  the

junior  technical school, into aided  schools,  or

Chinese  schools. Some, of course, are  not  of  a

high  enough intellectual standard to benefit from

secondary education and will leave school to  join

family  businesses and so on. But the  balance  of

students  remaining  who need secondary  education

from   January  and  will  not  get  it  is  still

formidable.  I do not think that the Minister  for

Education will accuse me of exaggerating if I  say

that  this balance would be enough to fill another

two   secondary  schools,  possibly   three,   but

certainly  not  less than two.  If  the  secondary

school programme for 1955 had been completed, this

shortage would not have arisen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worse still, the shortage will increase next

year   with   increasing   numbers   of   students

completing the primary stage, and once  you  start

cutting  down  on the policy of one new  secondary

school  for every four primary schools built,  you

are,  in fact, following a policy of putting young

students  of  14  and 15 on to the streets.  Quite

apart from the dangers of this course, we are at a

loss  to understand the Government policy. A  lack

of  secondary  schools means a  reduction  in  the

number  of students who can be trained as teachers

to  man more schools in the future; a reduction in

those  being  sent  for higher  education  in  the

University  of  Malaya and  abroad,  and  hence  a

reduction of highly qualified local men  to  enter

the   civil  service  or  commerce  and  industry.

Malayanisation has no meaning as a policy if it is

to  be  stifled at the outset by lack of  adequate

higher   education  facilities  for  the   younger

generation. In our view, therefore, the Minister's

educational policy is not in the best interests of

the  country  and  needs radical  changes.  It  is

indeed  a  retrograde policy which could bring  us

into  serious trouble in a few years, and a direct

reversal of Progressive Party policy which  fought

for years with the previous official Government to

get secondary education given its proper place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I leave secondary education, Sir, I would

suggest  to  the  Minister that he considers  more

seriously what he can do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>

for  the 2,000 students who will fail to get entry

to secondary schools next year. He has stated that

bright  over-aged students will be given a  chance

to  skip a year of secondary education and qualify

for Std. VII, but he has given no solution for the

average-aged  students  who  are  still  virtually

unemployable  at  the completion  of  the  primary

education stage, partly because of age and  partly

because  of  an  insufficiently  high  educational

attainment. Something must be done to  make  these

young  people  employable, so that they  can  make

their  own way in life. They must not be  left  to

drift  into undesirable company and become loafers

or  worse. It has been suggested that just as  the

intake  of  primary schools has  been  doubled  by

having  morning  and afternoon schools,  the  same

should  be  done in respect of secondary  schools,

but I believe there are practical difficulties  in

the   way  of  this  apparently  simple  solution,

because  secondary  schools spill  over  into  the

afternoons, particularly science periods; in other

words, there is no clear cessation of work at  one

p.m.  But  not  all class-rooms are  full  in  the

afternoons, and therefore I hand the Minister this

suggestion.  Start a two- or three-year  intensive

course  in a limited number of subjects  and  make

them   available   to  these  otherwise   unwanted

students;  in other words, bridge the gap  between

unemployability and employability and give them  a

chance  in  life,  even if it is  only  in  junior

posts,  but  do  not abandon them.  Parents  would

rather  have their children busy with this limited

type  of  training than running wild. I hope  that

earnest  consideration be given to  setting  up  a

scheme  of  this kind in motion early in  the  new

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third charge against the Government was that

no consideration had been given to a reorientation

of  the  educational policy of  this  country.  No

doubt,  my hon. Friend will say that he is waiting

for  the completion of the now long overdue Report

of  the All-Party Education Committee, but I would

remind  him  that  the terms of reference  limited

that Committee to consideration of the problems of

Chinese  education  and Chinese schools.  Although

the suggestion has been made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>



that   the  Government  should  build  a   Chinese

secondary school, a Malay secondary school,  or  a

Tamil  secondary school on the basis of its policy

of  equal  treatment  in education  for  all,  and

although the Minister has indicated that a Chinese

secondary school, I think it was, is to  be  built

next year, it is by no means clear to me that  the

sum  required has been budgeted for unless  it  is

one of the two which he now says will be completed

in 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet it is quite clear that speed in this matter

is  essential, and Government should have hastened

the completion of the All-Party Committee's Report

so  that it could have been debated in this  House

this  year  instead of in February next  year,  or

even  later, or make a start with its policy where

it  cannot  conflict with anything the Report  may

reveal. Just to set aside $20 millions for grants-in-aid to vernacular schools is not a policy,  and

we  on  this  side of the House are not  happy  in

approving a lump sum amounting to ten per cent  of

the country's revenue without Government coming to

us  for  sanction as to how this amount should  be

spent.  I  am  not  against  it  being  spent   on

education, or wholly on vernacular education. That

is understood and agreed. But we may find that the

whole  of  the money should not be spent  on  full

grants-in-aid to individual schools, but that  the

promotion of sound vernacular education  can  best

be  promoted if part of it is spent in other ways.

It  may be best, for example, to allocate some  of

it  to  a  special branch of the Teachers Training

College  for the training of teachers for Chinese,

Malay  and  Indian  schools. Some  of  it  may  be

required for more suitable textbooks and so on.  I

hope that the Minister will give an assurance that

this  huge grant will be put to the best  possible

use  for  what I have called the reorientation  of

our educational policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking broadly, and more broadly than the All-Party Committee is empowered by its terms of

reference to speak, I would suggest that education

has three main purposes: firstly, to equip boys or

girls  to  earn their living; secondly,  to  equip

them to play their part as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>



citizens  of a democracy; and thirdly,  to  enable

them  to  develop  all  the powers  and  faculties

latent in their nature so as to enjoy life in  all

its fullness. These purposes are complementary  to

each  other  and a proper education will  seek  to

secure  all  three,  and all of  them  within  the

framework  of a Malayan nationalism.  It  follows,

therefore,   that  all  the  main  languages   and

cultures which should make up that composite thing

which  can be called Malayan nationalism  must  be

regarded as complementary to each other and not as

existing separately in water-tight compartments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that a way will have to be found, and

found  at  once,  to achieve the  following  three

objectives. Firstly, the total eradication of  the

charge, erroneous but real, that there is  a  plot

to  exterminate the Malay and Chinese  and  Indian

cultures. Secondly, the total eradication  of  the

charge,  for  which there is some substance,  that

our  young  people  in English schools  are  being

brought  up as imitation Westerners with  no  real

cultural  roots  of their own. And,  thirdly,  the

free and equal choice of parents to decide whether

their   children  are  to  have  a   predominantly

Chinese,   or   Malay,  or  Indian,   or   English

education,  and  yet  always  within   a   Malayan

framework. I was a teacher of English in an Indian

college  founded on English models  for  over  ten

years and perhaps I can claim to know something of

the problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to live together in this small country

in  peace and goodwill, we have to found a Malayan

nationalism     which    transcends     individual

nationalism.  The more we understand each  other's

languages,  the  more  we  shall  understand  each

other's minds and the less shall we be set  within

the   rigid   confines  of  our   own   particular

community.  While  it is true  that  we  see  best

through the eyes of our own community, or race, or

nationalism,  it  is also true that  we  only  see

imperfectly.  By  learning each other's  languages

and  about each other's cultures, we find that  we

can see more than we could before, because we see,

to some extent, through each other's eyes also. In

this  way  we  can rise to the idea  of  a  common

synthesis, something which we can all see



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>



through learning many-sidedness; and we shall then

see  that  a  Malayan culture  can  transcend  the

Chinese, or Malay, or Indian, or European cultures

without destroying or belittling any of them;  and

we  shall then know that it is not merely possible

but  indeed  the  duty to begin by  being  a  good

Malay,  or a good Chinese, or a good Indian  or  a

good  European, and then to make one further  step

without  losing  that quality - and  become  a  good

Malayan. I do not believe that you can talk  about

an  educational policy in any other way. I do  not

believe  that you can gain a happy and  prosperous

future for Singapore and Malaya in any other  way,

and  it is our hope that the Government will  take

an  early step forward in the promulgation of such

a policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, may I

congratulate   the  substantive  leader   of   the

Progressive Party for putting forward a  point  of

view  which we, on this side of this side  of  the

House, have been advocating for so long? It  is  a

decided  step  forward  when  a  right-wing  Party

understands  that militant agitation for  equality

of   treatment  in  education  is  not   Communist

propaganda.  We fully endorse what has  been  said

about  the  necessity of harmonising  the  various

cultural and linguistic groups in the country.  We

endorse the hope that the Government will find  it

possible  in  the very near future to formulate  a

definite policy within either their four-year term

of  office,  or their two-year term of office,  to

give  a  beginning to this re-orientated education

policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, I wish to add to what the

Member  for  Tanglin  has  said  on  primary   and

secondary  education by commenting  on  University

education.  There is a vote, out of  this  46  odd

million  dollars, of $2.38 millions,  contribution

to  the  University of Malaya. It is  our  earnest

hope  that  the  University of  Malaya  would  not

continue  in its role of being an institution  for

purely English higher education. Either that  role

must  be changed, or, in pursuance of this  policy

of equality of treatment for all languages and all

cultural  groups,  other  universities   must   be

founded to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>



meet  the  demands  of  the other  linguistic  and

cultural groups. So far, the University of  Malaya

has  not  captured the imagination of the Chinese-speaking,   Indian-speaking,   or   Malay-speaking

groups.  Indeed, even amongst the English-speaking

group  it  has not succeeded in bringing home  the

fact  that  here  is an institution  which,  if  a

Malayan  civilisation is to  flourish  in  Malaya,

must  foster  the  leaders,  not  necessarily  the

economic    leaders,   but   the   cultural    and

intellectual leaders of the Malaya of tomorrow. It

is  important  that in this seat of  learning  the

highest  traditions of academic freedom should  be

observed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, we all know that sometime

last  year  an  unfortunate blunder  was  made  on

somebody's part when academic freedom amongst  the

students  was  attacked, when  a  prosecution  for

sedition  in a University publication was  brought

against  the editorial board of a certain  student

magazine. I find it difficult to assess  even  now

the  damage that the prosecution has done. It  was

fortunate  indeed that a district judge - and  I  am

proud to say that it was an Asian (he was born and

bred   in  this  country) - decided  to  throw   the

prosecution out of hand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr C. H. Butterfield)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> Point of order, Sir. My point

of  order relates to Standing Order 15 (1) (g). It

seems  to  me,  Sir,  that the speaker  was  going

rather  close in what he said to reflecting  on  a

decision of a court of law.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Standing Order in question reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every question shall conform to the following rules: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question shall not reflect on the decision of a court of law .."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question of this nature before the

House  at  all.  The  word  "question"  refers  to

questions  to Ministers. Can you enlarge  on  your

point of order, Mr Attorney-General?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> The question is not whether I

wish  to  or  not, but I think I should,  Sir.  My

recollection  of  the Standing Order  was  not  as

clear  as  it might have been, and it is clear  as

you have already ruled, Sir, that my point was not

well taken.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, that was

perhaps what might have happened when the decision

to prosecute the students was made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is essential for an institution for higher

learning  that  there should be absolute  academic

freedom. This includes the freedom to discuss  any

political  subject  and  to  adopt  any  political

attitude,  within  the confines of  that  academic

institution.  Since  the salutary  effect  of  the

dismissal  of  that prosecution,  the  authorities

have  been more tolerant and more liberal in their

attitude  to  the students' political  activities.

But  I  wish today to bring to the notice of  this

House the fact that the authorities have not shown

that  same  academic  tolerance  to  its  teaching

staff.  The  Hon. the Chief Minister,  Sir,  knows

personally  of  the case where a  teacher  in  the

University  was about to be dismissed  because  he

held  views  which  were  not  palatable  or   not

acceptable  to his head of department and  to  the

University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Will the hon. Member permit

a  point  of explanation? In fairness  to  him,  I

should  say that I am conscious of the  person  to

whom  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar has  referred,

and in fairness to the University authorities with

whom  I  have discussed the matter, there  was  no

question  of his political views being taken  into

consideration but only the question of his  health

and  his standard of work, and that ultimately  he

was, in fact, engaged.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am much obliged to the Chief

Minister  for  his elaboration. Ultimately,  after

the  personal  intervention of the Chief  Minister

who  knew the facts of the case, particularly from

the  point  of view of the person who  was  to  be

victimised, he was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>



re-engaged. Mr Chairman, Sir, we are only able to

draw  inferences from facts. We do  not  know  the

reasons  behind the facts. We know that a  certain

state of facts exist and from those facts, certain

inferences  must inevitably be drawn.  Since  that

intervention of the Chief Minister, a more healthy

atmosphere  has prevailed in the University.  This

has  been apparent to a certain number of teachers

in  that institution who felt the oppression  that

had  previously existed when one after another  of

their number, who had chosen not to conform,  were

either asked to resign or were made to resign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, and this is a case which has not as yet

reached  the  attention  of  the  Chief  Minister,

attempts  are  still  being  made  to  penalise  a

teacher  in  the University because his  political

views  do not coincide with those of the  head  of

his department or those in charge of policy in the

University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November 9th this year, a certain appointment

was  made  in which a local man, who had  received

the  highest  of recommendations from  his  fellow

research  workers with whom he had  done  research

work  in  Britain, was appointed to  a  particular

Readership.  He was the man most eminently  suited

for  that job and was so recommended by the Inter-University Council. The appointment was made.  But

on  the following day objection was taken to it by

the  head  of that department who had  refused  to

recommend this particular individual. He  had,  in

fact, the impudence to suggest that this man, born

and   bred  in  this  country,  should  apply  for

promotion to a university outside Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot but share the anger with which

this  piece of unsavoury wire-pulling was received

by  those who are connected with this institution.

I  have been to that institution, Sir. I know  the

bitterness,  the  frustration, and  the  hostility

with  which  the  local man views any  attempt  to

frustrate his legitimate political rights. Here is

a  case - and I hope to bring it to the attention of

the  Chief  Minister  in the near  future - where  a

local  man has proved that he is the best  man  in

the field. The Inter-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>



University Council has said that he is the man who

should be appointed. Indeed, he was appointed. Yet

attempts  have  been made, first,  by  clandestine

methods,  to  get the University  to  reverse  the

appointment  and  substitute somebody  else,  thus

avoiding the risk of having the whole thing  being

exposed. Then, when that failed, an attempt is now

being  made to send the matter back to the  Inter-University Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Point of order, Sir. It

seems to me unfortunate, Sir, that charges of this

nature  irrelevant to the discussion - and  that  is

the  point of order - should be made without  giving

an opportunity, by way of notice, to the officials

to  answer. This is a public charge, Sir. I do not

quite  know the case in question, but  I  have  no

doubt that he could pin-point it. But the point of

order is merely this, that it is irrelevant to the

motion before the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The impression I have gained is

that  the  hon.  Member is probably  advocating  a

policy  of complete freedom of speech and  thought

for education.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am much obliged to you, Mr

Chairman,  Sir. The Hon. the Chief Minister  quite

naturally  would not like to have a discussion  on

which  he has had no previous knowledge or  notice

of the facts. But I am citing this example to show

that,   in  spite  of  his  intervention  in   one

instance, and in spite of the fact that  a  better

atmosphere  has prevailed after his  intervention,

there  are  people in that institution  of  higher

learning who persist in political persecution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, I propose at a later date, if

no  satisfaction is obtained by friendly  methods,

to  table this whole question of academic freedom,

particularly political freedom, in the  University

for  a  fullscale  debate. It  is  of  the  utmost

importance, if we want this country to survive  as

a   democracy,  that  this  particular  group   of

people - the English



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>



educated,  and, the "elite" in the  University  of

Malaya - should  not  be antagonised  to  the  point

where  they say, "You are against me? I am against

you! You fight me? I fight you! If you attempt  to

crush  me,  I  will  fight you  with  all  allies,

whoever  they are, and wherever they are, so  long

as I will defeat you and break you!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, Mr Chairman, Sir, is what has been

happening  for  the  last  eight  years   of   the

Emergency. That is a fact which I think the  Chief

Minister now realises. That is the basic cause why

today we have, to our regret and to the regret  of

every  Party  here, an Assembly  which  represents

weak  and effete political Parties. All the fierce

men, all the men who are prepared to die for their

political beliefs, have gone over to join  fiercer

men. I hold very strong -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> All?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I do not

know how fierce the Hon. the Chief Minister is



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Or yourself?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am not quite such a fierce

man, Mr Chairman, Sir!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I am glad to know it!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> There are moments, Sir, when I

feel  that  perhaps years of indulgent living  and

contact  with  British civilisation have  somewhat

worn  down the ruggedness of the Asian in me,  but

that  is  beside the point. What is  important  is

that  if  we  lose the battle for the  hearts  and

minds  of  men  in  this  institution  for  higher

learning,  then  we can never  hope  to  build  an

independent,  democratic,  non-Communist   Malaya.

There  is your intellectual corps. There  is  your

final battle, not for mass support. Masses can  be

swayed  by  emotions. But there is your  group  of

workers, of brains, of intellect, of men who  will

do  things out of conviction. If you convince them

that  the only way to fight the system is to fight

it  outright  and break it, then I  say  you  will

create  a  situation in which they  will  have  no

alternative but to destroy the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>



whole  system.  I  hope I have  been  sufficiently

careful to be fair to the people concerned, not to

criticise  them  by name in this Assembly.  But  I

sincerely  hope  that  they  will  hear  of   this

debate - to  bring home to them the solemn  reminder

that  if  the faults of the past eight  years  are

repeated, then the consequences will be bitter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am grateful to the Member for

Tanglin  for several of the points that he  raised

in his speech. I will take his points one by one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About a reduction in the cost of school

buildings,  I  can  assure  this  House  that  the

Ministry  of  Education, in conjunction  with  the

Ministry of Communications and Works, have set  up

a  Committee to study this question,  and  we  are

continuously carrying out investigations  to  find

out  ways  and  means  of  reducing  the  cost  of

building  schools, but it must be  borne  in  mind

that a stage will soon be reached when economy  on

capital   expenditure  is  more  than  offset   by

increase   in  maintenance  costs.  It   must   be

remembered  that  a very large number  of  schools

will  be  built in this Colony during the  present

decade,  and we do not want them to be so inferior

in  quality that they will be a permanent reproach

to  the  legislators  of this  generation.  I  can

assure  the  hon.  Member in particular,  and  the

House  in general, that this question of reduction

in  the  cost  of  building will  be  carried  out

effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point raised by the hon. Member

that   there  is  an  absence  of  provision   for

secondary schools, I think I have already  replied

to  that - I think it was on Monday last.  I  said

that it would be unrealistic for me to put in  any

provision for secondary schools when the provision

for  seven secondary schools carried forward  from

previous  years has not been completely  utilised.

It would, in effect, -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $18,240 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 1 (2), Deputy Secretary

(Administration), Grade G, on page 179 of the Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There being no response, the Chairman proceeded

to the next amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Chairman, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $2,400 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 2 (2), Transport, on page 179

of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, we have no explanation of why

this item of transport is included. I believe  the

salaries  the  employees  get  include  their  own

transport, and if there is anything else, I  would

like to know what it is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> The

item  "Transport" under Head 51, sub-head 2,  item

(2),   Sir,  includes  $1,800  for  the  transport

allowance of the Minister. The remaining provision

is required for meeting the travelling expenses of

officers who are required to proceed in future out

of   Singapore,  visiting  various  hospitals  and

institutions  in  the area. It also  includes  the

transport expenses of the Minister to Kuala Lumpur

or  Penang, where he is required to go  to  attend

conferences   or  have  consultations   with   his

colleague in the Federation.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, we have been receiving

$500  as  an  allowance as Legislative Councillors

since  1948,  and this has been continued  in  the

present Government. Now this $500 - and I think I am

correct  in  saying  this - includes  transport  and

incidental  expenses. The Ministers  get  salaries

which should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>



include their own transport. If this $1,800  is  a

loan  to the Minister, what about the other things

like  household servants, kebuns, and  possibly  a

food  allowance? I do not know where it will  end.

This is public money. The Ministers' salaries have

been fixed and these are quite adequate to include

their  own  transport. I would say that it  should

not be allowed.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> May I remind the hon.

Member,  who  was  a  Member  of  the  Legislative

Council,   I   believe,  that  he  also   received

remuneration for being a Member of the Legislative

Council? I would also remind him that a travelling

allowance  for attending meetings of the Executive

Council for one day a week was paid at the rate of

$90  a  month  to those who had the  privilege  of

being Members of the Executive Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this instance, Sir, since there was no

question  of  the Ministers receiving  cars  which

were  intended, or any other perquisites,  it  was

decided   to  fix  the  travelling  allowance   of

Ministers, who have to give their entire time  to

their duties as Ministers, at $150 a month.  As  I

have  already said, this was, to my  mind  at  the

time, an extremely low figure.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, apart from being a

Legislative  Councillor in previous years,  I  was

also  on  the Executive Council. There are Members

here who were also on the Executive Council on the

official  side.  Let me inform the Chief  Minister

that  they never received $90 a month as transport

allowance at all. I did not receive it myself.  It

was  all  included  in the $500  that  we  got  as

Legislative Councillors. Our work on the Executive

Council was honorary, nothing more than that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I was a Member of the Executive

Council,  Sir,  and I did, in  fact,  draw  $90  a

month. I can only assume that the Member for Telok

Ayer  (Mr R. Jumabhoy), being a man of substance,

decided -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Public spirited!



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> - to forego his allowance!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> It seems to me that, without my

knowledge,  the  officials had  been  receiving  a

transport  allowance.  I do not  think  unofficial

Members  of  the  Executive Council  received  any

transport allowance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chairman:</b> Yes, Mr Lee Kuan Yew?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, on page 179

Deputy Secretary (Administration) -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have passed that, Mr Lee Kuan

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member is too late for

his amendment. He was first on the list.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> As you will, Mr Chairman, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $2,000 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 4, Entertainment Expenses,  on

page 179 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I proceed with the subject, I would like

to  know what the entertainment expenses are  for,

and  whom  the Ministers (especially the  Minister

for  Health) entertain. As far as I am  concerned,

and  there  are many on my side of the  House  who

feel  the  same  as I do, we have seen  plenty  of

entertainment  going on since the Government  came

into  power.  I  was  in the old  Legislative  and

Executive  Councils and they never spent  so  much

money  at all. Why is it that so much public money

should  be  wasted on entertainment now?  I  would

like to have an explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I think I have dealt in detail with

the   reasons  for  the  entertainment  allowances

generally, Sir. In connection with the Ministry of

Health,   it  does  fall  upon  the  Minister   to

entertain  eminent people who visit  Singapore  in

connection  with  medical  matters.  For  example,

quite  recently we had a conference of  the  World

Health  Organisation  here. We  have  had  eminent

physicians visiting the country under the  Colombo

Plan, and there is, I think I am safe in saying, a

considerable  come  and go of medical  authorities

through Singapore. In these circumstances,  it  is

only right and proper that the Minister for Health

should entertain them when they arrive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum of $84,340 for Head 51 stand part of

the Schedule.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, since you

have  ruled that I have lost my right to move  the

amendment  under Head 51, will you  permit  me  to

make some remarks in general about the Ministry of

Health?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, this is the only one of the

new   Ministries  in  which  there  is  a   Deputy

Secretary  (Administration).  There  is   on   the

professional  side, on page 180 of the  Estimates,

Head 52, sub-head 1 (4), an Administrative Officer

to look after co-ordination and administration. It

is  interesting to note that there  is  no  Deputy

Secretary  (Administration)  in  the  Ministry  of

Communications  and Works, in spite  of  the  fact

that  the  Minister (Mr Thomas) runs a number  of

subsidiary  departments. Mr Thomas'  Ministry  is

set  out  at  page  231. It shows  a  Minister,  a

Permanent Secretary, an Assistant Secretary. Under

this   Ministry  are  the  Departments  of   Civil

Aviation,   Meteorology,   Postal,   P.W.D. and

Telecommunications - five large departments. It  has

about   the  thickest  number  of  pages  in   the

Estimates for any one Ministry. It is difficult to

understand  how,  in spite of this  oft-proclaimed

desire   to   economise   in   respect   of    new

appointments, it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>



has  been  found necessary to have this  redundant

officer  for  administration  on  the  Ministerial

side.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Point of order, Mr Chairman.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Chairman, you have already ruled

out  the motion standing in the name of the Member

for  Tanjong Pagar, stating that he was too  late,

so I do not think we can dwell upon that now.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have ruled out the amendment as

such,  but  I  understand the hon.  Member  to  be

commenting on the Establishment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Policy. [Interruption.] I am

constantly being astonished at the -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> One cannot help but be

astonished at the constant desire of Ministers  on

the  other  side of the House wishing to  avoid  a

debate.  I  should  have thought  that  the  whole

purpose of this -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order. I think the

statement is not quite fair, because any  Minister

or any Member can always rise on a point of order.

Opinions  always differ. My opinion may be  wrong,

but my opinion prevails in this Assembly. That  is

the difference.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I would

hesitate  to say that your opinion is wrong  while

in  this  Assembly. I would suggest that the  fact

that  the  Minister  for Health  put  forward  his

objection in such a contentious manner showed that

the  intention was not to take a point  of  order,

but to exclude discussion on the amendment which I

am not proposing to proceed with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the point which I hope to get a reply from

him   is:   why  is  it  necessary  to   have   an

Administrative Officer on the Ministerial side  on

a  superscale salary when in no other Ministry has

that been found necessary?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Timescale.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Timescale? Deputy Secretary,

Grade   G,  is  superscale.  We  are  also   being

astonished, as we go along in this debate, and not

without  reason, that Ministers, in fact,  do  not

know  what is in the Budget. That is why it is  so

important  to have this matter given  the  fullest

ventilation.  The  Minister for  Health  sometimes

does  a  world of good in the P.W.D. He cleans  up

all  the  grease and all the dirt! But we want  an

explanation on this. The only inference  that  one

can  draw, unless one is given more facts, is that

the  Ministry is damnably inefficient,  either  on

the Ministerial side -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member cannot use

words like "damnably" in this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I withdraw it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> It is natural with the P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Either it is inefficient in

the extreme on the Ministerial side, or it must be

inefficient  in  the extreme on  the  professional

side.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> The Member for Tanjong Pagar is very

fond  of  using these expressions of  speech,  but

there was no question of trying to deprive him  of

a  debate  on  any  subject at  all.  I  am  quite

prepared  to  meet  him on any  question  that  he

wishes me to meet, but I was only trying to uphold

the  Standing Orders which you, Mr Chairman,  had

brought up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the Member has confined himself solely to

the  motion  standing in his name which  you,  Mr

Chairman,  has  ruled  out of  time,  I  am  quite

prepared  to  answer it. First, he  is  not  quite

correct   in   saying  that  that  is   the   only

Administrative Officer for whom provision has been

made,  because  if  you  refer  to  the  Education

Ministry  under  Head  48,  at  page  164  of  the

Estimates, sub-head 1 (4), you will find there the

same type of officer - "Deputy Secretary (Staff  and

Administration)". Now in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>



the   Ministry  of  Health,  the   head   of   the

department,  who  is  the  Director   of   Medical

Services, is also the Permanent Secretary, and the

Deputy  Director of the department is  the  Deputy

Permanent Secretary. This means that with the  new

constitution  and  with  the  formation   of   the

Ministry,  the  headquarters office receives  only

one   extra  officer,  namely,  an  Administrative

Assistant - an    executive    rather    than     an

administrative   post.   Prior    to    the    new

constitution,  the  Director of  Medical  Services

approached   the  Government  and  the  Government

approached   the  Director  of  Medical   Services

through   the   Secretariat.  All   memoranda   to

Government  and  all  external  correspondence  in

legislation,   etc.,   are   prepared    in    the

Secretariat.   Now  all  this  work,   which   was

previously  done  by the Secretariat,  has  to  be

covered in the Ministry. Circumstances are proving

that  the  senior Administrative Officers  of  the

Ministry   cannot   cover  the  responsible   work

involved in their dual role of senior departmental

officers  and Ministerial officers. The efficiency

of the work is suffering.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Administrative Assistant post provided in

1955  is  not  a  post for one  who  has  to  take

responsibility  for supplying  the  Minister  with

information  and  for  carrying  out  the   policy

directed by the Minister. It is essential  that  a

senior  and  experienced officer be provided,  one

who   is   able   to   take  full   administrative

responsibility. A comparable Ministry that I  have

just  pointed  out  is that  of  the  Ministry  of

Education.  The  fact  is  that  with  the   ever-increasing  size  of  the  medical  services,  the

Permanent   Secretary  and  the  Deputy  Permanent

Secretary cannot physically cover Ministry  duties

as well as departmental duties -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Do not read!



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> The additional Ministerial work -

[Interruption.] May I ask you, Mr Chairman -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please. Carry on, Mr

Braga.  There have been interjections.  There  are

interjections, but carry on, please.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> The additional Ministerial work need

not   be  done  by  a  professional  officer,  and

therefore  a  post  for  a  senior  administrative

officer  has been asked for. It should be stressed

that whatever happened under the old constitution,

it  is no longer true that policy is framed in the

Secretariat.  After Government  has  sanctioned  a

policy, that policy is implemented in the Ministry

and  by  the  Ministry, and I repeat, not  by  the

Secretariat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, it is a

most  wordy  explanation which does  not  give  an

explanation! We have been referred to the Ministry

of  Education on page 164 and it has been  brought

to  our attention that there is a Deputy Secretary

(Staff and Administration), Grade F. Mr Chairman,

Sir,  that is exactly my point. In no Ministry  is

there on the Ministerial side (in the case of  the

Ministry  of Education, turn over to page  163)  a

Deputy   Secretary   (Administration).   In    his

Ministry,  Medical  and  Health,  he  has  on  the

professional  side an Administrative  Officer,  as

there  is  in the Education Ministry. He  has  not

explained why it has been found necessary  in  his

case,  and it is certainly not the largest of  the

six Ministries which have been created. That he or

his  Permanent  Secretary  should  have  found  it

necessary to have an extra Administrative  Officer

on  the Ministerial side on a superscale salary is

just waste.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order. The time has

elapsed. The sum of $84,340 for Head 51 ordered to

stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 52 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $18,240 the sum to be allotted in

respect  of  sub-head 37 (4), Medical  Officer-in-

charge,   Maternity  and  Child  Welfare   Services

(Rural), Grade G, on page 190 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fairly complicated Establishment

matter and I hope the House will forgive me  if  I

take my points a little slowly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At page 190 of the Estimates, you will find at

the  top of the Ministry (Health Branch), sub-head

37 (1), "Chief Health Officer, Grade E". Then you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>



have  following  it "Senior Port  Health  Officer,

Grade  G"; then "Health Officer-in-charge Schools,

Grade  G";  then at sub-head 37 (4) you will  find

"Medical  Officer-in-charge,  Maternity  and  Child

Welfare Services (Rural), Grade G". In the Remarks

column against this item, you will find this: "New

appointment".  Now  if you  look  at  the  Remarks

column   against  item  (2)  "Senior  Port  Health

Officer,  Grade  G", you will find "Title  changed

from Deputy Chief Health Officer. (687/55)".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first point is that the post of Senior Port

Health Officer is not a change just of title  from

Deputy Chief Health Officer but a change of  duty,

because  this  man,  who was Deputy  Chief  Health

Officer, had under his charge "Maternity and Child

Welfare  Services  (Rural)". If you  compare  this

with  the  Singapore Establishment Staff List  for

1955  at  page  83,  the position  becomes  fairly

clear.  There is a Chief Health Officer.  At  page

84,  there is a Deputy Chief Health Officer and  a

Health Officer-in-charge of Schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these years the port of Singapore has

been about three square miles long and it has  not

been  necessary  to  have  a  Senior  Port  Health

Officer.  His  work  has been  done  by  a  junior

administrative medical officer. Unlike the Port of

London or Liverpool he has not such a wide area to

cover,  nor  has  he  a large  number  of  medical

officers  to  supervise  and  control.  The   only

inference one can reasonably draw from it is that,

whilst there is a Deputy Chief Health Officer  who

also  looks  after  maternity  and  child  welfare

services, it would be difficult to create  another

superscale post Grade G. So a favourite  dodge  in

Establishment  technique  has  been  adopted.  The

title  of  the  man  who was Deputy  Chief  Health

Officer  is  converted  into  Senior  Port  Health

Officer, so there is now no Deputy. Then they slip

in  another  superscale post and put  it  down  as

Medical  Officer-in-charge,  Maternity  and   Child

Welfare  Service.  The appointment  is  completely

unnecessary. It is wrong to come to this Assembly,

after  it has been told that the Government  wants

to  economise,  to  ask it to boost  up  one  more

superscale post.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I would first like to remind the

Member  for Tanjong Pagar that it is our intention

that  a suitable local officer shall be chosen  to

proceed  overseas  for special training  prior  to

appointment to this post.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to inform the House that the

Medical Department has more than 40 maternity  and

child  health  clinics  scattered  throughout  the

island today. There has been a remarkable increase

in  total  attendances  at these  clinics  in  all

categories  and I would like to give some  of  the

figures. The following statistics are relevant:

<pre>

   Number of clinic sessions held                           2,945

   Ante-natal cases                                        11,505

   Total attendances of antenatal cases in these clincis   39,000

   Post-natal cases                                         3,552

   Total attendances of postnatal cases in these clincis    5,496

   Infants under one year                                  14,330

   Total attendances of infants under one year             94,180

   Pre-school children                                      6,173

   Total attendances of preschool children                 46,249

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary for the efficiency of the

service  that  there should be a  responsible  and

specially trained medical officer in charge of  it

and responsible for it to the Chief Health Officer

in the Ministry of Health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the three chief appointments that you see

under  sub-head  37  represented  the  three  main

sections  of  the Health Branch of  the  Ministry,

each  officer  responsible  to  the  Chief  Health

Officer for his section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the change of title, it is purely that

the Senior Port Health Officer under Division I is

in  charge of Quarantine, and, as I have said, all

these   three  Grade  G  posts  are  for  officers

responsible to the Chief Health Officer for  their

particular  sections. It is the growing  necessity

of having a medical officer in charge of maternity

and  child welfare that necessitates the provision

of  this  new appointment, and it is provided  for

the  sole  intention of having  a  suitable  local

officer  to  fill  that  post  after  he  has  had

overseas training.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I am glad to note that

the  guilty conscience on the part of the Hon. the

Minister  for  Health has made  him  categorically

state -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I do object! Contemptible P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order. It is certainly

unparliamentary for the hon. Member to impute that

any Minister has got a guilty conscience.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I must bow,

of  course, to your ruling but I must say that  it

would be an astonishing House indeed that did  not

have    Members   and   Ministers   with    guilty

consciences!



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Especially the leader of the P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, we have now a categorical

assurance from the Minister that the post has been

created  in  order that a local man  can  be  sent

abroad  and  that, in fact, this  appointment  has

been created for him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, however, like to point out that the

local  Government doctors have asked me to  remind

the   Minister  for  Health  that  no   specialist

appointment can be filled by any officer unless he

has at least ten years' seniority after qualifying

as  a  medical  officer and at least  five  years'

experience as a specialist. That is a departmental

ruling  which,  in their opinion, is  designed  to

exclude  them.  It is no use creating  this  post,

sending  the  man overseas, letting him  become  a

specialist, bringing him back and then letting him

squat for five years before he becomes eligible to

hold this appointment as a specialist officer in a

superscale post.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, I would just like to point

out  to the Minister, in respect of the statistics

with  which he has showered us, that he never gave

us  the  figures for 1951, 1952 and 1953  to  show

that  there  was, in fact, a definite increase  in

the  number of attendances at these rural clinics.

But  on  page 117 of the 1955 Estimates, one  will

find that there was exactly the same number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>



staff - Chief Health Officer, Grade E; Deputy  Chief

Health  Officer, Grade G; Health Officer-in-charge

Schools,  Grade G; Health Officers, 27.  Sir,  one

must  assume, if one bothers to work it out,  that

any  increased  work  cannot be  covered  by  just

appointing a man at the top and placing him at the

disposal of this particular department. 27  Health

Officers  were  sought in 1955 and  27  are  still

sought in 1956. That, in my submission, shows that

whatever  expansion  there may  be  is  adequately

covered  by  the 27 Health Officers and  that,  in

fact, the Medical Officer-in-charge, Maternity and

Child Welfare Services, is completely unnecessary.

First,  one  abolishes  the  Deputy  Chief  Health

Officer.  (What has he been doing all these  years

if  he  was  not the Deputy Chief Health Officer?)

Then  one  creates, since there is no Deputy  now,

three  superscale  posts - three different  branches

all   being  co-ordinated  by  the  Chief   Health

Officer.  Then in a year's time, if this  sort  of

rigging still persists, one slips in a vote for  a

Deputy  Chief  Health Officer, another  superscale

post.  One comes back and says, "Ah, but  now  the

Chief Health Officer has so much to co-ordinate he

must  have  an assistant to help him co-ordinate."

This is just the sort of thing that has been going

on  for  years  and years, bedevilling  the  whole

civil service and reducing it to utter contempt.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I object to the

suggestions  made by the last speaker.  I  do  not

need  any  reminder  from him.  I  made  a  public

pledge,  when  I  assumed office as  Minister  for

Health,   that  I  would,  in  keeping  with   our

Malayanisation  policy and  without  reducing  the

standards of the Ministry of Health, see that  the

Malayanisation policy is carried through.  I  need

no reminder from him at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These posts and some other posts have been

created  so that there will be vacancies  for  our

locally domiciled men whom I will see sent  abroad

for  higher  education to fill  these  posts.  The

question  of time qualification that he  has  just

mentioned is under consideration by me and by  the

Council  of  Ministers. There is  no  question  of

trying to sneak in extra posts because I think his

main com-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>



plaint is that the posts are made for expatriates.

Let me tell him that it is not so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Just one point in reply, Sir.

It  is  really  amazing that  any  one  could  put

forward  the  proposition that we have  created  a

post  for  a  local officer in order to  send  him

abroad. When I ask how that position can be filled

if  he needs at least five years' experience after

qualification, I am informed that  the  matter  of

the   five-year   qualifying   period   is   under

consideration. Let me tell the Hon. the  Minister

for  Health  that  his Government's  and  his  own

political future depend upon the confidence of the

local  medical officers. It is for him to convince

them. [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Hon. Members can speak

afterwards.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The pity of it all is that

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am much obliged, Mr

Chairman,  Sir,  for  also  wishing  to  help  and

sustain  the  Ministers in the  dignity  of  their

office.  I  would  point out to the  Minister  for

Health - and I will point out to him ad nauseam  as

we  go item by item through my amendments - that  if

the  local officers continue to lose faith in  him

and  his Administration, then I say his Government

will  go down the slippery slope at the bottom  of

which  lie  the mangled remains of the Progressive

Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $72,970 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 55 (5), Radiologists, Grade G,

on page 195 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to point out that I

do  not  understand one particular remark  in  the

Estimates;  it  is  that two new appointments  are

being   sought.  "Radiologists,  Grade  G,  three:

(Diagnostic),   two   (Therapy)" - Remarks    column

"Radiologist (Therapy) - new appointments. Provision

for one - token of $10 only."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In last year's Estimates, on page 122, I find

"Senior Radiologist, Grade E; Radiologists,  Grade

G, three." And against that, in the Remarks column

I  find "Radiologists increase two, one subject to

C.S. sanction." - that  was   the   old   Colonial

Secretary - but  I  do  not  understand  where   the

increase  comes in, because there was  already  an

increase  last year and the same number of  people

were in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we look at the Establishment List, page

84, we will find four Radiologists:

<pre>

    Appointment

      filled       Radiologist, General Hospital

      Vacant       Radiologist, T.T.S.H. and T.B. Clinic

      Vacant       Radiologist, General Hospital

      Vacant       Radiologist, General Hospital

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are already two vacancies in the existing

number  of  appointments for  Radiologists,  apart

from  T.T.S.H. and T.B. Clinic. If this item means

that  two  further appointments are being  sought,

then  we  on  this side of the House  cannot  make

sense  out of it. Does it mean that they  want  to

fill  two  vacancies  and continue  two  vacancies

which  they  hope  to fill in the distant  future?

Then   it  has  some  meaning,  but  we  want   an

explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I am much obliged to the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar for pointing them out  to  me,  but

these are new appointments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> So there will be seven?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Well, I cannot reconcile that. I am

dealing with the 1956 Estimates and these are  two

new  appointments. I would like to point  out  the

radiological service is expanding rapidly. In 1954

there   were   104,605  diagnostic   examinations,

representing  a  30  percent increase  over  those

recorded in 1953.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Therapy section the cases treated

increased  from  412  in  1953  to  565  in  1954,

representing a 37 per cent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>



increase.   The   Therapy   department   of    the

radiological  service is of increasing  importance

as  modern discoveries extend the scope of  radio-active   treatment  of  disease.  Hitherto  Radio-therapists   have  not  been  shown  specifically,

although  one  Radio-therapist has been  employed.

The  provision of two extra posts is  intended  to

enable  the  special  training  overseas  of   two

locally  domiciled  officers  who  may  show   the

ability  to  undertake further  training  in  this

speciality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A suggestion has been made by the Colombo Plan

authorities  that  Singapore  might  apply  for  a

cobalt  bomb. So far it has not been  possible  to

follow  up  this suggestion because a cobalt  bomb

will  be of no assistance to Singapore unless  one

can  be confident that there will be available  at

all times a specialist to use it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I wish to remind the Member for Tanjong

Pagar that these two extra posts have been created

specially for the purpose of enabling the Ministry

to  send  two locally domiciled officers  overseas

for special training.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, this is the

difficulty that we constantly experience  on  this

side  of  the  House. Regardless of the  point  we

make, we get an answer which has been prepared and

written out beforehand, without relevance  to  the

points made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, if I may take the Minister's last point,

that  he wants to send two local officers overseas

in  order  that they may become radiologists,  and

that  therefore he has created the posts now which

they cannot fill until five years after qualifying

as  specialists,  unless he does  something  about

what  he  says is under consideration - the removal

of this prohibition of a man becoming a specialist

unless he has five years of his speciality. May  I

inform him that the local officers are quite happy

to  be timescale officers, so that when they  come

back  they can fill the job immediately?  They  do

not  want  to be on superscale, because they  feel

that  that is another of those nasty little dodges

they play in the civil service, check and counter-check,  a  little game of chess.  They  are  quite

happy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>



to go and train as radiologists, come back, not as

superscale  officers  but  as  ordinary  timescale

radiologists, to do the job, and after five years,

if  there  is  a  benevolent government  still  in

power,  they  might be promoted to superscale  and

given  more money. But they are quite happy to  do

the  job  without more money, and they  prefer  it

that  way, because they feel safer for they cannot

be cheated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have heard a mass of irrelevant

information about a cobalt bomb being applied  for

from  the  Colombo Plan authorities, and therefore

radiologists are required to manipulate it. All we

want to know is why are there two vacancies in the

Establishment List for radiologists which have not

been  filled? The Minister comes before this House

and  says, "I do not know how to explain that, but

I  am  asking for two new ones." He is asking  for

something  which  is costing us something  in  the

region of $70,000 odd without our knowing what  it

is  all about. When it is put to the vote,  we  on

this  side of the House are expected to say, "Aye,

we  agree  with that." I would ask the  Government

seriously  to  consider this point which  is  made

with the authority of the local officers. They are

quite happy -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Name them! Do you speak for

them?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> There is an association of the

local medical -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> You speak for the

association?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order. You can speak

afterwards, Mr Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Chief

Minister  takes great umbrage when anybody  speaks

for any group of people for whom he would like  to

speak. I would like to remind him that the further

he  goes with his expatriate officials in creating

all  these appointments, the further away he  goes

from  his  own  people on whom he ultimately  must

rely  for support to run his Administration. I  am

not  suggesting for one moment that this was  done

with the connivance or the consent of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>



Chief  Minister or his Ministers. I  said  at  the

opening  of  the debate on the Second  Reading  of

this Bill that there are faults in the Budget that

I   do  not  lay  directly  at  the  feet  of  the

Ministers.  They  are new in their  jobs.  As  the

Minister  for  Health  has  given  us  reason   to

believe,  they really do not understand  what  all

this  is about. Quite obviously they have to  rely

on  the  expatriates and the officials, and  these

gentlemen,  like everybody else, are creatures  of

habit.   They  do  what  they  have  always   been

accustomed  to  do. They carry  out  their  artful

little  dodges.  They carry on in their  good  old

ways for as long as they can. Sir, I would ask the

elected  Members  of this Government  to  consider

reducing the posts of Radiologists from superscale

to ordinary timescale. The local officers, to whom

the  Minister for Health has made reference,  have

indicated that they would prefer much less pay  on

timescale. They would rather come back from  their

training overseas and fill that job than come back

and  find  that they are not qualified to  fill  a

superscale  job.  Then  application  is  made  for

somebody  who  is qualified and that  somebody  is

inevitably an expatriate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir,   on   this  question  of  Radiologists,   we

understand  from  the  Minister  for  Health  that

locally  domiciled people are being sent  overseas

for further studies. I would just like to know the

number  sent,  how  long they will  take  to  have

special  training, and when they will  return.  If

none  are to return in 1956, as they are sent now,

then there is no point in creating posts now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point. I would like to refer to

the  post  of  Radiologist at the  Tan  Tock  Seng

Hospital  and T.B. Clinic mentioned at  page  203,

Head  52, sub-head 55 (130). It occurs to me  that

they are just trying to complete the hospital  and

this will not be so until sometime in July. If you

do not have a hospital to cope with patients, then

you  do  not  require  such  a  large  number   of

Radiologists. I would like to have an explanation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I would like to ask one

more  question.  It is this. Will these  posts  be

left  vacant  till these people qualify,  or  will

they be filled by somebody else in the meantime?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I can answer that, Mr Chairman.

These  posts are intended to be held vacant  until

the  officers under training obtain the  requisite

experience to fill them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That means for eight years.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> That is under consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, we now come

to an even stranger item. I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $22,080 the sum to be allotted in

respect  of  sub-head 55 (27), Sister  Tutors,  on

page 196 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, in the Remarks column, one sees

"Increase  six.  Provision  for  seven  for  seven

months."  It  is a lot of algebra the significance

of  which we, who are not accustomed to the  slang

of  the  Administration, cannot really appreciate.

Now, if we turn first to the Establishment List -



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> On a point of order, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The Establishment List, I think, is

irrelevant  to the debate. We are considering  the

Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I understood the hon. Member to be

making  comparisons  on the same  subject.  He  is

entitled to make comparisons.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> This is the sort of -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have ruled already, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am much obliged for your

assistance, Mr Chairman, Sir, but I feel that one

should  not  allow this kind of  conduct  to  pass

without  comment. However, since you feel  that  I

should  not  comment, I will not, but nevertheless

it  does not mean that I do not want to comment in

the strongest possible terms.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, at page 92 of the Establishment List, for

Sister  Tutors,  one  finds that  there  are  four

Sister  Tutors - four expatriates, one local.  There

are  four appointments, but there are five  Sister

Tutors, and I am told the explanation for that  is

that  there  is one leave reserve - one is  away  on

leave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are now told that the Government wants

six  more. They want provision for seven for seven

months.  What that means is that for seven  months

in  1956, June to December, they propose to engage

seven  Sister Tutors. Of course, we  can  have  an

assurance from the Minister for Health that he  is

going  to  send six lucky local girls for training

so that they may come back and enjoy the wonderful

privilege of being Sister Tutors, because they can

only become Sister Tutors by going to Britain  for

training.  That  training takes a period  of  more

than  six  months.  By June next  year  all  seven

appointments  will  have been  filled.  I  do  not

understand it, but I do understand this, that this

need  was  seen as long ago as February 1954.  Sir

Han  Hoe Lim is a very conservative member of this

community about whom, in his capacity as a  Member

of the Public Services Commission, little good has

been  said.  In  a Commission of which  he  was  a

Member,   he,  from  such  an  indisputably   pro-expatriate  quarter, advised in  his  report  that

within  the  18 months following the date  of  the

report  in  1954,  five Sister Tutors  should  be

chosen  and sent for training in order  that  they

could  fill these posts. It is on page 40  of  the

Han  Hoe Lim Report (Council Paper No. 40 of 1954)

and you will see there:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Candidates for these must be chosen within the

next  18  months, and the posts in the Departments

concerned must not be occupied substantively until

their return, qualified to fill them."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there, amongst the list of other things, are

five Sister Tutors. Now we are told that they want

six.  They were told early in 1954 to choose  five

and send them away for training. Nothing was done.

I  do not hold the Minister for Health responsible

for  this because, after all, he did not know that

he  was  going  to  be Minister for  Health  until

sometime late in April this year. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>



I  hold  responsible the experts for whom  we  are

paying  special  pay to attract  and  retain,  the

bunglers and the fumblers who allow this  kind  of

tomfoolery  to go on in the very serious  business

of  Administration. Five were told to  be  chosen,

yet  nothing was done. We are now asked to approve

seven for next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If I may, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I would ask, Sir, whether

abuse   of  this  character  conduces  either   to

intelligent debate, to the dignity of this  House,

or  to  the  efficient functioning of  government.

Could  I,  Sir,  at least plead with  you,  as  we

cannot,  Mr Chairman, with hon. Members opposite,

that  they conduct themselves in a manner that  is

more  consonant  with  their responsibilities  and

with the dignity of the House?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order. I have pointed out

time  and  time again that I am bound by  Standing

Orders  and  I can only intervene when Members  of

the  Assembly  are  attacked, when  offensive  and

insulting  language about Members of the  Assembly

is  used  or when improper motives are imputed  to

any  Member.  It may be that Standing  Orders  are

defective  in that respect, but, as I  say,  I  am

bound  by  Standing Orders and I expect  that  the

permanent  officers  who  are  attacked  will   be

supported or upheld by the responsible Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I have been scrupulously

careful  in this respect, that I have never  named

any  officer.  I am damning the Administration  as

such - a  class of officers - and surely the Hon. the

Chief  Minister  knows that  one  cannot  libel  a

class.  But if they should take personal  umbrage,

then  let me assure them, if they feel that  their

Minister does not or cannot defend



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>



them  to  their satisfaction, that we are prepared

to meet them at any suitable forum at any time and

place convenient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out to this Assembly that

we  are  being asked now to give approval for  six

appointments - Sister  Tutors - in  order  that  six

people can be sent overseas to be trained and come

back  at  some  indefinite  date  in  the  future.

Meanwhile  the posts having now been created,  are

going  to be filled as from June next year  before

these  people  could possibly have been  selected,

sent  and returned qualified. The whole thing does

not make sense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Member for

Tanjong Pagar referred to a White Paper, a  report

under  the  chairmanship of Sir Han Hoe  Lim.  The

relevant  sentence  of  that  report,  which   was

accepted by the Government then, was "that  it  is

necessary to ensure that before officers are  sent

on  Scholarships  there  shall  be  vacancies  for

promotion  on  their return." As I have  explained

earlier to this House, that is the reason  why  we

are  creating these posts. That recommendation was

implemented  by  the Director of Medical  Services

and  the Chief Secretary on the 5th of July, 1954,

and further amplified in August 1955 with regard to

scholarships, giving the basis for award of  these

scholarships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar also referred to my

reading  notes. I have received quite a number  of

motions and it is only necessary, of course,  that

answers  to  these,  with  the  assistance  of  my

officers, be dictated, and I must refer  to  them,

but  I can assure him that I do not type and  read

out any verbatim speeches such I have seen Members

on the opposite side of the House do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I wish to inform the House that the

present Medical Department has an establishment of

four  Sister  Tutors. In addition to  these  four,

there  are three World Health Organisation  Sister

Tutors working in Singapore at the Nurses Training

School. Our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>



agreement   with  the  World  Health  Organisation

commits  this  Government to replace  these  World

Health  Organisation experts with  local  officers

when  the  period  of  loan of  the  World  Health

Organisation   experts   terminates.    Therefore,

although  the  proposed  establishment  for   1956

appears to involve an increase of six, the  actual

increase asked for, in fact, is only three.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nurses Training School in the General

Hospital is being expanded to enable the School to

have  an  annual  intake of 150  probationers.  If

efficient training is to be given by that  Nursing

School  at  the General Hospital, it is absolutely

necessary that there should be an establishment of

ten  Sister Tutors. In this connection, I wish  to

say  once  again - and  I make it  clear - that  these

additional  posts  are intended by  Government  to

provide  for  scholarships and  fellowships  which

will  enable locally domiciled officers to proceed

overseas to take the Sister Tutor Certificate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I must

point out that it is significant that the Minister

for  Health  has not chosen to meet my point.  The

only  inference that one can draw from the remarks

"Provision  for  seven for seven months"  is  that

long  before  these Sister Tutors return  in  June

next year, seven posts will be filled.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> In amplification of what I said just

now,  Mr  Chairman, Sir, if there were  immediate

needs  by my Ministry for any posts, whether  they

be  for Sister Tutors or otherwise, these could be

filled  on  contract  basis. Such  posts  will  be

filled   when  our  own  nurses  return  and   are

qualified to fill them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> And the need for these

vacancies was seen as early as February 1954.  Why

was nothing done?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $36,480 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 55 (131), Chest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>



Physicians, Grade G, on page 203 of the Estimates.

<pre>

  "Sub-head 55

  (131), Chest

  Physicians,

  Four; Grade G ....  Increase  three to  include

                      the   appointment  of  T.B.

                      Specialist previously shown

                      under General Hospital."

</pre>

<br><br>"Increase  to  include" - in other  words,  one  can

assume  that the increase sought for is two.  Here

again, if I may just refer to a document to  which

the Hon. the Financial Secretary does not wish  to

have  this  House refer - page 83 of  the  Singapore

Establishment  Staff List - "One Chest  Physician".

That  is  all, and we are asked to approve another two.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, we are not against the

creation  of more posts for Chest Physicians,  but

we  are  against the creation of superscale  posts

for  Chest Physicians. They can only be filled  by

men  with ten years qualification, with five years

qualification in a specialist capacity. The  class

of  people  from whom these people must be  chosen

for   specialist  training  have  indicated   very

strongly  that they prefer timescale appointments.

They  are  quite  happy to go  abroad,  get  their

training  and come back to time-scale appointments

and do the jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know if the Members of the Government

understand  that every time they say  "no"  to  an

amendment,  they  are not always  saying  "no"  to

motions  which  have been set down  for  political

reasons,  where we disagree with the politics  and

the policy of the Government. Under Head 52 are  a

number of amendments which have got nothing to  do

with  politics or policy between Parties  in  this

House.   We   are  all  committed  absolutely   to

Malayanisation.   We   do   not   consider   these

amendments  as  motions of no  confidence  in  the

Government.  We  ask the Government  seriously  to

consider  the  request which I am putting  forward

before this House on behalf of the people who will

be  affected by these new appointments. They  have

asked  me to state that they are happier  to  have

less   money  as  timescale  officers.   But   the

Government says, "No, we will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>



give  them superscale appointments. Meanwhile,  we

will  recruit Europeans if we need any because  no

local men are available."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, we have repeatedly heard

the  hon. and  learned Member for  Tanjong  Pagar

suggest  that he speaks on behalf of  the  medical

profession of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Government service.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> There is no iota of evidence

to support - [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I would like to say this,

Sir,  that  I have had the most cordial  relations

with  the Alumni Association. In fact, one of them

is   the  Chairman,  as  you  know,  of  our  most

important  Commission. If there was any suggestion

of  the  medical profession, either in  Government

service    or   otherwise,   having    made    any

representations of this character,  I  find  it  a

little  difficult  to digest the possibility  that

they would seek to make those representations, not

to   the   appropriate  quarters - to  the  Minister

himself or even to the Chief Minister - but to  this

one-man  band  of  the so-called  People's  Action

Party -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Not so-called.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> For this person, who, as is

known by every observant person, is nothing but an

umbrella - a one-man umbrella - for  a  group  whose

activities  cannot  bear  the  light  of  day,  to

suggest  that Government officers would prefer  to

make  their  representations to him  than  to  the

proper  Ministry  and the proper  Minister  is  to

insult  our  local  civil service.  I  reject  the

suggestion  that  the  Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar

speaks for anyone but himself and his more dubious

companions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, whenever I

say  that  I speak for a group that the  Hon. the

Chief  Minister does not like me to speak for,  he

inevitably comes to the conclusion that it  cannot

be  so.  I  do not like to disillusion him  but  I

would suggest to him that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>



the  reason why they have, in fact, not approached

either  the Minister or the Chief of the Ministers

is   because  there  has  been  gradual  loss   of

confidence  in  his policy of Malayanisation.  The

person   to  whom  the  Hon. the  Chief  Minister

referred to as being on the most cordial of  terms

has  received  a  rude shock in  his  capacity  as

Chairman of the Malayanisation Commission. I might

also  indicate to the Hon. the Chief Minister that

this  person has considerable qualms as to whether

he  should  write his report after his  own  heart

because he might then find it difficult to make it

acceptable to the Chief Minister. May I assure him

that  after this debate, I can give him  full  and

satisfactory evidence, if he needs evidence,  that

I  am  not  speaking just on my  own  behalf?  Mr

Chairman,  Sir,  although I may  not  be  a  great

actor,  I  am  not  such an  inept  politician  as

publicly to make statements on behalf of  a  group

of local men who are an important cog in the local

administrative machinery when, in fact, I have  no

business  to do so. For it will only  lead  to  my

antagonising them. I would commend to the Hon. the

Chief Minister to reflect on the possibility that,

in   fact,  they  are  losing  confidence  in  the

firmness with which and the uncompromising  manner

in  which he was expected to pursue his policy  of

Malayanisation. His drift towards  his  expatriate

officials  and  his  keenness to  defend  them  is

causing  this  loss  of  confidence.  It  may   be

possible,  and I would like to ask him to  reflect

on that -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> And disloyalty.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Call it what you will.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Member for

Tanjong Pagar has referred constantly to things of

the  past. This Government can in no way  be  held

responsible for the Administration in 1954. I have

said  it  once,  and  I say  it  again,  that  the

question   of   time   qualification   is    under

consideration and everyone will be treated on  his

own merits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of these Chest

Physicians, the Government's plan for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>



the  Tan  Tock  Seng Hospital  is  to  expand  its

accommodation  to  a total of 1,000  beds.  It  is

under consideration at the present time. We expect

to  complete  in the middle of 1956 two  new  ward

blocks  providing for 400 additional beds  to  the

550  already  at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital.  This

additional  provision, together with the  enormous

out-patient  work,  demands  an  increase  in  the

number of specialists to provide for the efficient

supervision   of  the  treatment  of  tuberculosis

cases.  In  this connection, it is once again  the

intention of the Government that locally domiciled

officers  should  proceed  overseas  for   special

training  and  if  the two additional  posts  here

provided  are  deleted  from  the  Estimates,  two

locally  domiciled officers scheduled  to  proceed

overseas in 1956 will not be able to do so -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Come, come, that is another -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $10,020 the sum to be allotted in

respect    of    sub-head   55   (163),    Medical

Superintendent,  Grade  E  on  page  204  of   the

Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum asked for is for the creation of a Grade

E  superscale appointment for Trafalgar Home.  Mr

Chairman,  Sir, I do not know if the Minister  for

Health   is   aware  that  there  is   a   Medical

Superintendent at Kandang Kerbau Hospital, one  at

Woodbridge  Hospital  and one  at  Tan  Tock  Seng

Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Kandang Kerbau Hospital, which is one of the

biggest  maternity hospitals in  the  world,  with

20,000  deliveries  a year,  there  is  a  Medical

Superintendent who is only a Grade G man. There is

another  person  in Tan Tock Seng Hospital - a  much

bigger hospital than Trafalgar Home - who is also in

Grade  G.  In Woodbridge Hospital, however,  where

there is an expatriate, the officer is on Grade E,

probably because there may be an increase  in  the

near  future  in  the  number of  lunatics  there.

Therefore the duties of that post may become  more

and  more important. But we do not understand  how

the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>



assess the value of the post at Trafalgar Home,  a

relatively  small hospital compared to either  Tan

Tock Seng or Kandang Kerbau, as a Grade E post.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I do not know, Mr Chairman, Sir,

whether the Member for Tanjong Pagar was confusing

Trafalgar Home, which is a home for leprosy cases,

with Woodbridge Hospital, which he mentioned as  a

small one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Trafalgar Home has accommodation for 1,000

patients, which is no small hospital. At  the  end

of  1954, there were 825 infectious cases isolated

there.  In  addition to the cases accommodated  at

Trafalgar   Home,  there  are  over   1,000   non-infectious  cases of leprosy under  treatment  and surveillance in out-patient clinics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto, specialist supervision of the

treatment  of these patients has been carried  out

by  the  tuberculosis specialist at the  Tan  Tock

Seng  Hospital.  The expansion of  Tan  Tock  Seng

Hospital   will   mean   that   the   tuberculosis

specialist  will  be able to give  less  and  less

supervision   to   the   treatment   of   leprosy.

Government are in sight of bringing leprosy  under

complete control within the Colony, and it will be

a  most serious step to endanger the efficiency of

leprosy  control  by  failing  to  provide  expert

supervision. It  is considered essential  that  a

full-time  officer be appointed for this  purpose.

Such an officer must have specialised training and

experience  and, in this case, once again,  as  in

all  cases  that I have mentioned, the  Government

wish  to  be  in  a  position to  send  a  locally

domiciled  officer overseas for  further  training

for   a  higher  specialist  degree  and  specific

training in leprosy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> In the meantime, Mr Chairman,

Sir, is it the intention of the Government to  put

an expatriate there?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> If it is necessary, he will be on

contract.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Mr

Chairman, Sir, I should like to explain  that  the

policy  outlined  in  His Excellency's  speech  on

behalf  of  the Government on the 22nd  of  April,

1955,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>



has  been stringently adhered to. There has been

no   question  whatsoever  of  the  employment  of

expatriate officers except where we have no  means

of  getting  local  officers. There  is  also  the

matter  of  urgency of employment and  even  then,

Sir, there is not a single expatriate officer,  to

my knowledge, who has been employed since the 22nd

of   April  otherwise  than  on  an  all-inclusive

contract  which  gives no right of  abolition.  In

order to enable our men to succeed them at the end

of   the   contract  and  in  view  of  the   very

considerable,  and  at  times  very  unreasonable,

criticism  that has been levelled at  us  and  the

slimy   imputation   of  our  weakening   in   our

Malayanisation  policy which  the  gentleman  from

Tanjong   Pagar,  who  calls  himself   the   Hon.

Secretary of the P.A.P., has made, I think  it  is

necessary -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Not quite really -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> He must speak all the time.

I  think  it  is necessary that this Assembly  and

this   country  should  be  reminded   that   this

Government is adhering to and maintaining  in  all

its  stringency the undertaking given as a  matter

of policy when we first took office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move,

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am glad, Mr Chairman, Sir,

that  you  have ruled on how important  statements

are  to  be  made, but I sometimes wonder  if  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $18,780 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 55 (198), Male Nurses, on page

206 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, it is only a very short

point. If one turns to the 1955 Establishment List

under  "Male Nurses", one finds that there are  "6

appointments  and  1  Leave  Reserve",   and   two

vacancies  unfilled for male nurses. Two vacancies

unfilled, and we are being asked now to  vote  for

more vacancies. Does it make sense?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> The Member for Tanjong Pagar has not

given  any  serious reason for moving this  motion

but, for the sake of information, I have to inform

you  that  there are 1,936 equipped  beds  in  the

Woodbridge Hospital and the Woodbridge Hospital is

not,  as  some people think, a hospital solely  to

imprison people who are mentally deranged. It is a

curative   hospital  where  persons   are   cured,

discharged  and then returned to normal  life.  If

treatment  is  to be carried out properly,  it  is

essential  that  there  should  be  a  supervisory

nursing  staff,  experienced  and  expert  in  the

treatment of mental diseases. The three additional

posts  here  provided are specially  intended  for

locally domiciled officers to obtain mental  nurse

training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.

respect of sub-head 55 (202), Sisters (Trained  in

Mental Diseases), on page 206 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are being asked here for an increase of

six - provision for one month. Mr Chairman, Sir, we

have  been told repeatedly this morning that every

new  appointment has been created for the  purpose

of  furthering  Malayanisation,  by  sending  some

local  man or woman overseas in order that  he  or

she can equip himself or herself for the necessary

job.   If   one   looks  at  the  1955   Singapore

Establishment  Staff List on page  97,  one  finds

four vacancies:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nursing Sisters (Trained in Mental Diseases),

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodbridge Hospital, 4 appointments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 Vacant".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why have not four local girls been sent abroad

for  training  if  that is the  purpose  of  these

appointments?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the posts must

first  be created prior to employment, and without

the  creation of such posts there is no  means  of

getting  the staff. It would be putting  the  cart

before  the  horse if that were not  so.  For  the

information of the House, however, I would like to

say  that the same reason as that indicated by  me

in the previous amendment to "Male Nurses" applies

here for the new additional six posts. In a mental

hospital  of  the  size  of  Woodbridge  Hospital,

provision  for a total of ten sisters  trained  in

mental  diseases  is  woefully insufficient.  Here

again,  Government has taken a realistic  view  in

providing  only those posts which it  can  foresee

filling   in  due  course  by  locally   domiciled

officers who have received special training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 1955, this Government opened a new

training school in Woodbridge Hospital for  mental

nurses  with  the specific intention that  locally

domiciled  nurses could obtain their  training  in

mental  diseases.  If  this  training  is  to   be

provided  for  and if this Mental Nurses  Training

School is to be expanded, the additional provision

here proposed is essential, as also that, if I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1271</b></font><br><br>



might draw your attention to it, for the

appointment of a Sister Tutor under item 204 under

the same Head.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The point on which we would

all be grateful to receive information is why have

not  four  local  women  been  sent  if  the  four

vacancies  made last year were for the purpose  of

sending local women overseas for training?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> That point will be met as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 54 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Hon.

the Chief Secretary yesterday doubted if there

were enough rabbits in the colonial hat to make a

rabbit pie. I have great pleasure now in pulling

one of the fattest rabbits out of this colonial

hat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $1,200 the sum to be allotted in

respect  of  sub-head 1 (2), Deputy Controller  of

Immigration,  Grade  G,  on  page   214   of   the

Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, in the Remarks column of this

First  Schedule, there is this legend against  the

post:  "Salary  scale revised  from  $1,300-40A-1,420".  The post is to be changed from  an  upper

timescale  post to a superscale Grade  G  post  at

$1,520 - Deputy Controller of immigration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, last year's Estimates showed

the  same  number of people in this department  in

Division 1 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Controller of Immigration, Grade E

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deputy Controller of Immigration (not Grade G)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistant Controllers of Immigration, seven.



<br><br>Now, it is going to become:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deputy Controller of Immigration (upgraded to

superscale)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior Assistant Controller of Immigration

(upgraded from Assistant Controller to upper timescale) -



<br><br>with the same number of officers in charge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister

may  not like what I said in this House yesterday,

and  he  will not like what I have to say on  this

today.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1273</b></font><br><br>



But I would remind him that it is the duty of this

Assembly  to  see not only that his Malayanisation

policy  is being pursued vigorously but also  that

there is no rigging in the service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At page 75 of the 1955 Establishment List - this

is  a  copy, Mr Chairman, Sir, which  is  in  the

Library of this Assembly, and I do not see why the

Hon. the  Financial Secretary would not wish  the

House  to have the advantage of information  which

has  been  placed at the disposal of this Assembly

in  its  Library - one will see that the  inevitable

result  of  the creation of these two posts  means

the upgrading of two expatriate officers. There is

a  Deputy  Controller of Immigration  (substantive

holder),   who   is   an  expatriate,   and   this

appointment has always been a timescale post. Now,

it  is proposed - not that there is any expansion in

the staff of the department, not that there is any

rise  in the status of that particular office - that

the  scale for that particular office be  upgraded

to  Grade  G.  As there is already  a  substantive

holder  of  that position, there is no doubt  that

the  person  who is going to get the rise  is  the

person in occupation of that office. There  is  no

doubt that it is a simple and clear case where, in

spite of the good intentions of the Hon. the Chief

Minister  and his Ministerial colleagues who  have

been  elected  into office, the intention  of  the

expatriate civil service is quite clear - that  they

are  pushing  and jockeying all their  friends  up

into  all  the superscale posts in every  possible

way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Mr Chief Secretary?



<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> On a point of order, Mr Chairman,

Sir.  The  Member  for Tanjong Pagar  has  imputed

improper  action by the civil service.  The  civil

service  in  this  Colony  this  day  and  age  is

controlled by Ministers. That is imputing improper

motives to Ministers.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have not heard the hon. Member

imputing an improper motive to any specific Member

of the Assembly. As I see it, he is now at-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>



tacking  a  class  of  public  officers.   It   is

unfortunate that he should see fit to do so. I  am

sorry  that  my hands are tied by Standing  Orders

and I must leave the standard of the debate to the

conscience of individual Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, my

conscience is clear -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If any.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> If any? We may not, Mr

Chairman, Sir, be quite so super-sensitive in  our

reaction to attack, or criticism, or objection, or

interruption, but that does not mean  that  we  do

not  have  a  conscience to keep  faith  with  our

electors,  with the people who have sent  us  here

for a specific purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, in other parts of the world,

the civil service is not a political issue and  it

is  not  customary  to have to  attack  particular

appointments  in the administrative service  of  a

country.  But  we  have got  an  expatriate  civil

service  which  is  a  political  issue  in   this

country.  It is a live political issue  and  I  am

attacking it purely on the grounds that it  is  an

expatriate and a foreign service. We are  fighting

to  abolish  it, not to give it more  pay  for  no

reason other than that the Hon. the Chief Minister

did  not  know better than to take the  advice  of

those  who  are  bound  to  benefit  by  all  this

upgrading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, it is not

my  Ministry  but  as  a  Member  of  the  Finance

Committee,  I  am one of the Ministers  personally

responsible for this particular item.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I can speak therefore on the

reason why we permitted it. I would like to say to

the  Assembly - other than those who are so  blinded

by  their  hate  that they will  not  see - that  we

called  in the Controller of Immigration and  said

that  we  were not happy to upgrade any particular

post   until  we  had  the  full  Report  of   the

Sreenivasan (Malayanisation) Commission.  In  this

instance, Sir, it was pointed out to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>

us  that this officer has reached the upper  limit

of his timescale for some time now, and that there

has  been,  since  the  advent  of  the  Coalition

Government, considerably increased activity in the

Immigration Department, particularly as  a  result

of representations which came through me and other

Ministers,  and particularly due to  the  pressure

that  I  was  putting on and other Ministers  were

putting on the Department to expedite its dealings

with  applications for entry permits which in  the

past  had  taken two or three years to go through.

To our minds, Sir, it is a ghastly thing to keep a

family waiting in suspense and anxiety for such  a

considerable  period of time, and although  it  is

true  that  the senior officers in that Department

remain  the  same in number, the House surely  has

not  forgotten that only recently it approved  the

appointment of four more junior officers  to  that

Department  in  order  to expedite  the  increased

volume of work as well as to give greater rapidity

to  the decisions to be taken in respect of  those

applications. As a result of that expansion,  Sir,

there has been a great deal more work thrown  upon

the  officer  in question whom I do  not  remember

ever  having  met. I learned his  name  only  last

night, and that from the hon. Member opposite, but

the name does not matter. I think it is correct to

say  that  he  is an expatriate officer,  but  the

position is this, Sir. It is the intention of this

Government  to deal with scrupulous fairness  with

all its employees, and if in the normal course  of

events  it is proper that a certain civil servant,

whether  he  be  a  Malayan or whether  he  be  an

expatriate,  should  be  promoted  and  receive  a

hundred dollars extra per month, then he should be

promoted,  Sir.  He  should  also,  if  there  are

abolition  terms,  properly  get  those  abolition

terms in respect of that extra hundred dollars.  I

do not, nor do my colleagues, intend to permit the

expatriates to be treated unjustly nor,  I  think,

does the country want it. We want abolition and we

want  Malayanisation, but we do admit  that  there

must be fair compensation and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>



there cannot be fair compensation, Sir, if we  are

holding  back  the  proper  promotions  at  proper

times.  I  know I find myself in the extraordinary

position - it  may seem to be so to certain  Members

of  the  House - of  defending the expatriate  civil

service,  but  I  have all my  life,  Sir,  sought

fairness for all human beings. That is why I am in

this Assembly and I hope that is why we are all in

this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that it is unfair to an expatriate officer

to  stop his normal promotion - and this was not  a

normal  but  a pressing promotion - just because  we

want  to give him less when abolition terms  come.

That is cheating in the true sense of the word and

it is not the intention of the Government to cheat

the  expatriate civil servants, nor do I think the

people  of  Singapore want to cheat the expatriate

civil   servant  when  it  comes  to  giving   him

abolition  terms. I have every reason to  believe,

and so have the Ministers who are my colleagues on

the  Finance Committee and who saw and  heard  the

Controller    of    Immigration,     after     the

representations made, that this was,  in  fact,  a

proper and well-earned promotion. It is true  that

when  abolition comes he will get  a  few  dollars

more  because he is now getting a hundred  dollars

more a month. For the honour of this country, Sir,

we should not seek to save those few dollars.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> For the honour of this

country, Sir, let us be honest whether we want  to

Malayanise  at  every possible speed.  Let  us  be

honest whether we propose to get rid of expatriate

officers  and supplant them by local officers,  or

quibble  and wobble, be frightened of sabotage  in

the   civil  service  by  Europeans  in  strategic

positions, and come here and defend them.  I  have

not  come here to this Assembly to represent their

interests. I said before the elections that I  did

not  seek one European vote. I have come  here  to

represent the Asians of Singapore and they do  not

want  this. Furthermore, I am ashamed to hear that

the  officer  in  question  cannot  discharge  his

duties unless he receives a hundred dollars more -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> There was no such

suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The man is already in that

position  and  has always been in  that  position.

Because  there  are  four  more  Deputy  Assistant

Controllers  of  Immigration  to  look  after,   a

slightly  increased  number  of  Deputy  Assistant

Controllers - four  out  of  27 -  because   of   the

increase  of the four, the officer in question  is

unable  to  discharge his duties with  proficiency

and honesty if he does not get the hundred dollars

more!  That,  Sir,  I think is  the  most  damning

admission  that  any Minister can make  about  the

expatriate civil service -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> There was no such suggestion or admission.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar  is  on a  witch-hunt  against

expatriates.   He  sees  red  when   anything   is

suggested   to  improve  the  lot  of   expatriate

officers, not because they are expatriate officers

but because of the rate for the job.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Come, come!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> It is because of the new

constitution   that  this  Deputy  Controller   of

responsibilities. It is as a result of  the  spate

of  appeals  that have been sent to the Department

through  the  various Ministries, and particularly

through the Chief Minister, that the Controller of

Immigration  has  found  it  necessary   to   give

additional   responsibilities   to   the    Deputy

Controller of Immigration. To suggest that  I,  as

the  Minister  responsible  for  that  Department, would  allow  a recommendation to go through  just

because  the  holder of the post is an  expatriate

officer is a most unfair and baseless -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,009,790 for Head 55 ordered to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 56 -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $10 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 9, Assistance to Youth

Organisations, on page 226 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, Sir, at the beginning make my stand very

clear.  I am not moving a reduction of $10 because

I  feel that the sum is too much but I am moving a

reduction  of $10 because I think the sum  is  too

small.  I  am bound by Standing Orders  and  so  I

cannot  move anything above what has been  put  in

this Budget.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, "Assistance to Youth Organisations" in this

instance means assistance to boys' clubs and mixed

clubs  and girls' clubs. The institution of  boys'

and girls' clubs was mooted in the year 1946 and I

think the Nominated Member, Mr R. C. H. Lim,  was

for  a  very long time on the Committee of one  of

the clubs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose and aim of such clubs and

institutions   are   to   assist   underprivileged

children. In Singapore today, Sir, we all realise,

and  it has been repeated very often indeed,  that

over 50 per cent of the population is under 21. It

is  even more important, Sir, to realise that  out

of  that 50 per cent of young people in Singapore,

a   very   large   number  of   them   come   from

underprivileged  homes, homes that  cannot  afford

the little amenities of life. The parents of these

youngsters  are  probably hawkers  and  labourers.

They  cannot afford to buy them anything to assist

them to pass their time usefully. These youngsters

have  no playing facilities. Many of them have  no

opportunity  to go to school. Many  more  have  to

help  their families. It is because of this  group

of  youngsters that boys' clubs and  girls'  clubs

are set up to assist them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance to such people must take in a lot of

voluntary  workers, and I would say that  in  many

clubs  many people are willing to help this  group

of  people.  They  are  doing  really  good  work,

instead of theorising in air-conditioned rooms, as

some  people do, as to what we should do  for  the

underprivileged. However, not all people who  want

to  help can help because they are not equipped to

help.  I  believe that whenever we spend money  we

must always get value for our money. If any scheme

to  help these under-privileged young people is to

attain greater success, then we must train a group

of  people so that they may be able to help  these

young  people.  We must train them  along  special

lines.   We  must  train  them  in  art   and   in

handicrafts so that they can go back to the  clubs

and assist the youths, but such schemes cost money

and very little money has been provided.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, doing such work is full-time work.

The whole band of voluntary people who are helping

in   these   schemes  have  to  earn   their   own

livelihood.  They  have to look  after  their  own

affairs  and in order to make leadership in  boys'

clubs  more  effective, we have club  leaders  who

work  for  a period of six hours and more  a  day.

Some  work  for  eight  hours,  and  holidays  are

included,  but  they are very happy  to  serve.  I

personally  feel that although the  Department  of

Social  Welfare would like to say  that  they  are

part-time  workers, they are, in  fact,  full-time

workers. They work on holidays when they should be

having  their  rest; and yet how much  do  we  pay

them?  We pay them round about $80, $90 or $100  a

month,  and that is really a pitiful sum.  We  are

now  faced with the position whereby if we do  not

assist  these  young people to spend their  excess

energy in the proper manner, there is a very  real

danger of their running into bad company or  being

led to become gangsters; and of their being taught

to be anti-social in the years to come. Boys' club

work  is positive work and it is only by the  work

of  such  people that Singapore may be  a  happier

place to live in. The sum allocated, $40,000,  for

the  whole  movement is indeed very small.  During

the  Second Reading stage, I said that in 1954 the

sum allocated was $28,000. That was for ten clubs.

In 1955 the sum allocated went up to $40,000. That

sum  represents  a 50 per cent rise  and  we  have

about  13  clubs. This year we have 40 clubs,  and

the  sum allocated remains the same for 1956.  You

will   see,  Sir,  that  the  activities  of  this

movement  have increased almost three times  since

last  year,  but the grant remains  the  same,  at

$40,000.  I  regret  that that  should  be  so.  I

believe that it should be increased and all people

who  have  any  love and care for  those  who  are

really under-privileged and need assistance should

see to it that that sum is increased at once.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

I  have been connected with boys' clubs since 1946

and have helped in the establishment of many of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>



the  boys'  clubs, but there are some boys'  clubs

existing  today which cater not for poor  boys  or

working  boys, but school boys and boys of parents

who  are  able to contribute a fair share  to  the

expense  of running such clubs. I feel that  until

we  could  prove to the Social Welfare  Department

that a boys' or a girls' club caters only for poor

boys  and working boys and not for boys and  girls

whose parents could contribute to the expenses  of

the   club,   we  are  not  justified  in   asking

Government to spend public money for the  purposes

of such clubs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other thing which the Member for Serangoon

has forgotten is this. A request has been made  to

the  Social  Welfare Department to supply  several

club leaders one of whom should be in charge of  a

number  of  clubs  to  assist  in  their  running,

instead of each club employing a half-baked leader

to look after its welfare.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, youth

welfare  is,  of course, in the forefront  in  the

Government's social welfare programme, and  I  can

assure the Member for Serangoon that the points he

has  raised  will be looked into by me personally.

The  $40,000 vote in the Estimates, Sir, is to  be

regarded   as  a  standstill  vote,  pending   the

creation of standard formulae for grants which are

now under consideration, largely as the result  of

a  visit of an expert on youth service. The amount

necessary will, of course, depend on the number of

new  clubs formed. Government has no control  over

this.  The  formation of clubs is spontaneous  and

should be so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been pointed out by Mr R.C. H. Lim, the

Social  Welfare Department provides youth or  club

leaders in the form of five Youth Service Officers

and  four  Assistant  Youth  Service  Officers  to

assist  in  the  running of the  boys'  clubs.  In

addition,  Sir, under the Head: Contributions  and

Charitable   Allowances,  the   Government   gives

financial  assistance to the Girls' Life  Brigade,

the   Boy  Scouts  Association,  the  Girl  Guides

Association  and the Singapore Youth Council.  The

amount has been increased from $11,775 in 1951 to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>



$22,680  in 1956. In addition, Sir, the  Education

Board  gives grants to Boy Scouts and Girl  Guides

to  the  amount  of $11,000, as  can  be  seen  in

Appendix  C,  page 267, sub-head 3  of  the  Draft

Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I confirm what the

Hon. the Minister for Labour and Welfare has just

said,  that the question of assisting boys'  clubs

is   in  the  forefront  in  the  minds  of   the

Ministers,  but  I am sorry that  the  Member  for

Serangoon made a reference to the hawkers  because

I  do  not think they can be considered as  under-privileged  since they have just  built  a  market

costing  nearly  $1  million for  the  hawkers  in

Killiney Road.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, if Mr R.

C. H. Lim refers to all boys from schools as being

privileged, then I think we must differ  a  little

on  that. If you refer to those boys who  ride  in

big  cars and whose parents have salaries of  $500

and  above, yes, I agree that they are, but I  can

assure  you that such boys form a fraction of  one

per cent of the strength of such clubs. If you say

that  there  are a few school boys in such  clubs,

then  I,  as  the President of the  Federation  of

Boys'  Clubs, welcome them. I welcome them because

they  are material which can be made to lead other

boys  who  are not as good when compared  to  them

educationally  or otherwise. A few  educated  boys

coming into boys' clubs and mixing with the  other

boys   is   certainly  a  good  way  of  promoting

understanding between their different stations  in

life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would like to make is that the

Hon. the  Minister  for Labour  and  Welfare  has

stated  that he has increased the number of  Youth

Service Officers. This should be the case and  the

number should be further increased. It is not just

because  you  have  increased your  Youth  Service

Officers  that  you  have discharged  your  duties

towards  the under-privileged people,  the  people

whom  you say you will take care of; but  I  think

you  will  have rendered them a direct service  if

you  work  among them, lead them, help  them  with

money and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>



create  for  them a contented feeling that,  after

all, the Government is trying to do something  for

them.  They do get a little kick out of  it.  Then

you  can afford to be somewhat complacent. But if,

with   the  present  lot  of  youths  all  looking

enviously  at  everyone else, and you  do  not  do

something  about  it and quickly enough,  you  are

going  to  run into great danger. The danger  will

not  be faced by you. It will be faced by probably

your  successors because these are the people  who

will be the citizens of tomorrow.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, there has

been  no suggestion in my speech that, because  of

the  presence of the nine Youth Service  Officers,

the  Government will not increase the grant to the

youth organisations. I have already explained that

the  $40,000 in the Estimates is a standstill vote

pending the creation of standard formulae, and  as

soon as these are ready, Government will then give

consideration to additional grants  if  these  are

necessary.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I would

like  to  assure the Member for Serangoon that  he

has my sympathy and support whenever he is able to

prove  to Government that the clubs which are  now

requiring financial support from the Government do

not  have  boys or girls whose parents  could  contribute  towards the expenses of such  clubs,  and

with  the  assurance  and  the  attitude  of   the

Minister as expressed today, I am sure that if the

Member  for  Serangoon  could  produce  sufficient

evidence, the grants might be increased.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> On a matter of guidance, Mr

Chairman,  Sir. If the circumstances indicated  by

the  Member  for  Serangoon as a  motive  for  his

motion  is  by  way  of  a  protest  against   the

inadequacy of the provision, and there is not  the

appropriate procedure for such a motion,  then  it

should  be  withdrawn at the  end  of  the  debate

rather than put to the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That depends, of course, entirely

on the hon. Member whether he is satisfied.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I register this

dissatisfaction  and  will not  withdraw  it,  not

because  we want to have a vote taken  on  it  but

because  I  want  to  put on record  that  such  a

protest has been launched. That is all.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps I did not explain myself

very  clearly. The protest has been launched.  The

hon. Member's motion will appear in the Votes  and

Proceedings and in the Official Report but  if  he

wants a vote taken, then, of course, a vote can be

taken.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I would not want to take a

vote. I want to move this motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Chairman. Sir, it is a

revelation  to  me  how  some  of  the  Government

Ministers have lost touch with the common  people.

For  the Hon. the Minister for Health to say  that

hawkers  are  no  longer an underprivileged  class

because of the building of a hawkers' shed costing

$1� million  in Killiney Road is a very astounding

statement for me to hear. I think he has now  lost

touch  with  the  poor people since  he  has  been

elevated  to  his position. This  market  was  not

built  by  the hawkers. The hawkers got people  to

come and help finance them to build it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

I  wish  to  mention to the Hon. the Minister  for

Labour  and Welfare one important point  regarding

the  youth organisations - the so-called boys' clubs

and  the  Youth Council. We have noted  that  most

members  of  these two organisations are  English-speaking  school  boys. I think  that  is  a  very

serious  matter  which needs consideration  and  I

hope  we can change that in the Youth Council  and

the  boys'  clubs.  If  I am  not  mistaken,  many

Chinese  school  boys and girls, according  to  my

personal   experience,  are  taking  very   little

interest in these youth organisations. Sir, I wish

the  President  of the Federation of  Boys'  Clubs

would give me an actual number of how many of  the

members   of  these  organisations  are   Chinese-speaking,  how  many  English-speaking,  how  many

Malay, how many Tamil -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order. The time has

elapsed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $9,282,580 for Head 56 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 57 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Lazarous -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $2,750 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 2 (4), Transport and

Travelling, on page 231 of the Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir, when I gave notice of my amendment, I was

under the impression that the money allotted under

this Head was to be used during the current year,

but after having listened to the Hon. the

Financial Secretary, I am satisfied that this

amount will be properly controlled. So I propose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member is not proposing the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $132,960 for Head 57 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 58 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $10 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 15, Telecommunications

Services, on page 234 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move this motion mainly because I do not

know  for  what purpose that large sum of $903,520

is to be used. I believe, Sir, that quite a number

of  motions like the next motion that will come up

will  also  be  for  the  same  reasons.  This  is

because,   Sir,  we  do  not  have  an   Estimates

Committee.  In  the Standing Orders  Committee  of

which  I am a Member, I remember that we submitted

a Report to this House recommending the setting up

of  an  Estimates Committee and if a Minister  had

taken  this  matter  up  with  the  House  and  an

Estimates  Committee had been set up, there  would

not have been this necessity of moving a motion in

order  to  find out the reason why large  sums  of

money with no breakdown figures



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>



are  being  voted,  or why such  expenditures  are

being allocated apparently for no reason.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I do sympathise

very  much with the hon. Member because  it  is  a

confusing thing. I wished to get up just  now  but

you  would not allow me to tell him that. In fact,

the  two  amendments which he is moving do concern

precisely  the same thing although  it  cannot  be

shown in the Estimates in the present form.  I  do

not  know myself how it could be shown at all but,

anyhow,  I  will start now to try and explain  the

situation. It is rather a complex one in a sort of

arithmetical way, and if you cannot understand  my

explanation, then I will leave it to the Hon. the

Financial Secretary who can, no doubt, give it  to

you still more clearly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation, broadly, is that telecommunication

services are an essential part of the Regional Air

Traffic Control Centre, which is necessary for  an

international  airport,  and  the  problem   which

particularly puzzles the hon. Member is  that  the

costs  under  the  Regional  Air  Traffic  Control

Centre  are  apportionable amongst the Governments

of  the  Federation, the Bornean territories,  and

Singapore.     The     total    expenditure     on

telecommunications for the Airport is broken  down

into  two-thirds  for  the  Regional  Air  Traffic

Control  Centre  and one-third for  the  Singapore

Airport.  The one-third for the Singapore  Airport

is  payable by Singapore. The two-thirds  for  the

Regional    Air   Traffic   Control   Centre    is

apportionable. The basis of apportionment  is  one

of  those  terribly confusing formulae  which  are

arrived  at  when you have Committees  meeting  on

these  things, and each Government  is  trying  to

find  some  means  of  sorting  out  what  is   an

acceptable  way of charging the costs amongst  one

another.  They  are on the basis  of  landing  and

housing fees in each territory. Singapore's  share

comes  to  approximately 45 per cent of the  total

cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I am not sure if that solves your difficulty

or whether you want me



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>



to  go  into  the  details of  what  services  are

provided and that kind of thing. Would you like me -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> A little, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> - to continue?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the hon. Member addressing the Chair?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr Chairman.

Well, let us see. I think this will do quite well.

I  think  this is what you want. You have  a  good

many  aeroplanes  coming  into  the  international

Airport.  You  have,  in  fact,  three  aerodromes

parallel  with one another, and aeroplanes  coming

into  all of them. A large part of the air traffic

is  military, which must fly in a military type of

way.  In  fact,  if you have got to  make  an  air

strike  in Johore, the Airport authorities  cannot

say, "We are going to delay the air strike because

we  expect an airliner to arrive at about the same

time as you want to make the air strike." Military

aircraft therefore have to be able to take off and

come  down whenever they want to. You need to have

special navigational aids which can assist a civil

aircraft as it approaches the aerodrome and  bring

it  straight  on its own proper safety  line  with

beacons and that sort of thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the items provided for the safety of

aircraft  in  flight  are  five  long-range  radio

circuits to other airports in South-East Asia  and

Australia-Sydney, Ceylon, Bangkok,  Djakarta,  and

Borneo. Then we have the long-distance radio and a

telephone service to aircraft in flight up to  500

miles or more from Singapore. Then there are short-range  radio services operating from the Singapore

Airport  Control  Tower which controls  the  local

flying  of  aircraft  as  they  come  on  to   the

airstrip.  There  is also the maintenance  of  air

radio  beacons which are the equivalent, from  the

air navigator's point of view, of a lighthouse  on

an  island  when a ship is coming  over  the  sea.

These  beacons are picked up by an aeroplane which

follows  the beacons till it touches down  on  the

ground. Then there is a miscellaneous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>



local   link  in  radio  communication  which   is

necessary  to  ensure  effective  ground   liaison

between  the airports. I hope that is a sufficient

picture of the network. The costs are fairly high,

but if you want an international airport, you have

to   have   the   equipment  which   international

operators   expect  and  which  is  necessary   by

international civil aviation standards.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, references

have  been  made  to the absence of  an  Estimates

Committee by you and also by other Members on  the

other side -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the hon. Member talking on this

question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> On this question, Sir, because

I have to reply to that point, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Carry on, Mr Lim Yew Hock.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Thank you. The Member for

Serangoon  has mentioned that the Standing  Orders

Committee  has recommended the appointment  of  an

Estimates  Committee. I would like to inform  this

House  that  the Committee's recommendations  have

been  accepted by the Government but it  was  felt

that  we  should only move a motion to  adopt  the

recommendation at the next session of the Assembly

because  the  proposal is to appoint an  Estimates

Committee  at the beginning of each session.  That

is  why  I did not table a motion and I am waiting

until the next session to do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, just on a

point   of  information.  May  we  know  at   what

particular hour today this decision was reached to

have the Estimates Committee?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, although

I have listened to a most interesting discourse, I

view  it as a waste of time, the reason being that

had there been an Estimates Committee we would not

have been wasting our time here. I feel that there

is no point in going on with my two motions and  I

ask leave to withdraw them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Have I the assent of the Assembly

that  the  amendment  moved  by  the  Member   for

Serangoon be withdrawn?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Lim Choon Mong -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $10 the sum to be allotted in

respect  of  sub-head  21, Telecommunications,  on

page 237 of the Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 59 -



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I beg to move an

amendment,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $10 the sum to be allotted in

respect  of sub-head 7, Upper Air Observatory,  on

page 238 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to make a long flight into the

stratosphere,  and, in moving  this  amendment,  I

wish  to enquire whether it is fully necessary  to

embark  on  this project during the  coming  year.

There  are  so many pressing priorities  requiring

larger  and  larger sums of money  in  the  social

services, and I wish to be assured whether  "Upper

Air Observatory" is a priority and not a secondary

requirement,  seeing that it involves  expenditure

amounting to something like $70,000. Fair  weather

for  this  island is what we all want,  but  after

sitting  in  this House for the last few  days,  I

wonder whether we shall not find it by keeping our

feet on the ground rather than having our heads in

the  clouds. I shall be grateful for enlightenment

from  the Hon. Minister as to whether this  is  an

absolutely essential provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Here again, it is highly technical in

its  way  but  the  basic principle  is  extremely

simple.  This is not a new project. It started  in

1951  and we are coming to the end of the Colonial

Development  and Welfare grant which has  provided

an  Upper Air Investigation Programme - I think  you

can   call  it  that - and  the  programme,   having

exhausted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>



the  Colonial Development grant, now has  to  come

down to public funds if we want to continue it. If

you  do  not want a flight into the stratosphere - I

am afraid you will get it if you ask for it - I need

only   say   that   it   does  provide   essential

information  about  the winds at  high  altitudes,

about  temperature, humidity, the  probability  of

precipitation of rain and so forth, which  factors

are of extreme importance if you are going to have

high-flying  international  aircraft  coming  into

Singapore. They are also of considerable relevance

for  forecasting weather on the ground as well and

are aspects of the meteorological service which we

are anxious to extend and improve.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am sure the hon.

Member  has done his homework and, in view of  his

explanation, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Have I the leave of the Assembly

that this amendment be withdrawn?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $999,480 for Head 59 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 60 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $16,560 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 1 (2), Controller of Posts, on

page 241 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, this increase is the result of

an intention to double the number of Controller of

Posts.   I   would,  with  your  indulgence,   Mr

Chairman,  touch upon the other item  to  which  I

shall be moving an amendment relating to Assistant

Controllers of Posts where there is an increase of

two,  one approved in 1955. Mr Chairman,  I  have

broken down -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please. That is one of the

items  which  have  been marked  as  objectionable

under  the  Standing Orders. Can the  hon.  Member

explain fully?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the

explanation for that is this. In respect  of  that

amendment, I am entitled to attack the increase of

one, as one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>



was  approved in 1955, and I am entitled  to  take

the point in this session.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I see. Carry on, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I have here a simple table of

the   figures  for  Division  I  appointments   as

compared   to  the  Divisions  II,  III   and   IV

appointments ranging over the years 1947 to  1955.

This table shows an increase of 66 per cent on the

1947 figures in Division I appointments and 20 per

cent   increase  in  Divisions  II,  III  and   IV

appointments:

<br><br>The  figures show an increase in Division I  posts

of  66.6  per cent as against an increase of  20.6

per cent in Divisions II, III and IV appointments.

According  to  these figures, unless,  of  course,

there  is a subtle explanation of which this House

is  unaware,  the Establishment shows  a  definite

tendency  for  the Department to become  top-heavy

with Division I officers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Let us have the 1947 figures



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> 1947 is 7 to 703 by which, of

course, you meant one is a leave reserve filled at

that  time in Kuala Lumpur. I think the difficulty

is  that  you have probably overlooked  the  leave

reserve and thus got a rather discrepant figure -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member is still

addressing the Chair, is he not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I do apologise, Mr Chairman. We are

so informal sometimes that I get a little confused -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> That is the trouble with some -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Now, I apologise again, Mr

Chairman,  but  in the process of  checking  these

figures  with  great interest, I missed  the  main

point  of what the Member had to say, and he  will

have to repeat it if he wants an answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, that is the

tendency  of  those  who  come  here  in  informal

clothes and informal shoes!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Oh, stop sneering!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> We know you are -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I find it very difficult to

understand -

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I find it impossible!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - how one can carry on a very

serious debate when one loses one's temper,  which

I   think   is  always  a  bad  thing  under   any

circumstances. What I wanted to point out  to  the

Minister for Communications and Works is that  the

increase in Division I appointments is roughly  66

per  cent as against the increase of 20.6 per cent

in Divisions II, III and IV appointments. In other

words,  what  it means is that compared  with  the

1947  figure - assuming that 1947 was  a  year  in

which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>



there  was  an  efficient  working  unit  in   the

Postmaster-General's Department - it shows that the

Department is now getting top-heavy with  Division

I appointments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I do sympathise with the

difficulties of the Member for Tanjong Pagar.  It

is   a   complicated  thing  to  understand   the

workings  of a very large organisation  like  the Post Office -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Please explain.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I am going to, and I shall explain

all  the  quicker if the Member for Tanjong  Pagar

can  control  both ends of his tongue  which  does

rather  take  up the time of the Assembly  without

getting us much forrader! Now, the point which, in

fact,  we  are discussing, if I take it correctly,

is  the  appointment  of an  extra  Controller  of

Posts.  It  is  an  upper timescale  post,  not  a

superscale post -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I never said it was.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> No, I know the Member did not, Mr

Chairman,  but you probably looked it,  I  do  not

know.  Now,  the  relevant fact  to  this  is  the

existing  situation  and the  situation  which  we

expect  to come. In the beginning of this marathon

debating   contest,  I  did  point  out   to   the

Opposition    that   their   motto   might    very

appropriately  be:  "Those  who  pay  no  heed  to

existing conditions and formulate their criticisms

blindly." Now let us take one point. In the period

during  the last five years, there have been  over

20,000  houses  and flats built in Singapore  and,

averaging  at  five residents per house  or  flat,

which  is  rather low, it gives you  a  figure  of

somewhere over a hundred thousand persons who have

been  rehoused in new areas in one way or another.

This,  in  itself,  is  a very  large  problem  of

reorganisation. When you get population shifts  of

that  size,  you  do need continual  planning  and

readjustment in order to secure that your  letters

do  arrive  without  undue  delay  and  that  your

postmen have an adequate weight to carry on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>



their  beat - not too many letters and not too  few,

but  just  what  is  reasonable  and  correct   by

agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this movement of population

(which  is  continually going on) there  are  also

some  statistical  figures. The  hon.  Member  has

expressed  his  repugnance at being showered  with

statistics - they are too much like  facts  and  too

little  like oratory for him. I would  point  out,

however,  that  the total mail handled  has  risen

from  47  million items in 1947 to  89,300,000  in

1955,  constituting an increase  of  over  80  per

cent.  The savings bank transactions have gone  up

from  167,000 to 305,000, another over 80 per cent

increase;  Money  Orders  issued  and  paid   from

202,000  to 440,000, which is about 117  per  cent

increase;  Postal  Orders  issued  and  paid  from

101,000  to  553,000, a 449 per cent increase.  If

the  hon.  Member wishes to note  them  down,  Mr

Chairman, I will go slowly for him if he wants  to

discuss them later.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Let us have a copy of it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Expenditure has gone up from

$1,700,000 in 1947 to $8,850,000 in 1955.  Revenue

has  gone up from $4,600,000 to $11,550,000 during

the  same period. Profit has been steady the whole

way   at  an  average  of  $2�  millions  a  year;

sometimes  it  is  up and sometimes  it  is  down,

according mainly to how much development goes  on.

Then, of course, the population of Singapore as  a

whole has increased by perhaps 200,000 during this

period, perhaps by a bit more. It is not a  figure

that  is  precisely available. The staff increases

on  the  whole  are not in relation to  the  total

expansion of post office business. Whereas I  have

given you figures of anything from nearly 450  per

cent  increase  down to 82 per  cent  increase  in

postal  business, the actual total staff  increase

is  in  the nature of 32 or 33 per cent, and  hon.

Members will appreciate that this does represent a

very  marked achievement on the managerial  level.

That you could have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>



this  enormous expansion of business with  a  very

moderate  expansion  of staff  is  an  achievement

which  is very greatly to the credit of the senior

officials - locally  domiciled and  expatriate - who

are  running  our very efficient postal  services,

and   if   it   is  necessary  to  maintain   that

efficiency,  then  you should  have  a  thoroughly

adequate and competent managerial level staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other point which I think perhaps I

ought  to take and that is, as the hon. Member,  I

know  for sure, is very well aware, that the  Post

Office  makes  a  very thorough  business  of  its

employer/employee   relationship    which    is

necessarily  a matter that occupies  the  time  of

people  at  the  very  top  level  of  the  postal

services.  If  you  are  to  have  competent   and

responsible  officials  dealing  with  the  rather

lengthy discussions and examinations that  go  on,

and    if   you   are   going   to   ensure   good

employer/employee relationships, then they  cannot

have  adequate  time for dealing with  the  postal

traffic, and this is another new factor which does

reasonably put up a case for the expansion of  the

top-level staff. In my view, if a case  is  to  be

made  out,  it  should be made out  for  a  larger

staff,  because the set-up is expanding  and  will

continue to expand and the staff at the top  level

are very heavily worked. We have development plans

in hand, but they are not yet ready to come before

the House, Mr Chairman. I hope they will be ready

fairly  soon and we will then see whether they  do

call for an urgent increase in staff.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, we are

indebted  to the Hon. Minister for his  exhaustive

explanation  of  how  the  volume  of   work   has

increased  in the Postal Department on account  of

the  increase  in the population and  the  general

increase in the postal matter and people  who  use

the  mails, but we should be obliged if  he  could

explain why he has found it necessary to have  one

more  Controller of Posts and one  more  Assistant

Controller of Posts just to look after the  little

bit  of  work  which is involved in  employer  and

employee  relations. Is he suggesting  that  these

two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>



appointments are going to be filled because of the

commendably  progressive  trend  of  having   good

relations with the employees? Are these  two  just

to deal with employees?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Could the hon. Member reveal whether

he  is commenting on the first amendment or on the

second,   or  whether  he  wishes  to  take   them

together?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> He has commented on both. The Hon.

Minister may comment on both.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> My comment, Mr Chairman, Sir, is

that  the hon. Member, as he very often does, puts

up  a  thing that he has invented himself and then

proposes to shoot it down. I have just given  very

lengthy reasons why further managerial level staff

is  required and he passes it all by, as far as  I

can  understand  him, saying,  "Are  these  people

being  appointed  solely  for  the  employer   and

employee  relationship?" Of course, they are  not.

They  are  employed for the purpose which  I  have

already  outlined at considerable  length.  I  can

outline them again if it is the wish of the House.

I do not think it is very necessary -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Carry on, carry on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I must say that I feel a sort of

pleasant  home-sickness as a schoolmaster  for  my

classroom. As I look at the Opposition and see the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar in the  front  row,  he

reminds  me so much of what you always  get  in  a

classroom.  That is the bright little boy  in  the

front  row, who is always putting up his hand  and

saying:  "Sir, Sir, I know!" He is always bounding

on  to  his toes longing to give and pour out  the

information  he has inside him, and a  student  of

that kind is an awful nuisance in the classroom. I

feel that the hon. Member has taken up rather more

time   than  necessary  with  his  extraordinarily

lengthy irruptions into the debate because -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Is the hon. Member talking

on the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I am just arriving at this point. He

wishes  me  to comment on the Assistant Controller

of Posts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order. The time has

elapsed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $9,570,380 for Head 60 ordered to

stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 61 -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $1,200 the sum to be allotted in

respect of sub-head 1 (2), Deputy Director of

Public Works, Grade D, on page 244 of the

Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, one notices in the Remarks

column  that  the salary is being  revised  from

$1,670  to $1,770. We were informed, when we  were

talking  about the Commissioner-General's  Office,

that  the reason for that increase was because  of

the  Ritson revision which should have taken place

much  earlier. In this particular case, the Ritson

revision  has  taken place recently and  we  would

like to know why, so very shortly after the Ritson

revision,  it  is thought proper to come  to  this

House to ask for a further upgrading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> We can judge, Mr Chairman, the

sincerity  of  feeling  of the  hon.  Member  when

dealing  with these staffing matters by  the  fact

that he is anxious now to object to every possible

post  that he can. He was very much chagrined  and

disturbed and perturbed when he discovered, to his

dismay,  that  he  had actually approved  quite  a

number of the posts which he now sought to attack;

and  it was one of the most unpleasant shocks that

he had ever had -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> There are a few more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> - when he discovered that, here and

there,  scattered through the amendments  standing

in  his  name  where  he proposed  to  attack  the

Government, they were the things to which  he  had

himself assented in earlier Command Papers. It was

also  noticeable that, even during today when  one

of  his amendments was due to come up, he had left

the  room, perhaps to gargle his exhausted throat.

Anyhow, he was not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>



there when he had to discuss the appointment of  a

Deputy Secretary to help in the administration  of

a very important and essential public service -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of order. Mr

Chairman,  Sir, I do not really wish to  deny  the

Hon.  Minister the right to speak at great  length

if  there were time, but I would be obliged if  he

would  come  to  the point because the  number  of

minutes  allotted for this is limited. On a  point

of  order I would ask that he be made to speak  on

the subject.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Did you give way on Monday?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, please. I was just

wondering when the hon. Member was coming  to  the

amendment. I expect he is working up to it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I am indeed, Mr Chairman, indulging

in  what we call a flight of rhetoric, but I  will

do  my best to come to the point. We all recognise

that the Member for Tanjong Pagar does arrogate to

himself  the position of an efficiency expert  who

is  fully confident of assessing the need for  any

job and the emoluments which should be attached to

the  job,  and  I  would like to  satisfy  him  in

respect  of this Deputy Director post.  The  first

thing  I would point out is that this is a  simple

upgrading  which was proposed way  back  in  July,

1954,  and  it simply brings into line the  Deputy

Director of Public Works with two other comparable

Deputy  Directors. I would ask the hon. Member  to

look  at item (2) of sub-head 1 under Head  48  on

page  164 - "Deputy Secretary (Schools and Colleges)

and Deputy Director of Education." Similarly under

Medical  and Health, Head 52, on page  180,  under

"Personal   Emoluments - Headquarters - Division   I,

Deputy  Secretary, Ministry of Health  and  Deputy

Director  of  Medical  Services."  These  are  two

Deputy  Director posts comparable  to  the  Deputy

Director  of Public Works, and it does  seem  very

reasonable and proper that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>



such Deputy Directors should get the same Grade D.

That may, however, not satisfy him. It is a simple

matter  of  equity in which he takes not  a  great

deal of interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other points which might be noted are that,

in  fact, the top-level appointments in the Public

Works  Department are decreasing. If I  can  refer

the  hon.  Member again to the Estimates  he  will

observe that the appointment of the Chief Drainage

Engineer - item  5,  sub-head  1  on   page   244 - is

vanishing  after three months and the  appointment

of  the Superintending Engineer, Grade F, is  also

vanishing after six months. The appointment of the

Chief  Engineer at the Airport has already  gone - a

reduction of three superscale posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the hon. Member has accepted the

principle   that   an  increase   in   work,   and

consequently  an increase in responsibility,  does

justify  an  upgrading. He accepted  that  earlier

this  morning and I would point out  to  him  that

there  has been something in the nature of  a  300

per cent increase in the work of the P.W.D. in the

last  five years and therefore this very  moderate

upgrading is related to a very large expansion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is this expansion since the

Ritson revision?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I really think the hon. Member knows

the  answer to that. I have just pointed out  that

expansion  has gone on over a series of years  and

you  can  pick  out what point you  wish  for  it.

Expansion  continues  and  is  probably  going  to

continue into the future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, are we to

imply that the upgrading is going to go up and  up

into the future?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> This is another example of the

habitual  practice of the leader of  the  People's

Action   Party   of  putting  up  a   preposterous

absurdity and pretending that I have said  it.  He

has  said  it,  nobody else has said  it,  and  he

proposes,  Mr Chairman, that I should somehow  be

made to stand as father to his brainchild - so he is

welcome  to  it!  I propose nothing  more  than  a

simple practical operation, the upgrading of a man

to put him on equality with other similar



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>



Deputy  Directors, and that is related to  a  very

large  expansion  in  the work.  Why  any  further

preposterous suggestions should be attached to it,

I leave it to the Members of the House to judge.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the

explanation   we   have  received   is   to   this

effect - that   the  work  in  the  Department   has

increased and the Deputy Director of Public  Works

has  been brought into line with two other  Deputy

Directors in two other Departments. May I  enquire

from  the  Minister why, when the Ritson  revision

took  place, it was not found necessary to upgrade

this  Deputy Director of Public Works? Why is  it,

in  spite  of his admission that the expansion  of

the  P.W.D. took place before the Ritson revision,

that  it  is  only now found necessary to  upgrade

him?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am afraid I am

not  very clever about Ritsonisation and that kind

of  thing,  but  the  fact is  that  there  is  no

connection between the two. Ritsonisation was done

for  consolidation,  if I understand  it  rightly.

This  is  a simple matter of a man being  given  a

lift  up  in relation to an expansion of work  and

expansion of responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $18,240 the sum to be allotted in

Engineers, Grade G, on page 244 of the Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, we have here in the Remarks
