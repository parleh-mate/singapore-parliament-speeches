The <p align=left>Column: 2842 <p>Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) has a 24-hour crisis hotline 1800-221-4444.&nbsp; Other helplines include those by the Care Corner Mandarin Counselling Centre and Family Service Centres, and their numbers are given out through radio programmes and talks.&nbsp; Those who have psychiatric disorders or depression or are prone to suicide can receive medically appropriate help at the Institute of Mental Health.&nbsp; Those who are bereaved due to suicide often need much support, and those affected can attend a support group called "The Healing Bridge" run by the Samaritans of Singapore.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The annual Suicide Prevention Week by SOS is a commendable community effort to increase understanding of suicidal thoughts and the avenues for help. Last year, the event was supported by my Ministry and the Southeast CDC.&nbsp; The annual event is aimed at bringing prevention messages to the community, so that everyone can be alert to early signs of depression and refer those affected for help.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, some of the efforts are targeted at the young.&nbsp; For example, SOS has&nbsp;implemented an Email Befriending Service to complement their hotline as more young people are now using the Internet.&nbsp; Children can call the Tinklefriend helpline run by Singapore Children's Society.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the IMH, the Child Guidance Clinic and Department of Child and Adolescent&nbsp;Psychiatry provide services for children and adolescents with emotional problems.&nbsp; Recently, my Ministry and the Ministry of Education&nbsp;jointly developed a resource booklet entitled "Children at Risk - A Handbook for Teachers".&nbsp; This handbook informs teachers on how to identify at-risk students and the appropriate interventions.&nbsp; My Ministry is also expanding the STEP-UP programme which enhances the capacity of VWOs in the delivery of school-based social work.&nbsp; This programme, which complements MOE's existing pastoral care system, strengthens <p align=left>Column: 2843 <p>our students' emotional resilience and helps parents and teachers better manage and support our students.&nbsp; MCDS will also work with youth agencies and SOS to enhance programmes and capability to support suicidal youths who are out of school.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the possible reasons for suicides are multi-faceted.&nbsp; Local academics and researchers found that the reasons leading to suicide among young people included interpersonal relationship problems and conflicts, stresses resulting from school or work, financial pressures and mental illness.&nbsp; My Ministry and the other relevant agencies will continue to study the trends and profile of persons who commit suicide and the reasons for suicide.&nbsp; As we have done in the past, we will share pertinent findings with the agencies involved in the&nbsp;prevention and intervention efforts so that all of us can enhance our programmes and services where appropriate.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I want to thank the Minister for giving us the information, but it seems to me that&nbsp;although the programmes which&nbsp;the Minister has mentioned are programmes which are currently in place,&nbsp;the suicide rate among females aged&nbsp;15 to 24 continues to be high.&nbsp; Are there any new intervention programmes that the Ministry can think of?&nbsp; For instance, the intervention programme mentioned between MCDS and MOE on children at risk may not necessarily target the specific group we are concerned, ie, those between&nbsp;15 and 24.&nbsp; Obviously, MCDS, when working with MOE, colleges, polytechnics, secondary schools and universities may have to target the women in these areas.&nbsp; My question is: are there other programmes that the Ministry is thinking of and, specifically,&nbsp;will the Ministry be able to conduct a survey to identify what are the causes, so that we can have more targeted assistance programmes for them?</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

In fact, the Arts enrich the general education of the students and vice versa.&nbsp; The result is that such schools often provide excellent education in both the Arts and other subjects.&nbsp; The Committee proposed that the students of the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Arts</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> would graduate at the end of&nbsp;six years with an IB Diploma. The curriculum in the final&nbsp;two years would be focused on the IB Diploma programme, and the first four&nbsp;years could be structured around the IB Middle-years programme, the GCE 'O' levels or an equivalent.&nbsp; The reference to the Express stream, quoted in the media reports, was made in this context. The demands of the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Arts</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>'s curriculum, at least in the first four years, would be equivalent to that of the Express Stream.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Committee recommended that&nbsp;admission should be based on merit, and emphasis should be given to the artistic potential of the applicants. The proposed selection process should be through auditions, portfolio assessments or entrance examinations. The Committee also recommended that, in addition to artistic potential, students should demonstrate basic academic achievements.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with the Committee's recommendation that entry requirements should include both artistic talent and academic achievement. I believe that the arts training of our young talents should not be at the expense of overall academic training.&nbsp; In fact, arts training and academic learning should be integrated and should reinforce each other.&nbsp; My Ministry will consult the various stakeholders, including teachers, students, parents and arts practitioners, to<p align=left>Column: 2855 <p> establish the entry requirements. We will take into consideration the possibility that there may be students with high artistic potential but are weaker academically.&nbsp; We do not want such students to lose the opportunity to enter the Arts School.&nbsp; For example, if we come across an exceptional youngster like Abigail Sin, but without her academic achievements, the School will certainly strive to accommodate such talent with the clear potential to succeed as a musician.&nbsp; The general approach is to ensure that the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Arts</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> is not perceived as a school for those who cannot do well in other schools.&nbsp;</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Ms Braema Mathiaparanam--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam</B>:&nbsp; I thank the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for his answer.&nbsp; But&nbsp;I am still not so convinced about this aspect of the GCE 'O' levels because&nbsp;Normal (Academic) students are equally capable of getting two GCE 'O' levels.&nbsp; In such cases, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary&nbsp;mentioned about portfolios.&nbsp; If the portfolio is of a higher quality than the academic achievements of the child, what then will be the position of the selection committee?</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Encik Yatiman Yusof--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Encik Yatiman Yusof</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the comparison between the Express stream and the Normal (Academic) stream with a minimum of two GCE 'O' levels is the&nbsp;minimal point.&nbsp; But again, this is the basic consideration that is required before&nbsp;a person is allowed to apply.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Talking about the portfolios,&nbsp;it is a factor&nbsp;to be considered. Some students may not be very bright academically, especially in Mathematics and Science, but in other areas, they are quite strong.&nbsp; But it must be tempered with&nbsp;a balanced academic capability.&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp;a minimum standard will ensure that the Arts School will not be&nbsp;a school for those who could not do well in the academic field because, ultimately, when they qualify later, they could either be professionals, ie, lawyers or&nbsp;doctors, after <p align=left>Column: 2856 <p>pursuing their studies with very deep-rooted feelings and passion for the arts and vice versa.&nbsp; Those who&nbsp;are very strongly inclined towards arts are capable of switching over to find jobs in other fields or professions if they do not succeed in that field.&nbsp; In other words, the Arts School provides the option for them to go to either academic professional line later or in pursuing their passion in arts.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

As to&nbsp;how do we synergise the Arts School with the existing institutions, such as the SIA-LaSalle College of the Arts and the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA), the SIA-LaSalle College and NAFA's intake is offered to those students who have gone through the&nbsp;normal secondary school&nbsp;

In other words, while the permeability of the Arts School students at the secondary level within the first four years is such that they are allowed to go back to the secondary school, those who continue with the Ivy League institutions will have their own paths.&nbsp; This means that they will not be going to LaSalle or NAFA, because the curriculum of LaSalle and NAFA is quite different compared to the Arts School, in the sense that&nbsp;it will prepare&nbsp;its students both in terms of&nbsp;

I think the Committee will also conduct studies in this area.&nbsp; In general, it is always perceived that those who are inclined in sports and arts are less capable in the academic field.&nbsp; This is the perception.&nbsp; It could arise because of the motivation found among the students.&nbsp; But studies in other countries have shown that those who are good academically are also capable to perform in sports as well as in the arts.&nbsp; Yes, we will look into this area to make sure that the School will be able to bring in talented people if they are academically inclined or strong, as well as those who are talented but not so academically inclined.&nbsp;

(b) whether the&nbsp; National Environment Agency's monitoring efforts have led to any conclusion about the health risks arising from such airborne dust and pollutants; and (c) can something be done to reduce the level of such soot and dust.</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Swee Say)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Swee Say):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past few months, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has received several complaints from some residents living in Sembawang New Town in the vicinity of Admiralty Link about black dust deposited in their flats.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investigation conducted by NEA showed that the black dust is generated by grit blasting of ships at Sembawang Shipyard and the dust is carried towards the HDB flats by the north-easterly wind during the north-east monsoon from October to March.&nbsp; The black dust comprises mainly iron and copper particles, and is no more harmful than other particles in the air if present in small quantities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEA had monitored the dust level in the air at the HDB blocks in Admiralty Link and found it to be within international standards. The dust level there therefore does not pose a health risk to the residents.&nbsp; NEA conveyed these findings to the grassroots adviser and leaders in March&nbsp;this year.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The black dust, however, posed a nuisance to the residents. Hence, Sembawang Shipyard has on its part taken measures to reduce dust emissions from its operations. Sembawang Shipyard has installed a water curtain system to wash down dust emissions during blasting of ships. It has also installed a strong suction system to remove dust deposited on the ground of the blasting area. These measures have helped to reduce the level of dust in the air blown to the surrounding area.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:  2863 <p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sembawang Shipyard has also installed two air samplers at the boundary of its premises to monitor dust emission from its blasting operations. This has enabled the shipyard to take prompt actions in the event that dust emission exceeds the acceptable level.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in short, I would like to assure Dr Warren Lee that the dust level in the air in Admiralty Link is within international standards and it does not pose a health risk to the residents there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span><!--MP_NAME:Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The Bill will amend the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act, or the EEI Act in short. &nbsp;It will <p align=left>Column: 2864 <p>give legislative effect to three tax changes which were&nbsp;announced in the 2003 Budget Statement, refine the Pioneer Incentive, as well as remove and merge several existing tax incentives.&nbsp;

The first tax change is the introduction of the Integrated Industrial Capital Allowance, or the IICA in short.&nbsp; Currently, capital allowances are granted only on plant or machinery that is used in a company's own trade or business in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; We recognise that there is a growing trend for corporate groups to base their headquarters, marketing and other high value-added activities in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and have their regional subsidiaries perform other activities like manufacturing.&nbsp; To accommodate this business model, the IICA allows <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> companies to claim capital allowance on equipment such as plant and machinery that is used by their wholly-owned subsidiaries outside <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IICA will offer a seamless tax regime for companies that have manufacturing activities in the region, and encourage them to base their headquarter functions in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, even as they internationalise and tap new markets.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 23 of the Bill inserts a new Part XIIID in the EEI Act, comprising sections 97ZA to 97ZE, to give legislative effect to the IICA.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">R&amp;D and IP Management Hub Scheme</i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second tax change is the introduction of the Research and Development and Intellectual Property Management Hub Scheme, or R&amp;D and IP <p align=left>Column: 2865 <p>Management Hub Scheme in short.&nbsp; The objective is to increase the amount of funds for R&amp;D activities conducted in or controlled from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; These R&amp;D activities will generate a healthy pipeline of intellectual property for commercialisation, contribute to a vibrant IP hub in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> and create economic value for our companies.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under this scheme, an approved Singapore-based company is granted tax exemption for a period of five years for foreign-sourced royalties and interest income that are received in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> and&nbsp; channelled to R&amp;D activities.&nbsp; At least 20% of the&nbsp; foreign-sourced income remitted to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>&nbsp; must be expended on R&amp;D activities conducted in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and all the resulting intellectual property of these R&amp;D projects shall be owned and commercialised in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> by the approved company.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scheme encourages companies to fund and conduct their R&amp;D activities in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, as well as manage and exploit the IP rights here. This creates a sustainable cycle that reinforces both IP management and R&amp;D activities in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 24 of the Bill inserts a new Part XIIIE in the EEI Act, comprising sections 97ZF to 97ZJ, to give legislative effect to the R&amp;D and IP Management Hub Scheme.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Overseas Investment Incentive</i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third tax change is the revision to the Overseas Investment Incentive, or the OII in short.&nbsp; Currently, the OII allows an approved <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> company to deduct losses arising from the sale of shares or liquidation of an approved overseas investment against its income.&nbsp; The criteria for the scheme are stringent, given that the Government in effect underwrites<p align=left>Column: 2866 <p> part of the investment.&nbsp; This has resulted in low take-up and approval rates.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To enhance the relevance of the OII and encourage more companies to expand overseas, the scheme has now been revised to allow an eligible holding company to defer its tax payments (arising from its profitable operations in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>) for two years, if its approved overseas investment incurs operating losses during the first three years of the investment.&nbsp; The deferred payment is proportionate to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> tax impact of the overseas losses.&nbsp; This helps to provide temporary cash-flow relief when overseas ventures incur initial losses.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 25 of the Bill inserts a new Part XIIIF in the EEI Act, comprising sections 97ZK to 97ZO, to give legislative effect to the revised OII.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Refinements to the Pioneer Incentive&nbsp;</i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will now touch on the proposed refinements to the Pioneer Incentive to provide greater flexibility in the award of this incentive, as follows:</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to allow Pioneer Incentives to be awarded for a period of less than five years and up to a period of 10 years;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to allow pioneer companies to undertake non-pioneer activities without prior approval of the Minister; and</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, to delegate the authority from the Minister to the Comptroller of Income Tax to adjust the profit margin criterion of non-pioneer trade downwards in certain circumstances.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These changes are reflected in clauses 3 to 5 of the Bill.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Repeal of tax incentives</i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, it is proposed that&nbsp; two obsolete tax incentives be scrapped, while&nbsp; seven <p align=left>Column: 2867 <p>overlapping incentives be streamlined and combined with other schemes.&nbsp; Thus, a total of nine tax incentives will be repealed.&nbsp; There are only a small number of existing companies on these schemes and they will be allowed to complete their current incentive period.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clauses 8, 13, 17 and 21 of the Bill amend the EEI Act to provide for these changes.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Consequential amendments</i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, as a result of the various changes to the tax incentives, consequential amendments will be made to the relevant sections of the EEI Act.&nbsp; These amendments provide for the following:</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, deletion of the definition of terms relating to the discontinued tax incentives (ie, clauses 2, 10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20 and 28 of the Bill); and</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, allowing tax incentives awarded before the new amendments to continue to have effect (ie, clause 29 of the Bill).</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequential amendments will also be made to the EEI Act arising from changes to the Income Tax Act.&nbsp; These are to provide for the removal of the tax treatment that deems certain dividends as interest and expanding the definition of&nbsp; "concessionary income" under the provisions governing investment allowances.&nbsp; Clauses 6, 11, 18 and 22 of the Bill amend the relevant sections of the EEI Act to provide for these changes.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Conclusion</i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

At present, the Government grants Singapore Pools, a company under Temasek Holdings, the right to conduct 4D, <st1:place><st1:City>Toto</st1:City>, <st1:country-region>Singapore</st1:country-region></st1:place> Sweep and football betting.&nbsp; The Singapore Totalisator Board, on the other hand, operates 4D and betting on horse races.&nbsp; Both Singapore Pools and the Totalisator Board each separately manage the donation of the surpluses that they generate from their gaming operations.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Finance proposes to have the Totalisator Board acquire Singapore Pools, with the Board then holding the right to operate all legalised gaming activities in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2869 <p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be no change to the donation outreach and commitments arising from the Totalisator Board's acquisition of Singapore Pools.&nbsp; The Totalisator Board will honour all of Singapore Pools' ongoing donation commitments.&nbsp; In fact, the merger will bring together the donation approaches of both organisations for more holistic results.&nbsp; The Board will employ both a "wholesale" and "retail" approach towards disbursements of donations.&nbsp; For the "wholesale" approach, the Board will work with partner organisations, such as our universities, the National Medical Research Council, the Singapore Symphony Orchestra and our community centres, to disburse donations towards strategic areas, such as the promotion of education, health, the arts and community development.&nbsp; The Totalisator Board will at the same time take a "retail" approach to disburse donations directly to smaller organisations and individuals serving unmet needs within the community.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Turf Club, on the other hand, will stop operating 4D.&nbsp; It will instead concentrate on horse racing and totalisator operations.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the main provisions of the Bill.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the Bill will allow the Totalisator Board to conduct football betting operations and all lotteries.&nbsp; At present, the Singapore Totalisator Board Act allows the Totalisator Board to carry out only 4D and totalisator operations in relation to horse racing, but not other lotteries or football betting.&nbsp; Clause 4(1) of the Bill allows the Board to operate any<p align=left>Column: 2870 <p>gaming or betting activities as prescribed by the Minister for Finance.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the Totalisator Board Act currently only allows the Board to form companies but not to acquire companies.&nbsp; Clause 5(1) of the Bill provides the Board with the power to acquire companies as well.&nbsp; This will enable the Board to acquire Singapore Pools.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, clause 6 of the Bill will expand the size of the Board of Directors from a maximum of seven members to 12 members, including the Chairman.&nbsp; This will enable the Board to better carry out its new functions.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I would like to propose consequential amendments to the Betting Act.&nbsp; The Betting Act, as it now stands, allows the Minister for Home Affairs to exempt only racing clubs or associations from the Act.&nbsp; The consequential amendments to the Betting Act will give the Minister for Home Affairs the power to exempt persons and organisations other than the Singapore Turf Club from the Act.&nbsp; This will allow the Totalisator Board and its operating agents which carry out legalised gaming to be exempted from the provisions of the Betting Act.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This should be lauded for the efficiency gains arising from the streamlining of operations.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gaming taxes are major contributions to public funds.&nbsp; Yet, even after generous payouts to winning bets, and accounting for the 12% betting taxes imposed, plus operating costs, Tote Board and Pools still<p align=left>Column: 2871 <p> have sizeable pools of funds that over the years have been distributed for many worthy causes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These include the construction of The Esplanade through a mechanism of public finance, famously described by a very&nbsp;senior ex-civil servant as "ingenious", the granting of computer loans to students and the promotion of sports, arts and culture.&nbsp;

I understand that these are the sectors which the Tote Board has traditionally supported.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore Pools has, on the other hand, mainly donated to causes in the areas of sports, charity and community service.&nbsp; The beneficiaries include charities under the banner of the National Council of Social Services,&nbsp;Community Chest,&nbsp;NKF, Kidney Dialysis Foundation, Singapore Red Cross Society, Home Nursing Foundation, National Council Against Drug Abuse, Singapore Hospice Council and Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.&nbsp; Since its inception in 1968, Singapore Pools has contributed more than $1 billion to such causes.&nbsp; And in the fiscal year 2001 and 2002, Singapore Pools' community funding amounted to $147 million.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The task of allocating these substantial funds rests with the two respective boards.&nbsp; Under the new regime envisaged in the Amendment Bill, the Tote Board will be enlarged to 12 members, including the Chairman, in order to oversee the larger scope of operations and more sizeable pool of money.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with the impending transfer of Singapore Pools to the Tote Board, I understand that there is disquiet in some quarters, especially among the beneficiaries of Singapore Pools, particularly the smaller organisations that funding for their causes may be adversely affected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2872 <p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, they are concerned that with the transfer, there could be a change in donation policy to the detriment of the smaller recipients, much like what is construed to be the fate of some smaller customers after the DBS-POSB bank merger.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I note that the MOF, through its press release in February 2004, has sought to give some reassurance to the beneficiaries that, even after the transfer, all operations of the Tote Board,&nbsp;Singapore Turb Club and Singapore Pools will continue as usual.&nbsp; Specifically, donations that Singapore Pools has agreed to make will not be affected by the transfer of the company to the Tote Board.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I also note that the Minister has reiterated this point earlier.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I would like to ask the Minister again to reassure these beneficiaries, for which Singapore Pools' donation forms an essential lifeline, that the Tote Board will continue to donate its excess funds to worthy causes, which must surely include the charities which help the intellectually disabled, the dependent elderly, the homeless, children in care, the needy and the disadvantaged.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, Sir, while the Tote Board is audited and the members are honourable and successful individuals appointed by the Minister for Finance, there is no means for the public to know if the allocation goes to the most needy or worthiest causes during any one financial year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like an insight into how the Board actually decides on its distribution policy.&nbsp; Is there, for example, the equivalent of a health care "means test" that we have heard so much about?&nbsp; This could help to allay concerns, particularly of the smaller charities that they may be nudged out of the competition for limited charity dollars as a result of their lower public profile.&nbsp; Is there also a reserves policy evaluated by<p align=left>Column: 2873 <p> the Board, a question especially pertinent in the light of the issues raised by the recent NKF episode?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, with efficiency gains accruing from integration, I would like to ask the Minister if the merged entity would provide every greater support for causes in the sports, arts, culture, charity, community and so on, and not just simply rationalise the combined network.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, beyond this, I am tempted to engage in the delicious speculation that the bringing of the Singapore Pools under the Tote Board is a precursor to the Government eventually operating or, at least, taking a stake in the much-discussed proposed casino itself, should the decision be made to proceed with the project.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am happy to leave this as a hunch that requires no direct answer from the Minister.&nbsp; But I venture to add that, if this is indeed the intention, then it could well address some of the public concerns voiced over the moral and social consequences of having a casino in Singapore, even if it is physically offshore.&nbsp; However, a lingering concern here would then be if the Tote Board has the necessary expertise to pursue this project properly and effectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with this, I support the amendments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Ng Ser Miang (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ng Ser Miang (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Speaker,&nbsp;I heard from Dr Amy Khor that, since its inception of Singapore Pools in 1968, it had contributed more than a billion dollars from its surpluses to the development of arts, sports and community projects.&nbsp; Two of its most notable contributions being the $409 million over seven years for the Esplanade project and the $375 million over five years towards Sporting Singapore.&nbsp; It has<p align=left>Column: 2874 <p> also&nbsp;directly and indirectly contributed and supported many sports and National Sports Associations.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years, Singapore &nbsp;Pools has become a strong supporter and partner of sports development in Singapore.&nbsp; Without the funding of Singapore Pools, it would not have been possible for the Singapore Sports Council and the National Sports Associations to implement many of their plans, and sports in Singapore would not be where it is today.&nbsp; Singapore and Singaporeans would have been poorer for it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the funding of the Singapore Pools, the hard work put in by our National Sports Associations and the dedication and sacrifices of our athletes, we are now seeing more and more outstanding performances and international successes from our athletes in many sports, such as table tennis, badminton, sailing, bowling, swimming, just to mention a few of them.&nbsp; The most recent case being Ronald Susilo winning the Japan Open Badminton Championship, a five star event and critical match before the Olympic games in Athens in August this year.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore Pools has also been a true supporter of the Singapore National Olympic Council, funding the participation of athletes for the various SEA Games, Asian Games, Commonwealth Games and the Olympic Games.&nbsp; It has also generously supported the cash award for our medal winners at these major games.&nbsp; The cash award serves both as a recognition and motivation to our athletes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I cannot over emphasise the importance of funding provided by the Singapore Pools to sports.&nbsp; I hope that the Singapore Pools, or the Tote Board in this case, will continue to serve the social objectives and especially support of sports after the Singapore Pools has been acquired by the Totalisator Board.&nbsp; In fact,<p align=left>Column: 2875 <p> I believe that the acquisition of the Singapore Pools by the Totalisator Board would create synergy and therefore more surpluses, and in which case, I would like to do a Oliver Twist and ask for more, ie,&nbsp;more funding for sports.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I would like to thank both Members for their support of this Bill.&nbsp; And I would also like to reiterate what I said earlier that there would be no change in the donation outreach and commitments arising from this merger of the Totalisator Board and the Singapore Pools.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we are trying to achieve in this exercise is, first, to make the operations more efficient because there is some overlap in the 4D operations by the Singapore Tote Board and the 4D operations by the Singapore Pools.&nbsp; So by combining these two, I think we will run a better and more efficient operation.&nbsp; Second, we want to achieve a holistic approach to the donation of the surpluses even though in the past, we had segmentised the areas by which the Singapore Tote Board would support the other areas where the Singapore Pools would support.&nbsp; Even though we segmentised them, there is still some overlap, particularly in the charitable and community development sectors.&nbsp; With this merger, the Board can take an overall view and allocate the funds more efficiently and more optimally to areas worthy of their support.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the merger takes place, I can assure Members that the priorities currently given by both entities will remain and this rationalisation or holistic approach would be taken over a longer timeframe.&nbsp; In particular, I would like to assure the smaller charities that they will not be left out.&nbsp; They will continue to be strongly supported by the Tote Board and also the sporting community.&nbsp; Last year, <p align=left>Column: 2876 <p>for example, the overall sporting community received something to the tune of $120 million from the Singapore Pools.&nbsp; This is a very significant amount.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the Tote Board will continue to support the sporting community in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just explain, as Dr Amy Khor asked, how the Board intends to allocate its funds.&nbsp; As I explained in my speech, the Board does so through a wholesale approach as well as a retail approach.&nbsp; By wholesale approach, what I mean is that they allocate a sizeable quantum to an overall agency, say, for example, the National Medical Research Council and then allow the National Medical Research Council to&nbsp;sub-allocate the funds to the research projects that are most worthy.&nbsp; This is because the Tote Board does not see itself having the capability to differentiate the medical research projects&nbsp;and, therefore, they work through an intermediary agency, like the NMRC.&nbsp; Similarly, for the sports community, they adopt both the wholesale and the retail approach.&nbsp; They fund the Singapore sporting funds.&nbsp; They also fund individual National Sports Associations.&nbsp; So they do both on a wholesale approach through the bigger organisations as well as a retail approach through the individual organisations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the charity and&nbsp;community development, the Board would have to take a more retail approach rather than a wholesale approach.&nbsp; And this, the Singapore Pools&nbsp;has done so in the past and intends to adopt this same aproach.&nbsp; For example, last year, there were more than 1,000 applications from all the small organisations.&nbsp; The Singapore Pools would have to evaluate these and make its judgement on who to support.&nbsp; Of course, they cannot support all 1,000 applications.&nbsp; What they do is they form small sub-committees with expertise in the various areas, whether it is community development, charity or <p align=left>Column: 2877 <p>sports, which would then evaluate these proposals and allocate the donations accordingly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor asked whether this merger is a precursor to the Tote Board operating the casino.&nbsp; She does not want to speculate and she does not expect an answer from me.&nbsp; So I shall leave it at that.&nbsp; But my own personal view is that the casino ought to be run by a private operator.&nbsp; So I think the Tote Board would be running the current operations and there is no intention, for the time being, to expand its operations.&nbsp; Whether we have a casino or not, it is still subject to&nbsp;evaluation by the Ministry of Trade and Industry.&nbsp; So I think we just have&nbsp;to&nbsp;wait&nbsp;six or nine months for that study to be completed before letting our imagination run wild.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me, again, reassure all beneficiaries of the Singapore Tote Board and the Singapore Pools that they will continue to be supported by this new merged entity.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

So this is quite a significant sum.&nbsp; And they approach this donation by first making general allocations to the various areas which they are supporting, for example, the arts, health, education, sports, charity and community.&nbsp; So there&nbsp;are general allocations out of the $300 million, and <p align=left>Column: 2878 <p>where are the areas that they would support.&nbsp; And having made these general allocations by the various sectors,&nbsp;they either go through an intermediary, as I said just now, which is the wholesale approach, say, for example, in health.&nbsp; If they want to support, say, $10 million in health research,&nbsp;their approach is to go through the National Medical Research Council rather than inviting research applications and then making a decision.&nbsp; So they go through the intermediary.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the charity,&nbsp;the community development and the sports, they work through&nbsp;both the wholesale and the retail approach.&nbsp;

Singapore enjoys a peaceful and productive industrial climate that is the envy of many nations.&nbsp; We have not had a strike since 1986.&nbsp; The state of our industrial relations is a key competitive advantage that attracts investments and businesses into Singapore.&nbsp; Our unions, <p align=left>Column: 2880 <p>principally led by the NTUC, and employer organisations, together with the Government, are equal social partners in the spirit of tripartism that work together for the common good and prosperity of this country.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But particularly because we have had industrial peace for so long, some may mistakenly take these relations for granted, and assume that this state of affairs is the natural order of things.&nbsp; Nothing could be further from the truth.&nbsp; We have achieved industrial harmony not by change, but by choice, hard work and constant tending to the ground.&nbsp; All three social partners interact constantly and often accommodate the other partners' concerns to achieve the greater good.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We did not inherit these virtuous conditions.&nbsp; Indeed, industrial relations in Singapore in the 1950s and early 60s were adversarial and confrontational.&nbsp; Frequent work stoppages, a lack of discipline and teamwork resulted in a poor investment climate, economic stagnation, high unemployment and social unrest.&nbsp; When independence was thrust upon us in 1965, and faced with dire economic conditions aggravated by the withdrawal of the British forces, the crucial challenge then was to move away from the adversarial labour-management relations to a cooperative one, and to develop a disciplined, motivated and productive workforce as part of the national effort to create a favourable environment for investment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To achieve this objective, the existing legal framework was overhauled by introducing a rational framework for collective bargaining, conciliation and arbitration of industrial disputes, and also by establishing basic employment terms for employees.&nbsp; More importantly, the three social partners, ie, the employers, trade unions and the Government, realised that, for the industrialisation programme to succeed, confrontation had to be replaced by cooperation and collaboration.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2881 <p> They, therefore, decided to adopt a tripartite partnership approach, with the Government as a facilitator, to bring about labour-management cooperation.&nbsp; A new spirit of tripartism unique to Singapore was thus born.&nbsp; This provided a consultative platform for industrial relations issues to be addressed and resolved amicably, and laid the foundation for the development of a disciplined and productive workforce.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This special bond between the three partners spurred growth, created job and raised standards of living for all.&nbsp; We should vigorously guard this framework and be alert to practices that can, over time, if left unchecked, undermine our labour relations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is with this caveat that I put to the House today the Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill.&nbsp; While amending this Act, let me reiterate the Government's commitment to preserve the rights of workers&nbsp;and the unions that represent them to voice their concerns, bargain collectively and to seek redress.&nbsp; This Bill seeks to amend the Trade Unions Act to confer on the officers of a trade union and any other persons appointed by the trade union to represent its members in collective bargaining the authority to bind all the members by the collective agreement reached through negotiation with the management without the need for ratification by the members.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me elaborate on our reasons for proposing this amendment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ratification clause exists only in the constitution of one union in Singapore - the Airlines Pilots Association of Singapore (Alpa-S).&nbsp; In 1999, Alpa-S was restructuring to accommodate members from subsidiaries of SIA, such as Silkair.&nbsp; Alpa-S took the opportunity to introduce a clause into its constitution which required <p align=left>Column: 2882 <p>collective agreements (CAs) to be ratified by members.&nbsp; Ostensibly, through this check mechanism, members could, by their approval, affirm that their interests had been protected at the conclusion of the CAs and endorse the leadership of the negotiating team that negotiated this collective agreement.&nbsp; But, in practice, members' interests have not been safeguarded, as thereafter protracted and futile negotiations worsened relations between union and management, to the detriment of all.&nbsp; In some instances, negotiating positions had progressively hardened and precipitated deadlocks, as the Executive Council (Ex-Co) sought ratification from the members.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, in 2001, the collective agreement between Alpa-S and SIA management could only be concluded after 27 months of tedious negotiations.&nbsp; Even after this, the in-principle agreement between Alpa-S and the SIA management was short-lived, as it was overwhelmingly rejected by the Alpa-S membership during an EGM to ratify the agreement.&nbsp; This case was eventually referred to the Industrial Arbitration Court (IAC) and subsequently settled out of court.&nbsp; Both management and union must share the blame for this unproductive exercise.&nbsp; But the point is this: that the interests of both union members and the company suffered from these cycles of acrimony aggravated by the ratification clause.&nbsp; Last year, a wage cut was proposed by the management after SIA suffered losses due to the impact of the Iraqi war and the SARS outbreak.&nbsp; The dispute between the two parties was settled after the case had been referred to the IAC and mediation by MOM.&nbsp; But even after the Alpa-S members had ratified the agreement, 55% of their members subsequently voted out the President and his negotiating team for the agreement.&nbsp; Again, the ratification provision did not serve its original purpose of securing a mandate for the Ex-Co from union members because, as this case illustrated, members could, even after<p align=left>Column: 2883 <p> ratifying an agreement, change their minds and their leaders subsequently.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other unions have been able to adequately protect and reflect their members' interests without this onerous stipulation.&nbsp; Unions affiliated to NTUC, which represents 99% of all unionised workers, vest the mandate in their Ex-Co to negotiate and commit to an agreement with the management.&nbsp; Doing so does not in any way compromise the membership's interest, as the Ex-Co is fully accountable to their membership and the decisions they make during negotiations.&nbsp; The Ex-Co is duty-bound to act responsibly in the interests of their membership, failing which the membership still retains the constitutional powers to vote the Ex-Co out through the AGM.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar provisions on the representation rights of trade union officers are found in the labour laws of other countries.&nbsp; Let me just quote one.&nbsp; For example, Article 6 of&nbsp;Japan's Trade Union Act delineates the authority of a trade union to negotiate as follows:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Representatives of a trade union or those to whom the authority has been delegated by the trade union shall have the authority to negotiate with the employer or the employer's organisations on behalf of the trade union or the members of the trade union with respect to conclusion of a collective agreement and other matters."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill will, therefore, facilitate a more efficient process of collective bargaining and will not compromise or diminish the rights of unions and members in collective bargaining.&nbsp; Presently, only Alpa-S will be affected by this change, and the amendment will also override any future rule or resolution by a trade union which requires agreements to be ratified by union members.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I do not want to give the wrong impression that this amendment alone will<p align=left>Column: 2884 <p> improve relations within the union or their relationship with management, be it in SIA or elsewhere.&nbsp; The ratification clause is one of many aggravating factors, and this change is necessary.&nbsp; But management continues to bear the responsibility for restoring, building and nurturing the relationship between them and their employees.&nbsp; Leaders and members of unions, however, can accelerate productive outcomes with positive attitudes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, the tripartite partners, comprising the employers, unions and the Government, have formulated a Code of Industrial Relations Practice.&nbsp; This Code is to promote and guide both employers and trade unions to conduct industrial relations and deal with labour-management relations in a responsible and constructive manner for the benefit of the company and its workers.&nbsp; I am pleased to present the Code for Members' information, which I now ask the Clerk of Parliament to distribute.&nbsp; &nbsp;<I>[Copies of Code distributed to hon. Members.]</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, this Code is unique to Singapore&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> 	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>  	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">			 </span></div><!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>and it reflects that special bond, the spirit of tripartism which I spoke about earlier.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that the harmonious industrial relations in Singapore&nbsp;are essential for economic growth and social stability.&nbsp; It is important that Government guides the framework for industrial relations so that it supports the development of harmonious relations.

This is, in effect, giving elected union membership a blanket authority during the term of their office to act on behalf of members without the need to face the consequences of their action until the end of their term of office.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rationale behind some unions requiring their officers to come back to them for confirmation of collective terms is to avoid situations where the officers get carried away and agree to terms not acceptable by the majority of the union members.&nbsp; It also serves as an effective deterrent against union leaders acting on their own interpretation of what is in the best interest of their members without consultation and confirmation from members as to what they think is&nbsp;their best interest.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To me, obtaining members' ratification of terms of collective agreements is a superior process and a better safeguard for union members.&nbsp; It is also in line with the spirit of democracy of which accountability of leaders is the hallmark.&nbsp; Accountability does not merely lie at the end of one's term of office nor at <p align=left>Column: 2886 <p>elections.&nbsp; True accountability means acting in accordance with the mandate given by the members and being answerable to members for actions taken.&nbsp; If we believe and trust the wisdom of the people, it should be up to each union to decide what kind of rules they want.&nbsp; The officers are chosen by the union members and it is up to the members to decide how much power to give them.&nbsp; If the union's rules provide that the negotiating officers cannot conclude terms of agreement or collective agreements unless the members confirm the terms,&nbsp;then why should the Government impose this blanket condition on all the unions by way of legislation?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, this amendment does not surprise me.&nbsp; It reflects the typical mindset and the response of the PAP Government. This is the response to the robust democratic process of the Alpa-S union, which needed the attention of the Senior Minister to finish his unfinished business.&nbsp; In Singapore, rarely do we see such incidents of organised labour movement openly pressurising their management to secure the best deal for their members and replacing their leadership&nbsp;to demand accountability.&nbsp; I suppose with this amendment, the unfinished business is done.&nbsp; I am quite sure similar&nbsp;episodes will not have a chance to take place again. This is the typical response of the PAP Government.&nbsp; If they cannot control you or is unable to persuade you to act according to their wishes, they will outlaw you or cripple you by legislation.&nbsp; A legitimate act could become a criminal act overnight.&nbsp;&nbsp; A robust organisation could become subdued and submissive.&nbsp; Welcome to Singapore!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PAP Government is able to do this because Parliament, which makes laws, is&nbsp;the territory of the PAP. Some people say that the only law in Singapore is PAP law. Others say that under the PAP Government, there is no rule of law, only ruled by law!&nbsp; Why is it that after nearly <p align=left>Column: 2887 <p>40 years of nation-building, there is political&nbsp;apathy among Singaporeans?&nbsp; Why is it that our pledge "to build a democratic society", &nbsp;sounds hollow, with our people being passive in upholding the principle and the spirit of democracy and fearful, even ignorant of their democratic rights?&nbsp; The answer, I believe, lies in legislation like this. This is&nbsp;the Singapore story untold.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I oppose this amendment.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Sir, I rise in support of this Bill.&nbsp; In practical terms, this amendment will have little impact on the 63 unions affiliated to NTUC.&nbsp; Among our unions, the Executive Committee, as the duly elected body of the workers through secret ballot, can negotiate on behalf of their members and enter into binding collective agreements with employers.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are about 1,200 collective agreements registered with the Industrial Arbitration Court.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year, about 300 of these collective agreements are&nbsp;renegotiated by our affiliates with no difficulty whatsoever.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this provision, found in the constitution of our unions, empowering the Executive Committee to negotiate a collective agreement without the need for ratification by members, is voluntarily adopted and is not&nbsp;the result of any statutory requirement. Although the existing arrangement has worked satisfactorily for us, we are supportive of the move to enshrine what is already a widespread practice into our law&nbsp;as&nbsp;this&nbsp;will provide greater clarity and certainty in the conduct of industrial relations and minimise potential disputes due to the increased complexities of the workplace today.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, Sir, there are some concerns that have been expressed over this amendment which I would like to highlight here and seek a response from the Minister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2888 <p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, some people, like Mr Low Thia Khiang,&nbsp;a few moments ago, have expressed the concern that this amendment represents a step backwards and is not in the interest of workers.&nbsp; The issue is whether this amendment will deny individual members the right to have a final say on their pay package.&nbsp; Some see ratification by members as an important safeguard which will be removed with this amendment, as the Executive Committee will now no longer be accountable to their own members over such an important issue as their salaries and terms and conditions of employment.&nbsp; To some extent, in my view,&nbsp; this concern may be overstated as ultimately, members still wield the power over the Executive Committee to act in their interest.&nbsp; They can, for instance, refuse to re-elect an Executive Committee that has negotiated a collective agreement against their interest.&nbsp; And there is, of course, nothing to stop them from throwing out an Executive Committee mid-stream that has negotiated a collective agreement which they feel is not in their interest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Democratically, Sir, unhappy members can also vote with their feet and leave the union. These factors will, in my view, act as a natural constraint on the unions' Executive Committees who would, themselves, be affected by the collective agreement that they negotiated for their members to act in their members' best interest.&nbsp; Sir, nevertheless,&nbsp;the Minister's clarification on this point&nbsp;whether the amendment would&nbsp;indeed be detrimental to workers' interest is important, bearing in mind that this is a restriction that will now be mandated, instead of being voluntarily adopted by unions.&nbsp; In the latter event, one could still argue that&nbsp;members,&nbsp;when approving the voluntary system of non-ratification, have the final say on how they should be consulted.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, Sir, there are also concerns expressed that this amendment is one-<p align=left>Column: 2889 <p>sided.&nbsp; While the amendment prevents union members from overriding the collective agreements negotiated by the Executive Committee, there is no corresponding obligation imposed on employers so that the board of directors or the shareholders of a company can override a decision made by the management or disagree with the collective agreement that&nbsp;has been&nbsp;negotiated with the union.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a fact that there are employers who drag their feet, resort to delaying tactics and who send representatives to the bargaining table without any mandate to settle with the union.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, Sir, in the absence of any provision imposing a similar statutory obligation on the employer, could the Minister tell us what steps the Ministry will take to impose similar obligations on employers to negotiate in good faith and to respect workers' and trade unions' rights during collective bargaining? Would this amendment, Sir, amount to a situation where unions are now required to negotiate with one hand tied behind their back, but employers have both hands free?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, thirdly, there are many who feel that this amendment alone is not sufficient and will not, by itself, result in good industrial relations. The law can provide a useful framework for unions and management to deal with each other in a rational and orderly manner.&nbsp; But, Sir, in today's context, one requires much more than just a civilised manner of dealing with each other.&nbsp; What is needed is a collaborative relationship built on trust and confidence, a sharing of mutually agreed goals, strong communication and fair and transparent rules.&nbsp; No law, however, Sir, can mandate all these nor is it something that can be built overnight.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our experience shows that where&nbsp;there is a high level of trust, it is much <p align=left>Column: 2890 <p>easier for companies to implement change and workers are more receptive to wage freeze, wage cuts or even retrenchments. Where&nbsp;there is a low level of trust, Sir, restructuring becomes more bumpy and acrimonious.&nbsp; I am therefore happy that there is now a Code on Industrial Relations to codify some of the key guiding principles and ensure strong&nbsp; partnership between management and unions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Sir, for this&nbsp;Code to be truly meaningful, it must have the support and endorsement of the top leadership in&nbsp;the company and be implemented at every level of management. So I would like to ask the Minister&nbsp;what steps will be taken to strongly promote this&nbsp;Code among companies.&nbsp; One suggestion I would like to make is for the Ministry, together with the Singapore National Employers Federation and the NTUC, to organise a series of workshops and seminars on this Code so that everyone understands the part they have to play.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in this highly competitive world that we live in, infrastructures, systems and technologies can be easily duplicated if countries have the means to do so. What makes us different from many countries is our strong tripartism and good labour-management relations at the enterprise level.&nbsp; Sir, in order to preserve this edge, it is important that we continue to invest sufficient time, effort and resources in this partnership.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr A Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr A Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member):</B> Sir, how critical&nbsp;is it for leaders to have mandate to deal on behalf of their members, as a clear mandate allows different partners in a negotiation to resolve issues&nbsp;in a harmonious way for the mutual benefit of both partners concerned?&nbsp; These are important questions.&nbsp; We need to reflect on our past experience to see what has happened in&nbsp;the past in&nbsp;many of the affiliated unions in <p align=left>Column: 2891 <p>NTUC.&nbsp; Here, I wish to share my own experiences.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in 1985/1986, we went through a severe economic recession. At that point of time, I was a leader with the then PUB Daily-Rated Employees Union.&nbsp; We had to take tough decisions.&nbsp; One of it was&nbsp;to accept a wage freeze and to forgo the mid-year bonus for&nbsp;these&nbsp;low-income workers. The union leadership had to take a decision, and we took a decision which was,&nbsp;no doubt,&nbsp;tough and unpopular.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With&nbsp;that&nbsp;and other tough measures introduced, such as the CPF cut, the Singapore economy rebounded and a lot of progress took place.&nbsp; The PUB Daily-Rated&nbsp;Employees Union in 1989 negotiated a collective agreement on behalf of its members.&nbsp; Through that collective agreement, workers managed to enjoy a pay increase of between&nbsp;18%-21%.&nbsp;&nbsp;All that came about because&nbsp;a&nbsp;very strong harmonious industrial relation existed.&nbsp;We were able to take tough decisions, and&nbsp;we had the mandate to take&nbsp;tough decisions.&nbsp; This was one of the examples we went through.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in the 1990s, we wanted to take away this daily-rated concept because it was a misnomer of our colonial days.&nbsp; The union discussed this issue with its Executive Council and we decided that we could not do it by wage increase alone and we needed to address a more fundamental issue of helping the workers to go through training, whereby they could adapt to the new technological changes taking place in the market.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To do that, we had to take some very tough decisions. At that point of time, this group of workers was working from 7.00 am to 2.50 pm and thereafter, they did a second job. So any training programme or any change in their working hours to attend a training programme will become very disruptive.But then&nbsp;the<p align=left>Column: 2892 <p> collective benefit of all the employees and their long-term benefits have to be taken into account.&nbsp; So, we decided to discuss this with the management, and the management too had a strong mandate.&nbsp; The director had a very strong mandate from the management and he understood the problem.&nbsp; He knew that was the right direction, and he was able to convince his senior management.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From 1992 to 1997, about 1,800 daily-rated workers were trained and retrained.&nbsp; After which, they were able to acquire monthly rated positions, which were more secure jobs, and they were also able to enjoy higher wages.&nbsp; If they had not gone through the changes and attended the training programmes, today, they would be earning between $1,000 and $1,400.&nbsp; But by accepting the changes and accepting the union leaders' decision, today, they are able to enjoy salaries of between $2,000 and $2,700, and this is a hefty increase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All this was possible because the union leaders had the mandate.&nbsp; In my own experience, since 1979, I have negotiated&nbsp; over 20 collective agreements, and went through nine elections.&nbsp; If the workers' interests have not been taken into account, that would not have been possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The union constitution provides sufficient provisions for the whole executive council&nbsp;to be removed by the ordinary members.&nbsp; And we have to make sure that we are close enough to our members, close enough to even listen to their pulse, and this is important for a union leader.&nbsp; We have to hear views and feedback.&nbsp; But at the end of the day, we have to make&nbsp;decisions.&nbsp; And to make decisions, we need a mandate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, this amendment, I believe, is long overdue.&nbsp; In fact, it should not have taken such a long time to amend this law.&nbsp; But at the same time,&nbsp;some other concerns <p align=left>Column: 2893 <p>have been raised.&nbsp; One of the concerns has been&nbsp; highlighted by&nbsp;Mdm Halimah.&nbsp; As far as union leaders&nbsp;are concerned, they have a clear mandate.&nbsp; What about management?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lately, we notice that some employers are&nbsp;more concerned with shareholders' interest.&nbsp; Their primary concern is on shareholders' interest, not so much for the other stakeholders, especially the workers.&nbsp; So, they are not giving a clear mandate to human resource heads to negotiate with the unions, and this has caused a lot of disruption in the workplaces.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Acting Minister has&nbsp;circulated a Code of Industrial Relations Practices.&nbsp; But this is just a piece of document.&nbsp; You just sign and then you keep it in your file.&nbsp; It does not serve anybody's interest.&nbsp; You must make sure that it&nbsp;is put&nbsp;into real practice.&nbsp; Because by issuing this statement, tomorrow, everything is not going to change.&nbsp; Those reluctant employers must change their attitude, and must give a clear mandate to their human resource director to negotiate.&nbsp; If they do not have a mandate, then there is no point in blaming the unions or the union leaders.&nbsp; So, this is very crucial for harmonious industrial relations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have decades of industrial harmony and peace, and we have enjoyed prosperity and growth. On the average, we have enjoyed about 5% wage growth since the NWC started in 1972.&nbsp; All this could not have been possible without&nbsp;cooperation and clear mandate.&nbsp; But, going forward,&nbsp;with a very competitive environment, we see a lot of difficulties arising.&nbsp;&nbsp;On this, the Manpower Ministry has to&nbsp;give&nbsp;its Conciliation Officers more powers, so that&nbsp;they can take to task employers or their representatives who are not showing the kind of support that they should give to good industrial <p align=left>Column: 2894 <p>relations practices.&nbsp; It is not just by signing papers, because this is not a legal document.&nbsp; And if it is not a legal document, employers will&nbsp;just talk about it and&nbsp;after that, they will forget about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should not allow that to happen.&nbsp; If&nbsp;we are sure about the amendment, make sure that it is balanced&nbsp; -&nbsp; the interests of the workers are taken care of and, at the same time, the employers' interests are also taken care of.&nbsp; But the employers must also&nbsp;exercise their responsibility and give a proper mandate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, I just wish to state that in my view, a leader without a mandate is similar to a body without a head.&nbsp; On that note, I support the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</B> Sir, I am really concerned with&nbsp;the amendment&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Trade Unions (Amendment) Bill and do not support the passing of this amendment.&nbsp; Just imagine a worker called Mr Flying Pilot.&nbsp; Without joining any union, Mr Flying Pilot makes his own decision&nbsp;on&nbsp;the terms of employment with his company.&nbsp; Yet, after joining a trade union, his power to decide on his own terms of employment with the company has been replaced by&nbsp;a collective agreement, something that is negotiated and agreed upon on his behalf without his participation, agreement nor ratification.&nbsp; This is no good.&nbsp; How can a person who joins a union have his employment rights legally restricted?&nbsp; People who join unions want to have a voice, an outlet for them, to improve their rights, their lives, their work environment and be more effective when negotiating with the management for&nbsp;fairer wages.&nbsp; If this voice is being crippled by law, what is the point of them joining a union any more?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of being reassured that the union will protect Mr Flying Pilot's earnings and livelihood, he may have sleepless nights wondering and worrying&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2895 <p>whether the union officials had accepted an unsatisfactory collective&nbsp;agreement with a difficult and not responsive management.&nbsp; He has no choice but to worry unnecessarily because there is no cause for redress for him once the law is passed.&nbsp; This amendment adds insecurity, uncertainty and stress to union members, and should not be passed at all.&nbsp; However, as said by Mr Low Thia Khiang earlier, with the complete dominance of Government Members in this House, I am most assured that this amendment will be passed through easily.&nbsp; Therefore, I can only advise our Singaporean workers to seriously think twice if they want to renew their union membership or join any unions in Singapore in future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B> Sir, let me thank Members for their responses.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was very heartened with Mr Nithiah Nandan's heartfelt recounts of how he was able to secure a mandate and leadership.&nbsp; In his capacity, he had negotiated 20 collective agreements and re-elected nine times.&nbsp; Even in some unions, with this ratification clause, there have been more leadership changes than collective agreements bargained.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Nithiah Nandan said that leaders without mandate are like a body without a head.&nbsp; It invoked images of thrashing headless bodies around!&nbsp; And, indeed, in some circumstances, it was, as I related to&nbsp;Members how in the last negotiations in 2001, after a tedious exercise of 27 months, even&nbsp;with in-principle agreements, it was overthrown by the membership.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Nithiah Nandan's account is certainly more enlightening than Mr Low Thia Khiang's diatribe against what he calls "the oppression and&nbsp; how we have crippled rights".&nbsp; But is this so?&nbsp; What rights have we deprived from this amendment?&nbsp; Have we deprived workers of the right to bargain collectively?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2896 <p>Have we deprived them of the right to organise?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Have we deprived them of a right, if they feel that their interests have not been protected, to change the leadership?&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; They can call, as Mdm Halimah has said, an EGM to change the leadership.&nbsp; Have we deprived them of the right to seek recourse or a decision by the Industrial Arbitration Court?&nbsp; And the answer is again no.&nbsp; So, Mr Low hypes the effects of this amendment, and this amendment only seeks to facilitate the collective bargaining process, which I have recounted, this clause has not effected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang and Mr Steve Chia speak much about protecting workers' rights, and that this amendment will increase the insecurity of workers.&nbsp; In the last few months, we have put out in broad print the challenges of the aviation industry.&nbsp; It seems to me that they have ignored completely all the challenges, and only made political points.&nbsp; Which is the greater insecurity?&nbsp; That of individual unions demanding their own personal share to the detriment of the company?&nbsp; And when the company suffers and divisions go under and workers are unemployed, will Mr Steve Chia and Mr Low Thia Khiang say, "Well, there you are, but your rights have been protected.&nbsp; You are out of a job, but never mind!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Steve Chia makes a plea to Singaporeans not to join unions.&nbsp; I would ask him to look at the membership numbers from the NTUC which represents 99.5%.&nbsp;&nbsp;Locally, the numbers have gone up.&nbsp; And if you compare it internationally, the numbers and the union memberships have grown&nbsp;from strength to strength.&nbsp; What does that tell us?&nbsp; It tells us, as Mr Nithiah Nandan has said, that Singapore workers are much more enlightened.&nbsp; They look at the overall effects.&nbsp; They see what the Government says. They see what the union membership say and can deliver, and they are willing to trust that leadership to deliver what was promised&nbsp; - &nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2897 <p>not quick remarks, not grand sounding aspects, not chest thumping, what Mr Low Thia Khiang refers to as superior processes of democracy.&nbsp; In other words, go on the streets, demand your rights, never mind the overall picture, never mind the ability of the companies to survive, never mind the economic competitiveness of your nation.&nbsp; I think that our workers and our citizens are much smarter than them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah asked what safeguard do we have to make sure that employers do not abuse this.&nbsp; First, I would say that employers do not have a rule requiring them to seek ratification of negotiated collective agreements.&nbsp; But I also take the point that there may be instances where employers, for whatever reason, do not come to a conclusion or lengthen out the process.&nbsp; And I would advise such employees who have such employers, as both parties now have the ability, to make <I>ex parte</I> applications to the IAC or to approach MOM for conciliation.&nbsp; The Ministry of Manpower would advise the employer not to cause undue delay in negotiations and help the two parties reach an agreement within a reasonable timeframe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Nithiah Nandan says, give more powers to my conciliation officers.&nbsp; I think we have been doing OK, looking at the number of collective agreements and the number of cases that we have had to settle.&nbsp; But I take&nbsp;their point&nbsp; -&nbsp; Mr Nandan and Mdm Halimah&nbsp; - that the Code of Industrial Relations Practice that was circulated today is a piece of paper.&nbsp; They are quite right, but it is a valuable piece of paper.&nbsp; Very few countries, if you read the contents, are able to arrive at these enlightened principles, to have it signed by union, Government and employers.&nbsp; That starting point should not be underestimated.&nbsp; It is unique.&nbsp; I have travelled widely.&nbsp; I have consulted<p align=left>Column: 2898 <p> employer organisations, as I have visited trade union leaders.&nbsp; We are the exception to the rule.&nbsp; It is an important starting point.&nbsp; It is a valuable platform.&nbsp; Yes, we will roll out this series of seminars, as Mdm Halimah has suggested, to bring on board more employers and more union leaders.&nbsp; It is certainly not a piece of paper to be filed away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me conclude by saying that this amendment does not in any way deprive or diminish the rights of workers or the unions that represent them.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

That is a fundamental point.&nbsp; They can call an AGM<p align=left>Column: 2899 <p> and remove the leaders at any time, even after this amendment.&nbsp; So, in that way, their rights are not deprived at all.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang asked: does this reduce the mandate for leaders?&nbsp; But this ratification clause, as I have illustrated, in no way assures a mandate.&nbsp; Because looking at the exercise last year where the wage cuts from SARS were negotiated by the Ex-Co and ratified by the members, a few months later, even before the removal of the thermal scanners, the members changed their minds and removed their leaders.&nbsp; So, what assurance was that given to leaders?&nbsp; This clause has neither helped members nor their leaders.&nbsp; It does not deprive the members of their right to change and elect new leaders.&nbsp; That is fundamental.&nbsp; But it does facilitate the collective bargaining process.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, this is not the only factor which aggravates labour-management relations, and we should not pretend that amending this Act will suddenly improve relations.&nbsp; As Mdm Halimah says, there is a lot to be done and we will continue in this process.&nbsp; This is a necessary change, but it is a first step of many steps that we must help unions and their leaders who have trouble to restore, to build and to reach a situation where the mandate is strong enough for them to believe their members, for the leaders to believe the management, and for the management to take the leaders into confidence about where the company is headed, and for all to thrive and benefit.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

And what is it you will accept?"&nbsp; But the ratification clause, in practice,&nbsp;was that it created a dynamic where there was brinkmanship.&nbsp; Sometimes, there was a power play; sometimes, the leaders use the excuse to say, "Well, I can't conclude because the members might not agree."&nbsp; And this has created a negotiation, a dynamic that precipitated that lock.&nbsp; Because at each successive cycle, the stakes got higher, until both sides were locked and you could not come to an agreement.&nbsp; Therefore, that is why you have 27 months of negotiations.&nbsp; This is one of the factors.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> I wonder why is there a need for the Government to come in to legislate in order to outlaw similar provisions passed by union members.&nbsp;&nbsp;The union members may decide whether or not they want to give full power to their leaders for negotiation or they may want to decide that, all right, after negotiation, their leaders come back to consult the members.&nbsp; Of course, I think there is nothing to prevent the union leaders, after negotiating the collective agreement, to consult the members.&nbsp; But&nbsp;the onus is on&nbsp;the union leaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a resolution passed by the unions, it will be mandatory for the leaders, after negotiating the agreement before signing it,&nbsp;to come back to consult the members.&nbsp; So the members' interest is in a way&nbsp;protected.&nbsp; At least, the members know what is the final agreement which they are going to conclude.&nbsp; Does he agree with that?</P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><p align=left>Column: 2901 <p><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B> Sir, I mentioned in my preamble that because we have industrial peace for so long, some may mistakenly believe that this is a natural order of things - that&nbsp;the industrial relation that we have is a natural order of things.&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang asked why is it necessary for the Government to intervene.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said that the three social partners interact constantly.&nbsp; This is not a static picture of harmonious relationship because it is so.&nbsp; It is because we have constantly tended to the ground.&nbsp; And why we have intervened is because this ratification clause, as I have amply shown, precipitates or worsens labour-management relations.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, for them to get the clause into their constitution, they had to ask the Registrar of&nbsp; Trade Unions' permission, and we allowed it.&nbsp;&nbsp;But through these years, they have shown, and we have observed, that it does not help them.&nbsp; So just as we have the powers to say yes for a clause to be included,&nbsp;we only allowed the clause because ostensibly they said this protects members' interest and facilitates labour-management relations.&nbsp; But when the clause has not been shown to serve its orginal purpose and, indeed, worsens relations, I think it would be remiss of the Government not to intervene.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do we not just allow them to, as Mr Low says, for the Ex-Co to go back to the membership for the reasons that I have illustrated?&nbsp; But removing this clause does not deprive the members from having the final say on their leadership.&nbsp; The&nbsp;point is that many other unions - in fact, this is the only union which has this ratification clause - have been able to function and achieve collective agreements, and protect their members' interest without the&nbsp;need for this ratification.&nbsp; If Mr Low wants to know how it is done, I suggest he consult my NTUC counterparts in this House.&nbsp; Some of the examples that have been cited are that they practise a pre-mandate.&nbsp; In other words, they ask the members beforehand what positions are agreeable.&nbsp; That is a fruitful and productive way of doing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The current policy for hotels and boarding houses is to allow them in locations zoned Hotel or Commercial. Within sites with mixed use zoning, such as&nbsp; Commercial/Residential and Residential with 1st-storey Commercial, hotels and boarding houses are allowed on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration the compatibility of boarding houses with the existing uses in the location.&nbsp;<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The development of backpacker hostels and budget hotels is to meet the needs of the changing profile of our visitors. With the advent of budget travel and growth in value-conscious markets such as <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, Singapore Tourism Board (STB) anticipates an increase in demand for such accommodation.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The primary objective of Government's policy regarding budget hotel is to cater to the needs of budget travelers, while ensuring that boarding houses would not create adverse impact on the amenity of the area. To minimise the possibility of these boarding houses breeding undesirable activities, URA works closely with the Police (Anti-Vice Branch).&nbsp; Police would also monitor areas where vice activities are prevalent and, if necessary, conduct surprise checks on these hotels and boarding houses to flush out these undesirable activities within them.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hotel Licensing Board and STB also inspect the budget hotels to ensure minimum standards are met.
