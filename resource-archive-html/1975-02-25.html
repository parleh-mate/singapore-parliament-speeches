<div align="center"><b>Debate on the Address</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(First Day)</b></div>



<br><br>2.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the following Address in reply to the Speech of

the President be agreed to:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Parliament of the Republic of

Singapore, express our thanks to the President for the

Speech  which he delivered on behalf of the Government

at   the  opening  of  the  Second  Session  of   this

Parliament.".'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that hon. Members in this House wilt

rise in support of my Motion thanking the President for

his  speech  which reviews the state of the nation  and

outlines  the  major  policies  and  measures   to   be

implemented in the coming years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also confident that I speak for all hon. Members

that  we  welcome  the  proposed increased  income  tax

relief  for  those with aged parents living with  them,

the  measures  to  eliminate  industrial  friction  and

improve  compensation  rates for  workers  involved  in

industrial  accidents. It is a  relief  to  note  that,

despite  the  prevailing world-wide  inflation  coupled

with  economic recession, we have managed to achieve  a

real growth



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



rate  of  about 7%. It is also reassuring to note  from

the  President's  speech  the  cautious  optimism  that

"Singapore  is likely to reverse the downtrend  in  her

economy"  with  the prospect that we will  probably  do

better  by  the  later  part of  this  year  than  now,

provided there is no major unexpected catastrophe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We owe our present well-being to our decisive will to

succeed  and hard work. It is with the able leadership,

imaginative  policies  and  tough  measures  that   our

Government has been able to- minimise our economic  and

social   dislocations  under  the   current   recessive

climate.  Although economic growth by itself  does  not

necessarily  generate happiness all round, the  absence

of   such   growth   will   undoubtedly   create   much

unhappiness.  More  hard work, unpopular  policies  and

tough  measures there shall be for the continued  well-being of our society for generations to come. There  is

no  question  of any of this Government's policies  and

measures   being   swayed   by   short-term   political

considerations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are new challenges and problems ahead of us, as

pointed  out in the Addendum to the President's speech;

and to quote the President, "there will be much to keep

Honourable  Members busy in 1975." One of the  pressing

problems   generated   by   our   rapid   progress   of

urbanisation  and industrialisation is  that  of  urban

transportation,  in particular, peak  hour  travelling.

The  daily  traffic congestion has caused  much  social

frustration,  unnecessary  fuel  expenditure   and   an

adverse  effect on business activities in  the  central

business  district due to a lower degree  of  mobility.

There  is  no easy and simple solution to overcome  the

complex  problem  of  urban  transportation  which  has

become  a major concern of all metropolitan and  public

policy  in  this  century.  The  Government  will  soon

introduce harsh traffic management measures such as the

park  and  ride,  city shuttle bus and  area  licensing

schemes    to    relieve   traffic   congestion.    The

comprehensive scheme with unpopular management



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



measures, though not a new idea, is attracting  much

international attention because few governments in  the

so-called  free-world have dared to venture  into  such

unpopularity     due     to    short-term     political

considerations. Our bus service is improving,  but  the

standard   is   still   far  from   satisfactory.   The

introduction of the park and ride scheme will no  doubt

relieve  the traffic congestion in the central business

district. However, careful regulation or adjustment may

be  necessary to maintain a balanced set of  management

measures to ensure, among other things, that the scheme

would  not  unnecessarily  attract  the  normal  public

transport  riders  to  opt  for  the  park   and   ride

alternative,  in  which  case,  a  shift   of   traffic

congestion  from the central business district  to  the

outer urban areas may result.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another growing concern is the increasing crime rate

and   the   insufficiently  staffed  police  force   as

expressed  by  the President. Although the introduction

of  full-time national servicemen for the police  force

will  lessen  the  problem of  manpower  shortage,  the

effectiveness of our police force will depend  more  on

the  quality and maturity of the personnel  than  sheer

numbers.  It  is  imperative  to  stress  the  need  to

carefully  train our selected young national servicemen

for  police  duty. In the course of their active  duty,

their contact with the public is unavoidable, and their

ability  and  tact  in handling human  situations  will

determine  the goodwill or ill-will between the  public

and the police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is without doubt, to quote the Addendum to the

President's  Speech, that "The Police will require  the

support of the public to be fully effective." As it is,

the  degree of mutual trust and cooperation between the

public  and  the police leaves much to be  desired.  No

doubt  severe  punishment must  be  meted  out  to  law

offenders, but more severe punishment should  be  meted

out  to the law enforcement officers who flout the  law

if we are to make Singapore a safe and orderly place to

live  in. The current world economic situation has made

it  very  clear  that the economic  well-being  of  any

country depends more than ever



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



before  on the well-being of other countries.  The

reality   of   interdependence  is   obvious   and

immediate,  and  it is in this  direction,  as  it

should  be,  that the Addendum on the Ministry  of

Foreign  Affairs  has stressed the  importance  of

cooperation with our South-East Asian countries to

safeguard  our common interests and  the  need  to

encourage  increased  trade  with  West  Asia  and

Eastern  Europe. But interdependence  goes  beyond

economics to the question of food, population  and

jurisdiction over the seas, all of which requiring

urgent attention but none of which could be solved

by any nation acting alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of international goodwill as an

overture  to  greater  cooperation  and  increased

trade cannot be over-emphasised if we are to truly

establish  Singapore  as  a  "Global  City".   Our

traders   and  those  who  have  active   business

dealings with our neighbouring countries should be

made  to  realise  this, and  I  would  urge  them

wherever  possible to avoid sacrificing our  long-term  international  goodwill  for  any  immediate

trading gain. Our traders should be encouraged  to

conduct "fair trade" not only intra-nationally but

also  internationally if this tiny  City-state  of

ours  is  to continue to thrive under the  "Global

City" concept.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support without any

reservation the Presidential address delivered  at

the  opening  of the Second Session of  the  Third

Parliament on 21st February, 1975.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his address, the President pointed out:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The primary duty of government is to establish a

society  in which everyone has an equal chance  to

live,  learn, train, work and earn to the best  of

his or her ability.'



<br><br>In  my  opinion,  this is one of the  most  urgent

tasks of nation-building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of national service following

our independence has success



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



fully  imbued in our youths with a sense of  self-reliance and patriotism. Our participation in  the

five-nation  defence pact and the  ASEAN  regional

organisation  has contributed towards  a  peaceful

and  stable  South-East Asia. In  the  foreseeable

future, I believe the ASEAN members would be  able

to  continue sharing prosperity in a harmonius  co

existence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we in Singapore have seen an increase

in  the crime rate. These unlawful activities  are

causing   a  problem  to  our  effort  in  nation-building. It is like an ugly shadow cast over  our

society.  Unless we reduce the crime rate  to  the

minimum, we would not be able to escape from being

labelled "a paradise for criminals", especially at

a time when we arc making progress in economic and

other fields. As a result of a rising incidence of

robbery,  rape  and murder, kidnapping  and  drug-trafficking,  the middle income and  upper  income

groups  are exposed to threats, and not only  that

but  the safety of housewives in the lower  income

group is also threatened while they go to work  or

shopping.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there was the campaign last year to

fight  crime  and  delinquency  organised  by  the

department responsible for the maintenance of  law

and  order, my personal feeling of the results  is

that more publicity had been given to the campaign

than  the actual achievement of its objective.  As

compared with the "Keep Singapore Clean and Green"

campaign  in  1969, this Crime Free campaign  paid

more  attention to publicity and it has  become  a

fashionable gimmick.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the fact that acute shortage of

police  manpower  has  to  a large  extent  contributed

to   these   unlawful  activities.  It   is   therefore

necessary  to  consider  heavier  penalties   for   the

recalcitrant  anti-social  elements.  I  fully  support

the  President's  statement  in  this  respect,  and  I

sincerely  hope  that  the  officers  responsible   for

law  and  order  well understand the  rationale  behind

the   imposition   of   heavier   penalties,   and   to

exercise  their  authority to maintain  law  and  order

in our society.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my feeling that the existence of crime in

our  society  has  its root in  the  size  of  the

family.  Families with a large number of  children

generally  have  not been able  to  provide  their

children with the good things in life, despite the

sweat and toil of parents throughout their unhappy

lives.  In  such an environment where parents  are

away   at  work,  children  fail  to  learn  their

positive  role  in the society. And  children  are

very susceptible to bad influences. In the company

of   anti-social  elements  they   easily   become

delinquents.  There is no doubt that  there  is  a

need  to  extend our sympathy to these unfortunate

strays. They must be properly guided to a sense of

responsibility  that is expected  of  them  in  an

orderly and healthy society. Sympathy and guidance

notwithstanding,  we must be firm  and  deal  with

them severely if they continue to defy the law and

attempt to create disorder in our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I am also in full agreement with the

President's statement on the need to further lower

our  birth  rate  and to adhere to  the  two-child

concept. We must completely eradicate the obsolete

concept  of the different values attached to  male

offsprings  and female offsprings and  to  promote

the  concept that boy or girl, two is enough. What

is  important is to instill in parents the need to

bring   up   quality   children   in   a   happier

environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the need to revolutionize our concept

of male offsprings and their values, there is also

a  point worthy of consideration. Perhaps to drive

home  the  point that females do not lose  out  to

males in an equal and just society, job preference

may  be  given to female applicants from  families

without  male  siblings, provided such  applicants

possess   equal  qualification  and   ability   as

compared  to  the  male applicants.  In  this  way

parents  without male offspring might think  again

before  enlarging  their  family  only  with   the

purpose of ensuring that there is someone to carry

on their name.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion I strongly suggest that on the one

hand,  we  should  enlist  the  help  of  law   to

discourage  the  tendency  to  rely  on  luck  and

gamble;   on   the  other  hand,  we  must   adopt

enlightening  incentives to upgrade human  quality

so  that  every  citizen will lead a contributing,

self-disciplined and meaningful life in a fair and

stable society.



<br><br>2.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to  speak in full support on the  Motion  of

Thanks  to the President as moved by my colleague,

the Member for Kim Keat. In moving the Motion,  he

mentioned that the President in his address at the

opening  of  the  Second  Session  of  this  Third

Parliament  on 21st February, 1975  stated  in  no

uncertain terms that "there will be much  to  keep

Honourable Members busy in 1975." In this respect,

the President posed several problems to which Hon.

Members "will have to tackle."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many Backbenchers will be speaking on this

Motion,  I  shall confine myself  to  those  areas

which  I  am more interested in. I am particularly

exuberant  with happiness over the fact  that  the

President stated that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Government will take measures to make it more

attractive for young couples to have their parents

live  with them. If nothing else, the grandparents

help in bringing up the children whilst father and

mother are at work.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, about five years ago, in fact,

on  15th October, 1969 [Hansard, Vol. 29, col. 85],

I made a plea to the then Minister for Finance who

is  now the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister  of

Defence  to consider granting "income tax  reliefs

to   taxpayers  who  are  maintaining  their  aged

parents."  The  Minister in reply to  my  question

stated that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'in Asian societies, the support of aged parents

is   an   acknowledged  responsibility  of  all  decent

citizens.  Indeed,  Confucius has  elevated  this  into

a   basic  ethical  principle,  and  Chinese  classical

literature  is  replete  with examples  of  outstanding

acts  of  filial  piety.  In  these  circumstances   it

would  be  unworthy  of us to introduce  mercenary  con

siderations   such   as  relief   from   income   tax.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, the Minister continued:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`if this approach does not appeal to the hon. Member,

may   I   add   a  less  traditionalist  argument?   An

International  Monetary  Fund  mission   has   recently

examined  our  tax system and has stated that  our  tax

reliefs  are  overgenerous and could with advantage  be

reduced.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With due respect to the Hon. Deputy Prime Minister

and  Minister  of  Defence, I chose  not  to  press  on

persistently as economics is his homeground.  Moreover,

he  was  in  charge of our country's coffers then!  But

deep  down in my heart, I had hoped that the day  would

come when this matter would again be raised. However, I

tried to appeal to the Finance Minister again this time

by  the  so-called "hook" method. On 26th March, 1971

[Vol.  30,  col. 1360], I sought exemption for  persons

earning  $6,000  per  annum or  less.  Ironically,  our

present  Deputy Speaker, who was then the  Minister  of

State for Finance, stated that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`the burden of income tax in Singapore is low because

of  the  generous  personal reliefs and  the  graduated

rates of tax.'



<br><br>He went on to say that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Under the Income Tax Ordinance a taxpayer is allowed

personal relief of $2,000 plus an earned income  relief

of  1/5th  of his earned income up to a maximum  of

$1,000. A relief of $1,000 is given in respect  of  his

wife, $750 in respect of his first child, $500 each for

the second and third child . .` etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on 26th February, 1973 [Vol. 32, col. 4761,

the present Finance Minister declared that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`many Members suggested that reliefs should be given

for  the  maintenance of aged parents  and  handicapped

children  on  the grounds that the Eastern  concept  of

filial   piety  requires,  among  other  things,   that

children should look after their parents in old age.  I

recognise  that  with  greater  urbanisation  and  more

limited   living  space,  the  Asian  family  unit   is

threatened  with disintegration and that  aged  parents

may  be left on their own when they most need care  and

attention.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the Hon. Minister was:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`prepared to give some tax relief as an encouragement

to   taxpayers  who  look  after  their   parents   and

grandparents when they are without work or income.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`a taxpayer may claim a tax deduction from his income

of $300 per dependent parent or grandparent. A taxpayer

may  claim up to a maximum of two dependent parents  or

grandparents  who  are  over  55  years  of  age,   are

supported by the taxpayer and are staying in  the  same

household.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can imagine, Sir, that I heaved a sigh of relief

at  this disclosure, even though the amount allowed was

small  but  by  no  means  significant.  At  least,  my

colleague,  the Member for Bukit Ho Swee, pleaded  with

the Finance Minister to increase the tax relief to $750

when  he pointed out on 8th March, 1973 [Vol. 32,  col.

629], that "the tax relief for a first child is $750  a

year."  In the 1974 Budget Statement, the Minister  for

Finance said [Vol. 33, col. 72, 4th March, 1974]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Last year when I announced the relief to taxpayers

for  supporting  parents  or  grandparents,  many  hon.

Members  felt  that  the  tax  deduction  at  $300  per

dependant  was  inadequate. I have  given  this  matter

further  consideration and I am happy  to  inform  hon.

Members that the relief will now be increased from $300

to  $750 per dependant. There will be no change in  the

other  conditions announced last year. The increase  in

the  relief  will  also take effect from  the  year  of

assessment 1975, that is, based on 1974 income.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may well be, Sir, that I have elaborated long

enough  on  this  question of  tax  relief  granted  to

taxpayers who have parents living with them. But I must

hasten  to add that I take no credit in convincing  our

Government  to  grant  such  reliefs.  In   fact,   the

Government should be congratulated for this magnanimous

gesture  which lays stress and encourages young couples

to have their aged parents or grandparents to live with

them.  Basically,  in the Asian society,  its  cultural

heritage  differs greatly from that of the West.  In  a

small country like ours, it would be a great benefit if

our young could be instilled in their tender years with

such  good  human values like living harmoniously  with

their grandparents and parents. In this respect, I have

visited  old  folks homes at home and abroad  and  have

come  to  the  conclusion that  filial  piety  must  be

cherished by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



working  parents  and passed down to  their  children's

children if we are to build a closely knit and cohesive

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As families become smaller within the next ten years

or  so  largely due to a certain measure the successful

implementation   of  family  planning,   and   if   the

projection of population growth is accurate enough,  we

would still have large families occupying HDB flats  in

the various estates. In this respect, I wonder how many

families would gather around for a reunion dinner  once

a  year.  This  annual dinner has its own significance.

The Government have a State Banquet each year, in which

a  select group will attend. At this function,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister and his Cabinet  colleagues

play  host.  it is refreshing for one to be invited  on

such  an auspicious occasion in which the invitees  not

only  meet but strengthen the relationship between them

and also help to establish the esprit de corps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, every year the 65 Constituency CCCs and

MCs  from the 174 community centres attend a rally  and

dinner  to  celebrate  National Day.  Here  again,  the

relationship   between   grass-root   leadership    and

government  is  further strengthened. This  is  another

example of human value worth inculcating.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would elaborate on this further when I come to the

policy changes in our Education system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now come to the question, Sir, of crime

prevention.  I would like to touch on the  question  of

growing  crime rates. I fully endorse the  Government's

will  to  mete out more severe punishment to  criminals

and drug traffickers. In fact, I would like to call  on

the  Government  to  impose both the  cane  and  longer

periods of imprisonment to such people as they  do  not

deserve any mercy. Therefore, the introduction of full-time  National  Service in the  police  force  is  most

timely  as there is a shortage of manpower.  It  is  my

hope that there shall be police stations with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



necessary manpower and up-to-date facilities as well in

all  the  HDB  estates,  though  the  Addendum  on  the

Ministry  of Home Affairs states that four new stations

will  be  built in Toa Payoh, Paya Lebar, Orchard  Road

and  Jurong Town. But whilst there are so many new  HDB

flats being built, I would suggest that plans should be

in  hand to construct more police stations in these new

estates. We have often read in the newspapers cases  of

vandalism, molest, robbery and theft, committed in  the

HDB  estates especially in the lifts. As the  President

said,  "we must make Singapore a safe and orderly place

to  live in." Thus I do not see any valid reason why we

cannot   overcome  this  problem  because,   with   the

introduction  of National Service in the  Police  Force

coupled  with  the  Community  Security  Force  of  the

Vigilante  Corps, more personnel could be  deployed  to

many  of  the more populated HDB estates.  This,  I  am

positive, will help to reduce crime and deter these bad

elements  from committing such offences as  they  would

realise  that  it is painful for them when  caught  and

found guilty of committing such an offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Addendum on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

is in line with our declared policy on foreign affairs.

Since  the  setting up of ASEAN, member countries  have

come  closer  to each other on matters of regional  and

bilateral  interest, and I can foresee that a  stronger

relationship will develop. In this respect,  I  welcome

the  formation  of  a permanent secretariat  for  ASEAN

which  will  co-ordinate  the many  regional  economic,

social and cultural projects to be implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue vital to Singapore is sea

communications. I have on several occasions  drawn  the

attention  of the House that I have received complaints

from  the  trawlers based at Kangkar in my constituency

with  regard to the harassment and piracies encountered

by  the  fishermen who risk their lives to fish in  the

waters in the South China Sea in the area near Horsburg

Lighthouse as well as in Southeast Asian



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



waters. Several trawlers and crew together with their

catches have been captured and held to ransom by so-called pirates. The fishermen are very unhappy over

this. In this respect, I would like to urge our

Government to have high-level discussions with ASEAN

countries with a view to coordinating their efforts in

keeping the waters in Southeast Asia free of piracy so

that our fishermen can earn their bread and butter

without fear of being pirated. Combined efforts and

more regular naval patrols will, I think, be a step

forward in reducing the number of piracies, if not

totally eradicate it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now refer to the Primary Production under the

Ministry  of National Development. It is heartening  to

note  that  we are self-sufficient in fresh pork,  eggs

and  poultry meats in spite of occasional shortages and

high prices of imported raw feed materials. But what is

most  unfortunate is the fact that "in conjunction with

water   resources  development,  pig  farms   will   be

relocated  into non-catchment areas" in Punggol.  As  a

result,  more than a thousand acres of land in  Punggol

have been acquired for this particular purpose. I fully

realise  the scarcity of land in Singapore and more  so

the imperative need to preserve larger areas of land as

catchment  areas  which  are  free  of  pollutants.  In

addition  to  this,  the  Defence  Ministry  also  have

similar  needs for the training of national servicemen.

Therefore, whatever vacant land, especially that  which

is marked for agricultural purpose, is acquired in this

instance. Apart from this, lands are also acquired  for

other purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land availability has become a problem for our

Government  and I believe Singapore can  ill-afford  to

have  lands not fully utilised. Optimum utilisation  of

land  available  must continue to be so,  as  Singapore

continues to develop. Therefore, it can be adduced that

land  in  Singapore is worth an inch of gold for  every

inch  of  it! Within the acquired lands in Punggol  are

many  farmers,  namely, pig, poultry  and  agricultural

farmers. Most of them are poultry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



farmers and they number several hundred families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am given to understand that only a few have been

promised  that  they  would not be  required  to  leave

whereas  the  majority of them have  been  served  with

notices to quit, and some have been promised that  they

would  be  getting a three-room Housing Board flat  for

free, including ex-gratia payments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to make a strong plea to the Hon.

Minister  concerned  as to whether his  Ministry  would

consider the requests of the numerous farmers who  have

approached me for assistance. They maintain  that  they

are  bona-fide farmers and that pig and poultry farming

is  their  only means of livelihood, and  they  request

that   they  be  allowed  to  remain  where  they  are.

Therefore,  they  state  that  they  are  prepared   to

increase  the number of pigs or poultry in their  farms

to  the  minimum requirements of the Primary Production

Department  for the simple reason that they  have  been

farming  in  the  said area since they  first  came  to

Punggol. I can hear testimony to their claim as  I  was

born   and   brought  up  in  Punggol.  I   feel   that

consideration should be given to this request  which  I

consider   reasonable,  provided  that  these   farmers

continue  to maintain the required number  of  pigs  or

poultry.  They have also pointed out to  me  that  they

would  not be able to move into a three-room  HDB  flat

given  free to them as they would have no further means

of  income,  and in that case how are they to  survive.

They also state that they are in the "evening years" of

their lives and that their children would like to  step

into  their  shoes to continue farming as  a  means  of

livelihood.  Another reason advanced by  them  is  that

there  had  been several outbreaks of swine  fever  and

poultry  diseases  in the past few years  which  almost

drained  them of their financial resources; but  thanks

to  the assistance of feed retailers and suppliers, who

gave them credit terms, they were able to survive. This

is part of the reason why some of the bona-fide farmers

reduced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



their  stock. People seem to think that pig and poultry

farming is lucrative, but I do not think so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Why

do they continue?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> If it is not lucrative, they will not

continue farming.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Why should they not continue. That is

why  they  have to reduce their stock to  keep  to  the

means that they can afford.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> If it is not lucrative they will not

want to continue farming.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Then they will enlarge their farms.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> They cannot enlarge their farms if

they keep on losing money.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I did not say that they keep on

losing  money.  There  were  occasions,  however,  when

prices had gone up and gains reaped by them. Just  like

stocks  and  shares;  they go up  and  come  down.  Who

suffers? Sir, this issue has been raised in this  House

many  times.  In fact, my colleagues who are  known  as

"rural"  MPs  are  fully aware of the farmers'  grouses

like sharp rise in prices and low prices vice-versa  of

animal/poultry  feeds as well as a  glut  in  pork  and

eggs. This has been an annual feature of the debate  in

this  House. That is the answer, Sir. In fact,  another

point my farmers raised is that all they require  is  a

small plot of land, say one-half to one acre of land to

enable  them  to survive. Resettling the families  does

not pose such a serious problem as having to resettle a

farmer  into HDB estates. These people lose out because

they have to sell whatever they have, for example, pigs

and  poultry, the price of which would be  too  low  to

salvage,  and also not taking into account the fixtures

and structures put up at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



high  cost.  A  major part of their lives  has  been

spent  in  making them what they are today.  Therefore,

they  maintain  that  the amount of  money  by  way  of

compensation or ex-gratia payments given to them  would

not help them in any way, nor change their way of life.

As  a  result;  to move into a HDB flat,  according  to

them, is like starting life all over again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I concede that in order to have potable water from

the  Kranji and Peirce reservoirs, no pollution can  be

allowed in such areas, and for this reason pig farmers,

especially in these areas, must be relocated elsewhere.

That  being  the case, I am mindful of the  advice  the

President made when he stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I am confident that in your deliberations, you will

not  be  swayed by short-term political considerations,

and  that, instead, you wilt be guided by the long-term

interests of all our people.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, would not the Hon. Minister consider that the

other aspect of having substantial parcels of lands  in

Punggol  leased  out  to people  or  enterprises  on  a

commercial  basis  with  the  necessary  expertise  and

finance  would result in giving them the monopoly  over

such  industry  and consequently create more  attendant

problems  for ourselves. I would say that  the  smaller

farms   which   are  prepared  to  meet   the   minimum

requirements  laid  down  by  the  Primary   Production

Department be allowed to occupy a smaller plot of  land

on  Temporary  Occupation Licence basis  alongside  the

capital and labour intensive commercial farms and until

such time when they lose out to the commercial farms. I

would like to suggest to the Hon. Minister to give this

problem due consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now refer to the Education system.

I  note with optimism that the Education system will be

restructured by stages with the objective  of  reducing

educational  wastage, improving teaching and  learning,

and  increasing  the  supply of  trained  teachers  and

manpower.   Moreover,   several   measures   will    be

implemented.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what worries me is the question of supply and

demand subsequent to this change. In this respect,

I  would  not hesitate to call upon the Government

to  set  up  a  high-powered Committee  preferably

headed   by   a  Minister  to  cause  a   Manpower

Distribution Research Unit established with a view

to  studying in greater depth the various needs of

manpower in the next five or ten years or more. As

I  see  it, the new Education system envisaged  is

more  technically  oriented  to  meet  our  future

industrial growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I would like to pay tribute to the Minister

for  Education in setting aside a period known  as

"Education  for  Living." I view this  with  every

seriousness  as  I  notice that  many  youths  are

either  idle  or they do not want to work  because

they come from well-to-do families as well as from

the upper middle income group. Here parents should

check  them  and encourage them to look  for  work

rather  than  to  allow them to while  away  their

precious  time  whilst they are in  the  prime  of

their  lives and to spend such time in the  coffee

lounges,  bars or night-clubs. Parents should  not

pamper  their  children by giving  them  too  much

pocket allowance. At the same time, parents should

find  some  time  to  spend with  their  children.

Therefore, Education for Living should  provide  a

basic foundation in helping to mould the character

of  our students with a sense of moral values  and

self-discipline  so that, when they  leave  school

they  will be of benefit to the society.  This  is

the  motto which they should bear in mind  at  all

times  - "I serve my country and in return I enjoy

the fruits of my labour."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to add that the Addendum to

the   Presidential  Address,  covering   all   the

Ministries, clearly indicates the ambition of  our

Government's  long-term planning  and  projections

which,   when  ultimately  completed,  will   make

Singapore a beacon of the East in which her people

live  in  peace and harmony with her  neighbouring

countries



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the

President  for the concise manner he directed  our

attention  to  our present problems and  also  the

measures the Government proposes to take in  order

to  overcome  them. The President  did  not  sound

despondent nor was he in a state of euphoria  when

he  assured  us that we would fare better  towards

the  later  part of 1975. What probably  had  made

things  look  worse  than  they  really  were  was

because we had allowed ourselves to live with  the

idea  that doomsday was around the corner, so much

so,   that  unscrupulous  businessmen  manipulated

stocks  and  prices, and indulged in profiteering.

The  President's speech, although low-keyed, is  a

refreshing change from what we were used  to  hear

in the recent past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inflation causes concern to each and everyone. We

have  learned to live with it by prudent  spending

and reducing wastage. However, I believe we should

give  priority in tackling economic recession  and

the  loss of job opportunities. Whatever available

resources there are should be utilised to  develop

our  physical assets and infrastructure. The world

is ever more confident that economic recovery will

take  place before 1976. It is imperative we  make

use  of  whatever spare resources we have  now  to

build  up  our  physical assets and to  equip  our

manpower  to spring back to activity at  a  higher

technological   level.   There    is    all    the

justification  now  to  draw  upon   our   foreign

exchange reserves for these purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, no less important to Singapore

is  the  question  of controlling  the  growth  of

population.  Industrialisation  had   its   origin

because   entrepot  trade  could  not   give   job

opportunities to the growing numbers entering  the

employment  market. Rapid urbanisation and  living

in  high-rise  flats  also became  very  necessary

because  of limited land resources. Our population

density  is  3,664  persons per square  kilometre,

about  the highest in the world. There are 529,200

women in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



fertile age group 15 to 44, and if every one of them is

to  have only two children, our population will be four

million  in 50 years' time. There is no doubt  that  we

have  to  achieve zero population growth  as  early  as

possible. Land for housing, recreation, reservoirs  and

other  uses  are  not  abundant and  limitless,  it  is

already  generally agreed, even by those who have  more

than  two  children, that Singapore  is  getting  over-crowded.  Therefore,  over-sized  families  should   be

discouraged  by  suitable disincentives and  penalties.

Industrialisation based on the concept of  availability

of  a large reservoir of low-skilled labour should have

its cut-off point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to extend pioneer industry tax

exemption from five to ten years for the most deserving

industries. It is appropriate, therefore, to grant this

tax  exemption on a selective basis to industries  with

the possibility of proceeding to a higher technological

phase in production. The intention of the Government to

offer  attractive  terms for new types  of  industries,

such as machine tools, precision instruments and petro-chemicals, is well thought and timely. This has  to  be

done  if for no other reason than the hope for a better

standard of living through higher productivity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is abundantly clear that higher wages and standard

of  living are not possible without higher productivity

at all levels. However, all too often when the question

of productivity is examined, low productivity is always

blamed  on labour. There are also managements  who  are

inept and inefficient, the Singapore Bus Service is one

of  the many. The matter of productivity is within  the

province of management. I could not do better  than  to

quote  what the Minister for Finance said in an article

in  an NTUC publication commemorating the 50th birthday

of our Honourable Prime Minister:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Fairly productive labour with bad management,

antiquated  machinery or the wrong choice of  goods  to

produce  will  lead  to  low  labour  productivity.  An

increase in labour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



productivity can result not only from better training,

more  responsibility and better health of workmen,  but

also   from   an  improvement  in  management,   modern

machinery  or  a  different  production  and  marketing

programme.  Therefore,  the  major  aspects  of  labour

productivity are in the hands of entrepreneurs.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Labour has yet to fully convince

employers  on  the question. The National  Productivity

Board  is  to  convene  a conference  to  consider  the

question of productivity and wages. This is a good move

to  look  forward  to.  However, the  attitude  of  the

National  Productivity Board as stated in the  Addendum

to   the   Presidential  Address  that  the   "National

Productivity  Board will assist those who are  prepared

to  set up productivity committees" amply describes the

feeble  attempts of the National Productivity Board  in

this direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's education policy promises among

other things:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) `Every pupil who completes primary education will

proceed  to  post-primary education and training  of  a

type best suited to his aptitude and ability.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) `The secondary curriculum will be diversified to

include   a   variety   of  vocational   training   and

apprenticeship schemes.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main object of primary and secondary education,

as I see it, is to give practical training for suitable

employment in the future for both primary and secondary

school-leavers.   The  education   that   primary   and

secondary pupils receive, however, should not make them

robots  merely  suited to carry out work  in  a  narrow

field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a worker becomes technologically

redundant,   the  Industrial  Training   Board   should

organise  the  retraining programme at  the  employer's

expense  if  it  is not possible for  the  employer  to

retrain the worker on the job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the training of our young men for

defence of our Republic, the beneficial aspect which is

recognised  by both parents and employers is character-building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to post National Servicemen to do work

related  to  their future employment after leaving  the

Army will be welcomed by those concerned. It may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



be  worthwhile  to  consider  allowing  these  National

Servicemen in appropriate engineering vocations  to  be

given  the  task  of designing and carrying  out  civil

engineering works like bridges, wharves and  piers.  Of

course,  this should be done on a limited scale.  After

all  a soldier must train and carry out military duties

first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to introduce full-time National Service

for  the  Police Force would suit some young  men,  who

would, if it were not for this scheme, be drafted  into

the  armed forces much against their liking.  The  need

for  this  new approach is apparently due  to  manpower

shortage  in the Police Force. I think it is imperative

to  enquire  why  the Police Force  is  not  attracting

suitable young men. Why is it that, of the hundreds  of

school  police cadets, so few have chosen a  career  in

the Force? Drafting young men into the Police Force  is

not  the  most logical solution to solving  the  police

manpower  problem. I have my doubts  that  the  reserve

police service will enlarge the law enforcing capacity.

I  should like to be enlightened at an appropriate time

if  these  Police national servicemen will strictly  do

patrol  work, traffic control work, some boring  static

work  or some work which would not be of practical  use

in their future employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One significant admission in the Presidential Address

is  the need to keep the family all under one roof, and

if I may quote from the text of the speech:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`My Government will take measures to make it more

attractive  for  young couples, to have  their  parents

live  with them. If nothing else, the grandparents help

in  bringing up the children whilst father  and  mother

are at work.'



<br><br>This  is a good idea and in keeping with the real Asian

tradition. Urbanisation and the construction  of  small

flats  have  been  one  of  the  main  causes  of   the

proliferation  of  the  extended  family.  Nothing  can

substitute the care and attention of parents. The  next

best  are  the grandparents. From the social  point  of

view  the  encouragement  of  interdependence  of   the

various generations is good.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has not revealed what incentives would

be  offered  to those whose parents live with  them.  I

would suggest for consideration the following:





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A higher taxation allowance than what is allowed

now be given to those who truly and adequately maintain

their parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Priority in the allocation of bigger Housing and

Development Board flats on condition that nobody in the

family  should request for an additional flat within  a

fixed period of time.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the several problems modern Singapore faces is

urban  transportation. The problem of  controlling  the

volume of traffic entering the centre of administration

and business area would have to be controlled sooner or

later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public transport, in particular the bus system, is

still   inefficient  in  terms  of  routes,  frequency,

reliability  and service. As and when  the  bus  system

improves, more and more measures could be introduced to

encourage  people to use public transport. The  present

services provided by the Singapore Bus Service  is  far

from being able to take any further demand on them. The

addition of the shuttle service from the fringes of the

Central    Business   District   into    the    central

administration  and  business area  will  be  far  from

solving  mass transportation. For the time  being,  the

use  of  private cars for travelling will  have  to  be

maintained, though on a lower scale. Congestion in  the

CBD  does  not  appear  till after  8  o'clock  in  the

morning.  In  view of this, it may not be necessary  to

introduce  the  licensing scheme till  8  o'clock.  The

suggestion is 7.30 a.m. This should allow parents,  who

are  presently  sending their children  to  school,  to

avoid  having to bear an additional expenditure  during

these hard times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bus service is far from adequate to meet the

needs  of  the ordinary people. There has been  only  a

slight  improvement, however. The  improvement  is  not

significant  enough for any party involved  in  running

the system to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>



be  given  outright compliment. The conduct of  drivers

and conductors no doubt has shown marked improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secondment of more than 100 Government and

Singapore Armed Forces personnel since August last year

is  unprecedented though most necessary. Never  has  so

many  Government  servants been  seconded  to  serve  a

private company. It does prove my point that there  are

people with the right calibre in the public service who

could  manage the public transportation system.  I  say

without  reservation  that it  is  not  in  the  public

interest  for  the bus service to be in  the  hands  of

private entrepreneurs. The bus service must be operated

as a public service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed by the Government that the Singapore

Bus  Service be converted into a public limited company

with Government having a shareholding when it is firmly

established.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be happy if the House could he informed what

percentage   of  the  shares  will  be  held   by   the

Government. Will the new SBS be run to make the highest

possible  profit? What is the maximum  dividend  to  be

paid to the shareholders?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had proposed in the last session of this Parliament

that   there   should   be  established   a   statutory

corporation  to  run the bus service on a  co-operative

basis with the Government and other suitable parties as

shareholders.  Since it is operated on  a  co-operative

principle, profit-taking could be limited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should be happy if the new SBS is run with the

objective  to  serve the public interest and  that  the

highest possible re-investment is made to give the best

service to the bus-travelling public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree in principle that the Government should

discourage the use of private cars for ordinary travel.

The  need for any family to have more than one  car  is

questioned. In the same vein, the practice of tendering

for  car registration numbers of a low order by  people

in high society should not be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>



encouraged any more by the Registry of Vehicles. Social

snobbery amongst car owners is not in keeping with  the

art  of graceful living. If it can be described at all,

it  is  conspicuous  consumption and obscene-living  in

style. Why accentuate social tension?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are examples of harmful styles

for  our  young  generation to  imitate.  This  is  the

society  we  create. How much can we blame the  present

generation.  First,  we must demotivate  ourselves.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, in conjunction with this view, I could do

no  better than to quote the Secretary-General  of  the

National Trades Union Congress, Mr Devan Nair:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Those who live and lead in the opening years of the

21st  century are already in our charge today,  in  our

schools, our classrooms, and our playing fields. If  we

truly love them, and desire a better world for them, we

must  motivate them for a new and better  world.  Which

means   that   we  must  de-motivate  them   from   the

aberrations  and  the  insensate  hostilities  and  the

antagonisms of our times.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do we do this?" he asked. "We would, in brief,

have  to  de-motivate  ourselves,  before  we  can  re-motivate our children for the future".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I support the Motion of the

Member for Kim Keat.



<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the President's speech

clearly  reflects that after 16 years of administration

our  leadership is still preserving its usual  practice

of down-to-earth pragmatism. They have not for the sake

of  short term political objectives neglected the  long

term interests of the people. The policy for the coming

year not only thinks in terms of the younger generation

but  also  cares for the welfare of the aged so  as  to

ensure  that their livelihood in their remaining  years

may be properly protected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President says that 1975 will be a busy year for

the  Members  of  Parliament. From the point  of  civil

service,  we can say that 1975 will also be a  year  in

which  their  duties will be heavier, because  all  the

important measures and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>



policies   after  the  deliberation  and   passage   of

Parliament will have to be implemented by them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our independence, it is only a matter of 10-odd

years.  To  a country, a decade may not be too  long  a

time.  However,  we  have  been  able  to  make  marked

progress  and  achievements in  the  fields  of  socio-economy,  education, construction and others which  are

not only publicly acknowledged by all the people of our

country  but  have  also brought  to  us  international

renown. The main reason for this is that, while in  our

effort  for progress and survival, we have also at  the

same  time developed and built up a sound and efficient

administrative system with all the main departments and

statutory  boards  on  the  whole  able  to  match  the

determination and policies of the leadership,  actively

promoting and realising our plan for nation building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the juncture of transition from old to new and in

our efforts for progress, particularly in recent years,

some  traditional service departments in order to  meet

changing  objective environment and  needs  have  often

been reorganised or changed, some departments have even

been changed to statutory boards. On the other hand, we

have   also   set   up  a  number  of   non-traditional

independent organisations. What is most obvious is that

in  the  course of promoting economic development,  the

Government  has  under the Companies Act  set  up  some

commercial organisations in order to promote some  non-traditional  commercial and industrial  activities.  In

principle,  these organisational changes  are  actually

necessary. However, in the course of changes there have

arisen some organisational aberrations and signs of ill-feeling  on  the part of the people. Under the  present

public  service and economic development system,  there

seem to be the following shortcomings:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Each one in his own, or minding one's own business.



<br><br>On   the   one  hand,  statutory  boards  and  national

enterprises  registered under the  Companies  Act  have

increased in number greatly. Each statutory board has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>



its  legally  defined  position  and  power  and  every

Government   commercial   or  industrial   organisation

registered under the Companies Act also has its special

objectives and scope of activities. On the other  hand,

various  traditional Government departments  also  have

their separate rights and functions. These changes to a

certain  degree  might have brought about  symptoms  of

dismemberment  and  complication to our  administrative

entity.  This is because when promoting their  separate

policies  these separate units seem to lack  the  basic

consciousness   for  mutual  arrangement   and   mutual

coordination  and  cooperation.  Had  there  been   any

cooperation and coordination, it was mainly  accidental

and  not  due  to  any  unity or  planning  in  nature.

Therefore,  amidst  this trend of  each  looking  after

himself   alone,  there  are  bound   to   take   place

manifestations  of  mutual contradiction,  dislocation,

wastage  and delay very often leaving with the populace

the feeling that the left hand knows not what the right

hand  is  doing.  Some  obvious and  frequent  examples

include  tackling  the  question  of  reducing  traffic

congestion  in the inner city; in view  of  a  lack  of

coordination of the departments concerned in respect of

the  personnel  and  the  techniques  involved  a  much

confused situation has resulted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Wastage of personnel and resources.



<br><br>Under separate administration, every organisation tries

its   best  to  realise  its  objectives,  on  its  own

viewpoint. This might cause contradiction and  friction

among   the  departments  and  organisations  concerned

unwittingly  and would inevitably lead  to  duplication

and unnecessary loss and wastage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, in the usage of computers, there are up

to  now at least four or five units making use of  this

facility. In view of the expensiveness of this sort  of

equipment,  and in addition, shortage of  personnel  to

man it, if a scheme for centralised usage is adopted by

jointly setting up a computer service centre, I believe

that  expenses will be reduced not only in the  initial

period but also in the long run. And because of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



the  pooling of personnel and resources and  collective

planning resulting in the benefit of considered opinion

there will be more effective raising of our standard of

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is the question of land. According to

present  experience, there seems  to  be  some  quarrel

among some departments or organisations concerned about

the  usage of land. Under the present system,  although

we  have  in  existence the Land Office,  however  this

department is not the only authority that exercises the

control   of   state  land  and  the  power   of   land

acquisition.  There are some other establishments  such

as  the  Jurong Town Corporation, the Port of Singapore

Authority,  Housing  and Development  Board  and  Urban

Renewal  Authority Board which possess  equal  or  even

greater  statutory  power in this respect.  This  might

cause  friction among the various departments and would

expose the inherent contradiction of the Government  in

dealing  with land policies. In this respect,  we  must

strive  for  the realisation of comprehensive  planning

and  control  in order to ensure that the limited  land

may   be   distributed  and  utilised  rationally   and

effectively in the most economical and sound way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Excessive commercialisation.



<br><br>In  the  course of promoting our national economy,  for

various reasons the traditional service departments and

non.  traditional organisations have all tended towards

the target of financial self-management and sufficiency

and  the  accumulation of profits, thus neglecting  the

main  task  of service to the people. If we  turn  `the

pages of some official annual financial reports, it may

not  be difficult to discover in them the jubilant mood

in  between  the  lines in addition to the  reports  on

increasing  rates of expenditure and  profits.  With  a

purely  commercial organisation, this might  not  incur

any  quarrel. However, with a governmental organisation

whose  main task is to serve the people, this  kind  of

philosophical   concept  needs  to  be   reviewed   and

criticised,  Excessive  commercialisation  might  bring

about unnecessary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



competition  and friction among various organisations

concerned and increase the burden of the people.  There

is  another indication that some Government departments

for  the  sake  of ensuring their respective  interests

have even come to levy charges on other departments. In

the  end it is only the taxpayers and the broad  masses

that suffer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, many Government organisations possess the

power and freedom to adjust their charges, although  in

the  past few years the Budget Statements presented  by

the  Finance Minister to Parliament had invariably been

called  painless ones. But, in fact, in the  course  of

every  financial year, the charges for  many  items  of

public services had been raised directly or indirectly,

causing  the burden of livelihood of the people  to  be

heavier  and  heavier  year by year.  Most  departments

claim increased costs as the chief reason.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our Government is calling upon all the people

to  tighten their belts and to concertedly overcome the

threats  of  inflation  and economic  depression,  this

solitary  reason  may not easily  be  under.  stood  or

accepted  by the people. Under reasonable circumstances

and  conditions, we do not possibly as a whole deny the

elements  of commerce in some state organisations,  but

this  should stop appropriately where it should, so  as

not   to  spoil  the  good  relationship  between   the

Government and the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The growing practice of bureau-cratism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, various departments and organisations

in  our country, in trying to meet the rapid social and

economic  developments and needs,  have  met  with  the

problem  of shortage of personnel. In addition, because

of  the  buoyancy  of  the  commercial  and  industrial

enterprises  in  the private sector, capable  personnel

have  been recruited on high salaries, thus making  the

problem  more  acute  and  causing  a  high  degree  of

mobility   of   various  categories  of  employees   in

government  organisations. This  has  resulted  in  the

various  units  not being able to reach a  standard  of

stability and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



desired   situation  in  respect  of  supervision   and

training  of personnel. Under these circumstances,  the

standard  of service by our country would naturally  go

down,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policies fixed by the various departments are

meant  for  actual  execution.  However,  during  their

implementation,  because many civil servants  have  not

received  adequate  training and  also  lack  a  proper

understanding  of the right spirit of service,  in  the

end  they  have  often made the people disappointed  as

well  as  dissatisfied. In order to implement  speedily

some   important   measures,  some   departments   have

authorised  their executors the power of  ticketing  on

the  spot.  If  these executors are  well  trained  and

imbued  with  sympathy,  then  they  will  be  able  to

exercise their authority in a fair manner in the proper

circumstances  and conditions. However,  unfortunately,

many  executors  often abuse their  power.  They  often

threaten  to ticket a person on the slightest  pretext.

There is absolutely no reasoning or flexibility to talk

about.  In dealing with the people, some civil servants

also often show their impatience, especially in dealing

with  those  fellow  compatriots of  lower  educational

level their manners are even more rude. In dealing with

matters,  they  totally disregard  the  difficulty  and

inconvenience  of  the  "small"  citizens.   Even   for

ordinary matters, they would cause the people  to  turn

up  at  the department concerned several times to  wait

for enquiry, wasting much valuable time of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, if faced with somewhat complicated matters,

some executors usually evade their duties and resort to

their  usual tactic of playing Tai-chi boxing, shifting

the  problem  to some other department or  saying  that

they  are  going  to  see  a certain  MP.  Even  on  an

obviously   simple  matter  of  principle,  they   will

likewise push the responsibility to a third person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all these incidents that I have

pointed  out  are actual facts. I believe  many  fellow

Backbenchers feel the same as I do.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is bureaucratism on the growth. If we do not

destroy  it  in  time,  if  we  do  not  rectify   this

undesirable  manifestation quickly, then we  will  face

the   increasing   ill-feeling  of  the   people,   and

consequently the political confidence that  the  people

have  in  the Party in power over the past decade  will

certainly suffer unnecessary damage. During last year's

debate  on  the  Budget,  many Backbenchers  made  some

criticisms  on the organisational structure and  spirit

of service of the Central Complaints Bureau. I hope the

Government will take positive action to deal with  this

matter to enable this organisation to shoulder the duty

of supervision more effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the shadow of world economic depression, future

conditions   will   be   more  complicated   and   more

unpredictable than in the past. Therefore, the Party in

office  should  review  and reassess  its  dealings  in

internal    and    external   affairs.    The    future

administrative   slogan  should  be  anti-wastage   and

improving efficiency. Therefore, we must take practical

steps  to strengthen and promote the coordination among

various departments and organisations so that the whole

Government  service  system  may  continue  in  a  more

rational  way. On the other hand, we should all  firmly

bear in mind that the stability of a country depends on

the  close  tripartite coordination  of  the  political

leadership,  the Government administrative organisation

and  all  the  people. If one of the three is  missing,

then  the  development of the whole will  be  seriously

hampered.  Therefore, we must oppose bureaucratism  and

avoid  unnecessary  political  ill-feeling.  We  should

strengthen   the   education  of  the  civil   service,

irrespective  of  whether one is of a  higher  rank  or

lower  rank. We must establish in the civil servants  a

healthy spirit and attitude for service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Motion.



<br><br>4.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

to  endorse most firmly the Motion of Thanks  moved  by

the Member for Kim Keat. The speech



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



which   the  President  delivered  on  behalf  of   the

Government  represents a succinct statement of  policy,

elaborated  in  the various addenda pertaining  to  the

different  Ministries. The contents  of  this  combined

statement  have a comprehensive reference. Many  issues

have been touched upon and problems and tasks outlined.

As  the  President's Address will have it, with perhaps

characteristic understatement, "there will be  much  to

keep Honourable Members busy in 1975."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shakespeare spoke of the famous Egyptian queen,

Cleopatra, as one whom age could not wither nor  custom

stale  her infinite variety. When one views the variety

of  problems  the Government-party in  power  has  been

confronted  with  since 1959; when  one  considers  the

multitude  of  issues the present Government  has  been

involved  with  since  it  assumed  office;  when   one

remembers   the   freshness  and  even   audacity   and

determination, with which it has set about  its  tasks,

then it is not a romantic embellishment, or any kind of

verbal  liberty,  to say that custom cannot  stale  the

infinite  variety of the responses which our Government

contrives  to meet all sorts of situations  it  has  to

face. Indeed the changes we have brought about can only

be described as revolutionary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet so many people take for granted, or have become

over-accustomed to, the performance of  the  Government

amidst  its concern for the development of our  people.

This concern has not been characterised by sentiment or

undue  emotion or incorporated in extravagantly phrased

political  manifesto; this concern has  been  rational,

cool, expressing interest in long term consequences and

lasting benefits. It is in this way that the revolution

the  party-in-power  initiated 20 years  ago  has  been

continued  and  maintained, and  this  Government  must

continue  to  monitor the change and  progress  of  our

society  towards  a  more and  more  stable  and  happy

polity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I suggest that the Government has presently

to  be  specially watchful and jealous in  safeguarding

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



standards  of service and achievement that have  always

characterised  its  actions, actions  which  have  been

supported  by  a  people described in  the  President's

Address as "responsive to collective needs".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within our community, general standards have recently

faced  the danger of some erosion - a danger  of  which

the  Government  is  only too  well  aware.  The  Prime

Minister has himself recently remarked, for example, on

the poor quality of finish in the building industry. No

doubt  where  this particular detail  is  concerned,  a

suitable response will be contrived. For we note in the

Addendum   pertaining  to  the  Ministry  of   National

Development that programmes to train and upgrade skills

in the building industry are being planned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This aspect is, however, only a symptom of a more

general potential malaise

-  namely,  the  danger  of people  succumbing  to  the

temptation  of accepting lower standards as  being  the

easy  way  out, within the circumstances of  relatively

hectic development. Because of rapid development, and a

comparatively  good  development  achievement  (despite

adverse  world economic conditions) the temptation  has

been  strong  to being easily satisfied with  chin-chye

work, so long as it is speedily done. The temptation to

give  in  to  an insidious complacence and  inclination

towards making short work of things have not been  easy

to resist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And certainly we must resist the tendency to tolerate

lower standards. For example, those in charge of making

or servicing our roads should not be satisfied with the

present standards considering how easily wear and  tear

affects  road surfaces and how poorly the  patching  is

done.  For example, again, consider how so many  people

get away with petty to serious infringement of the law,

as  in  the  case  of  large  numbers  of  overspeeding

vehicles  or  smoky  vehicles.  Again,  there  is   the

continuing   possibility  of  improvement  that   still

remains  in  respect of service at various counters  in

government offices or institutions that deal  with  the

public.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not the most suitable

juncture  to  catalogue further  illustrations  of  the

dangers of lowering standards that confront us in  many

aspects  of  our living, and even of our  learning  and

working and training and earning and perhaps buying and

selling,  and  so  forth. In fact, the opportunity  for

such  detailed  comment will be given  to  Backbenchers

very  shortly  when Parliament goes into  Committee  of

Supply. But the point has to be made about the possible

threat  to  the realisation of an ideal we have  talked

about  regarding  a  higher quality  of  life  for  our

citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not be inappropriate to mention here that

quality is not equated merely with material betterment.

However, we should remember too that, according to  the

most respectable social psychologists, people will  not

want to strive for the fulfilment of their higher needs

until  their most basic needs like survival and freedom

from want have been adequately assured. This freedom we

have  succeeded  in  giving the vast  majority  of  our

people  ample  assurance  of.  However,  we  must  also

remember  that among us there are still  many  such  as

those who live in their one-room flats and earn just  a

little more than enough perhaps to keep them free  from

the  fear  of physical deprivation and free  from  fear

about  the  predictability of their  incomes.  We  must

continue to do all to ensure that the general level  of

living for these people is raised to a level where they

will  more  and  more have time and the  motivation  to

think  of a sense of belongingness, to think of wanting

to relate to their neighbours and to their environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt therefore that the first business

of  government is to continue to attend to what it  has

always  considered to be its basic task  -  namely,  to

increase the size of the economic cake in such a manner

as to ensure (besides other things) a bigger income (in

real  terms) for those in the lower income groups.  And

to supplement this with housing, hospital, recreational

and  various services. Attention to other  needs  on  a

more sophisticated level of want



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



follows only when the basic task has been done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of this order of quality of life, the

achievement  of government has been respectable.  In  a

consideration of income by house-hold heads for 1966 we

find  66.7% earned below $250 per month. For  1972,  an

ECAFE  survey  noted that 32% earned  below  $250.  The

percentage  of those earning more than $250  rose  from

roughly  just  over 30% in 1966 to just  under  70%  in

1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we try to identify our population by social class

groupings an ECAFE survey tells us that just under  70%

of  those surveyed in 1972 considered themselves middle

and upper class by self-identification. If one reckoned

by   more  objective  criteria  of  income,  education,

occupation  and  housing  conditions,  distribution  by

socio-economic  status would be: about 58%  middle  and

upper class, 42% lower class. This does not represent a

picture  of  economic degradation and  oppression  that

some commentators have tried to convey.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What it does represent is a challenge to improve the

conditions  of our people further, and to add  wherever

we  can  a  component that is related to the growth  of

graciousness in our community, graciousness as  may  be

principally  discerned in a concern for the  human  and

physical  environment, and for spiritual  and  cultural

values.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This graciousness has nothing to do with being able

to   spend   money  on  spacious  accommodation,   posh

appurtenances,   and  evidence  of   luxury.   It   has

everything  to  do  with regard and respect  for  right

conduct which all can afford. There is fair evidence of

the lack of this regard and respect in many, especially

of our young people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the President's Address laments the fact that

a  generation is growing up that wants the good  things

in  life,  but  without working to pay for  them.  This

attitude  is,  of course, reprehensible.  But  to  what

extent  are  the elders of our society also responsible

for  contributing  to  the  delinquency  of  our  young

people.  Have we not held up money, frequently  enough,

as a shining



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



criterion of success, even with the consequence of  one

of  our Ministers contributing for almost international

circulation the coinage "moneytheism".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A torn bank note features in a TV slot advertising

the  advantages of family planning. In advertising  the

sale  of  our official lottery, desire for property  is

the key incentive offered. Even when the races are over

at  Bukit  Timah, the traffic policemen will show  more

consideration to those leaving the racecourse  than  to

the hundreds of motorists who will be held up in a long

jam  on  Dunearn Road for the convenience of those  who

are dejectedly returning from their orgy of gambling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our cinemas and TV shows frequently give oblique

recommendations   to   violence   for   the   sake   of

covetousness. Meanwhile our interest in finer things is

expressed  by our giving relatively almost  nothing  to

the  National Museum, which we claim will serve as  "an

educational  centre  devoted to the  art,  history  and

anthropology of the peoples of this region." Presumably

all this will come about merely by our uncharacteristic

subscription to the idea that the best things  in  life

are free.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore all the more refreshing to notice a

recommendation to filial virtue in the reference in the

President's  Address to intended measures "to  make  it

more attractive for young couples to have their parents

live  with them". The relevant paragraph even  ends  by

conjuring the domestic portrait of grandma and  grandpa

helping  in  bringing  up children  whilst  father  and

mother  are  at work. Oh, Mr Speaker, Sir,  would  that

such  human touches obtrude more often in our otherwise

dispassionate official statements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While concern for the problems of the old represents

the most warmly human touch in the President's Address,

other concerns related to the welfare of the people are

expressed,  among  which must  feature  of  course  the

problem, as the Member for Kallang has pointed out,  of

public transport.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that the public transport system

seems  now to be sailing on less rough waters.  At  one

time  it looked like it was going to be torpedoed.  But

rescue  operations have been ably carried out. However,

the  bus service still may be likened to a vessel  that

has  been buffeted somewhat by the storm. We hope  that

it  will emerge from port in a few years' time - clean,

trim and serving effectively. Indeed, this has to be so

if  we  are  successfully  to  wean  away  people  from

excessive dependence on private vehicles. In 10  years'

time,  people should indeed be seen to prefer  to  take

public transport. They should indeed deem going by  bus

convenient,  pleasant  and a journey  which  affords  a

commuter time to look more often at the environs  of  a

more   attractive  Singapore.  We  should  succeed   in

bringing this about by the mid 80s - otherwise our mass

rapid transit system will not get off the ground. Worse

still,  we  will not have succeeded in growing  out  of

being  a  community  of  selfish  individualistic   car

drivers who insist on their private convenience at  the

risk  of choking the city with traffic jams and choking

people with pollution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to this particular aspect of our experience

is  the  note in the President's speech that we have  a

Government  that  is  prepared to  take  action  before

things  get  out  of hand. The action  that  Government

takes  has  always  to be within the  circumstances  of

people  understanding Government policy. The  important

factor   in   the   facility  with   which   Government

communicates with the people is education,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we think of education as meaning only formal

schooling, then quite large numbers of our people would

have  been left out. Although our literacy rate  is  an

average of about 70%, this is composed out of about 80%

for  males and 60% for females. About 40% of our  women

and   20%   of   our  men  would  lack   the   literacy

qualification to understand our message if we  gave  it

through the written word. This written word would  only

reach  the younger elements of our population, many  of

whom are still in school.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk of education, we must therefore mean

also  the  kind of non-formal means that would  include

our  mass campaigns and the informal messages  that  go

out  through TV, Radio, the community centres  and  the

citizens committees. This sort of education is for  the

civic  side of the development of our people.  For  the

vocational  side,  or  for  the  occupational  or  even

professional side of our people's development,  let  us

examine  the statement that says, "The primary duty  of

government is to establish a society in which  everyone

has  an  equal chance to live, learn, train,  work  and

earn to the best of his or her ability."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunities are many for our citizens to learn to

live their lives to the full, and to develop their work

capacity   to   their  best  advantage.  However,   the

motivation  for  learning, as I have witnessed  it,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, is almost wholly for hoped-for  material

gain. Mixed with other motivating drives, like the urge

for  cultural development or for the acquisition  of  a

gracious outlook, the expectation of some more material

benefit  is  not  at all reprehensible.  :But  if  this

expectation  is  about all there  is  in  the  urge  to

acquire  knowledge, then we will constantly go back  to

square one of moneytheism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One retarding factor in the way our people regard

education mainly for the material returns to education,

one  socially retarding factor is the almost idolatrous

attitude towards paper qualifications. A certificate is

looked  upon as a written guarantee to better  economic

returns.  Not  a few who have joined the civil  service

have  sadly equated their university qualification with

administrative talent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This certificate syndrome represents a gross

superstition which we should do all we can  to  dispel.

While  qualifications are not unimportant, an appointee

vindicates  the  choice of him by his employer  through

work, dedication and proven ability. It is how a person

makes  use  of  his  education  that  is  important  to

society.  Education is not terminal.  The  end  of  one

phase is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



beginning of another, and this goes on throughout life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the formal structure of our education

system  -  necessarily so- the idea that  education  is

terminal   and  even  final  takes  root  too   easily.

Throughout   all   the  streaming   and   phasing   and

labyrinthine  ways of our education  system  one  point

should  constantly  be stressed  -  and  that  is  that

schooling  ends,  but education goes  on.  There  is  a

Chinese proverb that goes roughly like this: "Ten years

to  grow a tree; a hundred years to grow a man".  [Shih

nien  hsu  mu,  pai nien hsu jen.] it is good  that  we

constantly bear this wisdom in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to support the Motion of Thanks moved by the

Member for Kim Keat.



<br><br>4.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru) (in Mandarin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to rise in support

of the Motion moved by the Member for Kim Keat to thank

the  President  for his speech. Since  independence  we

have  been  actively  engaged in  industrialisation  in

order  to  meet the economic problems of  our  country.

Today the whole world has been affected by the economic

recession  and  naturally we  have  also  suffered  the

effects of this recession. But we are fortunate in that

we  have  managed to achieve a 7% growth  rate  in  our

economy   last  year.  This  is  the  result   of   the

enlightened leadership of our Government and  the  hard

work  of  our people. Had it not been for the foresight

and  drive of our Government, the situation today would

have been a very difficult one indeed. A new era and  a

new   situation  require  new  policies  to  meet   new

problems.  In order to promote the economic development

of  our  country so that we can meet the recession,  we

have to extend the period for tax exemption relief from

five  to ten years. This is indeed correct. It is  only

by  doing  this that we can promote the most  deserving

types of new industries. But in taking this measure  we

should not overlook the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



existing small-scale and medium-scale industries  which

are  also full of potential. We should do our  best  to

help  these  industries to develop so that we  will  be

able to achieve economic recovery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the present Employment Act

stipulates  that youths of 14 to 16 years  must  obtain

the  permission of the Commissioner for  Labour  before

they  can  be employed in a factory. This is to  ensure

that  their safety and health are protected. But  facts

tell  us that a social problem has been created.  Those

who  have stopped schooling and with nothing to do tend

to waste their time on the streets. Very often they mix

with  the wrong company and commit crimes; and this  is

how  juvenile  delinquency comes about. Therefore,  the

Ministry of Labour intends to amend the legislation  in

this  respect.  This  is the correct  thing  to  do.  I

believe  this will help to reduce the rate of  juvenile

delinquency and also increase the supply of our labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, about 45% of our people are now

living in Housing Board flats and the demand for  these

flats  is  increasing all the time. However, there  are

many  people living in these flats who do not know  one

another.  This  is especially so in the case  of  young

working  couples. The Government is trying to encourage

young couples to live with their parents. This will not

only  solve the problem of the old people but  it  will

also provide the opportunity for working parents to get

somebody  to look after their children. This will  also

help the people to cultivate the virtue of filial piety

and  encourage  the  development of traditionally  good

family concepts. This will help to reduce crimes in our

Housing Board estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the task of the Police Force is to

ensure  the  safety of our people and  to  act  against

crime. This task is sacred as it protects the lives and

property of our people. But all along the Police  Force

has been undermanned. Its task is indeed very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



difficult  because  with increasing  urbanisation  the

crime rate rises. In the recent past, without the  help

of the CSF National Servicemen the situation would have

been  much  worse. Therefore, the policy to take  full-time  National Servicemen into the Police  Force  is  a

wise  one. Undoubtedly this will increase the  strength

of  the  Police Force in combating crimes which are  on

the increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on behalf of my constituents, I would like to

thank  the  staff of the Queenstown Police Station  for

their  good  work  in preserving law and  order  in  my

constituency and for speedily solving a number of crime

cases  in  the area. They have also acted  in  time  to

smash a newly formed secret society in my constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Motion.



<br><br>4.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Chiang Hai Ding -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chiang Hai Ding (Ulu Pandan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Motion standing

in the name of the Member for Kim Kent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech last Friday evening, the President

emphasised  the  great  effect of  external  events  on

Singapore when he said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Provided there is no war and another oil embargo or

other  major catastrophe, Singaporeans will  adjust  to

slower growth rates.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External events led to the establishment and the

development of Singapore. It is not my intention  today

to provide hon. Members with a tourist-guide history of

Singapore.  The proximity of the Raffles  Professor  of

History,  the Member for Alexandra, on my  left,  is  a

deterrent  for  which hon. Members  will  no  doubt  be

grateful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it cannot be doubted that conditions in the

19th  century in China, India and elsewhere  in  South-east  Asia  persuaded  our forefathers  that  Singapore

offered  greater  opportunities for a better  life  for

themselves and their families. They, and those who came

after them, created what we have in Singapore today.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Republic can take just pride in our achievements

when   we   compare  ourselves  with  other   countries

possessing vaster land areas, larger populations and an

abundance of natural resources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world today, especially in the last 18 months,

has become an even more interdependent one. There is no

escape from the effects of inflation and recession,  of

mounting  unemployment and in many cases of terror  and

violence   visited   upon   the   innocent   and    the

unsuspecting.   In   fact,   Singapore   has   suffered

relatively  little  from these afflictions  considering

how exposed a country we are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are exposed because, firstly, traditionally we are

an  entrepot port. Secondly, we are also a  centre  for

transport  and communications. Thirdly, since  the  PAP

formed  the  government in 1959  we  have  embarked  on

becoming  a manufacturing centre, selling our wares  to

the  world. Fourthly, since the decision to do  so  was

taken  in  1968  we are well on the way to  becoming  a

financial  centre. And now we are aiming  to  become  a

brains centre as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these developments result in the increasing

interaction  of  Singapore with other  countries.  What

happens   in   these  countries  must   inevitably   be

transmitted to us. Not all external developments affect

us  adversely. In fact, the reverse often is the  case.

When  other countries prosper, so do we. However,  when

they  suffer  high oil prices, high rates of  interest,

low   commodity  prices  and  a  slowdown  of  economic

activity,  we in turn suffer with them. To  put  it  in

another  way, when the world has the flu we can  hardly

hope to escape from catching a cold.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to what extent we suffer does depend on

ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Republic has interactions not only economically

but  also  politically with other  countries.  In  some

instances,  the  two  do  not  go  hand  in  hand.  The

Southeast  Asian  political  scene  has  changed   very

dramatically  in the last few years. The  American  and

Western



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



military  presence is diminishing. It is in the  nature

of   power  politics  that  other  powers,  greater  or

smaller,  will seek to establish positions of influence

since  hegemony  is  not possible.  The  President  has

referred to the important role that ASEAN can  play  to

strengthen  stability and peace in the region,  by  not

permitting   external  powers  to  exploit  differences

between  the  five  of  us:  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  the

Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our country is not only affected by external economic

and  political developments. It is likewise exposed  to

social  and  cultural influences from abroad,  such  as

long hair, high heel boots, broad belts, jeans and  the

like - I refer only to men's fashions since we have  at

the  present  time, no lady hon. Members. We  are  also

exposed to the international traffic in drugs which  is

more pernicious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we cannot shut our doors and windows upon the

outside  world, for that would be the  end  of  us.  We

cannot isolate ourselves. To survive and to progress we

have  to  keep  our minds open; we have to  learn  from

others, to adapt and to modernize.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people reject modernization because they equate

it  with  westernization.  However,  we  can  modernize

without sacrificing our Asian identity. Some years ago,

the Professor of Malay Studies, Dr Syed Hussein Alatas,

explained  to  me the difference between modernization,

which he applauded, and westernization, about which  he

was  suspicious. Said the Professor: `To  have  running

water  in your home is modernization. But to install  a

long-bath  and then stand in it to have a shower,  that

is westernization.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to confine my remarks today about our

young  Singaporeans,  on how to  equip  them  with  the

proper values to survive, progress and enjoy life in  a

world   that   has   become  increasingly   tough   and

competitive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum on the Ministry of Education, the

President   referred  to  the  restructuring   of   the

educational system



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>



and  the  need  for in-service courses  to  familiarise

principals and teachers with the philosophy of the  new

system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had so many changes in the system of

education in Singapore that perhaps we ought to declare

a  moratorium to see what structure we have got  before

further  restructuring. However, other Members  of  the

House,  such  as  my  colleagues from  Moulmein,  Telok

Blangah,  Paya Lebar and Jurong are more  familiar  and

competent to deal with the subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned, however, with the values that our

children are growing up with. What kind of values  will

they possess at the end of a six- or now perhaps seven-year primary school education? If I may say my piece, I

am  in  favour of seven years. What will our children's

perception  be  at  the end of another  four  years  of

secondary school and then, if they make the grade, of a

further two years Pre-University schooling?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not touch on university education which is

different in nature and concept and generates  problems

of a different kind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We became a sovereign state less than ten years ago.

We  are  literally a nation without a history,  without

memories,  such  as the Chinese, Japanese  and  Koreans

have  of each other, or the English, French and German,

to  take another example. So, despite the existence  of

the  largest British naval base outside of the  British

Isles   in  Singapore  and  its  fall  and  Singapore's

military occupation by the Japanese Imperial Forces for

three  and a half years. there were still people a  few

years ago, parents of young Singaporeans, who asked why

we needed the Singapore Armed Forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore perturbed by the decision of the

Ministry  of  Education  to  scrap  history  from   the

curriculum. Not because I used to teach the subject,  I

no   longer  do,  but  because  I  believe  that  every

Singapore  child  must know what  are  his  roots,  the

antiquity and cultural



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>



richness  of the lands whence his forefathers came.  He

will  want to know how his parents and himself came  to

be  in  Singapore  and why it is a multiracial  society

with four official languages. As he or she rides in the

NTUC  bus  he should know who were Raffles,  Balestier,

Boon  Keng, Hong Lim or Kuo Chuan. He must know himself

and be able to identify with Singapore. This, alas,  is

gone when the retrograde step of abolishing history  in

schools was taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have nothing against the new subject "Education for

Living"  which  my friend, the Parliamentary  Secretary

for  Education, who sits in front of me made  available

to  me. It is taught in the mother tongue of the  child

which  is  a good thing. However, it appears  to  be  a

course  in  community-living and is  not  designed  for

nation-building.  It  is therefore  no  substitute  for

history.   Both  could  be  included  in   the   school

curriculum:  the one to give our children the  cultural

ballast  which  our leaders so often  talk  about,  the

other  to engender the civic consciousness to ease  the

strains  and  stresses of living in  a  congested  city

state.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young and ourselves as well, not so young, are

constantly  reminded  that  nobody  owes  Singapore   a

living.  Each and every one has to earn his keep.  That

is  fine. Only by facing up to this hard fact  of  life

and sharpening our competitive edge can we survive in a

very tough world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But life is not just a ratrace. Let us leave that

race  to  the rats. There must be other things in  life

besides  the struggle for more and more of the material

things of life.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Chiang Hai Ding -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chiang Hai Ding:</b> I am at one with the Member for

Kallang  when he raised the subject of small digit  car

numbers.  What  can young minds conclude from  learning

that  Mr XYZ paid the Government so many hundred or  so

many  thousand  dollars to be able  to  use  a  certain

licence  number plate. They will not, I fear,  conclude

that Mr XYZ has a heart of gold, although



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>



I  am  told the money goes to charity. I fear that  the

children will conclude that the done thing is  to  show

your friends that not only can you afford a bigger  car

than  they  but that you can also afford a small  digit

number plate to go with it. This is two-upmanship which

we should hardly like to see, much less encourage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud the statement in the President's Address that

the  Government wilt make it more attractive for  young

couples  to have their parents live with them. As  many

Members  have pointed out, we are an Asian  society  in

which elders are regarded with respect, and rightly so.

Family  unity is a cornerstone of our social  stability

and a strong factor in preventing the disruption of our

Asian way of life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we care not for our parents then we set an example

for  our  children not to care for us as  we  grow  old

which,  alas,  we  must.  I  recall  a  story  from  my

childhood  that  the  head of a household  fashioned  a

wooden  bowl for his aged father to use as the old  man

kept  breaking the ordinary rice bowl. One day he found

his  young  son chipping away at a piece of wood.  When

questioned the little boy replied that he was making  a

wooden  bowl for his father to use when he  became  old

like grandfather. The father, thus shamed, gave the old

man ordinary rice bowls to use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to carry on, but we in Singapore are a

singular example of a nation state - modernizing, Asian

and multiracial. Our economic problems and those of the

rest  of the world notwithstanding, let us keep it that

way for our children. And let us try to pass on to them

something  of that "graciousness" referred  to  in  the

Addendum on the Ministry of Culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where else but in Singapore can we find an ethnic

Indian,   born   in  India,  educated   in   Singapore,

possessing  a  Science degree from  the  University  of

Singapore  (a  Master's degree in Marine  Biology)  and

writing beautiful love poems to his ethnic Chinese wife

in an English language magazine? I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



propose to read out his poems today but, in view of the

forthcoming  visit of our Foreign Minister  to  Peking,

perhaps  Mr Speaker and hon. Members will bear with  me

if I read three lines:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the east, where there is sunrise

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mind must turn for the beginning

of the world, in which only love matters.

<div align="right">(Chandran Nair, Her World, February 1975, p. 27)</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poems are published in a local women's magazine.

This is perhaps appropriate, considering that 1975  has

been  designated United Nation's International  Women's

Year. I hope that the additional fact that this is also

the  Year  of the Rabbit, which does not stop  at  two,

will  not  create any special problems for our Minister

for Health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in conclusion, I wish to express my

thanks  and  support to the President for  his  Address

last Friday.



<br><br>4.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong) (in Mandarin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in his Address to this

House,  the  President  has made  an  analysis  of  the

position  of Singapore. This analysis is both  incisive

and  easy to understand. It points out the crux of  the

problem  and it enables Singaporeans to understand  the

emphasis  in  the  various Government ministries.  More

important, Sir, the President has painted an optimistic

forecast  of our economic prospects, and this  is  very

encouraging  and  meaningful to Singaporeans  who  have

made their sacrifices in the national interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a disordered world economic structure and under

the  influence  of  economic recession  and  inflation,

other  countries  have  been  adversely  affected,  but

Singapore's  growth  rate has been  comparatively  much

better. Notwithstanding all this, we have taken several

measures  to contain inflation so that our people  will

not  suffer  any  more hardship. As  a  result,  credit

squeeze   was  imposed  but  this  has  also  adversely

affected our commerce and industries. Therefore, it  is

necessary  for us to be able to implement  with  proper

flexibility  and  strategy  the  various  measures   to

counter inflation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>



and  recession  for the interest of all the  people.  I

believe  that under the enlightened leadership  of  the

Government and with the cooperation of peoples  of  all

walks  of  life,  all problems will be  solved  in  due

course.  As our President has said, in the second  half

of the year our economy will turn for the better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to touch on education. Education is

a  matter  which requires a hundred years  of  planning

according  to  a  saying.  Every  country  regards  the

education  of  its  citizens  as  a  matter  of   prime

importance.  Every year we set aside  a  large  sum  of

money  in  our Budget for expenditure on education.  It

shows  how  much  importance the Government  attach  to

education. Furthermore, the civic organisations equally

are attaching greater importance to education. We still

have   Boards  of  Directors  in  the  Government-aided

schools.  These  schools are run on contributions  from

members  of  the public, and when they are affected  by

urban  renewal,  then the school boards  will  have  to

raise money to rebuild their schools elsewhere. This is

the  spirit  that  we  should  continue  to  encourage.

Furthermore, the various civic organisations also  have

scholarships,  bursaries and study loans  available  to

our  student  population. These,  together  with  those

available from the Government sources, Singaporeans can

enjoy  equal opportunities in education. No matter  how

poor  a student may be. he will be given an opportunity

for  higher education, so long as he is hardworking and

talented. In this way, we are able to make the best use

of our only resource, that is our human resource.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, times are changing and so must our Education

system change to adapt to the changing times. From  the

Addendum  on the Ministry of Education, we are informed

that the outmoded legislation on education will undergo

an  overhaul. We hope that in the process  of  amending

the legislation on Education, the Ministry of Education

will  seek  the  views  of  the  people  concerned   or

interested in education, particularly the teachers'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



unions,  so that the new Education Act will be able  to

meet the present needs of our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next major restructure of the Education system is

the   conversion   of  the  present  six-year   primary

education to a seven-year primary education,  with  the

provison to allow the brighter students to complete  in

six  years. The aim is correct and proper and, that is,

to remove the fear among our primary school children of

examinations and to give them an opportunity to develop

intellectually  and to make learning  more  interesting

and  pleasant. There is a general concern among parents

on  the  question of how to assess the children  for  a

seven-year or a six-year education. Furthermore,  there

is  also  the question of restreaming. How  should  the

streaming  be  done in the secondary  stage?  If  there

should be any erroneous assessment or restreaming, will

it be possible for a student to change from the science

stream  to  the academic stream, or from  the  academic

stream to the technical stream, so that our talents are

not   misused  or  wasted?  I  hope  the  Minister  for

Education   will,   in  preparing  this   restructuring

programme, also give parents the opportunity  to  clear

their  doubts or misgivings. This is something which  I

hope the Minister will consider.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to support the Motion in the name of the

Member for Kim Keat.



<br><br>4.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion by

the  Member for Kim Keat expressing our thanks  to  the

President  for  his  speech  at  the  opening  of  this

Parliament.  In  his speech and in  the  Addendum,  the

President has touched upon matters relating to Defence,

Finance,  Foreign  Affairs, Education,  Communications,

Culture  and  others.  He has  indicated  much  in  the

Addendum to show that we want to build a more just  and

fair  society.  This policy speech forms the  blueprint

for  our nation building. This speech is also what  all

citizens  who are interested in our welfare and  nation

building should pay attention to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Addendum on Finance touched upon the

Government's  decision to extend the  five  years'

tax  concession to pioneer industries to ten years

in   order   to   encourage   more   petrochemical

industries and other industries in order  to  draw

large sums of investment into Singapore, and  also

to encourage the education and training of skilled

workers. Therefore, these various concessions  are

very good indeed. I hope this concessionary policy

will   be   able  to  attract  more  international

investments  into  Singapore  so  as  to   promote

Singapore's  economic development and bring  about

more  employment opportunities for the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum on Education, mention is made of

the changes in the Education system. For instance,

primary school education will be extended to seven

years.  Those  students with  good  results  could

complete their primary education in six years, and

the Primary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



School  Leaving  Examination  will  be  a  grading

exercise  and not a kind of examination to  decide

whether  one has passed or not. This will be  some

sort  of  an  encouragement to the primary  school

pupils and will arouse their interest in learning.

Changing the Education system to suit the  child's

ability  is  good  as  it  provides  him  with  an

education  that  will  suit his  aptitude  and  so

assures  him of a better chance of getting  a  job

after completing his primary school education.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is 5.00 o'clock now, Mr

Teong.
