FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <B>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo):</B> &nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, it is true that a number of Indonesian DPR members have rejected the Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA) even before the Indonesian Government has officially submitted it to the DPR for ratification. Some claimed that the DCA infringed on Indonesia's sovereignty. Others denounced the Extradition Treaty (ET) and DCA agreements as an unfair deal for Indonesia. Many strange allegations were made against the DCA and against Singapore during hearings in the DPR.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, please allow me to reiterate some key points about the ET and DCA. The two leaders, Prime Minister Lee and President Yudhoyono, agreed in October 2005 that the ET and DCA would be negotiated as a package with a balance of benefits for both sides. Their intention was for the conclusion of these two agreements to elevate relations between Indonesia and Singapore to a higher plane. It was in this spirit that Singapore negotiated the ET and DCA with Indonesia.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to be expected, the negotiations were complex and took many rounds. It was important for both countries to<p align=left>Column: 989<p> benefit from each of the two agreements, taking into account each country's sovereignty and core interests. After nearly two years of negotiations, with both sides showing goodwill and making compromises along the way, we eventually agreed on a package of agreements on 23rd April 2007. This package comprised the ET, the DCA and four Implementing Arrangements or IAs. The four IAs were the Military Training Area IA and three other IAs on specific joint projects involving the three Services. The final round of negotiations was carried out by the Foreign Ministers, Defence Ministers and Defence Chiefs in Singapore. All the main documents, namely the ET, DCA and the Military Training Area IA, were initialled that evening in an atmosphere of relief and celebration which was well covered by the international media. It was agreed that the main agreements would be signed in a formal signing ceremony in Bali on 27th April 2007, by the Foreign Ministers, Defence Ministers and the Defence Chiefs respectively, and witnessed by PM Lee and President Yudhoyono. We would have signed the other three Implementing Arrangements on that same day, but, at the Indonesians' request, purely for administrative and logistical reasons because they were not able to get all three of their Service Chiefs together for the Bali signing, we agreed that they could be signed in a separate ceremony by the Service Chiefs of both countries in Jakarta on 7th May 2007, to be witnessed by the two Defence Chiefs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the whole package of agreements had been agreed to by both sides, we were therefore most surprised when Indonesia asked Singapore to make substantive changes to the IAs after the main agreements had been signed. There were also arguments from the Indonesian side that the agreements were incomplete.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 990<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as I have pointed out, the ET, the DCA and the four IAs were negotiated and concluded as parts of a carefully balanced package. Insisting on substantive changes or introducing new elements afterwards means that there was no agreement in the first place. In effect, the entire package would be unravelled. This would make future negotiations with Indonesia, or with any other country for that matter, difficult if not impossible because there would be no finality even after an agreement had been reached.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some DPR members have asked the Indonesian Government to accept the ET but reject the DCA. This is not possible as both agreements were negotiated and concluded as a package, a point which has been publicly acknowledged by both Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda and Defence Minister Juwono Sudarsono.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore's position is a clear and simple one. We have to abide by the sanctity of agreements once they are concluded.&nbsp; While maintaining this principle, we have nevertheless tried our best to be helpful to the Indonesian Government without reopening settled agreements. We have therefore conveyed a proposal to Indonesia on 22nd May 2007 suggesting a way forward. We are still waiting for Indonesia&rsquo;s response to our specific proposals. At a breakfast meeting on 12th June 2007 in Singapore, Foreign Minister Hassan assured me that there is no intention by the Indonesian side to reduce the substance of what has already been agreed. He said, however, that Indonesia needed some clarification of details to facilitate the implementation of the DCA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, we are aware that the dynamics of Indonesia's domestic debate are complicated and that the Indonesian Government may need more<p align=left>Column: 991<p> time before tabling the ET and DCA to the DPR for ratification. In the meantime, it is in the interest of both countries to continue strengthening bilateral cooperation in other areas. We are after all close neighbours with a high degree of inter-dependence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Michael Palmer has also submitted a question on the DCA to the Minister for Defence. Details on the DCA will be covered by the Minister for Defence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</B> &nbsp; Thank you, Minister, for the comprehensive reply.&nbsp; When the agreements were signed in Bali, it was hoped that it would bode better relations between Indonesia and Singapore but, given the opposition from the legislators in Indonesia, even the governors from Riau and the Riau Islands, and various allegations made, I wonder whether the Minister can give us an assessment of whether these two agreements would indeed spell better relations or give us new areas of dispute and friction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I also ask the Minister whether he thinks there is political will at various levels to move forward on this and to make sure that at the end of the day both sides will have a balance of benefits?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, there was hope when we entered the negotiations - there was certainly a lot of hope when we signed the agreements - and we continue to be hopeful that we will be able to work through the remaining problems, and have these agreements ratified by both sides and come into effect. On our side, there is no lack of will. On the part of President Yudhoyono, there is no lack of will, but we recognise at the same time that the politics of Indonesia are complicated and that sometimes, we may need a certain passage of time before some of these<p align=left>Column: 992<p> things can be done. But we remain hopeful and patient.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:DEFENCE COOPERATION AGREEMENT WITH INDONESIA--><p align=left>Column:  992<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:DEFENCE COOPERATION AGREEMENT WITH INDONESIA:::997--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>DEFENCE COOPERATION AGREEMENT WITH INDONESIA</span></B></div><BR>		<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Status--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Status)</span></B></div><BR>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Michael Palmer--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Mr Michael Palmer</B> asked the Minister for Defence what is the present status of the Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA) with Indonesia, given the fact that a DCA was signed between Singapore and Indonesia, and how will the Minister move forward so as to implement the DCA that was signed with Indonesia.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Defence (Mr Teo Chee Hean)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister for Defence (Mr Teo Chee Hean):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, as stated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his answer to an earlier Question today, the Extradition Treaty, DCA and the four associated Implementing Arrangements (IAs) to the DCA were negotiated and concluded as one package. Let me give the House a sense of how this carefully negotiated package came about, a flavour of the discussions.&nbsp; The negotiations were complex and took many rounds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> The meeting on 23rd April discussed and finalised all outstanding matters pertaining to the ET and DCA, and it involved all the key players from Singapore and Indonesia including the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, the Ministers of Defence, the armed forces chiefs and the Chief Negotiators of the ET and DCA. All the key people were there.&nbsp; This was a protracted meeting that started in the morning and lasted well into the night, during which all remaining issues in the ET and DCA were extensively discussed and settled.&nbsp; This was done with goodwill and patience on both sides as we worked towards an agreement, making sure all the matters were covered and settled.&nbsp; &nbsp;Both sides had ample opportunity to raise any issues of concern for discussion. At the end of the meeting on 23rd April, the ET, DCA and its four associated IAs were<p align=left>Column: 993<p> finalised, completed and agreed upon by both sides as a complete package. In fact, that night, we issued a joint statement with Indonesia which said, "both sides made significant progress and were able to reach agreement on all the remaining issues".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joint statement reflected the spirit of goodwill in which the package had been negotiated and the good faith in which it had been concluded by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Ministers of Defence and the armed forces chiefs of both countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Since then, however, Indonesia has indicated that it wants to impose substantive changes and new conditions on Republic of Singapore Navy training in Area Bravo. Naval training is not something new. It had been an integral part of the previous MTA which we had with Indonesia. &nbsp;During the many rounds of negotiation since October 2005<i>,</i> training for the Republic of Singapore Navy had always been a subject of discussion.&nbsp;&nbsp; The focus of the discussions was not on the type of training which had previously already been conducted under the old MTA but, rather, the focus was on which area the naval training should take place in.&nbsp; Several possible areas for naval training were considered, and both sides finally agreed on 23rd April after extensive discussions that the area for the naval training would be in what is now called Area Bravo.&nbsp; The training itself was never in contention or a subject of discussion, only where it would take place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The media has also reported comments about the interpretation of Article 6 of the DCA and how this relates to the IAs. &nbsp;During the series of negotiations leading up to the meeting on 23rd April, both sides agreed to have four IAs to the DCA.&nbsp; An IA for Area Bravo was never raised during the course of the<p align=left>Column: 994<p> negotiations. &nbsp;If there was a need to impose any new conditions on naval training or to conclude a separate IA on naval training, Indonesia had ample opportunity to raise the matter for discussion during the negotiations, before the carefully balanced overall package was finally settled and agreed to on 23rd April. Singapore's view therefore is that the package of agreements that was concluded on 23rd April is complete, and that what is already contained in the DCA and its four associated IAs&nbsp;is sufficient to implement the DCA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nevertheless, as mentioned by my colleague,&nbsp;the Minister for Foreign Affairs, out of goodwill and in the spirit of cooperation, Singapore made a proposal to Indonesia on 22nd May 2007 suggesting a way forward. This was a significant step and a sincere attempt to resolve this matter finally and conclusively. We are still awaiting a reply from Indonesia on the specific proposals in our offer. We welcome the assurances from Indonesia that it does not wish to change what was agreed, and look forward to being able to conclude and implement the agreements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore values the long-standing relationship that has been built up between the SAF and the TNI. This close relationship strengthens regional security and has served both sides well for many years, especially in times of crisis when we have come to each other's assistance.&nbsp; We are committed to working together with our counterparts in Indonesia to ensure that this relationship remains strong and positive .</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Michael Palmer (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Michael Palmer (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</B> <B>:&nbsp;</B> Sir, I believe the Indonesians have indicated that they want a cooling-off period before they come back to the table.&nbsp; Is there any indication of a timeline?&nbsp; Will we have to wait for a year or so before this matter is concluded?</p></div></span>			<p align=left>Column: 995<p>		<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Teo Chee Hean:&nbsp;</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said, we have made&nbsp;them a serious proposal on 22nd May.&nbsp; We are hopeful that the Indonesians will be able to study the proposal and come back to us with a substantive response to the points that we have put forward in our proposal.&nbsp; We have no indication how much time the Indonesians may need for this.&nbsp; We do understand that they have their own processes and considerations but we do hope that they will come back to us so that we will be able to move forward and conclude this agreement.&nbsp; We are certainly committed to doing so.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</B>:&nbsp; Sir, the Indonesian media has been reporting the specifics of what the Indonesian side has been thinking on the issue, including the specific areas of disagreement.&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister to please enlighten us on this way forward that has been proposed to Singapore because it is puzzling when we say that we do not want to make any substantive changes when the Indonesian does, and we say that there is a solution put forward?&nbsp; Can the Minister please enlighten us?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></span>		          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">        	      		<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B></span></B></div><BR>							<div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Teo Chee Hean</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not privy to the internal considerations of the Indonesian government and the people in its various branches of government.&nbsp; I also can only read what has been communicated in the newspapers and some of the statements do seem a little self-contradictory.&nbsp; But we do hope that Indonesia will look at this substantive offer that we have made which we believe would address most of their concerns and come back to us with a substantive response to this proposal. We believe that this is a good way forward.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also believe that the best way forward is to be able to communicate with each other substantively in this manner rather than to make statements in public which, one side or the other, may not<p align=left>Column: 996<p> know how seriously to take it because some of them are quite clearly polemical and we should not be conducting negotiations in that way.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister&nbsp;what are our options if this DCA does not go through.&nbsp; What&nbsp;are the long-term implications to our forces in terms of training and whether&nbsp;we have&nbsp;other alternatives?&nbsp; If we have other alternatives, would the Minister consider these alternatives now rather than to wait until then?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Teo Chee Hean</B>: Mr Speaker, Sir, these training arrangements with Indonesia have been going on for many years.&nbsp; As I told the House before, I participated in the first-ever exercise with Indonesia in 1974, probably dates me a little.&nbsp; But we had training arrangements with Indonesia to train, for example, in Pekan Baru area since the 1980s. We signed the military training agreement with them in 1995.&nbsp; And we have had very good interactions with Indonesia through these years. We have been able to work together in times of crisis.&nbsp; I recall many of them because I was directly involved in things like the rescue of hostages in&nbsp;Irian Jaya; I was involved during the search and rescue operations in the Musi river when the SilkAir aircraft crashed; and I was also involved in the tsunami relief operations.&nbsp; So I remember all these things very vividly and distinctly.&nbsp; And the thing that struck me about all these events was how closely and fraternally the TNI and SAF were able to work together because we personally knew the people on the other side.&nbsp; I think that has been the great value of the close exchanges and interactions that we have had with Indonesia. And this is the main reason why we feel that we would want to continue with the Defence Cooperation Agreement to strengthen our relations with Indonesia.&nbsp; The relationship is an important one for us from the strategic<p align=left>Column: 997<p> level and also from the ability to work with each other in a comfortable, friendly and familiar way.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of training of the SAF, we have other training alternatives. We have training agreements, DCAs and MOUs of various kinds with more than half a dozen countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are able to train there and to train with their forces and we appreciate very much the opportunities these various countries have given us to train the SAF there. These arrangements will enable us to continue to maintain the operational readiness and&nbsp;training levels of our soldiers, sailors and airmen.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Er Lee Bee Wah (Ang Mo Kio)</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;as in any offer, there should be a validity period.

There is no dispute that the sentence was legally correct.&nbsp;It was pronounced in open court and recorded accurately in the case file and notes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The error occurred at the stage when transcribing the sentence from the case file onto the Warrant of Commitment.&nbsp; The Warrant of Commitment notifies the Prisons Department the sentence that was passed on the offender. When preparing the Warrant, the Court Clerk erroneously entered the sentence for the second charge as six months' imprisonment and six strokes of caning instead of three strokes, thereby giving rise to eight strokes of the cane, instead of a total of five strokes.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the sentencing District Judge also did not spot the error when he signed off on the Warrant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The caning sentence was administered to Mr Dickson Tan on 29th March. The<p align=left>Column: 1000<p> Court Clerk who prepared the Warrant became aware of the error on 2nd April following an enquiry from a member of Mr Tan's family.&nbsp; The Court Clerk then alerted the District Judge, who in turn reported the matter to the Senior District Judge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second part of Mr Hri Kumar's question asks what steps have been taken to prevent a recurrence of the same or similar errors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before answering that, let me add that when the matter was brought to the attention of the Senior District Judge, he took the matter seriously and immediately directed investigations to be carried out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those investigations revealed how the error had arisen which I have explained.&nbsp; In the course of the investigations, statements were obtained from the Court Clerk as well as the District Judge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court Clerk, in his statement, admitted his mistake and apologised. The Court Clerk expressed his remorse over the incident and asked to resign on 12th April.&nbsp; The Subordinate Courts considered instituting disciplinary proceedings against the Court Clerk but after considering his overall performance record in the Court, which was good, and that this was his first mistake which was not wilful, allowed him to resign.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand from the Courts that the primary responsibility for preparing a Warrant of Commitment lies with the Court Clerk.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the District Judge who signed off on the Warrant did not detect the error.&nbsp; The Chief Justice has directed that the District Judge be formally cautioned and that after he has cleared his outstanding criminal cases, he would be taken off judicial work which involves the signing of Warrants of Commitment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1001<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, let me inform the House that the Chief Justice has himself looked into this matter.&nbsp; He has written to the Senior District Judge to express "deep concern" about what happened in this case and to impress upon the Subordinate Courts' Judges and Court Officers the seriousness with which he views avoidable mistakes of this nature.&nbsp; Moreover, notwithstanding that this kind of mistake was a rare occurrence, the Chief Justice has said that he takes this seriously as it may affect the excellent reputation and standing of our legal and judicial systems which have taken many years to build up.&nbsp; The Chief Justice has directed a review of all administrative procedures within the Courts so as to put in place a system to avoid mistakes of this nature in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chief Justice has also directed that the Courts work with the relevant agencies - Prisons, Police and the Attorney-General's Chambers to ensure that a comprehensive system of checks by all agencies is put in place to prevent mistakes of this nature. All these are now being done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that the Subordinate Courts have already taken additional steps and refined their checklists.&nbsp; For example, Warrants of Commitment will now be checked twice at both levels by another Court Clerk not involved in the preparation of the Warrant and by a second District Judge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Courts are also considering automating the process of preparation of Warrants of Commitment with built-in system checks so that such errors do not recur.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, let me end by putting his matter in perspective. The Subordinate Courts deal with some 200,000 criminal cases every year, some involving<p align=left>Column: 1002<p> sentences of imprisonment, some involving fines, some involving caning, and some involving a combination of these sentences. So, bearing in mind 200,000 cases a year, this kind of clerical mistake is an extremely rare occurrence.&nbsp; But as I have said publicly, even if these mistakes are rare, even if there is only one case, it is one case too many. We have to put it right and ensure that it does not recur.&nbsp; I think that is the way to uphold and strengthen the hard won reputation of our legal system for integrity and justice which we have built up over many years.&nbsp; I know that this is also the attitude of the Chief Justice, the Senior District Judge and other members of the Judiciary.&nbsp; Measures have been put in place to strengthen the system and to ensure that this sort of mistake does not recur.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

And the reason why the press statement had to set out the sequence of events is to show that, from the viewpoint of the Prisons, this was not true.&nbsp; In fact, we had to explain that the Prisons has a sequence of steps.&nbsp; From the moment the prisoner is admitted up to the carrying out of the sentence&nbsp; -&nbsp; in fact, I have gone through with the officials the sequence of steps -&nbsp; there are many stages where the prisoner is interviewed.&nbsp; He is asked to confirm that he does not wish to appeal, the sentence is read out to him, he is asked to affirm whether he understands and so on.&nbsp; In fact, I have seen some of the documents where&nbsp;in fact his confirmation&nbsp;is there, that he understood, that he did not object.&nbsp;

<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Members for their questions and interest in the UNSW project and the <p align=left>Column: 1007<p>broader issue of what this means for Singapore as a global education hub.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me first give the background of the UNSW project. After one-and-a-half years of feasibility study, UNSW assessed in 2004 that it was viable to establish a private comprehensive university in Singapore. This meant that the university would offer a full range of programmes in Science&nbsp;and Technology, Business, Arts and Social Sciences, and at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels.&nbsp; UNSW submitted its formal proposal to EDB in July 2004.&nbsp; Following discussions, EDB agreed to support UNSW's proposal.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When UNSW accepted EDB's support package in February 2005, it was on the basis that although UNSW would start off at an interim campus, it would eventually set up a new university campus here and enrol 10,000 to 15,000 students at the steady state. EDB saw a new campus as a clear demonstration of UNSW's commitment to the Singapore project, thus providing a good basis for its funding support. The acceptance of the EDB support package was signed off by the then Vice-Chancellor of UNSW, Professor Mark Wainwright.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the appointment of Professor Fred Hilmer as Vice-Chancellor of UNSW in June 2006, UNSW approached EDB to increase the support package. Professor Hilmer considered as inadequate the previous package which UNSW had agreed to.&nbsp; In August 2006, EDB agreed to increase the support package in return for UNSW's commitment to a ten-year student enrolment target of close to 5,000 students, the acceleration of the development of a new campus at Changi and additional R&amp;D activities. In December 2006, Professor Hilmer signed off on the increased support package. UNSW proceeded to invite and accept student applications to the Singapore campus for its first intake in March 2007.<p align=left>Column: 1008<p> It also continued to build up its staff strength.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in March this year, UNSW found that the first intake for UNSW Asia was far below its expectations. It had enrolled only about 150 students, less than half of its business plans' projected intake of 300. UNSW also expected the second intake to be significantly below earlier projections. UNSW thus reviewed its operations in Singapore again, holding extensive discussions with EDB.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UNSW eventually proposed a significantly scaled-down plan of achieving an enrolment of about 2,000 students in 10 years, half of what UNSW had agreed to in the revised package of December 2006. Moreover, UNSW was now unable to provide the assurance that there would be a permanent campus in Singapore, even on a reduced scale. This called into question UNSW's ability to deliver on its original intent of about 10,000 to 15,000 students at the steady state. EDB and UNSW explored various scenarios and options but could not agree on a revised package.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 19th May 2007, EDB informed UNSW that it could not agree to the revised support package proposed by UNSW. However, EDB made several counter-offers to help address UNSW's concerns. First, EDB was willing to give UNSW two years, until April 2009, to decide whether to develop the new campus at Changi. Second, EDB offered not to claw back the grant and loan incentives that it had disbursed to UNSW for the Singapore campus if UNSW agreed to carry on operations and meet a set of interim targets until it made its decision on the new campus in April 2009. Third, EDB offered that if and when UNSW should submit its campus proposal, EDB would assess afresh the proposal for a support package, with support commensurate with the benefits of the project to<p align=left>Column: 1009<p> Singapore. In the end, UNSW decided to cease operations because of what it perceived as an unacceptable level of financial and operational risks. UNSW announced its decision on 23rd May 2007.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before we come to any conclusion of the UNSW decision, let us step back and keep in perspective a few fundamental points. First, investors know their business better than the Government. In this case, UNSW - as the investor and the operator - is in the best position to assess the viability of its business plan and to decide whether to start a comprehensive university in Singapore. Second, Government's role is to facilitate and support investors in their decisions, not to second-guess or guide those decisions. In this instance, EDB's job was to facilitate UNSW's investment by providing it a level of support commensurate with the benefits of the project to Singapore and putting in place appropriate safeguards if the agreed milestones are not achieved. Since public funds are being used to support this investment, EDB is mindful that the project creates sufficient benefits to Singapore in terms of jobs and economic value. This is because we want to make every investment dollar count.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, UNSW's decision is a business decision.</p></div></span>		          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">        	      		<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B></span></B></div><BR>							<div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>While we as Government can play a role in giving support to investors who want to set up operations in Singapore, we cannot issue a blank cheque. We must ensure that public funds are well utilised and yield strong benefits to Singapore. EDB's support package for UNSW was therefore&nbsp;premised on the basis that UNSW would undertake a long-term commitment to establish a university of significant scale in Singapore that will create new economic value. EDB's grants and loans are conditional on UNSW achieving pre-<p align=left>Column: 1010<p>agreed milestones such as student enrolment, failing which they become recoverable.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To date, EDB has disbursed S$15 million in loans and S$17.3 million in grants to UNSW.&nbsp; As UNSW will not be able to meet the performance indicators that it&nbsp;committed to EDB in 2004 and 2006, UNSW is required to return the disbursed loan and grant to EDB.&nbsp; The disbursed loan is backed by a bank guarantee.&nbsp; EDB is currently discussing with UNSW on the recovery of the disbursed grant. The Government does not have any outstanding liabilities to third parties with regard to the UNSW project.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We regret UNSW's decision to pull out, but this is their business decision and we will have to respect it. The Government's bigger concern was the impact of UNSW's decision on the students. EDB therefore worked closely with UNSW and the Ministry of Education to assist the affected students.&nbsp; UNSW has assured us that it would mitigate the impact on the students. It has offered scholarships of between S$12,000 and S$22,000 per annum to the students who choose to go to the UNSW Sydney campus to continue their studies. This is to help with the living costs. To date, 116 students out of the 143 students enrolled for Semester 1 at UNSW in Singapore have opted to study in UNSW Sydney campus.&nbsp; For students who wish to remain in Singapore, EDB and the Ministry of Education have been working closely with UNSW to provide alternatives.&nbsp; NUS, NTU and SMU have helped by extending their deadlines for the UNSW Asia students to apply for admission.&nbsp; They have offered 24 places to the students who meet their admission norms and of these, 17 offers have been accepted to date.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the closure of UNSW Asia will not dampen our aspirations to become an educational hub. Not all<p align=left>Column: 1011<p> investment projects will succeed. But that should not stop us from constantly seeking new investment projects that can add value to Singapore. We will continue to bring in new projects and build on the base that we already have. Today, we have more than 16 foreign universities and 41 preparatory and boarding schools (comprising 38 foreign system schools and three privately-funded schools) in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More recently, we have also successfully attracted a range of reputable foreign educational institutions to set up their campus in Singapore.&nbsp; Recent additions include institutions such as the University of Nevada Las Vegas, the New York University Tisch School of the Arts, Duke Graduate Medical School, and foreign system schools such as the Bhavan Indian International School, the Delhi Public School and the Chinese International School.&nbsp; These institutions are doing well here. In all, there are currently 80,000 international students in Singapore today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The market for international education, especially in Asia, is growing rapidly.&nbsp; Singapore is well placed to seize a strong position in this market: we have high education standards, a secure environment and good quality of life, and a unique East-meets-West cosmopolitan environment. These will stand us in good stead, as EDB seeks to bring in more reputable foreign institutions and enrich the education landscape in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</B>&nbsp; Sir, I have two supplementary questions.&nbsp; First, on the issue of 10,000 to 15,000 students at the steady state.&nbsp; My question is: when&nbsp;did we expect them to achieve that level of enrolment?&nbsp; My second question is: how realistic has EDB been to expect a foreign university to achieve an enrolment of 10,000 to 15,000 students, especially if you look at it in the light of <p align=left>Column: 1012<p>how long it took our universities to achieve that kind of enrolment rate?&nbsp; Were we unrealistic in expecting any university to achieve that kind of rate?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, as I mentioned just now, it is not our job to evaluate the business plan of the investor.&nbsp; In this case, UNSW came to Singapore and they had a very unique and bold plan to set up a private comprehensive university. So, they were not looking for setting up a small niche area.&nbsp; They wanted to set up a comprehensive university, including science,&nbsp;engineering, arts, and social sciences.&nbsp; So, it was a unique proposition.&nbsp; And to make that work, they had to build up a critical mass -&nbsp;&nbsp; because it is an expensive endeavour to build up a comprehensive university, and you need the scale - and, therefore, they proposed an eventual enrolment of 10,000 to 15,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we realise this would not be achieved overnight, and the intermediate target was about 5,000 to 6,000 within the first 10 years, and then&nbsp;they build it up gradually.&nbsp; But&nbsp;they must show the commitment,&nbsp;build up the campus,&nbsp;recruit the staff, and meet the milestones, building up to this eventual target of 10,000 to 15,000.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Minister for the very comprehensive answer.&nbsp; I understand surely that it is not the Ministry's role to evaluate the business plan.&nbsp; But, however, I understand that all business plans must have contingencies before the Government itself gives out any funding or grant.&nbsp; I am sure the Government has evaluated in terms of their plans and any contingency if&nbsp; the enrolment drops below the projected numbers.&nbsp; So, I am&nbsp;wondering whether these contingency plans were evaluated and, if they were,&nbsp;why these contingency plans were not implemented.</p></div></span>					<p align=left>Column: 1013<p><!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>:&nbsp; The support package that EDB provided for UNSW was, essentially, in two parts.&nbsp; One was loan to help build the campus, and that loan was backed by a bank guarantee.&nbsp; So if they do not build,&nbsp;of course, we can recall the loan.&nbsp; The second support package was a set of grants to help them build up their capabilities, particularly in the science laboratories.&nbsp; So, of course, if they do not build the science laboratories, the grants are not disbursed.&nbsp; We also gave out some grants to help them build up the initial capacity, and they were the grants that were disbursed at the early stages, so that they&nbsp;could start up their operation and build up initial capacity.&nbsp;So, the grants were given for different milestones, and for those which were given at the startup to help them come in,&nbsp;those were the grants that were disbursed, and that is the S$17 million that we have to recover now.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, two supplementary questions, please.&nbsp; May I ask the Minister whether there is enough synergy between MTI and MOE in dealing with all educational issues, be they educational hub, foreign universities or students?&nbsp; Secondly, will the Minister consider setting up a one-stop centralised controlling authority among the stakeholders - MTI, MOE and ICA - to advise, implement and regulate policies?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>:&nbsp; Our plans to promote Singapore as an education hub is a whole-of-government plan.&nbsp; We work very closely between MTI, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Home Affairs and all the other agencies.&nbsp; As Members will hear later from Minister Tharman, we worked very closely in helping UNSW to set up its operations here and, also, we worked very closely when they decided to pull out.&nbsp; There are different roles by the different agencies and this is to be expected.

<B>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</B>&nbsp; Sir, I would like to thank Mdm Halimah Yacob, Mdm Cynthia Phua, Dr Lily Neo, Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Zaqy Mohamad for their Questions on the closure of UNSW Asia and related issues regarding private educational institutions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, the Minister for Trade and Industry had&nbsp;provided a comprehensive reply on negotiations between MTI and UNSW.&nbsp; MOE was informed of UNSW's decision to close its Singapore campus two days before the public announcement<p align=left>Column: 1019<p> on 23rd May 2007.&nbsp; As soon as we learnt of UNSW's decision, our top priority was to help the affected students.&nbsp; MOE worked with EDB, the three Singapore universities and several private education providers to provide options for affected students who wished to remain in Singapore to pursue their degree programmes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three Singapore universities - NUS, NTU and SMU&nbsp;- and the private education providers set up a one-stop centre at the UNSW Asia campus to facilitate enquiries and applications by the affected students.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking into account&nbsp;the suddenness of the situation and to help the affected students, the three Singapore universities extended their deadline for application for this academic year to 4th&nbsp;June.&nbsp; They received applications from 231 UNSW Asia students and considered these applications case by case on the basis of merit.&nbsp; Twenty-four UNSW Asia students received offers from the universities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These efforts to assist students provided them with additional options, besides the offer by UNSW of places in its Sydney campus.&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, we understand that 116 out of the 143 UNSW Asia students from the March 2007 intake have opted to continue their course of study at UNSW in Sydney.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE does not have information on students taking legal action against UNSW. These are decisions to be taken by the students themselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the question on safeguards for students raised by Mdm Cynthia Phua, private education providers which enrol foreign students are required to attain CASETrust for Education certification.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CASETrust-certified private schools are required to protect students' fees by purchasing tuition fee insurance.&nbsp; Alternatively, these schools may set up an<p align=left>Column: 1020<p> Escrow account into which students pay tuition fees in advance, which the bank will then disburse in instalments.&nbsp; In the event of school closure, unused tuition fees will be returned to the students.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign university branch campuses, such as UNSW Asia, are not required to be CASETrust-certified because they are reputable institutions with university status accorded by their home countries.&nbsp; It is also common practice for such institutions to collect tuition fees on a semestral basis.&nbsp; This makes CASETrust's student protection measures unnecessary.&nbsp; In the case of UNSW Asia, it fully refunded the tuition fees paid by its first batch of students for the period after its closure.&nbsp; It also refunded the deposits paid by students who had not begun their programmes of study.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From MOE's records, 18 private commercial schools have closed in the past five years, for a variety of reasons.&nbsp; In many cases, the schools stopped taking in new students and only closed after seeing through their final intakes.&nbsp; As such, students were not adversely affected.&nbsp; In other cases, the schools sought alternative programmes for their students to transfer to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr de Souza asked if the Government can ensure that private education institutions have sound business plans.&nbsp; It is not possible for the Government to ensure the success or financial robustness of any business venture.&nbsp; In the event of private school closures, our priority is to assist the affected students and minimise disruption to their studies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, as I announced at the last Committee of Supply in March 2007, MOE is looking at the feasibility of introducing a new regulatory framework for the private education sector that would, amongst other possible changes, enhance student protection measures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1021<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked about providing fee subsidies to students in privately-run tertiary institutions to pursue degree programmes.&nbsp;

Thirdly, I think to a large extent, now with all these foreign universities coming in, it also gives the students more choices, in terms of the academic courses to attend, by lowering the financial burden of the families rather than&nbsp;exploring overseas opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</B> Mr Speaker, I think Mr Zaqy Mohamad has another Question,&nbsp;Question No. 28, which is related to the admission and university places for our students.&nbsp; I just want to give a quick response now and&nbsp;we can&nbsp;deal with the specifics later on in that specific Question.&nbsp; Looking at it from the university's point of view, it is important for us to bear in mind that some private <p align=left>Column: 1024<p>education institutions can be quite expensive.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore difficult for us to extend subsidies to all private education organisations.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have provided significant subsidies through our&nbsp;three main universities - SMU, NTU and NUS.&nbsp; I think our focus now is to continue to build these universities and help our students do well in these universities.&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</B>&nbsp; The MOS said earlier that he is consulting the industry, comprising about more than 1,000 private education providers, to see how to regulate this industry.&nbsp; I get the impression from the MOS that the Government is now looking at regulating this industry.&nbsp; Surely, the question asked is whether this should have been done earlier before the closure came about, and we are left scrambling to look at what further regulations we have got to put in place.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</B> &nbsp; As&nbsp;I mentioned during the COS earlier this year, the private education landscape has changed over the years.&nbsp; In the earlier years, most of the private education organisations in Singapore worked very much&nbsp;as an agent that offers distance learning.&nbsp; Not many of them were here conducting lessons and having classroom facilities for our students.&nbsp; But over the years, this has changed and the sector has evolved and we have over the years also introduced several measures by the different agencies to improve the quality and regulation of this industry, including, for example, CASETrust which is one such measure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving forward, in line with our strategy to develop Singapore into an education hub, MOE is taking a more fundamental relook at this regulation framework and see how best we can support this strategy.&nbsp; It has to be a balance between regulation and promotion, as we want to regulate and <p align=left>Column: 1025<p>ensure compliance&nbsp;with the law.&nbsp; At the same time, we want to make sure that we do not stifle up and coming new merging private education organisations that are trying to make a mark.&nbsp; So it is a balance between regulation as well as promotion.&nbsp; That is why we have to track very carefully, consult widely, understand the industry before we introduce the system.</p></div></span>		          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, we have seen a sharp increase in dengue cases over the past two months.&nbsp; So far, the&nbsp;total number of dengue cases reported for the year is 146% higher than that reported&nbsp;for the same period last year, ie,&nbsp;4,368, as compared to 1,779.&nbsp; As of this morning,&nbsp;339 cases were reported for last week, bringing the weekly average number of cases this year to 156, compared to the weekly average of 64 cases for the same period last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, cases are expected to continue to rise in the warmer months ahead, up to September, with the rise compounded by a switch in the predominant circulating serotype from Dengue-1 to Dengue-2.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEA's strategy for dengue control is to suppress mosquito population by denying the Aedes mosquitoes the place<p align=left>Column: 1026<p> to breed, what we call&nbsp;source reduction, since we cannot control factors, such as&nbsp;the temperature and the circulating virus.&nbsp; To this end, NEA adopts a multi-pronged approach of preventive surveillance, public education and community involvement, enforcement and research.&nbsp; I shall highlight some of the dengue control measures that have been taken by NEA and relevant agencies this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In April this year, NEA had initiated the Intensive Source Reduction Exercise (ISRE), well ahead of the traditional warmer months of June to September.&nbsp;&nbsp;Together with 25 agencies of the Inter-Agency Dengue Taskforce (IADTF), daily checks are carried out to search out and destroy mosquito-breeding habitats.&nbsp; Other than homes, checks are being done in outdoor areas, drains, buildings, construction sites, parks, vacant land, and any infrastructure or facility that can breed mosquitoes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Land agencies, such as LTA, HDB and SLA, have taken action to repair damaged structures that could lead to water stagnation, eg, sunken roof gutters, ground depressions and damaged drains.&nbsp; NParks has also proceeded to seal tree holes and apply insecticides to plant axils to prevent mosquito breeding in these areas.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since end May, NEA has deployed an additional 300 officers from other departments in NEA, on top of its 500 environmental health officers, to carry out daily search and destroy operations to suppress the mosquito population.&nbsp; Particular attention is also being paid to 44 focus areas identified as susceptible to Dengue-2 outbreaks as these areas have not seen a predominant number of Dengue-2 cases in the last five years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, breeding in homes continues to pose a challenge.&nbsp; Thus far, domestic containers, flower pot plates and ornamental containers, both within homes and placed by residents outside their homes along the common corridors of<p align=left>Column: 1027<p> flats, form a significant portion of the breeding habitats detected.&nbsp; To raise public awareness, NEA has carried out intensive media publicity, public outreach and educational campaigns, and given its full support to grassroots activities led by Advisors.&nbsp; NEA will continue with these efforts in the next few months.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, NEA also provides daily updates on the locations of all dengue clusters on its website (<I>www.dengue.gov.sg</I>).&nbsp; This is to alert residents on dengue clusters within their neighbourhoods and enable them to take preventive measures.&nbsp; The Ministry of Health has also alerted all GPs on the current dengue situation.&nbsp; GPs have been advising dengue patients and those suspected of dengue to protect themselves and their household members from mosquito bites so as to protect their family members from contracting the disease.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Environmental Health Institute (EHI) under the NEA has been conducting research on ways to enhance mosquito control measures.&nbsp; One such project involves the extensive deployment of ovitraps to monitor mosquito activity.&nbsp; This allows NEA to take pre-emptive action in areas where an increase in mosquito activity is detected.&nbsp; NEA will continue to use ovitraps to help pre-empt localised outbreaks and prevent dengue cluster formation and growth.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the beginning of 2007, NEA has taken enforcement actions - these include fines, stop work orders for construction sites, and orders to take measures to prevent mosquito breeding -&nbsp;against 355 construction sites, 1,156 domestic premises and 713 non-domestic premises, eg, factories and shophouses, for mosquito breeding offences.&nbsp; NEA will continue to take strict enforcement action against parties responsible for mosquito breeding offences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1028<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to stress that our fight against dengue must be underpinned by collective efforts and commitment of all in our community.&nbsp; While NEA and other Government agencies continue to keep mosquito breeding in public areas in check, homeowners must play their part to rid their homes of stagnant water on a daily basis by doing the 10-minute Mozzie Wipe-out.&nbsp; I would like to urge our Town Councils, land agencies and homeowners to be vigilant in the fight against dengue.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo</B>:&nbsp; First, I would like to&nbsp;commend NEA for all the comprehensive measures taken so far against dengue.&nbsp; May I ask the Minister whether he is concerned over the emergence of new uniquely Singapore strains of dengue over the years, which means that more people may be susceptible to the new strains of dengue?&nbsp; Does he expect this to be a recurring yearly phenomenon?&nbsp; Is it true that it may be the result of our past eradication method?&nbsp; Does he need to do more studies to ascertain this fact in order to better fight dengue?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I am not sure whether it is uniquely Singapore but, certainly, as Dr Neo will understand as a doctor, the strains will appear periodically, depending on basically the immunity within the community.&nbsp; We are now beginning to see a switch-over from Dengue-1 to Dengue-2, something we have not seen for the last five years.&nbsp; That means there will be a certain proportion of our population who have not developed immunity against Dengue-2.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this a yearly phenomenon?&nbsp; It is difficult to tell, but based on the data that we have, there seems to be a six to seven-year cycle in terms of the peak.&nbsp; We are about at that point in time where there is a surge upwards.&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;this region is also endemic with dengue.&nbsp; And so we are in a dengue-endemic&nbsp;region and therefore we will see these surges occurring ever so often.&nbsp; We are now<p align=left>Column: 1029<p> trying to study the phenomenon even better.&nbsp; The research arm of NEA, ie, EHI, is conducting several research projects, some of which are too complicated for me to explain.&nbsp; But the point is that we want to understand the phenomenon better and to be able to develop tools that can allow us to pre-empt any increase in mosquito activity.&nbsp; Ultimately, our responsibility is to remove breeding habitats as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We work very closely with MOH to look at the possibility of developing vaccines.&nbsp; Hon. Members must have read that in the newspapers.&nbsp; Several agencies are coming together.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we will continue to do our part to support other agencies.&nbsp; But on the part of NEA, we will try and develop more tools to allow us to pre-empt so that we can do a better job.&nbsp; As I mentioned in my reply, it is still homeowners.&nbsp; Indoor breeding is still on the rise.&nbsp; I thank all the Advisors who have gone every weekend, including Dr Ahmad Magad, to deal with the cases in Pasir Ris.&nbsp; But I think we need to do a lot more to get our homeowners to switch and take on this 10-minute Mozzie Wipe-out as a daily habit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a perception that sometimes it is not fatal.&nbsp; So, if I get dengue, I go to the hospital, seven days and I am out.&nbsp; That is not true.&nbsp; So we have to tell Singaporeans that this disease is very dangerous.&nbsp; It can be fatal.&nbsp; It has proven to be fatal.&nbsp; So we have to remind Singaporeans that they have a role to play.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as I have mentioned, in all my replies in public, I can check all the outdoors, I can fine all the Government agencies, but I cannot go into your house unless there is a complaint.&nbsp; But you must do your part.&nbsp; If not, I would have to come down harder.</p></div></span>			<p align=left>Column: 1030<p>		<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo</B>:&nbsp; Sir, the Minister has given a very comprehensive listing of programmes that they are doing with regard to addressing&nbsp;dengue fever.&nbsp; I do not know whether in the Minister's programme he has&nbsp;also alerted the Town Councils on the need to comb through the parks and the landscape, because some of the varieties of plants and bushes that we have in our parks are actually collecting water.&nbsp; Despite the ovitraps, etc, I think these other areas we should also not neglect.&nbsp; I do not know whether it is the Minister's programme.&nbsp; If not, I would really appreciate it if we could&nbsp;have a more regular and vigilant inspection of the types of varieties of plants that we have in our parks and gardens.&nbsp;&nbsp;If need be, whether we have to actually remove and replant them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would appreciate it if the Minister could address that.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Fitness instructors in SSC's gyms monitor the performance of users and advise them on proper methods during their training.&nbsp; The instructors pay particular attention to first-time gym users.&nbsp; Safety advisory notices on proper use of equipment are also displayed in prominent areas in the gyms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our schools follow strict safety guidelines and procedures while conducting physical education, co-curricular activities and other sporting activities.&nbsp; These guidelines include&nbsp;Physical Education lessons before 10.30 am and after 3.30 pm, unless indoor facilities are available, ensuring that students are well-hydrated during physical activity, and introducing physical activities progressively and at a level appropriate to the individual or group.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Baey Yam Keng and Dr Lam asked about the measures to be taken to enhance the safety practices during sports events, in the National Sports Associations (NSAs) and at common exercise areas.&nbsp; As announced by my Minister Dr&nbsp;Vivian Balakrishnan on 30th June 2007, SSC has already&nbsp;set up a committee to look into the area of sports safety.&nbsp; This Sports Safety Committee will be chaired by Dr Benedict Tan, who is the Head of the Sports Medicine Centre at the Changi General Hospital.&nbsp; It will comprise<p align=left>Column: 1033<p> experts from the medical and sports sectors, as well as members from the public, private and people sectors.&nbsp; It also includes a parent of a triathlete.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The committee will look into how to minimise unnecessary risks in sports and create a system of effective and best practices for sports safety for all stakeholders, such as NSAs, sports event organisers, sports facility operators, and so on.&nbsp; Some of the areas that the committee will cover are enhancing public awareness of sports safety, reviewing safety procedures and medical support for sports events, programmes,&nbsp;facilities,&nbsp;training and competencies of first responders in the event of injury or emergencies.&nbsp; The committee will put up a preliminary report to SSC in a month's time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sports safety is something&nbsp;we cannot afford to compromise on.&nbsp; And the&nbsp;SSC and the Sports Safety Committee will be working towards enhancing these&nbsp;sports safety systems and we have zero tolerance for it.

Sports participants, on the other hand, especially those of the weekend warriors and corporate warriors, should train progressively for vigorous and difficult activities, such as marathons and triathlons, and prepare themselves by doing the proper warm-up, monitor their overall health condition,&nbsp;go for regular medical screenings, and not push themselves to carry on when they do not feel well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.00 pm</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.04 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law (Prof. S Jayakumar):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill makes several amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore.&nbsp; The main amendment is to make changes to the composition of the Legal Service Commission (LSC) as well as to enhance and institutionalise the personnel management system of the Singapore Legal Service.&nbsp; There are three other amendments:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;to make provision for alternate members on the Council of Presidential Advisers to act in place of<p align=left>Column: 1036<p> members who are temporarily unable to take part in Council proceedings; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;to shorten the oaths of office for the Prime Minister, Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries; and (3) to provide that Judicial Commissioners who are appointed to hear specific cases need not be subjected to repeated oath-taking.&nbsp; Some of these amendments, Sir, affect the President's discretionary powers, though not adversely.&nbsp; The President has been consulted on them, and he supports them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>The Legal Service Commission and personnel management system of the Singapore Legal Service</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me first deal with the amendments pertaining to the changes to the Legal Service Commission and to the personnel management system of the Singapore Legal Service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These amendments are a follow-up to my Statement to this House on 3rd April last year, when I announced&nbsp;a review of the personnel management framework for the Singapore Legal Service.&nbsp; As I then explained, our Legal Service personnel management system was inherited from the British. The Constitutional framework for the Legal Service has remained largely unchanged since Singapore's independence, even though the demands on legal services have changed radically.&nbsp; We need to strengthen the personnel management system to make it more robust as well as more responsive to the new challenges in managing talent and personnel in the expanded Legal Service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said in my Ministerial Statement last year:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "... The Government has discussed with the outgoing Chief Justice Yong Pung How, the incoming Chief Justice as well as the next Attorney-General, on how we can build on this hard-won reputation. They are all agreed that<p align=left>Column: 1037<p> the key is to have the right people in our judiciary and legal service.&nbsp; It is vital that we maintain a continuing inflow of talent and attract the best and promising law graduates to the Legal Service.&nbsp; They are also unanimous that, to achieve this, we need to restructure the Legal Service Commission (LSC) and update our personnel management system. We also need a more systematic talent management system."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a follow-up, the LSC appointed the Legal Service Personnel Management Review Panel on 20th April 2006, chaired by Justice Lee Seiu Kin, to conduct a comprehensive review. The Panel made several recommendations on the management and development of talent in the Singapore Legal Service. And these recommendations are now being implemented.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The LSC sits at the apex of the personnel management system for the Singapore Legal Service.&nbsp; It is vested with the Constitutional authority to recruit, promote and discipline all legal service officers.&nbsp; Currently, the LSC comprises the Chief Justice, the Attorney-General, the Chairman of the PSC, a Judge of the Supreme Court nominated by the Chief Justice, and two members of the PSC as nominated by the Chairman of the PSC.&nbsp; In other words, they are all members by virtue of the offices that they hold.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This composition has remained unchanged since independence.&nbsp; The membership of the LSC will now be widened to provide for the appointment of more members with experience that is relevant to the Singapore Legal Service of today.&nbsp; The LSC will be restructured to include members with a wider range of experience, for example, people who have worked in personnel management or who have knowledge of the legal service or the legal profession.&nbsp; They can be from the <p align=left>Column: 1038<p>private sector, and can include retired judges or retired senior counsel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chief Justice will continue to be President of the LSC, and the Attorney-General and the Chairman of the PSC will also continue as members of the Committee.&nbsp; Article 111 of the Constitution will be amended to provide up to six more LSC members, who need not necessarily be Supreme Court Judges or PSC members. The additional members will be nominated by the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice and Chairman PSC, respectively. The Prime Minister, the Chief Justice and Chairman PSC can each nominate one but not more than two additional members for appointment by the President.&nbsp; The President, however, is not bound by these nominations.&nbsp; His power to veto appointments under Article 22 is expanded to these additional LSC members.&nbsp; In doing so, we preserve the President's safeguard role as regards the integrity of the Singapore public service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A significant change is that the Prime Minister will now nominate up to two LSC members.&nbsp; Currently, the Prime Minister has no role in the appointment of LSC members.&nbsp; This change is consistent with the role of the Prime Minister in recommending appointments of judges after consulting the Chief Justice.&nbsp; It is also consistent with the role of the Prime Minister in recommending appointments to the PSC and his retaining responsibility for the civil service of which the Legal Service is a part.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Prime Minister will be nominating only two out of the six nominated LSC members, and his nominations will have to be approved by the President acting in his discretion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Constitution will also be amended to allow Personnel Boards to be established for the Singapore Legal Service, and for these Boards to operate autonomously from the LSC.&nbsp; Under the present personnel management system of the Singapore Legal Service, Personnel<p align=left>Column: 1039<p> Boards have been established by the LSC, but these Personnel Boards are delegates of the LSC, deriving all powers and functions from the LSC and discharging those powers and functions under LSC's direction and control.&nbsp; The amendments in the Bill will allow the Personnel Boards of the Legal Service to evolve to become like the Personnel Boards for the rest of the civil service, with adaptations, of course, because of the smaller number of officers in the Singapore Legal Service.&nbsp; A new Article 111AA will allow the President, on the advice of the Prime Minister, to establish one or more Personnel Boards having charge over different classes of Legal Service officers.&nbsp; The powers of the LSC will be devolved to the Personnel Boards for Legal Service officers, except the power of dismissal and disciplinary control, and all powers of recruitment and promotion of Legal Service officers of and above a certain threshold grade.&nbsp; Once a Personnel Board is established for a specific class of Legal Service officers, the powers of the LSC will cease to be exercisable with respect to that class of officers, except in an appellate capacity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The members of a Personnel Board for Legal Service officers may or may not be members of the LSC.&nbsp; LSC Personnel Board members will be appointed by the President where he agrees with the advice of the LSC.&nbsp; Like the Personnel Boards for other civil servants, the appointment of members of the LSC Personnel Board is also subject to the President's veto.&nbsp; Moreover, political office- holders, Members of Parliament and trade unionists will likewise be disqualified from sitting on the LSC Personnel Boards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with the changes to the composition of the LSC, and the separately constituted Personnel Boards for Legal Service officers, the Secretary to the PSC will also cease to be concurrently the Secretary to the LSC.&nbsp; The LSC can have its own Secretary, who must be a <p align=left>Column: 1040<p>public officer appointed by the President, on the advice of the LSC.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arising from these Constitutional amendments, related consequential amendments to the Public Service Commission Act will also be necessary to extend its scope and protection to the LSC and its members and to the Personnel Boards for the Legal Service.&nbsp; I will explain those amendments in greater detail during the Second Reading of the Public Service Commission (Amendment) Bill, which is the next item on the Order Paper.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Council of Presidential Advisers</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now deal with the amendments to allow for the appointment of alternate members to act in place of members of the Council of Presidential Advisers ("the Council") who are temporarily unable to take part in any proceedings of the Council.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Constitution now provides for the appointment of temporary members where a Council member, for a period of three months or more, is unable to take part in the proceedings of the Council for reasons of illness, absence or other reason.&nbsp; This is in Article 37C.&nbsp; The President can appoint a temporary member on the advice of the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice or the Chairman of the Public Service Commission (PSC), as the case may be.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;however, this provision&nbsp;to appoint temporary members has practical limitations.&nbsp; It does not apply to periods of absence or illness shorter than three months. It also does not address the situation where a Council member cannot participate in Council proceedings in order to avoid any perception of conflict of interest.&nbsp; To address these issues, the President has requested for changes to the Constitution to provide for the appointment of alternate members in place of temporary members. The <p align=left>Column: 1041<p>President was consulted on the changes and he supports these amendments in clauses 4, 5 and 6 of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article 37C, which today provides for the appointment of temporary members, will be repealed.&nbsp; It will be replaced with a new Article allowing the President to appoint two alternate members to act in place of any of the Council members, other than the Chairman, who is temporarily prevented from taking part in any proceedings of the Council.&nbsp; The requirement that the temporary disability should be for more than three months will be omitted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One alternate member will be appointed by the President in his discretion.&nbsp; The other alternate members will be appointed by the President on the nomination of the Prime Minister, after the Prime Minister has consulted with the Chief Justice and the Chairman of the PSC, the latter being the two other nominating authorities for the other Council members.&nbsp; The two alternate members will each be appointed for a term of four years, and each will be subject to the same disqualifications as for Council members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event a Council member is temporarily unable to attend at any Council proceedings, whether by illness, absence or any other reason, one of the two alternate members appointed can then be selected to act in place of that member. Where a Council member is appointed to act as Chairman of the Council, such as whenever the Chairman of the Council himself is Acting President, an alternate member may also be selected to act in that member's place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The selection as to which alternate member will actually serve at any instance will be made either by the President, the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice or the <p align=left>Column: 1042<p>Chairman of the PSC, depending on whose nominee on the Council is temporarily unable to attend Council proceedings.&nbsp; The President will make the selection solely at his discretion if the Council member who is temporarily unable to attend is the President's nominee.&nbsp; Where, however, if the Council member who is temporarily unable to attend is the nominee of the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice or the Chairman of the PSC, the selection will be made by the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice or the Chairman of the PSC, respectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the alternate members are like full Council members.&nbsp; Each alternate member has to take an oath of office and allegiance before assuming his duties as an alternate member.&nbsp; However, to avoid repeated oath-taking, the alternate member need not be required to take such an oath more than once during his term of office as an alternate member.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Oaths of Office for the Prime Minister, Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now turn to the amendments to shorten the oaths of office for the Prime Minister, Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries.&nbsp; The existing oaths of office are too lengthy and may be shortened without affecting the substance of the oaths.&nbsp; The present oaths of office for the Prime Minister, Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries in the First Schedule of the Constitution will be replaced with shorter oaths.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me stress, Sir, that while the new oaths are more succinct and concise, their essence remains unaffected.&nbsp; The oaths have been significantly shortened by leaving out two existing paragraphs on confidentiality of Cabinet discussions and maintenance of secrecy.&nbsp; Let me assure the House that, in substance, there&nbsp;is no change, as the Cabinet is bound by Article 24(2) of the Constitution and is<p align=left>Column: 1043<p> collectively responsible to Parliament.&nbsp; Secrecy of Cabinet discussions is the foundation of collective responsibility.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Repeated Oath-taking by Judicial Commissioners</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, the remaining amendment deals with oath-taking by Judicial Commissioners appointed to hear specific cases. Currently, Article 94 of the Constitution allows for the appointment of Judicial Commissioners for a period of time and also to hear specific cases.&nbsp; Article 97 requires a Judicial Commissioner to take an Oath of Office on each appointment.&nbsp; This means that a Judicial Commissioner who is appointed to hear two specific cases within a relatively short period of time will have to take the oath twice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chief Justice suggested, and the Government agreed, that we can dispense with oath-taking if the interval between cases is short.&nbsp; The Constitution will be amended such that Judicial Commissioners who are appointed to hear specific cases need not take the oath again if the interval between the cases heard is less than 12 months.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.25 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise serious reservations about one aspect of the Bill, and that is clause 8 which amends Article 111 to make changes to the composition of the Legal Service Commission.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these reservations arise because the Legal Service also comprises persons who are serving in the Subordinate Courts judiciary as Magistrates and District Judges.&nbsp; The Subordinate Courts administer justice and all of us have a<p align=left>Column: 1044<p> right to expect that the judicial officers will administer justice impartially.&nbsp; As such, we must make all efforts to give the public confidence that the personnel management system of these judicial officers will enhance their standing as independent arbiters of disputes.&nbsp;&nbsp; I listened to the Deputy Prime Minister's justification for the changes.&nbsp; Notwithstanding that, I believe that clause 8 has the potential of undermining public confidence in the courts' independence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the existing Constitution, the LSC comprises&nbsp;the Chief Justice as President, the Attorney-General, the Chairman of the Public Service Commission, a High Court Judge nominated by the Chief Justice, and up to two members of the PSC.&nbsp; Under clause 8 of the Bill, the composition of the LSC is to be changed to include up to two nominees of the Prime Minister.&nbsp; If the Bill is passed, the LSC still retains its role of deciding on dismissal and disciplinary action of legal officers.&nbsp; For officers above a certain threshold grade, the LSC will also make career decisions, such as promotions and transfers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could the Minister clarify further the rationale for having a new category of LSC members who are the Prime Minister's nominees?&nbsp; If the concern is to ensure that the Legal Service manpower policies are in line with the rest of the civil service, it seems to me that the PSC representatives on the LSC can already perform that role.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Members of the PSC who are sitting on the LSC had originally been appointed to the PSC on the recommendations of the Prime Minister.&nbsp; The Attorney-General who also sits on the LSC is a member of the Government.&nbsp; To now have two members specifically nominated by the Prime Minister potentially gives the Executive branch of the Government even more <p align=left>Column: 1045<p>influence over critical career decisions of our judicial officers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my concern is that this can be interpreted as a regressive step for judicial independence.&nbsp; Under the existing system, it is already clear that the Subordinate Courts judiciary does not enjoy security of tenure, unlike High Court Judges, as they can lose their judicial role at any time by being transferred out of the courts to other departments.&nbsp;Whatever the rationale of having a category of the Prime Minister's nominees on the LSC, we should step back and ask ourselves what message is being sent.&nbsp; Even if the intention is not to weaken the role of the Subordinate Courts judiciary, how would the public perceive this move?&nbsp; Would they not think that the judicial officers would still need to consider the interests of the Executive Government in reaching their decisions?&nbsp; After all, the system we are putting in place specifically allows nominees of the Prime Minister&nbsp;a say&nbsp;in their career progression.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, clause 9 proposes a new Article 111AA to set up Personnel Boards to exercise the functions of the LSC permanently, ie, once the Boards are constituted, the LSC can no longer exercise these functions.&nbsp; The members of the Personnel Boards will be appointed based on LSC's recommendations.&nbsp; Since the composition of the LSC itself is going to change to specifically include the Prime Minister's nominees, then recommendations of the LSC for the Personnel Boards would carry the same concerns about how independent they are vis-a-vis the Executive Government.&nbsp; While it may well be the case that the nominees are persons of integrity, would they be perceived as truly independent actors?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this Bill touches on one of the pillars of the rule of law, ie, the law is to be applied to everybody equally,<p align=left>Column: 1046<p> regardless of status or power.&nbsp; While we have entrenched safeguards to protect the independence of the High Court judiciary, we have not done the same for the Subordinate Courts judiciary.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Subordinate Courts' jurisdiction has been enlarged greatly over the years.&nbsp; They handle the vast majority of criminal cases&nbsp; -&nbsp; the Deputy Prime Minister himself mentioned a figure of 200,000 a year - and civil claims up to a quarter million dollars are also handled by the Subordinate Courts.&nbsp; According to their <I>Annual Report 2006</I>, they dealt with more than 350,000 cases in 2006.&nbsp; Thus, in terms of caseload, their role in the administration of justice directly affects more lives than the High Court.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is my strong belief that we should avoid taking any steps which might be perceived as weakening the independence of the Subordinate Courts judiciary.&nbsp; I believe that the proposed change in the LSC composition carries a real risk of undermining public confidence in the neutrality of our courts.&nbsp; And, as such, the proposed change is of grave concern.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

"What is perhaps more important is the integrity of the people who operate the system, ie, the investigative and the prosecutorial agencies, and the ultimate supervisor of the criminal process,&nbsp; the judiciary.&nbsp; In other words, it is people who make a system fair and just, and not the reverse."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand the constitutional amendment in relation to the Legal Service Commission&rsquo;s Personnel Boards to be preserving just that model.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1047<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new Article 111AA seeks to allow the President, on the advice of the Prime Minister, to establish by subsidiary legislation one or more Personnel Boards having charge over Legal Service officers.&nbsp; My understanding is that this amendment seeks to decentralise the management of officers.&nbsp; It seeks to create a more local supervisory system.&nbsp; In essence, it involves a devolution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The merits of having a more localised Personnel Board are three-fold:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the Personnel Board would, presumably, be made up of members within the officer's department.&nbsp; As such, it will be able to better assess the officer's ground skills to ascertain which posting the officer ought to receive next.&nbsp; It will be able to chart the officer's postings, based on a local assessment of the officer's skill-set.&nbsp; The board would also have had the benefit of reviewing his work on a day-to-day basis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the officer himself will benefit from a proximate "sounding board" from which he is able to establish how he is performing on the job. Such proximity will also enable the officer to communicate what his interests are to the board and which portfolio he prefers for his next posting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the plurality of the Personnel Boards (ie,&nbsp;if the amendment envisions the establishing of more than just one board) will assist the &nbsp;LSC in the collation of vital data.&nbsp; If multiple Personnel Boards are envisioned, such as one for each arm of the Service (for example, AG's Chambers, the Subordinate Courts, or the High Court Registry), the collation and submission of data by these boards to LSC will enable&nbsp;LSC to: (a) better rank officers across each&nbsp;arm of the Service; (b) assess which areas of practice the Service, in general, needs to improve on; and (c) devote more time to the important <p align=left>Column: 1048<p>task of assessing which officers have the potential to take up senior positions within the Service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I wish to highlight that the devolution of functions to Personnel Boards must not be at the expense of LSC's aim of promoting not just the officers who have skills organic to their daily jobs, but also officers who possess the helicopter qualities needed for leadership positions within the Service.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, indeed, these are goals of the proposed amendments, the LSC's secretariat, whose current function is to assist in the annual grading exercise of officers, must be allocated a larger financial budget so as to meet these new demands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the proposed changes must not be viewed as merely enhancing the career development of the officer and the morale within the Legal Service.&nbsp; The amendments merit much more than such&nbsp;parochial appreciation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The challenge is not only to chart a career path for a&nbsp;Legal Service officer, but it is to ensure that what he is being charted for meets the growing range of legal services that Singapore wants to provide to local and international clients.&nbsp; Intellectual&nbsp;Property, Competition Law and sophisticated litigation are only a few of the fast-changing areas which both the private and public sectors need to be proficient in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To this end, on 3rd April&nbsp;last year, DPM Jayakumar emphasised, and I quote:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As lawyers in the House would know, the legal landscape has changed tremendously in recent years, reflecting the wider changes taking place in the world.&nbsp; With each passing day, the frontiers of law are being pushed further and further.&nbsp; We need only to look at the developments in intellectual property, alternative dispute resolution, information technology and financial services."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1049<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Jayakumar went on to stress:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our Legal Service, therefore, needs to keep abreast of these wider developments, and we need good and able minds in the Legal Service with expertise to advise, prosecute as well as to adjudicate."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The profession's private sector and the Legal Service must move in tandem in order to keep ahead of this pace.&nbsp; Neither should have a monopoly of talent.&nbsp; Instead, they should augment each other so that clients will choose the Singapore legal arena as their jurisdiction for adjudicating disputes or concluding contracts because they know that they will be serviced by top minds in Government and in the private sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the areas of law I practise, two display the need for tandem progress in both the private and public sectors.&nbsp; These areas are Competition Law and Intellectual Property (or IP law for short).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Competition Commission of Singapore is staffed by Legal Service officers and economists.&nbsp; Among other things, it has a set of guidelines to regularise the manner in which the Commission will treat companies who "come clean" on their anti-competitive behaviour.&nbsp; This set of guidelines also seeks to explain the leniency programme for companies that "come clean" and seek help in how to become competition-friendly.&nbsp; These guidelines detail what level of immunity (whether half or full) the company will receive if the information that they provide is useful.&nbsp; The point I am making here is that the Commission is concerned with promoting competition in the Singapore economy via methods, such as this leniency programme.&nbsp; However, private sector lawyers and their corporate clients are most concerned with what information needs to be told to the <p align=left>Column: 1050<p>Commission and what immunity clients will receive. It is crucial, therefore,&nbsp;for the Commission to strike the right balance between enforcement and commercial sense.&nbsp; International as well as local clients will be affected, if the right balance is not struck.&nbsp; This displays how much we need to invest in the career development of our Legal Service officers and the profession as a whole.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where IP Law is concerned, many areas of IP jurisprudence are still being decided for the first time by the Singapore High Court.&nbsp; In a recent&nbsp;trial I was involved in, both plaintiff and defendant had to submit on what each thought were the criteria for ascertaining when a trade mark was "well-known".&nbsp; For this, parties submitted to Court authorities from the United States 9th Circuit Court, the European Court of Justice, and the <I>Hansard</I> report on DPM Jayakumar's speech in relation to the amendments of the Trade Marks Act. This was a classic example of how plaintiff, defendant and their respective counsel, Court and Parliament all sought to advance Singapore's Trade Marks law.&nbsp; This advancement is able to continue because of the strong judiciary we have developed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Personnel Boards will play a key role in ensuring that our officers are trained for and deployed to&nbsp;jobs that they can excel in.&nbsp; We must continue to invest in human capital.&nbsp; The base plate for my view finds itself in the conviction with which former Chief Justice Yong Pung How delivered the following statement at the annual Legal Service dinner in 2001, and I quote:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is precisely because of the difficulty in arriving at neat strategic plans of what to do at each critical moment, that makes it vitally important to ensure that the Legal Service has a continuing flow of top talent at all levels.&nbsp; ... The Legal Service will have to be staffed by men and women who are effectively trained, with strong professional knowledge and<p align=left>Column: 1051<p> expertise, who can identify and analyse intricate and novel issues, and make sound judgments where the bottomline is not dollars and cents, but unquantifiable yet critical outcomes, ie, the continued Rule of Law and the fair administration of justice in Singapore."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The need to recruit and retain talent in the Legal Service is of paramount importance.&nbsp;&nbsp;In June of 2000, former CJ Yong paid a visit to England and invited six students for lunch at a restaurant near Piccadilly Circus.&nbsp; He asked each of us to seriously consider a career in the Legal Service. Each of us had yet to graduate but took CJ Yong's advice seriously.&nbsp; Five of us returned and joined the Service as judicial clerks. The sixth joined a magic circle firm's offshore office in Hong Kong.&nbsp; Of the five who returned, two are remaining in the Legal Service and have now been posted to the AG's Chambers.&nbsp; Of the three that left Service, one has since joined&nbsp;a management consultancy firm, the second returned to serve out her bond at SembCorp after a year, and I joined the private sector last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was an honour to serve as an officer in&nbsp;the Legal Service and I can attest to the fact that it is the people who make a system proficient and not the other way round.&nbsp; Having received three postings in four years in the Service, I gained a keen respect for my colleagues who had to exercise an immense amount of discretion each day.&nbsp; This included: (a) deciding whether or not to institute legal proceedings against entities or private individuals in the name of the State; (b) the judicial exercise of discerning whether, on the balance of probabilities, one party's case outweighed the other; and (c) as a judicial clerk researching into how other jurisdictions have tackled a novel point in a new area of law and what we could do to improve on it in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to differ from Ms Sylvia Lim, and I wish to state that never once in<p align=left>Column: 1052<p> all these three portfolios of mine was my will weakened.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the powers given to these officers derive from the office they assume - whether it be a Deputy to the Public Prosecutor, an Assistant to the Registrar of the High Court or a law Clerk to the Court of Appeal - at the end of the day, it is the human mind that makes the decision.&nbsp; And it matters most that that human mind is equipped with the best knowledge, training and experience to make the decision.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I support the efforts of the Legal Service Commission to improve its structure for investing in and developing this human capital.&nbsp; My sincere hope is that these structural changes introduced via this Bill will ensure that our Legal Service continues to remain first class.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Prof. Thio Li-ann (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.41 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Prof. Thio Li-ann (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, this constitutional amendment Bill is, I believe, the 37th such Bill&nbsp;since Independence was gained in 1965.&nbsp; Given the present composition of Parliament in our dominant party State, it will clearly be adopted and its effect will be to further modify our flexible Constitution, the highest law of the land.&nbsp;&nbsp;This latest Bill will not be the last one to shape the contours of Singapore's still evolving, often innovative, constitutional experiment.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than 40 years of statehood, the Constitution remains a work-in-progress, as the Government continues to work out our constitutional salvation.&nbsp; While our constitutional order traces its roots to the Westminster parliamentary system, a colonial legacy, this legal transplant has undergone local modifications through the creation of home-grown institutions, such as the Elected Presidency.&nbsp;&nbsp;This has&nbsp;produced a <p align=left>Column: 1053<p>unique hybrid which realigns the institutional scheme of checks and balances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the amendment Bill before us today, we see the&nbsp;out-working of having an Elected President rather than a purely ceremonial head of state.&nbsp; The President is constitutionally vested with limited negative or reactive executive powers designed to check the Cabinet in exercising its proactive or initiatory powers in relation to specified matters. The powers of the presidency are implicated, as various proposed amendments in this Bill relate to the selection process concerning key civil servants.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the chief functions of the Elected President, since it was constitutionally entrenched in 1991, is to check nepotism and corruption from creeping into how key civil servants are appointed.&nbsp; Previously, the Cabinet had unrestricted discretion in this matter.&nbsp; The existing check on the Cabinet today operates through the vehicle of a presidential veto -&nbsp;as it is casually known - or discretion not to concur with the Cabinet's choice of candidates for certain offices, such as the Accountant-General or Chairman of the Public Service Commission.&nbsp; The President exercises personal discretion in this&nbsp;manner.&nbsp; When the presidency was purely ceremonial prior to 1991, the President was constitutionally obliged to act 'on the advice of the Cabinet', which is basically a formality,&nbsp;a rubber-stamping function.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The presidential veto now applies to a new category of civil servants created by the proposed new Article 111AA of the amendment Bill.&nbsp; These are members of the newly-created Personnel Boards of the Singapore Legal Service which will exercise certain devolved functions formerly wielded by the Legal Service Commission, excluding the powers to <p align=left>Column: 1054<p>dismiss and discipline legal officers of a certain rank, which the Legal Service Commission retains.&nbsp; The President can refuse to concur with the advice of the Legal Service Commission in relation to who to appoint to these Personnel Boards.&nbsp; The fact that these Personnel Boards fall within the scheme of the President's veto is a recognition of the important public function they play, justifying this extra layer of checks.&nbsp; It also applies in the appointment of Personnel Boards of the PSC under the current legal framework.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end goal of this institutional setup of having the Elected President check the Cabinet in limited matters is to ensure good, transparent and accountable Government.&nbsp; This is part of the political philosophy underlying our Constitution which establishes the rule of law as a fundamental constitutional principle.&nbsp; This affirms that we aspire and subscribe to a government of law and not the arbitrary rule of man.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bedrock of wisdom offered by the ideal of constitutionalism is that "ambition must be made to counteract ambition".&nbsp; Since public power may be abused, one method of addressing this classic problem of power is to diffuse political power and share it out among the various Government branches, to prevent an over-concentration of power in one hand.&nbsp; The adoption of checks and balances is an application of the</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>separation of powers principle which espouses the wisdom and prudence of adopting institutional and procedural barriers to hinder potential abuses of power.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our institutions are designed on these principles.&nbsp; When amending the Constitution to refine existing institutions or to create new ones, it is important that this should be done with an eye to ensuring consistency with basic constitutional principles and coherence<p align=left>Column: 1055<p> with the existing constitutional framework of powers.&nbsp; This is indeed reflected in some of the amendments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the principle governing the selection of members of the non-elected Council of Presidential Advisers, as set out in Article 37B, is faithfully adhered to in the proposed&nbsp;amendment to Article 37C.&nbsp; This provides for the appointment of alternate members to the Council.&nbsp; This is important to ensure that this advisory organ to the President is fully staffed, should&nbsp;a member fall ill.&nbsp; It also caters to the scenario where the presidency becomes vacant or the President is unable to discharge his functions because he is ill or out of Singapore.&nbsp; In these cases, the Chairman of the Council of Presidential Advisers steps in as Acting President.&nbsp; Clearly, the Chairman cannot wear two hats, that is, the mantle of the presidency and the garb of adviser to the President.&nbsp; There must be some separation of functions or powers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is perhaps necessitated because the original proposal to have a Vice-President was eventually rejected.&nbsp; Meeting the contingency of a vacated office always should be provided for, to prevent disruptions to the running of Government.&nbsp; So, too, constitutionally established organs should always be fully staffed and able to function effectively.&nbsp; By providing for alternate members, the new Article 37C seeks to ensure the Council of Presidential Advisers is always fully manned.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as&nbsp;the power to appoint these advisers is not monopolised by any one Government branch but shared between the President, Prime Minister, Chief Justice and PSC Chairman, the power to appoint alternate advisers under the new Article 37C is parcelled out.&nbsp;The President appoints one and the other is appointed by the Prime Minister, in consultation with the Chief Justice and PSC Chairman.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'checks and balances' interplay&nbsp;of political,<p align=left>Column: 1056<p> administrative and legal constitutional officers in this decision-making process moderates the exercise of power.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article 111 is also being amended and the change is quite substantive.&nbsp; Article 111 relates to another non-elected institution, the Legal Service Commission, or LSC,&nbsp;how its members are selected and by which constitutional actor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to enlarging the size of the LSC, the new amendments bring about alterations in two significant aspects.&nbsp; Firstly, it changes the criteria governing who may be appointed to sit in the LSC; the criteria have been modified and broadened.&nbsp; Secondly, it vests the power to nominate candidates to be appointed to sit in the LSC in&nbsp;a new&nbsp;constitutional actor.&nbsp; This is a substantive change and appears to&nbsp;mark a&nbsp;shift in principle or policy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principle of de-politicisation buttresses the existing system regulating the selection process and composition of the LSC. This seeks to keep political influence out of this matter or, at least, to minimise such influence.&nbsp; Presumably, this is to secure the institutional values of objectivity, impartiality and fairness in the management of public servants by the PSC, in general, and the appointment, transfer, discipline and dismissal of legal officers under the jurisdiction of the LSC or its Personnel Boards.&nbsp; Otherwise, the weight of politics may exert undue influence or bias into the process, compelling civil servants to comply with the will of their political masters.&nbsp;Some degree of separation or de-politicisation is desirable to preserve the virtues of the rule of law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the existing regime laid out in&nbsp;Article 111(2) of the Constitution, three members of the LSC are pre-selected in the sense they are drawn from the holders of three stipulated constitutional officers - the Chief Justice, Attorney-General and<p align=left>Column: 1057<p> Chairman of&nbsp;PSC.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Chief Justice and Attorney-General enjoy tenure until ages 65&nbsp;and 60 respectively, which is designed to insulate these officers from unwarranted political influence.&nbsp; The Chief Justice appoints the Supreme Court Judge, while the PSC Chairman may nominate up to two PSC members, to make the full complement of LSC members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the proposed new Article 111(2A), the three stipulated officers continue to be LSC members.&nbsp; The point of departure is in the modification of appointing powers and criteria for LSC membership.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chief Justice under the new scheme will have an increased power to nominate up to a maximum of two persons.&nbsp; The nominees are not required to be Supreme Court Judges.&nbsp; The PSC Chairman continues to have the power to nominate up to two persons, but there is no longer any requirement that they be PSC members.&nbsp; The general rule governing this refashioned nominating power is that either the Chief Justice or PSC Chairman nominates two persons, at least one must be a qualified person under section 2(1) of the Legal Profession Act for a minimum 10-year period.&nbsp; This indicates that while the membership of the LSC should be dominated by those&nbsp;with legal training and experience, this should not be an exclusively legal affair.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, consonant with the principle of de-politicisation, new Article 111(2B) seeks to preclude or minimise the politicised composition of the LSC.&nbsp; This Article is modelled&nbsp;on Article 106 of the Constitution which sets out the disqualifications for membership in the PSC.&nbsp;This principle is also applied to members of the soon-to-be created Personnel Boards of the Singapore Legal Service under the proposed new Article<p align=left>Column: 1058<p> 111AA(7).&nbsp;&nbsp; Article 111(2B) seeks to institutionally de-link LSC members from political influence, whether actual or perceptual.&nbsp; Article 111(2B) attempts to do so by precluding various categories of persons from becoming LSC members -&nbsp;thus, MPs, trade union members, office holders in political associations and employees of corporations, incorporated under existing laws, other than the Companies Act, such as an employee in a statutory body, are disqualified from LSC membership.&nbsp; Thus, the clear intent is that the process for nominating LSC members should, as far as is&nbsp;humanly possible, be freed from politics or that political influence is at least minimised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The primary change is the vesting of powers to nominate LSC members in&nbsp;a new constitutional office, that of the Prime Minister, who is added to the current slate of&nbsp;appointing authorities alongside the Chief Justice and PSC Chairman.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under this amendment, the Prime Minister will have the power, for the first time, to appoint up to two persons to sit in the LSC.&nbsp; This denotes a slight shift in political philosophy because the principle of de-politicisation, designed to shield a constitutional actor from what can be the gale-force of political influence, is somewhat modified.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current system, the influence of the Prime Minister over the composition of the LSC is, in formal terms at least, indirect.&nbsp; Any influence has to be traced to the fact that the Prime Minister has a role in selecting various constitutional officers who sit in the LSC,&nbsp;as stipulated under Article 111, that is, the Attorney-General, Chief Justice and the PSC Chairman.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the amendment, the Prime Minister will be able to directly influence the composition of the LSC through exercising his new powers of nomination.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1059<p> In what sense does this development represent a shift in principle?&nbsp;&nbsp;Conferring upon the Prime Minister for the first time a formal role in directly selecting LSC members does import in some degree of political influence since the Prime Minister holds an elected office and heads the parliamentary Executive or Cabinet Ministers as the first among equals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This might raise the concern, as it has done in the past, that it may be possible for the Executive to interfere with the subordinate Judiciary.&nbsp;This is because the LSC has jurisdiction over the appointment, transfer and dismissal of legal officers, including Subordinate Court Judges, who do not enjoy tenure under law.&nbsp; In all likelihood, the probability of such an occurrence may perhaps be remote but the possibility remains.&nbsp; One would&nbsp;however have to presume rather a lot of things to so conclude, including the assumption that the Prime Minister's nominees will not act independently of him but will do his bidding.&nbsp; Such possibilities may&nbsp;perhaps take up&nbsp;residence in the fertile imaginings of conspiracy theorists, but&nbsp;are unlikely to take root elsewhere.&nbsp; Nonetheless, from the perspective of constructing a system for the administration of justice, perceptions do count.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would hasten to add that this new power of the Prime Minister must be appreciated in context.&nbsp; The Prime Minister's discretion in relation to composing the LSC is not absolute.&nbsp; Three factors are worth considering. Firstly, it is shared&nbsp;with the&nbsp;Chief Justice and PSC Chairman -&nbsp;he does not monopolise it.&nbsp; Secondly, this discretion is, in fact, limited by the constitutionally enumerated criteria defining the eligible pool of candidates which is designed to ensure that the LSC members have no formal political affiliations.&nbsp; As mentioned, MPs, trade unionists or other persons who might have political affiliations or formal links to the Prime Minister or a political<p align=left>Column: 1060<p>party are expressly excluded from the selection pool.&nbsp;Lastly, the Prime Minister's power is itself subject to the checks of another organ of the Executive - the President.&nbsp; The new Article 111(d) will provide that the concurrence of the President, with the advice of the Prime Minister, Chief Justice or PSC Chair, as the case may be, in nominating his candidates is necessary to finalise the appointment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The direct involvement of the President as a countervailing check in the exercise of the appointing power in relation to the LSC members is also a new development,&nbsp;but it is consistent with the President's constitutional mandate in relation to key civil service appointments.&nbsp; Currently, members of the Public Service Commission are appointed by the President, provided the President, in his personal discretion, concurs with the Prime Minister's advice.&nbsp; That institutional set-up is now brought into play with respect to the composition of the Legal Service Commission. Thus, there is an official process under which the President can bring his wisdom to bear on the subject and can utilise the power of non-concurrence to influence the process and to even thwart a nomination.&nbsp; This can be a valuable safeguard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, in formal terms, while a politicised element is included into the selection process for LSC members by giving the Prime Minister a direct power and ability to influence the composition of the LSC, the pool of candidates he may choose from must formally have no political links, which is a de-politicising measure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This realignment of power which these amendments will bring about in relation to the selection process for LSC members is a manifestation of the principle of checks and balances and shows the separation of powers and operation.&nbsp; Previously, two important constitutional actors, the<p align=left>Column: 1061<p> President and Prime Minister, the Head of State and Head of Government respectively, did not have a direct role in determining the composition of the Legal Service Commission.&nbsp; This will change with the Amendment Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is heartening that a series of checks and balances have been incorporated into the scheme, consonant with the constitutional design of existing institutions.&nbsp; Thus, the power of the Prime Minister or other appointing authorities is subject to the moderating influence of the requirement that the President's concurrence is needed to confirm the appointment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The need for checks and balances harks back to the perennial twin problem of power:&nbsp;the need to empower Government to govern effectively, and the need to restrain power to curb abusive excesses to ensure Government is conducted fairly, while avoiding institutional gridlock and paralysis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The function of Constitutions and the institutions and processes they establish is to channel power.&nbsp; As James Madison stated in The Federalist No. 51, governments are the greatest reflection of human nature. He said, "If&nbsp;men were angels, no government would be necessary."&nbsp; Checks and balances are not needed if governors are wise, benevolent and angelic; but it would be the height of folly to assume this to be a permanent fixture in human affairs.&nbsp; History and prudence teach us the need to have precautions set in place to deal with worst-case scenarios.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As this Constitutional Amendment Bill indicates, its framers are aware of the need to emplace checks and balances in our constitutional order -&nbsp;they do exist; the task ahead, as in all constitutional orders, is to ensure that such institutional<p align=left>Column: 1062<p> safeguards work effectively for our common good.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, in reading clause 2, I also understand that the LSC membership might include lawyers with more than 10 years of experience in private practice.&nbsp; I welcome this inclusion, as it will no doubt expose the LSC to the best practices of the private sector and, hopefully, sensitise the LSC to the challenges faced by the private sector.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, Sir, I also wish to enquire why such membership to the LSC did not include members of the academia.&nbsp; I would certainly imagine that these learned men and women of the law, whose activities include in-depth research, would provide the LSC with useful inputs into its deliberations as well as to its decision-making process.&nbsp; Also, coming from an <p align=left>Column: 1063<p>academic domain, they may be able to provide fresh insights and perspectives to an issue that may elude practising members, whether from the public or private sector.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as a human resource practitioner, I warmly welcome the establishment of Personnel Boards for the LSC.&nbsp; Like any other organisations, the Singapore Legal Service faces the challenge of attracting, developing and retaining the best talents.&nbsp; Indeed, our goal so far as to say that the HR challenges of the Singapore Legal Service may be even more daunting, is that it needs to attract talents from a specialised discipline.&nbsp; We need to attract and keep the best legal eagles available to ensure the wheels of justice continue to work efficiently in Singapore.&nbsp; My colleagues before me, Mr Christopher de Souza and others, are such fine examples.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;I am compelled to express some disquiet at the proposed amendments to the First Schedule, in particular, the shortened oaths of office for the Prime Minister, Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries.&nbsp; The existing oaths are very specific on the duties and responsibilities of these officeholders, especially with regard to counsel and advice to the President and to the need for non-disclosure information.&nbsp; The new shorter oaths are curiously absent on these duties and responsibilities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is in the nature of law to be specific because the specifics provide the springwell of accountability.&nbsp; Some would say that the devil is in the details.&nbsp; I would like to enquire why these oaths of office need to be shorter.&nbsp; The existing oaths are only four paragraphs long, and I am sure reciting the existing oath is not onerous on the Prime Minister, Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries.&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.03 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to speak in support of<p align=left>Column: 1064<p> the proposed amendments to the Constitution, in particular, the amendments to Article 111 of the Constitution which expands the composition of the Legal Service Commission, and, secondly, the amendment to insert a new Article 111AA to provide for the establishment of Personnel Boards under the Legal Service Commission for the Legal Service.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have three main points.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; It is vitally important for the Legal Service to attract and retain top talent;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; The expansion of the membership of the Legal Service Commission to include appointees from the private sector is a step in the right direction that will help the Legal Service to attract and retain talent; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; The establishment of Personnel Boards is also a progressive move that will enable more efficient HR management within the Legal Service.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the first point, legal officers, being involved in the administration of justice as they are, have a direct and significant impact on the day-to-day lives of people in Singapore.&nbsp; In their capacities as prosecutors, registrars, district judges and as drafters of legislation, legal officers interface with ordinary people in almost every aspect of their daily lives.&nbsp; The work that the legal officers do and the decisions which they make can change the course of a person's life.&nbsp; As prosecutors, they make decisions on whether someone should be prosecuted for a crime, the way in which a matter is prosecuted determines whether or not someone goes to jail or is otherwise penalised.&nbsp; As registrars, magistrates and district judges, legal officers have to decide on cases.&nbsp; Their decisions affect people in a myriad variety of ways.&nbsp; Should a divorce be granted?&nbsp; Should maintenance be paid?&nbsp; Who gets custody<p align=left>Column: 1065<p> of a child?&nbsp; How do you punish someone for the crime?&nbsp; Does he go to jail or probation?&nbsp; The adjudication of commercial disputes which, in turn, affects Singapore's reputation as an economic and financial hub?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the quality of our administration of justice and our ability to maintain our reputation in this regard depend very much on the quality of people that the Legal Service is able to recruit.&nbsp; Poor quality recruitment means poor administration of justice, something that we cannot afford.&nbsp; Under the Constitution, the Legal Service Commission is tasked with the appointment, confirmation, placement, promotion, transfer and dismissal of all officers in the Singapore Legal Service.&nbsp; In order to fulfill this task, the LSC has to be up to speed, not just with the developments within the Legal Service and Government but also with developments in the private sector, because the Legal Service Commission has to compete with the private sector in order to recruit and retain legal officers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This competition should not be underestimated.&nbsp; We have a relatively small pool of legal graduates.&nbsp; Currently, our law graduates come from NUS, although the SMU graduates will come onstream in a few years.&nbsp; There are, of course, students with overseas law degrees, but these are also a relatively small number, due to the strict quality control requirements that have to be met in order to practise in Singapore.&nbsp; There is limited supply and, currently, there is a very high demand.&nbsp; And the LSC is faced with stiff competition for the recruitment of talent.&nbsp; Its competitors are not just the local law firms but also foreign law firms, companies which need inhouse counsel, and even employers from non-legal industries who nevertheless want legally-trained people for positions which are not law related.&nbsp; In this regard, I should<p align=left>Column: 1066<p> declare my interest as a private practitioner and also the Recruitment Director of my company, because we are in direct competition with the Legal Service Commission, and we will do our utmost to attract and retain the top legal talent.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it is not just about recruitment.&nbsp; It is also a question of retention.&nbsp; More and more, players in the legal industry are finding that getting in talent is one thing, but keeping it is quite another.&nbsp; And the Legal Service is no exception.&nbsp; Typically, in the private sector, we find that attrition tends to occur after about three to four years when people start to take stock of their careers and decide what they want to do for the future.&nbsp; In dealing with all these challenges in attracting and retaining legal talent, the Legal Service Commission has to be <I>au fait</I> with developments in the legal industry.&nbsp; This includes having to keep up not just with salaries but also understanding what attracts law graduates to join them and what people outside are doing to attract the same people.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the proposed amendment to Article 111 of the Constitution to allow for expanded membership of the LSC is a step in the right direction, because including or allowing the possibility of including people from the private sector or with personnel management backgrounds will better equip the LSC for its task of recruiting and retaining talent in the face of the fierce competition for talent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This brings me then to the points made by Ms Sylvia Lim and Prof&nbsp;Thio Li-ann on the question of whether one should include the Prime Minister's nominations to the Legal Service Commission.&nbsp; A lot of noise and smoke have been generated by this discussion.&nbsp; But it is like a mirage in the desert.&nbsp; When you really examine it, you will see that there is nothing there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1067<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first point is this.&nbsp; The suggestion is that a nomination of two people to the LSC by the Prime Minister will somehow politicise the work of the LSC.&nbsp; But what people forget - in fact, this was actually alluded to indirectly by Prof Thio - is that it is not the Prime Minister that appoints.&nbsp; The specific amendment and provision provides that the President appoints and he appoints, acting in his discretion, and it is only a matter of whether he concurs with the advice of the Prime Minister.&nbsp; The point to remember is this.&nbsp; Our President is not an appointed President.&nbsp; He is an Elected President.&nbsp; He derives his power, authority and mandate from the people of Singapore.&nbsp; And when he makes this decision, he makes it acting in his discretion and not simply because the Prime Minister requests him to do so.&nbsp; So, that is the first and overriding consideration to remember.&nbsp; This is not a political appointment.&nbsp; This is the Prime Minister giving advice to the President who acts in his discretion with a direct mandate from the electorate, the people of Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point is this.&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim has suggested that the Legal Service Commission should remain as it is.&nbsp; She is happy for it to remain as it is because she feels that the amendment, together with the proposed amendment for the appointment of the Prime Minister, would interfere with the independence of the Subordinate Court Judiciary.&nbsp; Let us examine the composition of the current Legal Service Commission.&nbsp; That is provided for in Article 111 of the Constitution.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Article 111 provides for five categories of people from the Legal Service Commission.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the Chief Justice, who is the President.&nbsp; Who appoints the Chief Justice?&nbsp; The Chief Justice is appointed under Article 95 of the Constitution.&nbsp; And guess what?&nbsp; He is appointed by the<p align=left>Column: 1068<p> President, acting in his discretion on the advice of the Prime Minister.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, in Article 111(2A), the second member of the Legal Service Commission is the Attorney-General.&nbsp; The Attorney-General is appointed under Article 35 of the Constitution.&nbsp; And guess what?&nbsp; He is appointed by the President, acting in his discretion on the advice of the Prime Minister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the Chairman of the Public Service Commission.&nbsp; The Chairman of the Public Service Commission and the members of the Public Service Commission,&nbsp;who are actually appointed under Article 105 of the Constitution, are also appointed by the President, acting upon the advice of the Prime Minister.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current provisions, it would have been a Judge of the Supreme Court nominated specially by the Chief Justice.&nbsp; But, of course, Judges of the Supreme Court, like the Chief Justice, are appointed under Article 95, also by the President in his discretion, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, two members of the Public Service Commission, who, as we have already seen, are also appointed by the President,&nbsp;acting on the advice of the Prime Minister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what I do not understand is this: why is it that it is fine to have the current Legal Service Commission all appointed by the President acting on the advice of the Prime Minister, but it is not all right to have two additional nominees nominated by the Prime Minister&nbsp;who would only be appointed if the President, acting in his discretion, decides to do so?&nbsp; Logically, it does not make sense.&nbsp; That is why I do not agree with the objections to having the Prime Minister add two nominations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, we have no issue with the appointment of our High Court Judges whose reputation as administrators of <p align=left>Column: 1069<p>justice not only in Singapore but internationally is a sterling one, and each and every single one of them is appointed by the President, acting in his discretion on the advice of the Prime Minister.&nbsp; If the quality of our High Court Bench is something that is internationally respected and renowned, then I see no reason why we cannot have the same procedure for the appointment of the Legal Service Commission which, in turn, obviously will decide who gets to enter the Legal Service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The objections to these amendments also, I think, unjustifiably denigrade or take away from the people who are appointed, because it assumes that they will not act without fear or favour.&nbsp; It assumes that they will not act and carry out their duties in the best manner possible.&nbsp; But all these people who are appointed have, at least, as far as I can see, carried out their duties properly and with a full understanding of what is required of them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, for those reasons, I do not agree to the objections to the provision for the Prime Minister to nominate two nominees to the Legal Service Commission.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I move on now to the third point, ie, the Personnel Boards.&nbsp; The setting up of Personnel Boards is a progressive step.&nbsp; Recruitment in today's world is not just about hiring and firing someone.&nbsp; HR management is a much more complex process today than it was in the past.&nbsp; Now, apart from just paying competitive salaries, it involves a HR environment that takes into account the employees' aspirations for training, advancement, quality of life, work-life balance, continuing legal education, etc.&nbsp; It is almost a full-time function in itself, and this is what we in the private sector have to contend with and I do not think that the Legal Service is any <p align=left>Column: 1070<p>different.&nbsp; So having a Personnel Board will allow for more efficient HR management in this respect.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would, however, like to seek clarification from the Minister for Law as to what is meant by having one or more Personnel Boards having charge over different classes of Legal Service officers.&nbsp; What exactly is it meant by "different classes" and how would different Personnel Boards dealing with these different classes work in practice?&nbsp; I am concerned about a possible "silo effect" where each Board does what it likes, because there must be some consistency in dealing with the legal officers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also hope that the establishment of Personnel Boards would allow the Legal Service to develop an overall structure that would allow legal officers to progress based on performance.&nbsp; From feedback that we get as practitioners - and I say that this is feedback as I do not know whether it is actually the case - it would appear that the type of Honours that a legal officer gets for his initial degree, ie, the LLB, pretty much determines not only his entry level but also his advancement for many years after.&nbsp; If this is so, then</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;

Progression based on the original university degree is actually markedly different from private sector practice where grades are only your passport to entry and that is all. Once you get in, in private practice, the clock is reset and all promotions and advancements are performance-based.&nbsp; I am not suggesting for one moment that academic grades and good performance are mutually exclusive.&nbsp; Usually, top grades are indicative of top talent.&nbsp; However, in practice, we do encounter people whose grades are not in the very top category academically, but <p align=left>Column: 1071<p>they really come into their own, when given a practical problem to resolve - they deliver solid results.&nbsp; Grades should therefore not be the sole or major determinant for career advancement once a person gets into the organisation.&nbsp; As far as possible, there should be performance-based advancement and everybody should have the opportunity to shine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, I see this issue of advancement depending on entry level as something I would call the "double&nbsp;helix staircase" syndrome.&nbsp; I am not sure if Members have had the opportunity to visit the Loire Valley in France.&nbsp; It is famous for its many beautiful chateaus built by the French Kings in the area.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them is the Chateau de Chambord built in Loire&nbsp;by King Francis I.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;the largest castle in the Loire&nbsp;Valley and one of the most recognisable with its blend of medieval French and Italian architectural styles.&nbsp; It is well worth a visit, not on public funds, but on a private visit.&nbsp; But a cheaper option is to check it out on Wikipedia.&nbsp; But, anyway, I visited&nbsp;Chambord in my fourth year in law school before I started pupilage. And one of the most noticeable features at&nbsp;Chambord which I saw then, and which I still remember to this day, is the double helix staircase, the conception and design of which has been attributed to&nbsp;Leonardo Da Vinci.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a rather remarkable design. Essentially, it comprises two spiral staircases, one built on top of each other. They twine round in parallel, from the ground to the third floor of the castle. So what it means is that you can have two people, each going up one staircase and they will never meet. One is always on top of the other and they are just going round until they emerge, and one is always at the lower level than the other.&nbsp; And from the point of entry, they are set on different paths. They also have different emerging points when they come&nbsp;out even though it is on the same floor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1072<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If progression within the Legal Service is largely dependent on the initial class of Honours, whether it is First Class Honours, for example, you are a JLC, then you will have this double helix effect where your entry point determines your progression and where you emerge, and it is not how fast or how hard you run up the stairs. That does not take into account the late bloomers or those who did not shine academically initially, but later on, are able to do well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I would hope therefore that the establishment of Personnel Boards will allow things like this to be addressed so that, ultimately, we can have a stronger, more robust performance-based Legal Service and also one where legal officers can find satisfaction in their career development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; With this, I support the proposed amendments to the Constitution.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.20 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to clarify something which Ms Rajah had mentioned about what I said in my speech.&nbsp; At no time in my speech had I said that I was happy with the composition of the LSC, as far as it relates to the career progression of the Subordinate Courts judiciary is concerned.&nbsp; In fact, Members with a longer memory will know that it has been a consistent stand of the Worker's Party that the Subordinate Courts judiciary needs more security in its tenure and this is not a new argument that we are raising.&nbsp; We have raised concerns in the past about the present composition of the LSC because of the perception that they may not be promoting security of tenure as far as the Subordinate Courts judiciary is concerned because of the potential of transfer. So it is not quite accurate what Ms Rajah said about my speech earlier. Just to reiterate, the amendments that we are considering today give the Prime Minister a direct<p align=left>Column: 1073<p> nomination role on the LSC.&nbsp; And I think Members will realise that this may have the perception of giving the public the opinion that the career progression of judicial officers is subject to the Executive assessment of their performance and this is something that will not strengthen the system, and my point still remains.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Indranee Rajah:</B> There is no reason why it should give anybody this perception of interference by the Executive if they read the amendments&nbsp;to the Constitution which provide that the appointment is by the President in his discretion and only if he concurs with the advice of the Prime Minister.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker:</B> Order.&nbsp; I propose to take the break now.&nbsp; I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair again at 4.35 pm.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align="right"><I>Sitting accordingly suspended</I></p><p align="right"><I>at&nbsp;4.15 pm until 4.35&nbsp;pm.</I></p><p align="right">&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><I>Sitting resumed at 4.35 pm</I></p><p align=left>Column: 1073<p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><B>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</B></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><B>CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE (AMENDMENT) BILL</B></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debate resumed.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Prof. Jayakumar--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Prof. Jayakumar:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Members who have spoken and I wish to respond to some of the comments and questions which they have posed.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me touch on points raised by Mr Christopher de Souza and also&nbsp;by Ms Indranee Rajah and then on points which were raised by other speakers.&nbsp; Mr Christopher de Souza asked about the separate Personnel Boards, whether there can be more than one Personnel<p align=left>Column: 1074<p> Board.&nbsp; Of course, there can be more than one personnel board but, due to the small size and relative homogeneous nature of the Legal Service, I think it is unlikely to exceed two Personnel Boards.&nbsp; But the precise details of how many will have to be decided later.&nbsp; I also cannot give precise answers as to how&nbsp;they will be organised.&nbsp; But I think they are likely to be organised more by grade of the officers, that is, whether they are on the timescale or superscale grade, and not by departments that he seems to suggest. This is to ensure greater consistency and fairness in assessment.&nbsp;&nbsp;This would also, I guess, to some extent,&nbsp;address the silo effect which Ms Indranee Rajah talked about.&nbsp; In any event, the LSC will continue to serve as a check against silos being built up.&nbsp; It has the power to hear appeals from the legal service officers who may not be satisfied with the decision of any Personnel Board and to substitute its decisions for the board's.&nbsp; Following recommendations made by the Legal Service Personnel Management Review Panel which I mentioned,&nbsp;chaired by Justice Lee Seiu Kin, the LSC has also put in place now a Talent Management Scheme, a succession planning framework and other measures to address improvements, not just for the entire Legal Service as a whole, but also the needs of the individual arms of the Service.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Christopher de Souza also asked about a larger financial budget&nbsp;so as&nbsp;to meet new demands. The changes, of course, will bring about a more robust personnel management framework, but I do not expect this to result in any significant increase in the budget. The amendments actually seek to institutionalise Personnel Boards which already exist today.&nbsp; But if additional resources are needed, I am confident that we should be able to make out a case for higher budgetary allocation to the Ministry of Finance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1075<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with what Mr Christopher de Souza said about monopoly of talent. It is not the intention of the Legal Service to monopolise all the legal talent for itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to what Ms Indranee Rajah has said&nbsp;and&nbsp;I hope&nbsp;it is not&nbsp;the intention of the big law firms and the profession to monopolise all the legal talent for the profession.&nbsp; There has to be a fair spread.&nbsp; Like the rest of the civil service, the Legal Service must also have its fair share of&nbsp;legal talent if we are going to maintain a first-rate,&nbsp;top-class Legal Service.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am afraid I have not followed in great detail the workings and recent events in the Competition&nbsp;Commission.&nbsp; I note the feedback of Mr Christopher de Souza on competition law and IP law, and on the specific issue concerning the Competition Commission.&nbsp; I will refer it to the Ministry of Trade and Industry.&nbsp; But I can agree with the general point that Mr de Souza made about the legal landscape changing, and changing very fast, and,&nbsp; therefore, a consequential need to invest in talent and to ensure that we retain the brightest in the Legal Service.&nbsp; I agree with him fully.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the point I made in the Ministerial Statement last year, and this is one of the reasons why the panel and the study by Justice Lee Seiu Kin's committee was important to put in place a personnel management system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very aware of the tremendous demands and challenges posed to the Legal Service as a result of these changes.&nbsp; For the past 19 years, I have seen how demanding these changes have evolved, whether it is in the drafting of Bills which come up to the House, whether it is the giving of legal advice on increasingly complex matters to different Ministries and to Cabinet, or in representing the Government, not just on domestic matters but, in recent times, on increasingly complex and important international law issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;The case we had with Malaysia on the reclamation issue is one and, later in the year, in November,<p align=left>Column: 1076<p> the International Court of Justice will be finally hearing the arguments on the case concerning Malaysia's claim to Pedra Branca.&nbsp; For this, I have had discussions with the Attorney-General's Chambers for many years in developing the arguments.&nbsp; This is just one example of the kinds of changing demands and challenges which require the Legal Service to have very bright, competent and able people, leaving aside, of course, the need for the judiciary also to have bright and able people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Indranee Rajah asked about performance-based advancement.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think her point was that&nbsp;it should not be based on the type of Honours or class of Honours.&nbsp; I guess, like many other establishments which recruit fresh graduates, the results achieved in the university examination&nbsp; - class of Honours -&nbsp;often make a difference in the recruitment process.&nbsp; But after recruitment, the career advancement must and will be based on the performance and the merits of the officer's performance.&nbsp; Of course, in the Legal Service, as many of you know, many of the top legal graduates would prefer to work as Justice Law Clerks and they will be given the choice.&nbsp; This is not different from any other much sought after jobs in other parts of the civil service, or even the private sector.&nbsp;&nbsp; The important thing is that, after the initial deployment, the rate of progression will be determined and assessed on the actual performance of the individual officers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I may turn to the comments made by Mdm Ho Geok Choo, she referred to the comments of Ms Sylvia Lim on the appointment of&nbsp;LSC members.&nbsp; I will deal with that later.&nbsp; Another point she made was about LSC membership&nbsp; -&nbsp; why do we not include members of the academia?&nbsp; I am a former academic myself!&nbsp; Let me say that if she looks at the provision as it is drafted, it does not exclude consideration of members of the <p align=left>Column: 1077<p>academia.&nbsp; It is not one of the disqualifications.&nbsp; I guess if we have a really outstanding member of the academia who is regarded as one who will bring a certain amount of expertise and experience to the Legal Service Commission, I am sure he will be considered.&nbsp; But the actual composition of the LSC will have to be worked out and made known when ready.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, she has a point about oaths of office.&nbsp; She said, I believe, that&nbsp;she had some disquiet over the shortening of the oaths because some phrases and&nbsp; wordings seem to have been omitted.&nbsp; Let me assure her of what I said in my Second Reading speech, that the substance and the essence of the oath is really not affected.&nbsp; I should explain and elaborate, if I may, that the oaths are not like a contract where there must be specific itemisation of legal rights and liabilities in order to operate as oaths.&nbsp; An oath actually is a solemn undertaking to conduct oneself and to perform his duties in accordance with whatever instrument that spells out his rights and obligations.&nbsp; The oath itself does not set out the substantive law of what&nbsp;are the Prime Minister, Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries' duties and responsibilities.&nbsp; They are set out in the provisions of the Constitution -&nbsp;the duties, powers and&nbsp;responsibilities of the Prime Minister, Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries and their relationship with the Legislature and with the Elected President.&nbsp; I would also add that Cabinet is, by Article 24(2) of the Constitution, collectively responsible to Parliament.&nbsp; I mention this because if she is concerned about the provision of secrecy, the secrecy of Cabinet discussions is actually the foundation of collective responsibility, and the secrecy of Cabinet deliberations and decision-making is recognised at law, because confidentiality is essential.&nbsp; It is not only<p align=left>Column: 1078<p> in common law; it is so in other Commonwealth Constitutions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me say that we have looked at the Constitutions of many countries in the world, and ours is one of the few which have such lengthy and outdated structure.&nbsp; On confidentiality, of course, I should add that there is also the Official Secrets Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I may now turn to the points made by Ms Sylvia Lim.&nbsp; In her second intervention in response to Ms Indranee Rajah, she asked the House, especially those who have long memories, to recall that this issue had been debated in this House.&nbsp; Indeed, as she was speaking, I was reminded of a previous Workers' Party Member of Parliament, Mr Jeyaretnam, who made all sorts of allegations about our existing system and raised the spectre of Executive interference in the Subordinate Courts judiciary.&nbsp; And that led to not only a Commission of Inquiry into allegations of Executive&nbsp;interference in the Judiciary, it also led to a Committee of Privileges being constituted by Parliament, both of which found Mr Jeyaretnam was wrong and unjustified in making those allegations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The difference, it would seem, is that, there, Mr Jeyaretnam made specific allegations of actual interference in the Judiciary but, in the process, he also cast doubt over the entire system.&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim, through her speech, is, in fact, resurrecting what, if I may borrow a term from Prof. Thio Li-ann, a conspiracy theory.&nbsp; But is this supported?&nbsp; Both Ms Indranee Rajah and Prof. Thio Li-ann have, in fact, in their speeches, provided the persuasive and convincing arguments which I would have used to rebut Ms Sylvia Lim; firstly, the Prime Minister, in nominating two Members of a nine-member enlarged LSC, is not doing something different from his many roles which Ms Indranee Rajah outlined&nbsp; -&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1079<p> appointing Judges, the Chairman of PSC, members of PSC, the Chief Justice, all subject to the veto of the President, which is exercised in his discretion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the qualifications and disqualifications for his appointment or nomination are spelt out in the Constitution, and they are spelt out precisely in order to ensure that there&nbsp;are no formal political links.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I may add that not only the nominees of the Prime Minister but&nbsp;every Legal Service Commission member will have to take an oath of office.&nbsp; And that oath of office would have him solemnly swear or affirm that he will, freely and without fear or favour, affection or ill-will, give his counsel and advice in connection with any matter referred to the Commission, and that he will not directly or indirectly reveal any such matters to any unauthorised person.&nbsp; And there is a prohibition in the Public Service Commission Act, which is now&nbsp;going to be suitably amended to include the LSC, which also makes it an offence for any LSC member or PSC member to disclose information of proceedings of the Commission.&nbsp; In other words, Ms Sylvia Lim builds this spectre or prospect of Executive interference.&nbsp; But I have pointed out in my Second Reading speech that we have to do this - the enlargement of the LSC&nbsp; - so that the LSC, which has remained unchanged from the days of our independence, can be geared to deal with modern-day challenges, to bring in people who may have expertise and&nbsp;knowledge about how things work out in the private sector, about human resource management and development.&nbsp; They can bring this expertise and I think the LSC will be that much better and richer in handling personnel management relations.&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as I have&nbsp;explained, the Prime Minister retains overall charge of the civil service, of which the Legal Service is a part.&nbsp; And it is only logical and necessary that the <p align=left>Column: 1080<p>Prime Minister has a role in nominating two members.&nbsp; But once he has nominated two members and they are appointed, his role ends there.&nbsp; Neither he nor the other nominating members&nbsp; -&nbsp; the Chairman of PSC or the Chief Justice - can in any way direct the nominees to act or to decide in any particular manner.</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

So, I am really surprised that Ms Sylvia Lim resurrects this spectre of possible Executive interference in the Judiciary.&nbsp; I had&nbsp;thought that was an old issue and&nbsp;am surprised that the leader of the party, Mr Low Thia Khiang, has not spoken&nbsp;on such an important issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; If Ms Sylvia Lim really feels that this is going to undermine the independence of the Judiciary, she has to tell us in what ways it is going to undermine the independence of the Judiciary, bearing in mind all the points that have been mentioned by me, Ms Indranee Rajah and Prof. Thio Li-ann.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it does a disservice to our system.&nbsp; It does a disservice to our Legal Service Commission, and it does a disservice to our reputation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at the end of the day, we can have any number of systems and any number of models.&nbsp; I know that the Workers' Party in its manifesto wants to scrap the present provisions for appointments of High Court Judges and Judicial Commissioners.&nbsp; They want to scrap the existing system to create a judicial service separate from the Legal Service.&nbsp; They do not want a transfer of members of the Subordinate Courts.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small place like Singapore, how would it work?&nbsp; I have discussed with the Chief Justice and he is convinced, so is the Attorney-General, that, in Singapore, it is in the interest of the Service and the interest of Singapore to have Legal Service officers exposed to and trained in<p align=left>Column: 1081<p> different fields of legal work.&nbsp; It must be so.&nbsp; How can you have somebody appointed as a Judge who has not had experience in prosecution?&nbsp; It is in the interest of our Legal Service, particularly when we have a small Legal Service, to ensure that over a period of time, there is sufficient exposure to different key branches of legal work that Legal Service officers have to handle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, at the end of the day, Sir, I come back to this point.&nbsp; As Law Minister, I have been to many Commonwealth Law Ministers' meetings and other Law Ministers' meetings where I have seen seemingly impressive papers presented by other delegations on their systems.&nbsp; Just as you can have any number of constitutions in the world, so too you can have any number of structures that you can think of for the Judiciary and&nbsp;the Legal Service.&nbsp; But the test is the integrity of the system of any model depends on the people who are operating the system and, most importantly, on the leadership&nbsp; in the Government and whether the Government respects the integrity and independence of the Judiciary.&nbsp; If that was not so, how would Singapore, year after year, have rankings from so many different surveying organisations which ranked our legal system and our system for administration of justice as amongst the top in the world?&nbsp; Not just in Asia, but in the world!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, to Ms Sylvia Lim and others who are ready to raise the spectre of lack of judicial independence, let me say that our system works, and it has gained for us a very valuable reputation.&nbsp; That reputation can be maintained for so long as we get good people in the Legal Service and in the&nbsp;Judiciary and,&nbsp; I say, as important, good people in Government and in Cabinet who will ensure that this system of<p align=left>Column: 1082<p> integrity and incorruptibility is maintained.&nbsp; That is the test, not whether you can create&nbsp;any number of structures.&nbsp; We have the system, it works, and we are now finetuning it to work even better, so we can retain good talent in the Legal Service.&nbsp; I say, let us keep what it works and let us not besmirch the reputation we have so carefully built up over the years.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Ring the Division Bells.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>After two minutes -</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I proceed to start the electronic voting, Members are reminded that they are to press 'Present' on their electronic voting unit located at their left armrest, before indicating their vote.&nbsp; Those who fail to press 'Present' will not have their votes recorded.&nbsp; Voting will be open for 45 seconds from the time 'Voting in Progress' is flashed on the display board.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members are also reminded to check their names and vote indications posted on the display board after the close of voting.&nbsp; If a Member is of the opinion that his vote has been taken in error or has been recorded wrongly, he may rise and request the Chair to have his vote taken correctly, provided that such request is made before the Chair declares the result of the division.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

For instance, section 3 provides that communications of the Commission are privileged.&nbsp; No person in any legal proceedings is permitted to or can be compelled to disclose any communication made to the Public Service Commission, whether between the Commission and other parties, such as the Government, or between its members.&nbsp;Section 4 prohibits the publication of disclosure of information with respect to the Commission's functions to any unauthorised person and make such disclosure an offence.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second main protection is by the imposition of sanction to uphold the integrity of the Commission's exercise of its powers and functions.&nbsp; Section 2 makes it an offence for anyone to give false information to the Commission.&nbsp; Section&nbsp;5 makes it an offence to influence or attempt to influence the Commission.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third main protection is by affording members of the&nbsp;Public Service Commission with the same protection and privilege as&nbsp;extended to magistrates in case of any&nbsp;action or suit brought against them for anything done in execution of their duty.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, with the amendment, the Legal Service Commission and its members will be accorded the same rights and protections as the Public Service Commission and its members.&nbsp; These protections are necessary for the Legal <p align=left>Column: 1088<p>Service Commission to carry out its public function in an effective manner.&nbsp; They are required so that communications can be freely made to and within the Legal Service Commission without fear that such communications can be used in subsequent legal proceedings.&nbsp; They are required so that information given to the Legal Service Commission will carry sanction with it if made falsely.&nbsp; And finally, they are required so that the Legal Service Commission members can go about their work independently and impartially without the risk of being sued for their decisions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More symbolically, this puts the Legal Service Commission on the same footing and position as the Public Service Commission.&nbsp; The signal being sent is that the Legal Service Commission and, by extension, the Legal Service is as important to the smooth running of the country as the Public Service Commission and the Public Service.&nbsp; These amendments go hand in hand with the amendments made to the Constitution which seeks to enhance the composition of the Legal Service Commission and provides the establishment of Personnel Boards.&nbsp; Together, they constitute a step towards taking our well-regarded and respected legal system to the next level.&nbsp; Singapore is regularly rated as one of the most competitive economies and among the best countries in the world to carry on business, and that is due in no small measure to the sterling quality of our Judiciary and Legal Service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a world-class Judiciary. And I consider that this extends both to our Supreme Court Judiciary where the Judges enjoy tenure until age 65 as well as the Subordinate Courts Judiciary where the Judges do not enjoy similar tenure.&nbsp; The reputation of our Judiciary stands out especially in the region for its quality, efficiency, impartiality and integrity.&nbsp; We have to ensure that the Legal Service and Judiciary continue to<p align=left>Column: 1089<p> attract the best of Singapore's legal talent so they can just not maintain a high standing but also to grow and adapt to ever-changing circumstances.&nbsp; The move to enhance the position of the Legal Service Commission which oversees the Legal Service signals&nbsp;a clear intention to strengthen one of the pillars of our society and economy, and should be welcomed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Prof. Jayakumar--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Prof. Jayakumar:</B> I think it is suffice for me to thank Mr Alvin Yeo for his support.<p>&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [ Prof. Jayakumar].</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>													<!--TITLE_NAME:PASSPORTS BILL--><p align=left>Column: 1089<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:PASSPORTS BILL:::1112--></b><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>PASSPORTS BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>											 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order for Second Reading read.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">5.25 pm</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore passport is well regarded internationally because of its strong reputation as a highly secure document with several anti-tampering features. The visa-free entry that Singaporeans currently enjoy in many countries and the fact that Singapore remains a member of the US Visa-Waiver Programme attests to the confidence that foreign governments have in the integrity of our passport. However, as the<p align=left>Column: 1090<p> Singapore passport provides easy visa-free access to many countries, it is also an attractive document for abuse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criminal and terrorist elements are known to assume different identities using photo-substituted or fake passports to facilitate their movement between countries. As recent as late March 2007, ICA had detected foreigners who attempted to use photo-substituted foreign passports to gain illegal entry into&nbsp;third countries. We should also not forget the case of Hambali, the suspected planner of many terrorist attacks in Indonesia, including the October 2002 Bali bombings, who was caught in 2003. He was reported to have used a fake Spanish passport for his travels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been taking and will continue to take the necessary steps to prevent terrorists and other criminals from misusing and abusing the Singapore passport. On 15th August 2006, we introduced the Singapore Biometric Passport, or BioPass, for short. The BioPass, with its enhanced security features, will help ensure that the Singapore passport continues to be regarded as a highly-secure travel document.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that we have the necessary tools to safeguard the security and integrity of the Singapore passport, we need to update the Passports Act, which has not been amended since 1971, so that it reflects the realities of the current operating environment and remains relevant in today's context.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, this Bill repeals the existing Act, and re-enacts a new Passports Act which introduces measures against the abuse and misuse of Singapore passports and travel documents, as well as foreign travel documents. It also sets out a comprehensive regime for the issuance and handling of our passports and travel documents. Finally, the Bill provides a<p align=left>Column: 1091<p> framework to allow the Immigration&nbsp;and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) to adopt new technologies to enhance the security of Singapore passports and travel documents.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><I>Regularising the issuance and handling of Singapore travel documents</I></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><I>Lost and stolen passports</I></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while we have been reminding our citizens to take good care of their passports, a small number of Singaporeans still lose or have their passports stolen each year. In the current security climate, should a passport fall into the wrong hands, the consequences could be very severe. ICA will continue to highlight the importance of safekeeping our passports. Charging a replacement fee for lost passports is one way of doing so.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ICA currently registers the reported loss or theft of Singapore passports in its database, to ensure that they can no longer be used for travel. However, such passports are not effectively cancelled as the present Act does not provide for cancellation under such circumstances. Clause 21 of the Bill rectifies this by vesting the Controller of Immigration with powers to cancel a Singapore passport immediately once it is reported lost or stolen.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for Singaporeans to promptly report the loss</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>or theft of their passports as this allows the ICA to alert the foreign immigration authorities.&nbsp; Through the sharing of information on lost and stolen passports, we can contribute to curb the abuse of passports worldwide. Clause 45 of the Bill therefore makes it compulsory for Singaporeans&nbsp;or a person who has a parental responsibility for a Singaporean aged 16 and below to report the loss or theft of a passport within 14 days when he first knows of the fact.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1092<p><p><I>Cancellation/refusal of passports</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, having the use of a Singapore passport is a privilege and not an entitlement.&nbsp; Clause 57 of the Bill makes it clear that every Singapore passport issued before, on or after the commencement of this Act shall be the property of the Government.&nbsp; In fact, this notice already appears in today's passport and in earlier versions&nbsp;of our&nbsp;passports.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill provides discretionary powers to the Controller to cancel Singapore passports.&nbsp; Besides cancelling passports that are reported lost or stolen, the Controller may also cancel or refuse to issue a passport for administrative or law enforcement reasons as well as for reasons relating to harmful misconduct which would include conduct that could prejudice the security of Singapore, endanger the health or physical safety of other persons, or constitute an offence under the Act. Let me elaborate on this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Administrative reasons</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While a lost or stolen passport can be cancelled, there would be some Singaporeans who will continue to be careless and fail to safeguard their passports.&nbsp; To help curb such behaviour, the Bill allows the Controller to refuse to issue a Singapore passport to a person who has had two or more passports lost or stolen when the Controller deems it undesirable to issue that person with another passport.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me reassure the House that the ICA will look into the merits of each case very carefully and will exercise such powers judiciously.&nbsp; A citizen who has taken reasonable steps to safeguard his passport need not be too worried about being denied a passport.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is important to emphasise that we expect Singaporeans to exercise due care in safeguarding their passports and to minimise the likelihood of their passports being lost or stolen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1093<p><p><I>Law enforcement reasons</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 23 of the Bill allows the Controller to refuse passports to persons for law enforcement reasons, such as to persons who have been placed under supervision of the Misuse of Drugs Act.&nbsp; This will ensure that they do not indulge in drug-related activities overseas.&nbsp; Others who may be refused passports include those who are the subject of warrants of arrest issued for seizable offences.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Reasons relating to harmful misconduct</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ICA has cancelled the passports of Singapore citizens for national security reasons.&nbsp; In recent years, such actions have been taken against&nbsp;the Jemaah Islamiyah members&nbsp;who are on the run or hiding in other countries.&nbsp; Under clause 24 of the Bill, the Controller can refuse to issue a passport to such a person to prevent him from doing harm overseas.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1st September 2005, we have put in place a passport cancellation policy against the leaders of unlicensed moneylending syndicates who are convicted under the Moneylenders Act.&nbsp; The Bill continues to allow the Controller to deny passports to these persons so as to prevent them from re-establishing and perpetuating their unlicensed moneylending business while they are overseas.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All Singapore passports and travel documents that have been cancelled should be surrendered to ICA quickly.&nbsp; This is to avoid such passports being subsequently abused.&nbsp; Hence, clause 30 of the Bill allows the ICA to demand that a person surrenders a cancelled Singapore passport.&nbsp; Similarly, a person who ceases to be a Singapore citizen will also be required to surrender his Singapore passport.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1094<p><p><I>Measures against the misuse of Singapore and foreign travel documents</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Bill seeks to enhance measures against the misuse and abuse of Singapore passports and foreign travel documents.&nbsp; Currently, for Singapore passports, we rely on administrative measures, such as the denial of passport facilities, to curb abuse.&nbsp; We can also prosecute a person under the relevant sections of the Penal Code if a Singapore passport or a foreign travel document is misused within our jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our efforts against passport abuse have kept the number of abuse cases low.&nbsp; In 2006, there were only 74 passport abuse cases, compared to 116 in 2003.&nbsp; Abuse of the Singapore passport, if left unchecked, can cause inconvenience to Singaporeans who travel overseas.&nbsp; Foreign immigration authorities may start to doubt the authenticity of Singapore passports presented to them, causing them to scrutinise our passports and their Singaporean holders more closely and, perhaps, even imposing additional restrictions.&nbsp; Our international reputation could be adversely affected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, in today's heightened security environment, we must do our part as a responsible member of the international community to minimise the abuse of our passports so as not to provide terrorist elements with the opportunity to slip in and out of the country easily using forged or stolen passports.&nbsp; It is therefore necessary for the Government to take a tougher stance by criminalising such acts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, the Bill introduces four main clauses of passport offences.&nbsp; These offences will carry heavy penalties to send a clear message to potential perpetrators.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1095<p><p><I>Offences related to the improper use or possession of passports</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we will introduce offences relating to improper use or possession of a Singapore passport.&nbsp; Sir, we have cases where persons were found to have attempted to pass through our checkpoints using another person's Singapore passport.&nbsp; We cannot condone such activities, nor should we allow a small number of Singaporeans to misuse their passports for selfish gains.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2006, ICA arrested a citizen who was engaged in selling lost or stolen Singapore as well as foreign passports to a syndicate.&nbsp; He was found to have multiple Singapore and foreign passports in his possession when he was arrested.&nbsp; As the law currently does not provide for the offence of selling passports, he was instead charged and only sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment for the fraudulent possession of property under the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act.&nbsp; The charge of fraudulent possession of property carries with it a maximum fine not exceeding $5,000 and an imprisonment term not exceeding two years, or both.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly, Sir, such penalties are grossly inadequate.&nbsp; Classifying&nbsp;the sale of passports as "miscellaneous offences" is not commensurate with the seriousness of the offence, especially if the passports were to fall into the wrong hands, in particular, the terrorists.&nbsp; With this Bill, any person who is guilty of selling or attempting to sell the Singapore passport can be fined up to $10,000, imprisoned up to 10 years, or both.&nbsp; Further, should such an act be found to be syndicated, ie, if a person is found to have engaged in the business of selling Singapore passports,&nbsp;the penalty will be stiffer - a mandatory jail term of not less than two years and not more than 15 years, and a fine of up to $20,000.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1096<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides the offence of selling Singapore passports and travel documents, we will also criminalise the improper possession of passports or travel documents, with a maximum penalty of imprisonment of not more than 10 years, a fine of up to $10,000, or&nbsp;both.&nbsp; A person who is found guilty of giving away his Singapore passport or travel document and is reckless as to whether it would be misused by another person for travel or for identification purposes will face a fine of up to $5,000, a jail term of up to three years, or&nbsp;both.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans should not hand over their passports to other persons or hold on to other persons' passports for no legitimate reasons.&nbsp; While&nbsp;we can allow travel agents to temporarily hold on to our passport to facilitate our travel documents, eg, for visa applications, we should not hand over our passports to persons who demand them as a form of security or surety for any form of goods or services rendered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Offences related to false Singapore passports</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the second group of offences covers the falsifying of Singapore passports.&nbsp; Clause 36 of the Bill makes it an offence for anyone to make or use a false Singapore passport.&nbsp; It will also be an offence for a person to make or have in his possession any equipment or material that is specially designed for the making of a false Singapore passport with the intent that it would be used for such purposes.&nbsp; Such acts would be punished with a fine of up to $10,000, imprisonment of up to 10 years, or&nbsp;both.&nbsp; In addition, clause 37 criminalises the possession of a false Singapore passport.&nbsp; Such an act will carry the same penalties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Offences related to foreign travel documents</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, besides the Singapore passport and travel documents, foreign travel <p align=left>Column: 1097<p>documents are also susceptible to tampering, forgery and misuse.&nbsp; We view any form of passport abuse seriously.&nbsp; Clause 47 of the Bill, therefore, seeks to punish such acts, if they are carried out in Singapore, with penalties equivalent to that imposed on the tampering, forgery and misuse of Singapore passports and travel documents.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Offences related to the giving of false statements or information</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in 2005, ICA detected a case where some parents had applied for Singapore passports for other children using their own children's original birth certificates in exchange for money to be gained.&nbsp; Their Singapore passports would bear the names of their own children but affixed with photographs of other children.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had ICA failed to detect such an act, the imposter would have used a genuine Singapore passport to travel overseas.&nbsp; While ICA's passport issuance process has the necessary checks and balances to detect and prevent fraudulent passport applications, we need to send a strong deterrent signal.&nbsp; We will, therefore, introduce a third group of offences to deal with the giving of false statements or information to obtain a Singapore passport or for any other purposes related to the Singapore passport.&nbsp; Clause 39 criminalises the act of providing&nbsp;false statement or information with a fine of up to $10,000, imprisonment of up to 10 years, or&nbsp;both.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Unauthorised issuance of Singapore passport</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, Sir, we will introduce offences on the unauthorised issuance of Singapore passports and travel documents.&nbsp; Clause 48 of the Bill penalises Government officials who issue or make<p align=left>Column: 1098<p> endorsements on Singapore passports contrary to the requirements set out in the Bill.&nbsp; This ensures that the integrity of our passport issuance system is duly upheld.&nbsp; Government officers who are found to have issued or endorsed passports in contravention of the requirements would be liable for a fine of up to $10,000, imprisonment of up to 10 years, or&nbsp;both.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Extra-territorial application for passport abuse offences</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we recognise that passport abuse need not be restricted to Singapore, but may be committed by people of all nationalities in any part of the world.&nbsp; Indeed, as the&nbsp;Singapore passport is a travel document, its value is in facilitating entry into other countries.&nbsp; Therefore, the abuse of a passport is likely to occur overseas, as in Singapore.&nbsp; Thus, the Bill extends the application for offences relating to the Singapore passport under this Act beyond our shores to all persons, irrespective of their nationality or citizenship.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are aware of the operational difficulties involved in enforcing our laws overseas.&nbsp; The foreigner concerned would need to be physically present in Singapore in order for us to prosecute him.&nbsp; There are also practical problems involved in information gathering and investigation for an offence committed outside Singapore.&nbsp; Nonetheless, having the extra-territorial clause in this Bill emphasises the Government's stance against&nbsp;passport abuse offences and sends a strong deterrent message.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Framework to adopt new methods and technologies for the Singapore travel documents</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the BioPass Project is an example of how, by incorporating new and advanced technology, such as the use of biometric identifiers, we can stay ahead<p align=left>Column: 1099<p> of the potential abusers who are increasingly using modern technology for criminal purposes.&nbsp; Indeed, since 2003, Singapore has been actively taking part in discussions in this arena held by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Council. This has helped us to successfully launch the BioPass in August 2006.&nbsp; As of May this year, the ICA has issued more than 300,000 BioPasses.&nbsp; Features of our BioPasses are now being considered as a model for many other countries planning to introduce biometric passports.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important for us to stay abreast of technological advancements and continue to deploy new technologies aggressively to enhance the security features of our passports.&nbsp; Clause 54 of the Bill therefore&nbsp;gives us the necessary flexibility to adopt new technologies for our travel documents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Safeguarding of personal identifying information</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, incorporating more personal information into our travel documents, such as biometric identifiers, also means that we need to safeguard such confidential information.&nbsp; Clause 55 therefore restricts the sharing of such information to the purposes of identification, law enforcement and national security.</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example, when a Singapore citizen faces difficulties in establishing his identity overseas, such information could be shared with our embassy officers to assist the authentication process so that&nbsp;necessary assistance may be rendered to him.&nbsp; Unauthorised access or disclosure of such information attracts a maximum penalty of fine not exceeding $5,000, imprisonment of not more than three years, or both.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Temporary Travel Document (TTD)</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with the growing affluence amongst<p align=left>Column: 1100<p> Singaporeans and a globalising economy, we are seeing strong growth in overseas travel.&nbsp; In 1998, Singaporeans make some 12 million trips overseas. This has since increased to more than 18 million trips in 2006. From time to time, Singaporeans may face difficulties when they need to travel urgently but their passports are with a foreign embassy for visa application. For this group of people, ICA currently issues them with what is known as&nbsp;the Document of Identify, or DOI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the DOI, as a travel document, lacks sufficient security features. Furthermore, not all countries recognise the DOI.&nbsp; There is therefore the need to introduce a new travel document, known as the Singapore Temporary Travel Document, or TTD.&nbsp; The TTD carries the same security features as our BioPass, but has&nbsp;fewer pages and a shorter validity.&nbsp; The TTD will be better equipped to serve Singaporeans' travel needs, compared to the DOI.&nbsp; Clauses 11 to 15 of the Bill therefore provide for the issuance of the TTD.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Consequential amendments to the Immigration Act</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Immigration Act regulates the entry, stay and exit of foreigners into and out of Singapore, and allows us to take biometric information from foreigners under certain circumstances.&nbsp; As such, the Passports Bill makes consequential amendments to the Immigration Act in order to put in place similar safeguards for the access and disclosure of such personal information.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Separately, Regulation 22 of the Passports&nbsp;Regulations requires a person to present his passport upon&nbsp;entry into and exit from Singapore only if required to do so by an immigration officer.&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with our move to tighten border security due to security situation, and as&nbsp;the presentation of passports upon entry and exit is essentially an immigration issue, we will<p align=left>Column: 1101<p> transfer this provision to the Immigration Act, and amend the provision to make it compulsory for all persons who enter and exit Singapore via our checkpoints to present&nbsp;his passport or travel document to an immigration officer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Validity of Singapore passports</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, following the&nbsp;First Reading of the Bill, members of the public have asked whether we would reduce the validity period of the Singapore passport with the passing of the Bill. Sir, I would like to clarify that the Bill does not shorten the validity period of the Singapore passports, including those that have already been issued.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1st April 2005, all new Singapore passports are issued with a validity period of five years. This allows ICA to incorporate new technologies and features into our passport to ensure that it remains secure and less susceptible to forgery and tampering. While clause 8 of the Bill states that a Singapore passport issued after 1st April 2005 would have a validity period not exceeding six years, the additional year of validity allows ICA the operational&nbsp;flexibility to transfer unused validity from an old passport to a new one, when Singaporeans renew their passports. For example, when a person who has a passport with&nbsp;remaining validity of six months applies for a new passport,&nbsp;ICA will transfer the remaining six months' validity to his new passport.&nbsp; His new passport would thus be valid for five years and six months.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is no different from the previous Passports Regulations which provided for a validity of&nbsp;11 years although the passports issued then were valid for 10 years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1102<p><p><I>Conclusion</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of Singapore's contribution towards the fight against international terrorism and transnational crimes, we must proactively enhance our security measures to stay ahead of terrorists and criminals.&nbsp; This Bill aims to restrict the space for terrorists' and criminals' movement by tightening passport controls and to deter the abuse of our passports and travel documents.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will not hesitate to take action against those who abuse their Singapore passports and travel documents. For the vast majority of Singaporeans who travel for legitimate purposes, they will benefit from a highly secure Singapore passport that continues to enjoy stronger reputation and confidence among immigration authorities around the world.&nbsp; This Bill will help us to maintain that reputation and confidence, so that Singaporeans can continue to enjoy hassle-free access wherever and whenever they travel overseas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.51 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Singaporeans become more affluent and the cost of travelling reduces, many Singaporeans will need a passport to travel the world.&nbsp; But the rising security threats and abuses of passports have made it necessary for Singapore to set up a comprehensive framework to protect the interests of Singapore and Singaporeans.&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the introduction of technologies and measures to combat identity fraud and possible misuse of Singapore passports and other Singapore travel documents.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1103<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as we introduce more stringent measures to curb abuses, we must also not over restrict the rights of Singaporeans to travel overseas. With globalisation, more Singaporeans will need to travel overseas for business and work.&nbsp; In addition, many Singaporeans have relatives and friends living in many countries and may need to travel for social purposes. Thus, we need to have proper control in the issue of Singapore passports and travel documents and, at the same time, set up an integrated system among different Government agencies to prevent forgeries and abuses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I wish to seek the following clarifications from the Minister:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One, lifespan of passport. Sir, I understand the continuing need to introduce new technologies to deter criminal elements in forging our passports.&nbsp; But a six-year lifespan for Singapore passports is rather short and does incur extra costs to both the Government and Singaporeans.&nbsp; Many Singaporeans do not travel frequently and thus their passports are used only a few times per year. Having to replace a passport every six years will entail wastage and pose unnecessary cost burden on Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sir, currency notes are also vulnerable to forgery or counterfeiting but, yet, the average lifespan for currency notes is about 10 years.&nbsp; I do not think the pace of new security technology advancements in passports warrants a shorter lifespan.&nbsp;Very often, new technologies will take many years to be tested before it can be introduced and integrated into our existing passport control system.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, it is always possible to introduce new security technologies in passport on an incremental basis without the need for a total revamp. Such practices are common in the printing of currency notes.&nbsp; As such, I would propose <p align=left>Column: 1104<p>that we continue to issue passports with a 10-year validity period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Two, issue of passport.&nbsp; Sir, I support Part III of the Bill which sets out various situations or circumstances which the Controller may refuse to issue or cancel a Singapore passport or travel document. This empowerment is necessary especially if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the holder of the passport will engage in harmful activities, such as drug trafficking or criminal offences.&nbsp; But I do not agree with clause 25 which allows the Controller to refuse the issue of Singapore passport to a person where two or more passports issued to the person have been lost or stolen.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support personal accountability whereby Singaporeans must exercise caution to safeguard their passports.&nbsp; However, when in foreign countries, the chances of having passports stolen or lost can be high. Sometimes, passports were lost or stolen under circumstances beyond the control of passport holders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, unless there is evidence to believe that such persons will be engaged in harmful activities if issued with another passport, we should not refuse the issue of Singapore passports to Singaporeans. The right to travel for Singaporeans must be respected and safeguarded.&nbsp; Instead, we can impose a penalty system for the replacement of passport to deter careless behaviour, and tag persons who have replaced their passports for more than two times in our immigration computer system so that our immigration checkpoints will be alerted when such persons travel in and out of the country.&nbsp; This will serve as a better deterrent to the abuse of Singapore passports.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2005, Australia&nbsp;amended its Passports Act to increase the replacement cost for passports ($50 for the first passport lost or stolen; $153 for the<p align=left>Column: 1105<p> second; and $306 for the third or more).&nbsp; We may consider using this additional fee to encourage Singaporeans to protect their passports at all times, both at home and overseas.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Three, offences relating to Singapore passports and travel documents. Sir, I support Part V of the Bill to increase the fine and imprisonment term for offences relating to Singapore passports and travel documents.&nbsp; The tougher penalties will serve as a strong deterrent to potential offenders who have intention to misuse the Singapore passports for unlawful gains.&nbsp; Clause 38 states a new offence, which is the "bringing, taking or sending across international borders a false Singapore passport or a false Singapore travel document to someone else".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have two queries on this new offence. First, how can this clause be effectively enforced especially for&nbsp;senders of false Singapore passports?&nbsp; Very often, the mastermind behind such unlawful acts will engage runners or con innocent people into sending the false passports. As such, this clause may not be effective in preventing the abuse of Singapore passports. Second, why the offence is only for false Singapore passports?&nbsp; A person with ill intention can also send genuine passports of other Singaporeans to other persons overseas for unlawful gains.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I propose we amend the Bill by deleting the word "false" in clause 38. This will make it an offence for anyone who brings, takes or sends Singapore passports to someone else across international borders. This will complement clause 42 which sets out the offence for selling Singapore passports or travel documents. Thus, the new offence will be able to cover all trafficking of Singapore passports or travel documents irrespective of whether they are genuine or false documents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1106<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the tougher penalties and increased powers of the Controller will provide more impetus to combat identity fraud, terrorism and other crimes relating to Singapore passports or travel documents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Alvin Yeo--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.59 pm </p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Alvin Yeo:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the new Act aims to combat identity fraud and the possible misuse of Singapore passports as well as the misuse of foreign travel documents in Singapore and elsewhere&nbsp;by creating new offences and widening the scope of and increasing the penalties of all offences.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These changes and the heavy penalties the offences will carry all serve as a deterrent to the commission of identity fraud involving the Singapore passport as well as the misuse of foreign travel documents in Singapore.&nbsp; The signal being sent is that Singapore will not tolerate such activities and will come down hard on the perpetrators.&nbsp; These measures are especially relevant in the light of the dangers posed by terrorism today. This is vital not just for our own security, but also that of our neighbours. We should thus close every loophole and strengthen any weak link in our vigilance against international terrorism.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, there are two points I wish to raise in relation to the changes. The first relates to the extra-territorial jurisdiction conferred under the proposed Bill. Clause 4 provides generally that the&nbsp;Bill will apply to&nbsp;acts done&nbsp;outside Singapore and to all persons irrespective of citizenship. Clause 34 provides that the offences under&nbsp;Part V will apply whether or not the illegal conduct or its result occurred in Singapore.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This means that under the new Act, a person may be prosecuted for an offence even if the offence was committed overseas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1107<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The misuse of passports or travel documents for illegal purposes is, by its very nature, a crime that cuts across borders, eg, a radicalised UK national might well use a forged Singapore passport to&nbsp;commit a terrorist act in&nbsp;Australia, thousands of kilometres&nbsp;away.&nbsp; The Deputy Prime Minister himself gave the example of Hambali using a forged Spanish passport.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a globalised world of today, acts of misuse could occur anywhere in the world.&nbsp; However, the question does arise - how&nbsp;could&nbsp;we effectively investigate and later charge someone whose actions were taken totally outside this country?&nbsp; We probably have no choice but to retain the power to prosecute such persons for such action, but we must take care that these provisions do not become merely symbolic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second comment or point I would like to raise relates to the right to refuse or cancel Singapore passports.&nbsp; Under clauses 19 and 21, the Controller of Immigration may refuse or cancel a Singapore passport.&nbsp; The grounds upon which he can do so include whether either a competent authority has made a request or the Controller himself believes on reasonable grounds that (1) it might prejudice the security of Singapore or any other country; or (2) endanger the health or physical safety of other persons in Singapore or overseas.&nbsp; This power is highly relevant in this day and age where the threat of terrorism and also of epidemics&nbsp;like avian flu is increased by the facility of modern travel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the concern I have is this.&nbsp; This right could be seen as a restriction on civil liberties.&nbsp; It thus becomes vital that the process, including that of appeals to the Minister, is handled in a fair and transparent manner.&nbsp; This may well pose difficulties as the person appealing is required to specify the<p align=left>Column: 1108<p> grounds upon which the appeal is being made.&nbsp; But if the decision to refuse a passport was made on grounds, for instance, of national security, the sources and items of information for that decision are likely to be confidential.&nbsp; How then is the party appealing against the refusal to bring forward his case?&nbsp; The situation is probably unavoidable as with all matters of national security, but it remains an issue to be grappled with nonetheless.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These two points notwithstanding, the move to tighten the regime against identity fraud is welcome.&nbsp; And, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.05 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B> Sir, I thank the Members - Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Alvin Yeo - for their support and&nbsp;comments.&nbsp; Allow me to explain further&nbsp;how the Bill will tighten the security of our passport regime.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo has proposed that we continue to issue passports with a 10-year validity period.&nbsp; I would like to reiterate that the current lifespan of five years for&nbsp;our biometric passport is to allow the ICA to quickly incorporate new technologies and features into our passports.&nbsp; A passport which is valid for 10 years will slow down our process of replacing passports with new technologies.&nbsp; It will mean that the pool of passports already issued will not become due for renewal or replacement until the person comes forward for a replacement or renewal for a long time.&nbsp; In fact, the ICAO itself recommended that the validity period of passports should be a maximum of five years, and that is the standard which we have followed.&nbsp; As a result of this, we can then make changes to the passports when they are due for renewal.&nbsp; In fact, a shorter period&nbsp;of validity also enables the pool of passports to be refreshed more quickly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1109<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Different countries have different standards in setting the validity period.&nbsp; Some countries have 10 years and some have five years, and we have chosen five years, like several of those countries which have chosen five years.&nbsp; But, despite that, clause 8(4) allows the Minister to extend the validity of the Singapore passport by <I>Gazette</I>, and we will consider doing this when our passport technology system becomes more stable.&nbsp; We do not know when but, in time to come, who knows.&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that technology will always bring forth surprises that will require us to continue to make changes to the passport.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said, Sir, each country sets its own standard in issuing passports.&nbsp; Let me give an example.&nbsp; Malaysia, Thailand and Japan issue passports with five years' validity.&nbsp; The UK, US and Australian passports are valid for 10 years.&nbsp; But there is a difference.&nbsp; Their fees are much higher&nbsp; -&nbsp; two or three times that of Singapore.&nbsp; We charge $80 for a biometric passport.&nbsp; And if&nbsp;a person applies for a biometric passport via electronic means through the ICA website, then&nbsp;he gets a rebate of $10, which means&nbsp;he pays $70.&nbsp; Whereas for the other countries, which I have mentioned with 10-year validity&nbsp;passports, they charge two to three times that amount.&nbsp; But that is not the only point.&nbsp; Their passports are with only 24 or 32 pages&nbsp; -&nbsp; half the number of pages of our passports.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can have a 10-year validity, but&nbsp;a traveller&nbsp;can be assured that if&nbsp;he is&nbsp;a frequent traveller,&nbsp;his passport will be renewed more frequently, and&nbsp;he will&nbsp;probably end up paying more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo also shared his concern about refusal&nbsp;of passports to Singaporeans who have lost or their passports stolen two or more times.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,&nbsp;we have always emphasised the need for Singaporeans to take good care of their passports.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is because the passport is a valuable travel<p align=left>Column: 1110<p> document, well recognised by many countries and, as a result of our reputation, we cannot run the risk of suffering a loss in our reputation if significant numbers of Singapore passports are abused, either by Singaporeans or by foreigners.&nbsp; Therefore, we take a very severe view of those who abuse their Singapore passports.&nbsp; It may be just a false Singapore passport, but&nbsp;we will still take that view that if a Singaporean is in cahoots with other groups or individuals to misuse a genuine or false Singapore passport.&nbsp; And when that passport falls into the wrong hands, I think the&nbsp;Member&nbsp;knows that the consequences&nbsp; will be quite severe, particularly if it falls into the hands of a criminal or a terrorist.&nbsp; And we never know when that criminal or terrorist may sneak into Singapore using that genuine Singapore passport as his identity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The practice of refusing passports to certain categories of people - including those who lost their passports twice or more - is not new.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we started this practice some years ago, but we did it administratively.&nbsp; And those who were denied their passports know why they were denied their passports.&nbsp; As Mr Alvin Yeo said, they ought to know the reasons.&nbsp; We will tell them the reasons and they have a right of appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the appeal comes to me, I will consider all the factors and&nbsp;give them a fair hearing, and I will then make a decision.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that is not to say that those who lost their passports twice or more will&nbsp;automatically have their passports denied forever.&nbsp; In fact, if there are good reasons why the passport was lost and it is a credible story, then ICA will be quite generous&nbsp;and will give them the passports.&nbsp; But even in the case of those Singaporeans who are denied their passports, because they have lost their passports twice or more, ICA also takes a compassionate view that if they have a good reason to travel, ICA will give them<p align=left>Column: 1111<p> a temporary travel document that would facilitate entry into a country for one time and come back, or for a short period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of this policy of denying Singaporeans who lost their passports twice or more, Singaporeans have become much more careful in making sure that they safeguard their passports and keep them well, so that they will not be lost or stolen.&nbsp; In fact, since we implemented this policy, despite the number of passports issued and in circulation has gone up, the number of persons who lost their&nbsp;passports&nbsp;more than twice has not gone up.&nbsp; The number is still very small.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have now put this into the Bill to make the process more transparent. Up till now, it is only done by administrative means.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo also mentioned that the right to travel for Singaporeans must be respected and safeguarded. But let me reiterate here that the passport issued is a privilege.&nbsp; It is not a matter of right, and Singapore is not the only country that&nbsp;has made it a privilege to give a citizen a passport.&nbsp; Other countries do the same.&nbsp; In fact, when crafting this legislation, we have taken the view that we probably do not need to reinvent the wheel.&nbsp; We can follow what others do, take on the very good features that others have adopted, and&nbsp;adapt&nbsp;them&nbsp;for our purposes&nbsp;and which&nbsp;suit our social context.&nbsp; This is what we have done.&nbsp; So many provisions in the Passports Bill&nbsp;have been adopted from&nbsp;other countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo mentioned about charging a penalty fee.&nbsp; We already have that.&nbsp; In fact, if&nbsp;a person&nbsp;loses&nbsp;his passport, the replacement fee for the first time is $50; the second time is $100; the third time is $100.&nbsp; And if we really have to do it, we will deny&nbsp;a person&nbsp;a passport, and&nbsp;he will not be able to travel.&nbsp; So&nbsp;it is very clear that we need to take very strong measures against people who abuse their passports.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1112<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the idea of tagging those who have lost their passports twice so that Immigration Officers can be alerted, I do not see much purpose in this.&nbsp; Because once a person is issued with a passport, he should be free to leave and return.&nbsp; The tagging does not serve a purpose, because we are not going to stop him from travelling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo's third point is regarding the offence of bringing, taking or sending of false Singapore travel documents across international borders, and he asked how such an offence can be enforced.&nbsp; In fact, I recognise the difficulty of tracking people who do this overseas.&nbsp; But if the person happens to be in Singapore and he is detected to have a false Singapore passport, then we will take action, and that is the purpose of the provision.&nbsp; But even if a person were to misuse a genuine Singapore passport, not just a false passport, action can also be taken by the ICA.&nbsp; Therefore, we see the need to put in place a system to check abuse in order to safeguard the integrity of our passports.&nbsp; I think this is for the general good.&nbsp; It&nbsp;is better because it will mean that the interest of the majority will be protected and they can get into or leave the country more easily than others whose passports may be suspect.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and&nbsp;committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a committee on the Bill.&nbsp; -&nbsp; [Mr Wong Kan Seng].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      					<!--TITLE_NAME:POSTAL SERVICES (AMENDMENT) BILL--><p align=left>Column:  1112<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:POSTAL SERVICES (AMENDMENT) BILL:::1123--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>POSTAL SERVICES (AMENDMENT) BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>											 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:The Second Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order for Second Reading read.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:  1113<p><p>6.15 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Second Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."<p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Introduction</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The postal sector was fully liberalised on 1st April this year with the end of SingPost's monopoly in the basic mail services market. Pursuant to this, this Bill seeks to make the necessary amendments to the existing Postal Services Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Liberalisation of the postal sector</I><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me begin with a&nbsp;brief overview of the postal sector and the process by which we have managed this liberalisation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Evolution of competition<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a whole, the postal sector remains an important one.&nbsp; In 2005, revenues in the sector were about S$1.2 billion, with some 564 commercial&nbsp;establishments.&nbsp; This market is also a mature one.&nbsp; While total mail volume has been growing since the 1990s, the average growth rate in recent years has only&nbsp;been about 2% per year.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been introducing competition gradually to this&nbsp;sector.&nbsp; This, first, began in 1992 when SingPost was granted a Public Postal Licence with a 15-year exclusive right to collect and deliver ordinary letters and postcards within, into and out of Singapore.&nbsp; Three years later, in 1995, the provision of express letter services was liberalised and opened to competition. Today, we have more than 100 express letter licensees.&nbsp; In addition, there has been a completely liberalised market for the delivery of parcels, marketing brochures, advertisements and publicity material.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:  1114<p><p><I>Benefits of liberalisation<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stimulus of competition will, we believe,&nbsp;spur even greater and better services for the whole postal sector.&nbsp; The opening of the market to many new players will promote innovation, a greater diversity of services and more competitive prices.&nbsp; This will benefit all users, especially the business users, who today account for more than 90% of the domestic mail that is sent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that the liberalisation of the postal services would result in cost savings of between $8 million and $25 million per year, for the sector as a whole, over the next two to three years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>Key considerations<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;we must ensure that the quality and integrity of the&nbsp;postal services are maintained at a high level even as we promote a competitive environment. It is in this spirit that the proposed changes in this Bill have been drafted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the changes will have a wide-ranging impact, my Ministry and the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) have conducted a series of public consultations which&nbsp; began in October last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank all the organisations and individuals who have provided much useful feedback, which we have carefully considered in the formulation of this Bill.</p><p><br><I>The new postal landscape<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing postal sector really consists of&nbsp;two markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are&nbsp;the Basic Mail Services market and the Express Letter Services market. Our proposed changes will focus on the Basic Mail Services market while, as I have&nbsp;explained earlier,&nbsp;the Express Letter Services market will remain unchanged because it is already open to competition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:  1115<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the old regime, SingPost was the only Public Postal Licensee (PPL) in the Basic Mail Services market and, therefore, had a monopoly.&nbsp; We will now introduce a new type of licensee, in addition to the PPL, called the Postal Service Operator (PSO).&nbsp;&nbsp; Collectively, PPLs and PSOs can be referred to as basic mail service providers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key difference between the PPL, on the one hand, and the PSO, on the other hand, is that the PPL will have to meet a set of Universal Service Obligations (USOs) in return for certain privileges.&nbsp; These USOs will include the requirement to maintain an island-wide letter collection and delivery system.&nbsp; Under the terms of its current licence, SingPost will continue to be the PPL in this market.&nbsp; A PSO, on the other hand, will have&nbsp;the flexibility to select one or more segments of the postal services market in which to operate, without the need to meet such USOs.&nbsp; Such market segments in the postal sector could include the conveyance of letters or mailroom operations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Details of the Bill</I><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have explained the policy objectives behind this Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quickly explain some of the key changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Revised definition and new provisions</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we have redefined the scope of a "letter" to now include all written communications, including&nbsp;postcards but excluding books, catalogues, newspapers or periodicals. We have specified that letters weighing more than 500 grams or the conveyance of letters by direct mail would be exempted from the licensing regime.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:  1116<p><p><I>Functions, duties and powers of the Postal&nbsp;Authority</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;second major change&nbsp;pertains to the powers of the Postal Authority.&nbsp; Clause 3 of the Bill adds new provisions that elaborate on the functions, duties and powers of the Postal Authority, which in our case&nbsp;is the IDA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed changes will&nbsp;allow&nbsp;IDA to design and fine-tune legal instruments to implement its policies for the sector.&nbsp;Clause 18 of the Bill will empower&nbsp;IDA to issue directions, codes of practice and standards of performance to ensure effective competition, fair market conduct and enforcement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same vein, clause 21 of the Bill sets out the IDA's new powers to control mergers and acquisitions involving designated postal licensees.&nbsp; It will empower the IDA to review acquisitions and consolidations, so as to address ownership changes that may raise regulatory or competition concerns or which have an impact on national interest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Enforcement powers and procedures</I></p><p><I><br>&nbsp;</I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me move on to enforcement powers and procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to maintain public confidence in the integrity of our national postal system.&nbsp; Consequently,&nbsp;IDA must be equipped with the appropriate enforcement powers to respond and fully investigate any alleged lapses or abuses.&nbsp; Today, section 46 of the Act empowers IDA to require any person to furnish any information or document in his possession relating to any postal service or system.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 31 of the Bill will enhance this provision by requiring the person who&nbsp;furnished the information or document, to also provide an explanation of the document in order to facilitate IDA's investigations.&nbsp; If the person claims that the&nbsp;document cannot be produced, then he&nbsp;would have&nbsp;to state,<p align=left>Column:  1117<p> to the best of his knowledge, the location of such document. A provision has also been inserted to stipulate that such a document can either be in physical or electronic form.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to balance this enhanced leverage, a clause has been included to offer the person a defence if he can prove that the document was not in his possession or not under his control, or that it was not reasonably practicable for him to comply with the requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other key changes in enforcement powers aim to provide greater clarity on the status of letters that have been seized during enforcement procedures.&nbsp; Currently, the Act is silent on what would happen to such letters and there is an&nbsp;uncertainty over who would be held accountable.&nbsp; To remove this uncertainty, for operators and consumers alike, clause 34 of the Bill will provide for the IDA to deliver to its intended addressee, or return the letter to the original sender.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Offences and penalties<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure the integrity and smooth functioning of the postal services and prevent any deliberate abuses, this Bill will also seek to&nbsp;reinforce the penalty regime for offences.&nbsp; Under the old regime, the gains from anti-competitive behaviour to disadvantage other competitors may well exceed the current&nbsp;stipulated penalties.&nbsp; Consequently, we believe that, by enhancing the penalties regime, we will&nbsp;ensure that our objective of maintaining a&nbsp;deterrent effect is retained. To do so, we have strengthened the financial penalties for licensees who contravene licence conditions, and for licensees who do not comply with orders issued by&nbsp;IDA.&nbsp; The scope of conditions for the suspension or cancellation of licence in section 9 of the Act has also been broadened to include an<p align=left>Column:  1118<p> assessment of whether the licensee is in a position to comply with the Act or the licence conditions as well as its propensity to default again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the financial penalty for contravention of licence conditions has been increased from the current $10,000 to an amount not exceeding $1 million.&nbsp; This might seem, at first glance,&nbsp;to be a large jump, but we believe that the magnitude of the increase in penalties is appropriate.&nbsp; It is also in line with what has been adopted under other pieces of legislation, for instance, the Telecommunications Act and the Electricity Act.&nbsp;&nbsp; This will serve as a safeguard against anti-competitive actions by any single operator if that operator was to attempt to&nbsp;hurt other operators and, ultimately, hurt consumers by reducing competition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Updating of existing provisions</I></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the third major area of change to the Act consists of updates to existing provisions to ensure they remain&nbsp;relevant.&nbsp; Let me cite a few examples.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>National postage stamps<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such area is&nbsp;national postage stamps.&nbsp; Because of their significance, clause 15 of the Bill will allow only IDA and the designated PPL to issue national postage stamps that&nbsp;bear the word "Singapore". The designated PPL will have to meet certain obligations, for instance,&nbsp;obtaining IDA's approval for the designs of the national postage stamps.&nbsp; The designated PPL must also comply with any related instructions from&nbsp;IDA.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SingPost, as a designated PPL, will continue to issue national postage stamps.&nbsp; These&nbsp;stamps and their associated rights, together with other philatelic archival materials, will continue to be the property of the Government.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:  1119<p><p><I>Remittance of money</I><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another provision that has been fine-tuned is the remittance of money under section 11 of the existing Act. The Bill repeals and re-enacts a new clause 11 that scopes the remittance activities to cover only those remittance systems that have been established by or among public postal licensees and any relevant foreign postal administrations.&nbsp; This will make clear that the new Act does not cover remittance activities carried out by financial institutions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Appeals mechanism<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One further enhancement to the Act is the inclusion of provisions to provide better clarity about the appeals mechanism. Clause 38 provides the details about the appeals mechanism that postal licensees who do not agree with IDA's decision can refer to, if they decide to appeal to the Minister.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><I>Other provisions</I></p><p><I>&nbsp;</I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have also been other changes to the Act that I will&nbsp; not dwell on.&nbsp; The House will find that these are mainly changes to ensure that the Act will remain relevant in this new competitive environment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we note that the changes that we have proposed in the Bill will require adjustments in other pieces of legislation as well.&nbsp; These include, first, the Bankruptcy Act; second, the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act (NPPA); and third, the Undesirable Publications Act (UPA). In essence, the consequential amendments to these Acts will widen the coverage of these Acts to include any of the new postal service operators that enter the scene.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, we appreciate the need for industry players and consumers alike to<p align=left>Column:  1120<p> have sufficient time to adjust to the changes in the legal and regulatory frameworks for the postal sector.&nbsp; Clause 41 of the Bill provides the transitional provisions that would allow a six-month period for operators to adjust to the new regime.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Access to letter box keys<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, before I conclude, I would like to address one issue which has attracted&nbsp;comments and queries in the press and during the public consultation phase, although it is strictly not part of the Bill. This issue is related to the matter of&nbsp;access to letter box keys. Some&nbsp;press reports have even implied that the letter box key might actually&nbsp;undermine our attempts to liberalise the sector.&nbsp; Let me explain the situation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are a unique country with a unique set of letter boxes.&nbsp; The traditional letter box which you will see all over the world is&nbsp;an open-aperture letter box, which means a postman or anybody else for that matter can come to the letter box and insert a letter.&nbsp; That is what we call the open-aperture letter box.&nbsp; But, in Singapore, because we - when I say "we", I mean the people in general - did not like junk mail.&nbsp; We came out with the idea of optionally locking the aperture in the letter box, which means the ordinary postman or the deliveryman cannot slip letters into your letter box.&nbsp; But, yet, in order to enable SingPost to deliver the letters,</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>we came up with what we call a two-door system, an aperture in front which the user can lock and a&nbsp;door at the back which SingPost has the keys to, and they can use that to open up the back of the letter box and insert the letters and the parcels.&nbsp; That is the two-way system.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there was another innovation, a three-way system.&nbsp; Because&nbsp;the problem with the two-way system is that when the postman opens the back of the box, <p align=left>Column:  1121<p>not only could he put letters in, he could also theoretically remove materials out of that letter box.&nbsp; So the next innovation was&nbsp;a three-way system where, if a person has that key, he could open the back, he could put in letters but he could not remove materials.&nbsp; That was meant to enhance security.&nbsp; The problem then arises with the two-door system because the postman can&nbsp;put letters in as well as remove materials out.&nbsp;And if you have free competition and multiple operators with that second key, where they could both insert and remove materials, then quite legitimate questions would be raised as to the security and integrity of your postal system.&nbsp; Because you will never be sure whether the letter was delivered or removed and, if it was removed, who removed it?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So after a significant amount of discussions and&nbsp;consideration, we have now decided that IDA will only facilitate that the designated&nbsp;Public Postal Licensee will have the full set of keys for both the two-way and three-way master letter boxes in Singapore.&nbsp; And to qualify for this access, the PPL would have to comply with arrangements that satisfy IDA that security and integrity have been addressed. Till such a new&nbsp;PPL emerges, for the time being, SingPost will continue to be the designated PPL that would have access to all local letter boxes for mail delivery under its universal service obligations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this does not mean that there will not be competition in letter delivery.&nbsp; Because this two-way <p align=left>Column:  1122<p>master-door letter boxes that I told you about only represent about 32% or one third of all local letter boxes.&nbsp; That means all the other basic mail service providers will still be able to deliver directly to the open-aperture letter boxes and to the three-way master-door letter boxes which together account for 67% of all the letter boxes in Singapore.&nbsp; Basic mail providers are welcome to directly approach the town councils or, in the case of condominiums, the Management Committees to obtain the master-door keys that will grant them access to the three-way master-door letter boxes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I would like to encourage all the town councils and the Management Committees to work with interested postal operators because, by doing so, it will provide more competition and more choices and, hopefully, more competitive pricing for&nbsp;the residents.&nbsp; But at the same time, IDA would also facilitate the system so that other basic mail providers will, if they do not have access to the letter box, still have access to SingPost delivery network and that delivery network will, as I said earlier, be able to reach all letter boxes but at regulated prices, terms and conditions, which IDA will decide.&nbsp; So using these two methods, we will still ensure that competition prevails and people will have choice.&nbsp; More details&nbsp;about&nbsp;this very difficult&nbsp;issue of access to letter boxes will be published by IDA in their Regulations,&nbsp;the Competition Code and Operations Code for the postal sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me end by summarising&nbsp;that the policy intention is to&nbsp;provide legal effect to&nbsp;the liberalisation of the postal sector.&nbsp; We believe this&nbsp;Bill will encourage fair market competition and ensure better services and more competitive prices for consumers.

The corresponding figures for 2005 and 2004 were 68 and 40.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all cases of unauthorised travel will result in prosecution. The OA considers relevant factors such as whether the bankrupt has travelled without permission before, the length of stay overseas, whether he has been generally cooperative with the OA, whether he has committed other offences, and so on, in deciding whether or not to prosecute the errant bankrupt. In appropriate cases, the OA may issue a warning in lieu of prosecution. Last year, 22 bankrupts were issued warnings. For 2005 and 2004, 21 and 6 warnings were issued respectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main purpose of requiring a bankrupt to seek the OA's permission for overseas travel is to help the OA in the administration of the bankruptcy estate, and to prevent the bankrupt from hiding income earned or disposing his assets overseas. To check whether a bankrupt may have travelled without authorisation, the OA follows up on information received and routinely checks the passports of bankrupts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The OA takes every case of unauthorised travel seriously. The OA has powers under section 116 of the Bankruptcy Act to detain the passport of a bankrupt or issue a direction to the Commissioner of the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority to prevent the bankrupt from going overseas. The OA can also take the errant bankrupt to task if he had concealed or improperly put his assets out of the OA's reach. As the OA's role is to ensure a fair and efficient administration of the bankrupt's affairs, he will not hesitate to take action against an errant bankrupt who frustrates this purpose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With more than 24,000 bankrupts, the OA must take a targeted approach. In monitoring the conduct of bankrupts, he works closely with creditors and their lawyers, who have the greatest interest to monitor the bankrupt's conduct and who can provide him with the relevant information. He can detain a bankrupt's passport or ask the Commissioner, ICA to do so if the bankrupt, despite repeated attempts to contact him, refuses to respond to the OA; is uncooperative or is suspected of having committed an offence; or if the OA receives information that the bankrupt may attempt to travel without prior permission. In appropriate cases, the OA may also apply to the High Court for a warrant of arrest against a bankrupt or potential bankrupt if there are credible grounds for believing that he is a flight risk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:  1127<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the current system has worked well. The vast majority of bankrupts seek the OA's permission before they travel. Last year, the OA received some 34,000 applications for permission to travel, inclusive of repeat applications of which some 30,500 applications, which is about 90%, were approved. And while there are currently more than 24,000 bankrupts, only about 100 or 0.4% are taken to task annually for unauthorised travel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, there is room for improvement. We will therefore implement the following measures. Firstly, the OA will help creditors and their lawyers to be more aware of the legal provisions in dealing with bankrupts and would-be bankrupts who are potential flight risks. Secondly, the OA will give early notification to potential bankrupts on travel restrictions that apply to bankrupts and the penalties for failing to comply with these restrictions. And thirdly, the OA will work with relevant agencies like the Courts to streamline current processes to expedite the transmission of information. I believe that these additional measures will strengthen the current system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span><p align=left>Column:  1127<p>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:RE-EMPLOYMENT OF WORKERS BEYOND 62 YEARS OF AGE--><!--END_COL_TITLE:RE-EMPLOYMENT OF WORKERS BEYOND 62 YEARS OF AGE:::1128--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>RE-EMPLOYMENT OF WORKERS BEYOND 62 YEARS OF AGE</P></span>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo </B>asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what plan will the Ministry put in place to track the re-employment of workers beyond 62 years of age; and (b) what is the Ministry&rsquo;s ultimate target for successful accomplishment of this plan.<p>&nbsp;</p></P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that older workers stay employed longer, it will require the concerted efforts of workers supported by unions, employers and the Government. Workers must remain productive through skills upgrading or be willing to take on different jobs.

They should also develop systems to re-deploy older workers when they reach retirement.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government will assist workers by making training more accessible and affordable. Initiatives such as the ADVANTAGE!

The Committee will report to the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports.&nbsp; It will be chaired by my Permanent Secretary, and will include senior officers from the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Manpower, Ministry of Health, and other relevant ministries and public sector agencies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Committee will set policy directions holistically, develop feasible strategies and look into the resource planning for the sector. The Standing Committee will also engage the people sector on their views so that VWOs can continue to play a key role in the implementation of disability services.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A clear priority area that emerged from the Enabling Masterplan was that employment for the disabled should be improved.&nbsp; It would enable them to integrate into society and be independent. Thus, we have focused on employment to start with.&nbsp; I shall elaborate further.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is also in response to Dr Fatimah Lateef's, Member for Marine Parade GRC, question on the ENABLE Fund. My Ministry has been working with the Singapore Workforce Development Agency. This Fund was set up in July 2006. The Fund aimed to encourage employers to employ persons with disabilities. The ENABLE Fund was open to employers who hired four or more persons with disabilities. Up to end April 2007, 11 companies have tapped on the Fund, with 58 workers benefiting from it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February this year, the Enabling Masterplan Committee recommended three enhancements to the ENABLE Fund. First, employers need not employ four new persons with disabilities to qualify as existing employees with disabilities can be counted in the tally of four.&nbsp; Second, companies that outsource jobs to disabled persons can tap on the Fund.&nbsp; Third, the Fund can be used to provide employment support, such as engaging a job coach. The Committee also suggested renaming the Fund as the Open Door Fund.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry has accepted all the recommendations. The Open Door Fund was launched on 1st May 2007. The Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) has informed me that so far, 10 companies have committed to hire 41 persons with disabilities. Of these, 19 are already employed. SNEF is also actively promoting the Open Door Fund through brochures and posters to SNEF member companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:  1131<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Together with the National Council of Social Service, MCYS also co-funds Bizlink, which is the central agency for job placement for persons with disabilities. Bizlink has been successful in placing out up to 250 persons with disabilities annually. To date, they have matched up to 4,900 job placements. In addition, another 1,300 are employed at sheltered workshops at the various Voluntary Welfare Organisations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, employers have also taken the lead to promote the employment of persons with disabilities. The Enabling Employers, a people-sector group led by Mr David Wong, Chief Executive and Managing Director of ABN AMRO Bank, South-east Asia, is supportive of the business case of employing persons with disabilities. Last month, David led his team of employers on a visit to Holiday Inn Park View hotel, which employs 15 persons with disabilities to showcase their capabilities. David has also planned for more activities in the coming months.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am confident that with the Enabling Employers' efforts, as well as with the support from caregivers and the public, more employers will be encouraged to come forward to give persons with disabilities a chance in employment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry, together with MOE and the National Council of Social Service (NCSS), are already working with Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA), Standards, Productivity and Innovation Board (SPRING) Singapore and National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) Learning Hub, and selected Special Education Schools, to come up with training facilities and apprenticeship programmes to equip students with disabilities with the necessary skillsets for employment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the education front, in line with the Enabling Masterplan Committee's recommendation, MOE had announced at this year's Committee of Supply that children in special education, who have been assessed as being able to follow a curriculum leading to the 'O' or 'N' levels or pre-vocational certification, may have their education funded up to 21 years of age, up from the current 18 years of age.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry, MOM and NCSS are also working together on the Enabling Masterplan Committee's recommendation to implement the foreign domestic worker levy concession for families or disabled persons with issues with activities of daily living such as bathing, feeding, and so forth.&nbsp; Our original timeline for implementation was November 2007.&nbsp; I am pleased to say that we can now bring forward this deadline to 15th September 2007.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Last but not least, the Ministry of National Development (MND) has just proposed changes to the Code on Barrier Free Accessibility to make the built environment more conducive to persons with disabilities, the elderly, and families with young children. Besides strengthening the accessibility within buildings, particular attention is paid to improving the connectivity between buildings and from buildings to nearby facilities such as transport nodes and parks. These are important steps towards better meeting the needs of the disabled community. BCA has also set up a $40 million fund to subsidise private sector building owners for the provision of basic accessibility features.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Standing Committee will deliberate on the other recommendations made by the Enabling Masterplan.&nbsp; We have made progress.&nbsp; To date, 11 recommendations have been accepted and announced by the different Government agencies. I expect more recommendations to be accepted. MCYS will provide an annual update during the Committee of Supply each year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span><p align=left>Column:  1133<p>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:WORK HOLIDAY PROGRAMME--><!--END_COL_TITLE:WORK HOLIDAY PROGRAMME:::1134--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>WORK HOLIDAY PROGRAMME</P></span>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo </B>asked the Minister for Manpower if he can elaborate on the Work Holiday Programme which will commence in December 2007 with 2,000 places for university students and graduates.<p>&nbsp;</p></P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Work Holiday Programme, or WHP, will enable young students and graduates, between 17 and 30 years old, to experience living and working in Singapore for up to 6 months.

Comprehensive plans to deter and counter a terrorist attack have been put in place since 2001 and our agencies are working closely together to constantly update and improve these plans.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the Member asked about recent incidents in UK, let me say that we have increased the frequency and coverage of airport patrols and enhanced the traffic roadblocks at the terminals.&nbsp; Our airport security personnel are paying special attention to vehicular access areas and driveways.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recent terrorist events in Glasgow and London reminds us that the threat of terrorism is real. We are in for the long haul and we cannot afford to let our guard down, whether it is security of airports, ports, transport system, key installations or other potential targets.&nbsp; The terrorists are highly adaptive and capable of finding new followers, even among the well-educated.&nbsp; Therefore, we must constantly refine our contingency plans, remain vigilant and stand prepared to deal with this threat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has undertaken necessary measures to protect Singapore and Singaporeans against the threat of terrorist attack. And it will continue to do so. Nevertheless, the Government's efforts to deal with the threat of terrorism can only be effective with the full participation of all Singaporeans. Our people must also play their part.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone has a responsibility to be "the eyes and ears" against potential threats, and also to react quickly and effectively in the aftermath of a terrorist incident. The response of the British people to the attacks also serve as a model of public involvement. There were reports that some members of the public had reacted quickly and helped to apprehend the perpetrators including the suspect, who was fleeing from the car in flames.

The walk would generally be within sheltered areas under HDB void decks or linkways.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The season parking demand by residents as a percentage of the total number of lots provided by HDB island-wide is about 60%.&nbsp; In the event that residents are unable to find a parking lot at the car park nearest to their block, they can park at another car park within the same car park group.&nbsp; In grouping HDB car parks for season parking, car parks within reasonable walking distance from one another are grouped together, and those in high demand are grouped with those in lower demand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where there are localised shortages, HDB will construct additional parking lots, by extending the existing car park or by building on vacant HDB land.&nbsp; If HDB is unable to do so, parking lots from other Government agencies located nearby can be considered, subject to the requirements and constraints of these agencies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span><p align=left>Column:  1151<p>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:COMPENSATION FOR DEAD OR INJURED NSMEN--><!--END_COL_TITLE:COMPENSATION FOR DEAD OR INJURED NSMEN:::1154--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>COMPENSATION FOR DEAD OR INJURED NSMEN</P></span>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>Mr Siew Kum Hong </B>asked the Minister for Defence (a) what is the rationale for pegging the compensation for dead or injured NSmen to the Workmen&rsquo;s Compensation Act; (b) what are the quanta of monthly payments to NSmen who are disabled or paralysed in the course of duty; (c) whether the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Group Insurance Scheme covers death or injuries in the course of duty; and (d) whether the SAF will consider paying for group life and/or disability insurance for non-commissioned full-time NSmen.<p><br>&nbsp;</p></P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Teo Chee Hean:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Mr Siew Kum Hong for his questions on compensation as it allows MINDEF to clarify our compensation framework.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MINDEF applies similar principles and practices used by the civil courts or the Workmen's Compensation Act (WCA) to determine compensation for deaths and injuries due to service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on these principles, MINDEF's compensation framework for death consists of up to three components. The first and base component is the lump sum compensation equivalent to sums prescribed under the Ministry of Manpower's Workmen's Compensation Act. It ensures that full-time national servicemen (NSFs) and NSmen receive amounts that are no worse off than that claimed under the WCA. Above this, more compensation is payable through two other components.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second component is a lump sum death gratuity. For NSFs and NSmen, MINDEF treats them like regulars and gives a minimum of one year's basic pay for a regular of the same rank.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third component is provided when there may have been negligence on the part of the organisation, or where the serviceman has rendered service beyond the call of duty. This is based again on principles consistent with those used in civil courts.&nbsp;The quantum is generally derived taking into consideration, amongst other factors, what the serviceman would have contributed to his dependants from his potential earnings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For permanent disability arising from service, MINDEF's compensation framework consists of up to four components. Again, the first and base component is a lump sum disability compensation according to the guidelines provided under the WCA. Above this, the second component pays a lump sum constant attention award, if the serviceman requires constant care as a result of his disability. The third component is a monthly disability assistance, which varies from person to person according to his circumstances, to defray expenses. The fourth&nbsp; component is an additional lump sum compensation provided when there may have been negligence on the part of the organisation, or where the serviceman has rendered service beyond the call of duty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:  1153<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, MINDEF also provides fully subsidised medical benefits at all Government/restructured hospitals or clinics, and the medical supplies needed for service injuries, for as long as the serviceman requires it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the base component in our compensation framework uses the Workmen's Compensation Act as the reference, compensation amounts for deaths, injuries and disability due to service would provide amounts not less than those prescribed under the Workmen's Compensation Act, and in most cases more than this amount. For the additional lump sum compensation, MINDEF uses the principles applied by civil courts to determine compensation amounts. This is a fair system based on prevailing practices and awards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, MINDEF also has an Awards Appeal Tribunal to consider appeals from servicemen or their dependants on compensation. To provide greater assurance to our servicemen and their families that compensation is fair, and applied according to the principles I have described, MINDEF intends to replace the Tribunal with a new Compensation Board that will be chaired by a non-MINDEF officer. The details are being worked out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Siew also asked about insurance in the SAF. Insurance is a question of whether the organisation wants to pass on the potential liability of paying compensation to an insurance company to carry. MINDEF does not buy insurance for its servicemen because MINDEF itself takes on the liability of paying compensation its servicemen for deaths and injuries arising from service through MINDEF's compensation framework. As explained earlier, this framework applies similar principles and practices used by the civil courts or the Workmen's Compensation Act (WCA) to determine compensation for deaths and injuries due to service. However, servicemen may purchase additional insurance coverage if they wish to. This is similar to employees who would choose to buy additional insurance for personal protection even though they are covered under the WCA or have recourse to civil courts to claim damages. The SAF has the SAF Group Insurance Scheme, which provides coverage for death and permanent disability from $50,000 to a maximum of $400,000. This covers servicemen both during the course of duty and when the serviceman is off duty. The premiums are affordable and MINDEF will continue to look for more competitive premiums for the coverage, and encourage our servicemen to take this up. For example, servicemen can currently insure themselves for $100,000 with a monthly premium of $16. NSmen can also take up this insurance even after their active service. As needs would vary among individuals, we leave it to the servicemen to determine what level of additional insurance coverage they would want to purchase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

The primary role of Special Needs Officers (SNOs) in mainstream primary and secondary schools is to provide support and intervention for pupils who have been diagnosed with mild to moderate special needs such as dyslexia or autistic spectrum disorder so that these pupils can have access to education in our mainstream schools. To date, a total of 81 SNOs have been deployed to 57 primary schools and 13 secondary schools. These SNOs provide individual support for these pupils in the normal classrooms, as well as train them in specific skills, such as literacy or social skills in small groups.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the diagnosis and assessments of children with special needs require the specialist knowledge of psychology or psychiatry. The SNOs are not trained to conduct these assessments. However, they and our teachers can make referrals to the professionals if they notice children who may be exhibiting signs of learning difficulties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The assessment of children with special needs in the mainstream schools is mainly done by psychologists in MOE or by clinicians in the Child Guidance Clinic at the Institute of Mental Health.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Identification of children with special needs in preschools</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the preschool children, the identification and diagnosis is carried out by the Child Development Units (CDUs) in KKH and NUH. This is because at this age, a child&rsquo;s physical, social, mental and language skills are developing. It is therefore important that the evaluation and input of professionals from multiple disciplines, including pediatricians, child psychologists, speech and language therapists as well as physio-therapists and occupational therapists (to develop the child&rsquo;s motor skills) are all taken into consideration to arrive at an accurate assessment. The inputs of other medical and allied health specialists, including geneticists, neurologists, and nutritionists may also be needed in some cases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help teachers understand children with learning difficulties, MOE requires the pre-service training for pre-school teachers leading to certificate or diploma includes modules on special needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, there is an annual seminar for child-care practitioners. The Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports has incorporated topics on special needs and<p align=left>Column:  1163<p> inclusion in this seminar. Child care centre staff are familiar with the current protocol for detection and referral of children with mild learning disabilities.&nbsp; Once a child with special needs is detected, the centre would advise the parents to seek professional help at the CDUs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE will continue to support MCYS and the Ministry of Health on early intervention for pre-school children with special needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span><p align=left>Column:  1163<p>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:UNEMPLOYED PROFESSIONALS, MANAGERS, EXECUTIVES AND TECHNICIANS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:UNEMPLOYED PROFESSIONALS, MANAGERS, EXECUTIVES AND TECHNICIANS:::1164--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>UNEMPLOYED PROFESSIONALS, MANAGERS, EXECUTIVES AND TECHNICIANS</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Figures--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Figures)</B></span><div><BR>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Edwin Khew Teck Fook--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>Mr Edwin Khew Teck Fook </B>asked the Minister for Manpower whether his Ministry will provide a breakdown of Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians who are currently unemployed and the sectors they belong to, particularly the manufacturing sector. &nbsp;&nbsp;</P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our labour surveys categorise unemployed persons based on their last job.

This is 15% lower than the 29,400 recorded at June 2004.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The distribution of unemployed PMETs broadly reflects the share of employed PMETs by sectors - 14% were previously from the manufacturing sector, 6% from the construction sector and 79% from the services sector.

The second type of exemption, which is granted under section 41A(2), allows companies which experience high volatility or seasonal changes in the volume of work to introduce &ldquo;flexible work schedules&rdquo;, by instituting customised work schedules with calibrated payment terms for overtime work and work on public holidays and rest days.&nbsp; In 2005 and 2006, 10 employers were granted such exemptions, also for a maximum period of two years.&nbsp; In both categories, the companies are required to seek renewal if they wish to continue with the exemption beyond the two year period.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first type of exemption, companies have to show that they have obtained the agreement of their employees to the proposed working hours, or the union if the company is unionised.&nbsp; The Ministry conducts a physical inspection on the company and interviews employees concerned to ensure that the overtime work is voluntary. In granting approvals, the Ministry also takes into consideration the track record of the company concerned in relation to their employment practices, including their safety and health practices.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In relation to this type of exemption, 27 applications were rejected in 2005 and 2006.&nbsp; Most of the rejections were on the basis that the Ministry detected weaknesses in their employment and safety practices, such as failing to provide the statutory employment benefits or adequate safety measures.&nbsp; The Ministry initially rejected one application as the union had objected on the basis that the proposal was unfavourable to the workers.&nbsp; In response to the union&rsquo;s objection, the company reviewed the proposal and made improvements, and the application was later approved by MOM with the support of the unions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In relation to the second type of exemption which allows companies to implement flexible work schedules, approvals are guided by a set of Tripartite Guidelines, which were formulated by the Ministry in consultation with the Tripartite partners. In processing each application, the Ministry also consults a tripartite panel on the company&rsquo;s proposals and seeks the agreement of the tripartite partners.&nbsp; So far, one application to implement a flexible work schedule has been rejected on the basis that the employees of the company did not support the scheme.&nbsp; Of the 10 applications approved, nine had profit sharing incentives built into their schemes.&nbsp; The remaining organisation is a non-profit organisation, which offers staff participating in the scheme fixed and variable bonus payments.&nbsp; Feedback on companies which have implemented flexible work schedules has been positive, and the Ministry has not received any complaints from workers regarding these schemes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span><p align=left>Column:  1167<p>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:GROWTH OF VEHICULAR OWNERSHIP--><!--END_COL_TITLE:GROWTH OF VEHICULAR OWNERSHIP:::1168--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>GROWTH OF VEHICULAR OWNERSHIP</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Figures--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Figures)</B></span><div><BR>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak </B>asked the Minister for Transport (a) if he can provide a breakdown of the growth of vehicular ownership in the North East and North West region of Singapore over the past five years compared to the overall vehicular growth; and (b) what was the rate of growth of roads in the different regions of Singapore during the past five years.<p>&nbsp;</p></P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vehicle ownership in the North East (comprising Ang Mo Kio, Serangoon, Hougang, Sengkang, Punggol and Seletar) and North West (comprising Choa Chu Kang, Bukit Panjang, Bukit Batok and Tengah) regions of Singapore both have grown by 23% since 2001, consistent with the development of HDB estates in the two regions.&nbsp; The overall vehicular growth was 16% in the same period.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 2001, 204 and 51 lane-km have been added to the North East and North West regions respectively.&nbsp; The rates of growth of roads in these two regions were 26% and 15% respectively, as compared to 8% for the whole of Singapore in the same period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag --><!--SECTION_NAME:APPENDICES--><P><div align=center><B>APPENDICES</B></div><P>	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> 	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">	<div align=center>		  			        		<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> 	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">	<div align=center>		  			        		<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> 	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">	<div align=center>
