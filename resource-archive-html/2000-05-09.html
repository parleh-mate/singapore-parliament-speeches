<div align="center"><b>SEAT OF NON-CONSTITUENCY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Announcement by Mr Speaker)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have to inform the House that I

received  a  letter from the Deputy Registrar of the  Supreme

Court  stating that a Bankruptcy Order has been made  on  5th

May  2000  against  Mr Joshua Benjamin  Jeyaretnam.   I  also

received  a  letter  dated  6th  May  2000  from  Messrs  Leo

Fernando, Advocates & Solicitors, acting on behalf of Mr J  B

Jeyaretnam, in which it was stated that they would be  filing

a  Notice of Appeal against the Bankruptcy Order made against

Mr  J B Jeyaretnam.  The letter also stated "Mr Jeyaretnam is

of  the  view that he should not be held to have vacated  his

seat in Parliament until the hearing of his Appeal".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have sought the advice of the Attorney-General on the

matter  and  he  has  advised that Mr  Jeyaretnam's  seat  in

Parliament was prima facie vacated on the day he was  made  a

bankrupt.  The words of section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act  are

clear in effect.  The Non-Constituency Member has now filed a

Notice  of Appeal to the Judge of the High Court in  chambers

with  the  intent  to  appeal against  the  decision  of  the

Assistant Registrar of the Supreme Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I am of the opinion that it is not

appropriate  for me to ask Parliament to make a determination

under  Article 48 of the Constitution as to whether his  seat

has been vacated as the Member has filed an appeal.

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>DEVELOPMENT BANK OF SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Administrative charge on POSBank accounts)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister if he

will  ask  the  Development Bank of Singapore  to  look  into

exempting  all  consumers holding less  than  $500  in  their

POSBank accounts to pay the administrative charge.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether he is aware that low-income earners will be penalised

by  the  decision  of the Development Bank  of  Singapore  to

charge  a fee for POSBank accounts with balances below  $500,

and whether this decision is consistent with the Government's

policy to move Singapore towards a cashless society.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister if

he  will  explain  the  rationale behind  the  move  for  the

Development Bank of Singapore to impose, from 1st June  2000,

bank charges on POSBank cheque services as well as on POSBank

accounts  which fail to maintain a minimum daily  balance  of

$500.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister whether

he  will  strongly  recommend the DBS-POSBank  $2  per  month

"accounts fee" be waived for low-income earners.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether  he  will  advise  the DBS Bank  not  to  charge  the

proposed  fee of $2 on a savings account with less than  $500

in the account at the end of each month.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Hawazi Daipi</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister how

many  account  holders have less than $500 in  their  POSBank

accounts,  and whether POSBank was losing money when  it  had

those accounts before it was sold to the Development Bank  of

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether  the Government will introduce measures to allow  and

encourage low-cost banking

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>

facilities to be provided so that low-income workers will not

be  penalised by having bank charges imposed on  their  small

bank accounts.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

what  is the impact of all banks imposing charges on accounts

not  meeting  their minimum sum on lower-income families  and

whether  the Government regards the situation as a  desirable

outcome of free market economy at play.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether  further mergers of our local banks as encouraged  by

the Government will lead to more increases in bank charges as

in  the  case of the Development Bank of Singapore; and  what

action  the  Government will take to address the concerns  of

the business community.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Inderjit Singh</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether  he  will  consider  fully  liberalizing  banking  in

Singapore  so that foreign banks can be given an  opportunity

to  provide  the  full  range of services  that  the  POSBank

provided in the past, with unlimited branches in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Inderjit Singh</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

if  he  will  consider  implementing an  alternative  to  the

previous  POSBank, like a cooperative with a banking licence,

to encourage savings.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

what  is the total number of Singaporean bank account holders

having  at  least  one GIRO arrangement for transactions  and

what is the distribution of these accounts in respect of each

local bank.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs and Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister would be

making  a  Ministerial  Statement  afterwards.   Among  other

things, he will also talk about the POSB and DBS issue.  So I

would  suggest Members who asked Question Nos.  1  to  12  to

await  the  DPM's  statement, after which they  can  ask  him

questions.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>HARBOURING OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Dr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

whether there will be some flexibility in dealing with  cases

related  to  people who had unwittingly overlooked  the  bona

fides  of  tenants who were later identified  by  Immigration

authorities to be illegal workers or overstayers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  whether his Ministry plans to review the Immigration

Act  that  deals with the crime of harbouring  and  employing

illegal  immigrants,  with  the view  of  distinguishing  the

punishment  to  be  meted  out for first-time  offenders  who

unwittingly  harbour  illegal immigrants  and  offenders  who

repeatedly or deliberately harbour illegal immigrants.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  if he will consider introducing amending legislation

to  require  housing  agents  to  ensure  that  tenants  they

introduce to landlords are not immigration offenders.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I will also be making a

Ministerial  Statement afterwards on the subject  of  illegal

immigrants and harbouring of illegal immigrants.  So I  would

ask  the three MPs who asked Question Nos. 13, 14 and  15  to

also  wait patiently for me to make a statement, after  which

they can ask questions.

<div align="center"><b>(Screening agency for genuine work permits or passes)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr Inderjit Singh</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

whether he will consider setting up a screening agency within

his  Ministry to determine whether foreign workers are indeed

holding genuine work permits or passes and to serve as a one-stop  agency,  where landlords and house owners intending  to

rent  out their residential premises to foreign workers,  can

check whether these workers have such permits and passes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker, I do not have a Ministerial Statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since mid-1998, my Ministry has been helping people

who need to check the status of a foreign worker.  We provide

a variety of checks for members of the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Work Permit Department has a one-stop checking

facility  for  members of the public who wish to  verify  the

authenticity  of a work permit card.  Anyone  can  submit  an

original  work  permit  for  checking  at  the  Work   Permit

Department.   The  Department  receives  about   50-60   such

requests  for  authentication every week.  An acknowledgement

letter  will  be  issued  to the member  of  the  public  who

presents  a  work permit card for checking.  Members  of  the

public can also verify the authenticity of a work permit card

by  using one of the self-service information kiosks  at  the

Department.  Currently, the information kiosk is not equipped

to  provide a written confirmation.  We are in the process of

improving the service to provide a hard copy confirmation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Department is also able to verify the

identity  of  a  work  permit  holder  if  the  foreigner  is

personally  present for a finger-print check.  We  can  match

his  finger-print with records captured when the work  permit

was  issued.   In  the case of employment pass  holders,  the

Employment  Pass  Department will verify the authenticity  of

the pass when requested.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who do not wish to come personally to the Work

Permit Department or the Employment Pass Department, they can

also  verify the information given on a work pass by  calling

the Ministry's One-Call Centre.  The one-call centre has been

receiving  as many as 100 calls a day for this  purpose.   We

also  provide  an   interactive voice response  system  where

anyone can dial in to verify the information given on a  work

pass.   An  advisory  on  how to use  the  interactive  voice

response  system  has  been freely distributed  at  the  Work

Permit Department's service counters since March this year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Work Permit Department and the Singapore Immigration

and  Registration are also currently working towards allowing

members  of  the public to verify the work permit  status  of

foreign  workers or the long term visit passes of  foreigners

through the Internet.  This facility will be available within

3 to 6 months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While members of the public can make use of the various

facilities provided by my Ministry to verify the work  permit

status  of  foreign  workers, I must  stress  that  landlords

should  also check both the work pass and passport or  travel

document  to ascertain that the particulars on both documents

correspond  materially.   Where the employer  is  named,  the

landlord  should also check with the employer to verify  that

the  prospective  tenants  are in fact  employed  as  stated.

Where  a  foreigner has no work pass records, landlords  must

check  the  foreigner's passport or travel document  to  make

sure  that the latter has legal stay in Singapore and is  not

an illegal immigrant.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I have two

questions.  The first one is on the verification of the  work

permit or the employment pass.  Does the prospective landlord

have  to submit the original copy of the document to the Work

Permit  Department?  The second question is  on  the  finger-printing check.  I think that is the best foolproof check  to

verify  whether a person is truly a legal immigrant or  legal

worker.   Could  this finger-printing check be designated  to

all  neighbourhood police posts, for ease of  access  to  all

Singaporeans?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if any landlord

wants  to check on the authenticity of the actual work permit

or  the  employment  pass,  then,  of  course,  the  original

document  has to be submitted, because you cannot verify  the

authenticity on the basis of a photocopy.  But  if  you  just

want  to check whether the particulars, in other words,  this

work  permit number belongs to a person by such  and  such  a

name, then those particulars can be verified online.  It  can

be verified through the interactive voice response system,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>

or  they  can  be verified by calling my Ministry's  one-call

centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we could decentralise the checking of

finger-print, I think we need to look into whether, in  fact,

it  is  technically  feasible to have  such  a  decentralised

system.

<div align="center"><b>STATUTORY BOARDS TAPPING FUNDS FROM OPEN MARKET</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Minister for Finance

whether  the  practice of statutory boards tapping  the  open

market  for funds has raised the overall cost of capital  for

these  agencies,  and  whether this  will  lead  to  (i)   an

inflation  of  the  cost of services to be  provided  to  the

public,  and  (ii) a change in the public finance  structure,

for example, the distribution of subsidies via the pegging of

interest  rates between the Central Provident  Fund  and  the

Housing and Development Board.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  raising  of funds  by  statutory  boards

through the issue of bonds in the open market should not have

any impact on the cost of services charged to the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statutory boards' expenditure falls into two categories.

The first category includes expenditure which is partially or

fully subsidised by Government for which the cost of funds is

fully borne by Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second category includes expenditure which is viewed

on a commercial basis.  The funding needs of such expenditure

are  met  either through loans from Government, through  bank

borrowings or through the issue of bonds in the open  market.

If  they  are borrowed from Government, the loans will  carry

assessed interest not significantly different from bond rates

for  similar  maturities.  Bank borrowings often  cost  more,

especially  for  loans  of longer maturities.   Overall,  the

diversification  of  their borrowing  portfolios  should  not

raise their cost of capital, if properly structured.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, statutory boards have tended to rely mostly

on  Government loans or bank borrowings as the procedures are

less  complicated.   Nowadays, they are encouraged  to  issue

bonds  to fund their programmes so that their costs of  funds

are   properly   priced.   Such  bond  issues  also   provide

additional outlets for the investment of domestic savings and

contribute towards the development of our capital market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the specific case of the link between HDB's borrowing

costs  and  its mortgage rates, I should point out  that  the

issue of bonds by HDB has no impact on the interest rates for

the  concessionary mortgage loans, which are pegged  at  0.1%

above  the  CPF  Ordinary Account interest rate.   The  bonds

issued  under the HDB Medium Term Note Programme are not  for

financing subsidised mortgage loans, but for financing  HDB's

development  programmes  and  operational  requirements.  The

bonds replace some of the HDB's loans provided to HDB by  the

Government at an interest rate of 2% above the CPF rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no plans at present to change the current peg

between  the CPF Ordinary Account interest rate and  the  HDB

concessionary  mortgage rate.  The source of  funds  for  the

mortgage loans will continue to be from the Government.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> I would like to ask

the  Minister to confirm that the cost of raising capital via

bonds  for statutory boards is actually lower than that  from

direct borrowings from the banks.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> So far, that has been the case.

I  will  give  an example.  For JTC, its long-term  borrowing

cost has averaged about 5.5% prior to bond issues in the debt

market.   But  these bond issues have averaged about  5%.   I

think  so long as JTC continues to get better rates for their

bonds  than from bank borrowings, this is something which  is

preferred.

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Re-sitting of Pharmacology examination)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Chiam See Tong -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. To ask the Minister for Education why was it

necessary  for  third year medical students of  the  National

University   of   Singapore   to  re-sit   the   Pharmacology

examination on 18th March 2000 when they had already sat  for

it on 13th March 2000.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Question No. 18,

Sir.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir,

on  15th  March, during the debate on the financial estimates

for  my  Ministry, Dr Wang Kai Yuen had already  raised  this

matter,  and I had replied to Dr Wang that I would leave  the

NUS  to handle the matter, and that the University would take

such  matters seriously in order to ensure that the integrity

and   reliability   of  the  assessment   system,   including

examinations, is maintained, and if there is a mistake,  that

the   University  would  correct  it,  in  order  to  restore

confidence in the system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the NUS has indeed investigated the matter. It set

up an inquiry committee to investigate the error resulting in

the  wrong set of essay questions being used for the 3rd year

Pharmacology examination on 13th March 2000.  On 20th  April,

it  made  public the findings of the inquiry and the  actions

taken against the University staff concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NUS has also explained why students had to re-sit the

essay  section of the examination paper.  The error  resulted

from  human  error.  NUS will reinforce the checks  that  are

already in place in the current examination system to prevent

a re-occurrence of such a mistake.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b> asked the Minister for Home

be taken against housing agents acting as loan sharks.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, I would

like  to  assure  the  House  that  Police  investigate  such

offences thoroughly when they are reported.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Housing agents who give such loans at interest will be

investigated  for  carrying  on  business  as  a  moneylender

without a licence under the Moneylenders Act.  Offenders  are

liable  on conviction to a fine of not less than $10,000  and

not  more  than  $100,000, and for  a  second  or  subsequent

offence to a fine of not less than $20,000 and not more  than

$200,000  or  to  imprisonment for a term  not  exceeding  12

months or to both.  An offending company shall be liable to a

fine of not less than $20,000 and not more than $200,000.  We

will  come down hard on these exploitative offenders and will

seek deterrent sentences where appropriate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Housing agents involved in such practices will be

reported  to the Institute of Estate Agents, and  the  Inland

Revenue  Authority  of Singapore which issues  housing  agent

licences to housing agents' companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home owners on their part should be prudent and exercise

caution when approached by housing agents making such offers.

They  should  not  take  any loan from illegal  moneylenders.

Those  who  do  so  do it at their own peril.   House  owners

should  report immediately to the police should  any  housing

agent make such an offer to lend money.  For Police to arrest

such exploitative offenders, house owners must be prepared to

cooperate and assist the Police in their investigations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would like to

ask  the  Minister  of State how many such  cases  have  been

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir,

Question No. 20.  Before the Question is answered, may I  say

that  I acted, before I ceased practice, as a lawyer for  two

of  these  men.   But I have no pecuniary  interest  in  this

Question at all.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Sir, in answer to the Question, let me say that

it  is  both  premature and improper to  say  at  this  stage

whether  the transport companies would be prosecuted or  not.

This is because the trials of some of the CISCO officers  are

still  underway  and  CPIB is awaiting  the  consent  of  the

Attorney-General  for  prosecution  of  others.    Upon   the

conclusion of the trial against the CISCO officers and  based

on   the   available  evidence,  the  CPIB  will  then   make

appropriate  recommendations to the Attorney-General  whether

to proceed against the transport company.

given these little sums of money without them asking for  it?

They were given at the end of their task.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it would have been

obvious from my main answer that these are issues not  to  be

<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN DOMESTIC MAIDS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Psychological evaluation)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Chiam See Tong -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. To ask the Minister for Manpower whether he will

make  it  a  requirement for all foreign maids to  undergo  a

psychological  evaluation  before  they  can  be  given  work

permits  in  view of the reported deaths and other  tragedies

involving foreign maids.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Question No. 21, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, currently, all

foreign   domestic  workers  must  undergo  a  full   medical

examination  before they are issued with a Work  Permit.  The

medical   examination  includes  a  section  on  the  foreign

domestic  worker's mental history.  If the  examining  doctor

feels  that  the  foreign  domestic worker  is  not  mentally

stable,  the foreign domestic worker will not be cleared  for

employment.   The Work Permit Department does, from  time  to

time,  reject applications from foreign domestic workers  who

have a history of mental illness, although the number of such

cases  is  not large.  The vast majority of foreign  domestic

workers are normal healthy persons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence requiring a psychological evaluation may not be

effective in preventing tragedies involving foreign  domestic

workers.   Typically, foreign domestic workers,  who  exhibit

abnormal  behaviour,  do  so as  a  result  of  work  related

stresses  or  news  of  unpleasant  events  from  home.   The

reported cases of foreign domestic workers, who were suicidal

or   who  inflicted  harm  on  a  member  of  the  employer's

household,  were normal when they first arrived in Singapore.

It  is  doubtful whether psychological evaluation would  have

prevented these tragedies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign domestic workers work and stay with their

employers.  Hence, employers are responsible for helping  the

foreign  domestic  workers to cope and  adapt  to  their  new

working and living environment.  Some foreign domestic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>

workers  may need more time to adjust to the new  social  and

cultural environment than others.  Employers should therefore

be  more  sensitive to foreign domestic workers' adaptability

and not subject them to unnecessary work pressures especially

at the beginning of their employment in Singapore.  Employers

should  also  show  more understanding and  concern  if  they

detect  that  their foreign domestic workers are  emotionally

upset,   especially  after  receiving  letters   from   home.

Generally,   employers  who  treat  their  foreign   domestic

workers well and are genuinely concerned with the welfare and

interest of their foreign domestic workers are more likely to

enjoy  a  happy and productive relationship with the  foreign

domestic workers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, does the Minister see the need

to  require foreign domestic workers after they have  arrived

here  to  also  include a psychological evaluation  in  their

subsequent medical examination?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not feel the

need for it because, as I said, if the employer observes that

the  foreign  domestic worker is psychologically unstable  or

not  adjusting well, they would know what to do, ie,  make  a

proper arrangement either to repatriate the person who is not

well  or  who  is  obviously unfit to work and  live  in  the

Singapore environment.  The employer has every opportunity to

do so already.

<div align="center"><h4>SPEAKERS' CORNER</h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  whether he will give an unequivocal  assurance  that

the  names  of the speakers at "Speakers' Corner"  and  their

particulars  will  not  be released to  anyone  but  will  be

destroyed at the end of the day.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> The process of registration to speak

at the Speakers' Corner is transparent. A speaker is required

to  give his name and NRIC number when he registers to speak.

The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>

names  of  all  the speakers who register to  speak  will  be

posted  and updated every two hours on a notice board outside

the  Kreta  Ayer Neighbourhood Police Post for the public  to

see.   The  public  will then know who  is  speaking  at  the

Corner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The records of the speakers cannot be destroyed at the

end  of  each  day because the Police may receive  complaints

subsequently  that  someone spoke without  registering.   The

records will then be needed to show whether the person did in

fact  register  with  the NPP.  Should  it  be  necessary  to

proceed  against  a  recalcitrant  subject  who  persistently

refuses  to register, thus breaching the conditions, it  will

be   necessary  for  the  register  to  be  examined  by  the

investigator, and even produced in Court as evidence.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister

why  is  it  thought  to be transparent about  the  need  for

registration when in other parts of the world no registration

is  required  at all?  Secondly, what is going to  happen  to

these records?  My question was an unequivocal assurance that

it  will not be released to anybody.  How long are you  going

to  keep  it,  and under what secrecy will these  records  be

kept?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the Member did not hear my

answer  carefully.  The last time when we sat and I  answered

this  question,  I  said  we need to  register  the  speeches

because only Singapore citizens are allowed to speak.  Unless

he  registers,  produces his IC, how do  we  know  that  that

person who is speaking is a Singapore citizen?  Secondly,  we

need  to  keep a register because of the reasons I have  just

stated,  ie, for investigation purposes, in case there  is  a

complaint subsequently that the person should not be there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long will these records be kept? Like all one-off

registration,  or application for licensing type  of  record,

these  records would be kept for five years.  As  to  why  we

want  to make the speakers' list public, what is there to  be

afraid  of if a person is speaking?  Everybody ought to  know

who  is  speaking.  Otherwise, supposing  so  and  so  is  an

interesting speaker and the members of the public may want to

find

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>

out who the person is and take a look at the list.  There  is

no secrecy about this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Minister keeps saying it is for

investigation   purposes.   Is   there   going   to   be   an

investigation  if someone complains that the  speaker,  while

speaking,  had made some very critical and pungent criticisms

of  the  Government  or  any official?   Will  there  be  any

investigation as to why the man said it?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, a lot of things have been said

against the Government - some very pungent, some very  strong

and  some  in  very hatred languages - and  nobody  has  been

investigated  because  they have  said  such  things  of  the

Government.  But if a person says something that  is  against

the  law,  ie,  if  he says something that has  slandered  or

intimidated  people,  then  of  course  there  must   be   an

investigation to determine what he has said is indeed against

the law.

<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN DOMESTIC MAIDS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Wrong pregnancy test results)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b> asked the Minister for Health how

many  doctors  have  been  taken to  task  for  providing  to

employers  wrong pregnancy test results for foreign  domestic

maids from 1996 to date.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Chan Soo Sen) (for the Minister for Health):</b> From 1996

to  date, the Singapore Medical Council has received a  total

of  eight  complaints  from the Ministry of Manpower  against

doctors  who failed to detect pregnancies in foreign domestic

maids  during  their medical examination.   And  these  eight

cases  occurred, one in 1996, three in 1998, one in 1999  and

three this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of these eight complaints, the three that were

lodged this year are still being investigated. The one lodged

in  1999  has been referred to the Disciplinary Committee  of

the  Singapore Medical Council for formal inquiry.   For  the

remaining  four cases, three had been dismissed as there  was

insufficient

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>

evidence to show that the doctors were guilty of professional

misconduct, and only one doctor had been censured.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of missed diagnosis of pregnancy is very

small  compared  to more than 100,000 foreign domestic  maids

working  in  Singapore. Nevertheless, the  Singapore  Medical

Council  has  reminded doctors about the importance  of  such

examination.   My Ministry is also working with the  Ministry

of  Manpower to study how the examination procedure could  be

improved so as to minimise the error.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Parliamentary Secretary: if such a wrong diagnosis has led to

subsequent  delivery  of a child in the KK  Hospital,  should

that doctor be asked to foot the bill?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> I have not heard of doctors footing

the  bills for such cases.  Let us put it this way.  A  wrong

diagnosis  is possible because normally a pregnancy  test  is

done  by detecting a certain hormone in the urine.  I believe

it  is  called  HCG, and if it is administered properly,  the

accuracy  is  about  98%.  There is a  possibility  that  the

hormone  could not be detected when she is in  a  very  early

stage  of pregnancy.  She may look physically normal  and  no

hormone  was  detected under such circumstances.   I  do  not

really think the doctor ought to foot the bill.  She ought to

be responsible for her own decision.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Sir, is it fair then to ask the

employer to foot the bill?

the  employer  was  asked to pay for the  hospital  bills  on

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> It will be interesting if the Member

could  let  me have the particulars of the case  so  that  we

could look into it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> May I ask the

Parliamentary  Secretary whether it is correct  to  say  that

there  were cases of false negative findings in patients  not

due  to errant doctors but due to the deceitful acts of maids

in  adulterating  urine samples and in using  someone  else's

urine samples for examination.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is possible and

that  is why when we review the procedure, we will look  into

the possibility using the blood to test for pregnancy because

HCG can be detected by a urine test.  I was also advised that

it  can  be  detected  through blood test  and,  for  medical

examination  of  foreign  domestic maids,  a  blood  test  is

already  necessary to identify diseases like HIV and sexually

transmitted  diseases.  So it is possible to incorporate  the

blood  test for pregnancy. We understand, however,  that  the

cost  may be slightly higher. The cost per urine test, I  was

told,  is about $1. The cost per blood test for pregnancy  is

about  $3.35.  We  will  look at  it  and  put  up  a  formal

recommendation  to  the  Ministry  of  Manpower  later.    By

insisting on a blood test, the possibility of adulteration is

much less because the doctor would probably have to draw  the

blood  himself  rather than leaving the maid to  produce  the

urine  and  she could have carried that bottle of urine  with

her to the toilet before the test.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary: in

a  case  of  deceit by the maid, is the doctor  still  to  be

blamed or is the maid solely liable?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> I am quite sure that this would have

been  taken  into  consideration during the  inquiry  by  the

Singapore Medical Council.  If the act is a deceitful one  by

the  maid,  I  do  not see the doctor being  responsible  for

analysing  the  wrong  sample, that is, obtaining  the  right

result leading to the wrong outcome.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary

whether  his Ministry will inform all doctors on the need  to

verify work

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>

permits of maids for identification prior to consultation and

certification  in their clinics?  Am I correct  to  say  that

there  are  employers who are reluctant to hand  work  permit

passes  to their maids?  Therefore, the requirement  for  the

Ministry  to  verify the identity of maids will help  doctors

enforce the correct procedure.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> I believe this is a question for the

Ministry  of  Manpower.   I stand to be  corrected  but  this

procedure  for medical tests is a requirement  to  renew  the

work permit.

<div align="center"><b>PROTECTION OF WORKERS AGAINST LIGHTNING</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower,

in  view  of the high incidence of lightning strikes, whether

his  Ministry will require employers to protect workers,  who

have  to  work  in  the  open during  thunderstorms,  against

lightning.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe) (for the Minister for Manpower):</b> Sir, as there

are  no  effective  means to protect workers  from  lightning

strike while working in the open during thunderstorms, it  is

advisable  for them to stop work and seek shelter when  there

is lightning in the vicinity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Meteorological Service currently provides round-the-clock free updates of weather information, including actual

locations  of  lightning and forecasts of  thunderstorms  for

various parts of the island.   These services can be accessed

via the department's dial-a-weather telephone service and the

Internet  website. Also, a real time graphic display  showing

areas in Singapore which are affected by showers and possibly

lightning is also available via the same website.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for those who wish to be alerted by telephone or

pagers  whenever the risk of lightning is very  high  over  a

particular  location, a lightning watch service is  available

through  subscription.  Such a service has  been  implemented

for a number of users in Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, employers who need their workers to work in the

open  are  advised  to  use  the  service  provided  by   the

Meteorological Service to find out the weather information of

the  work  area.  If  there  is  imminent  danger  posed   by

lightning, employers should not insist that workers  continue

to work in exposed workplaces.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> May I ask the Minister

of  State  whether the Ministry would consider  working  with

service aircraft in the airport round-the-clock?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, as I mentioned, the

Meteorological  Service  provides this  round-the-clock  free

updates  of  weather information.  I think  the  authorities,

whether  it  is  the  CAAS or the LTA,  can  check  with  the

advise  their  workers whether or not to  work,  particularly

when there is danger of lightning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Thomas Thomas -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25. To ask the Minister for Manpower what steps, if

any,  are being taken to increase protection and welfare  for

temporary, casual and contract workers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Question No. 25, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (for the Minister for Manpower):</b> Sir, the Nominated Member of Parliament has asked

about protection available for temporary, casual and contract

workers.  Let me clarify that temporary, casual and  contract

workers are covered by the CPF Act, Employment Act, Factories

Act  and  Workmen's Compensation Act - as long  as  they  are

employees engaged under a contract of service.  For  example,

a  worker who is employed by a shipyard on a temporary  basis

will be entitled to CPF

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>

contribution  and  also  enjoy  all  the  statutory  benefits

stipulated  in the Employment Act. His health and  safety  at

the workplace is also protected under the Factories Act.   If

he  meets  with  an accident in the course of his  work,  his

employer is liable to pay compensation in accordance with the

Workmen's  Compensation Act.  Similarly,  a  worker,  who  is

engaged by an employment agency or a labour supplier  and  is

deployed  to work in an electronics company, is also  covered

by these laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to take this opportunity to

remind employers of temporary, casual and contract workers of

their  obligations under the various employment laws.   These

employers  include employment agencies and  labour  suppliers

who  engage contract or temporary workers and supply them  to

companies  that  need  such workers.  They  are  required  to

comply  with  the  provisions of these  laws,  including  the

contributions to be made under the CPF Act and the  statutory

benefits stipulated in the Employment Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry carries out regular inspections to ensure

that  companies  comply with the laws under our  purview.  If

workers are denied benefits and protection stipulated in  the

laws,  they  are advised to seek assistance at the  Ministry.

The  Ministry  will  assist  them  to  recover  the  benefits

stipulated  under  the laws and also take appropriate  action

against the employer or agent concerned for violation of  the

laws.

<div align="center"><b>(Requirement on minimum contract sum)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26. <b>Mr Goh Chong Chia</b> asked the Minister for National

Development, in view of the structural collapse of  the  roof

at  Compassvale  School which was obviously due  to  lack  of

supervision, whether his Ministry will consider reverting  to

the  past  requirement of a resident engineer  on  a  minimum

contract   sum  of  $10  million  instead  of   the   present

requirement on a minimum sum of $15 million.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia (Nominated Member):</b> Before I ask my

Question, I wish to declare that I am an architect in private

practice.  Question No. 26, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the collapse of the roof at Compassvale

School  was  due mainly to a design error by the professional

engineer  and the failure of the Accredited Checker  (AC)  to

spot  the error. The lack of construction supervision by  the

site  supervisor was a contributory factor but not  the  main

cause of the collapse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The requirement of a resident engineer for projects

above  $10  million was set in 1987.  It was revised  to  $15

million  in 1997 to take into account the higher construction

costs.   We have no intention to change the current limit for

the time being.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the Compassvale incident, BCA has reviewed its

current  system in which the work of a professional  engineer

is  checked  by an AC to ensure the safety of the  structure.

The  system  is found to be sufficiently stringent.  However,

BCA  will  be  fine-tuning the AC system to ensure  that  ACs

maintain  a  high standard in checking so that there  are  no

lapses in the design. Some of the measures include:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) ensuring that the larger or more complicated

projects  will  be undertaken by an AC practice  with  better

resources and staff strength;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) requiring ACs to apply for renewal of registration

annually; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) stepping up surveillance and enforcement actions to

maintain a high standard in AC practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry intends to amend the Building Control Act

this  year  to  strengthen the AC system. The legislation  is

targeted for implementation from January 2001.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia:</b> Sir, as full-time supervision is

actually  done  by  a clerk-of-works or a resident  engineer,

would the Minister consider making them more accountable?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, currently clerks-of-works are

already accountable for the supervisory actions at sites.   I

am not sure exactly in what way the Member would like them to

be  more accountable.  Perhaps he could let the Ministry know

what he has in mind.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia:</b> In the case of Compassvale, although

the  Minister said the supervising personnel were accountable

to  a certain extent, nothing actually happened at all in the

whole  case.  They  were literally let off scot-free.   Since

they  are  full-time  supervisors  on  site,  are  they   not

accountable for anything at all?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Specifically in this Compassvale case,

the  inquiry  found that the main cause of the  accident  was

really  due to both the PE as well as the accredited checker.

The  PE  made  a  mistake in the design and he was  primarily

responsible. The AC, who was supposed to make sure that  such

design  errors do not slip through the system, also  did  not

check and, therefore, he was also found liable.  The role  of

the  supervisory  professional, in this case,  the  clerk-of-works, was found to be a contributory but not the main  cause

of  the accident. Therefore, it was deemed not necessary  for

action  to be taken against him in this case.  But that  does

not follow that he is not liable for his actions.  If, let us

say,  in  other cases, he is found to be liable, then  action

will be taken.

to  the lowest tenderers between 1997 and 1999;  (b) how many

of  these  contractors have gone into liquidation;   and  (c)

what  measures are taken to ensure that contracts are awarded

to suitable contractors.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, between

1997  and 1999, HDB awarded a total of 483 building and civil

engineering  contracts.   About 98%  or  473  contracts  were

awarded to the lowest tenderers.  The other 10 contracts were

awarded  to  the  effective lowest tenderers under  a  scheme

called  the  "Preferential  Margin  Scheme  for  Construction

Quality".  Under this preferential scheme, a premium (up to a

maximum  of  5%)  was given to contractors  with  good  track

records  to  discount their tender sums to make their  tender

positions more advantageous.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the 473 contracts awarded to the lowest tenderers,

two contractors went into liquidation before completing their

contracts.   HDB  has  recommended to Ministry  of  Finance's

Standing  Committee  on Debarment (SCOD)  to  debar  the  two

contractors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all Government procurement agencies, including HDB,

are  bound by the Government's Instruction Manual 3, Part  B,

to  award contracts to tenderers who submit the lowest  offer

that  complies  substantially with the contract requirements.

However, only suitable contractors who are registered in  the

appropriate Work Head and Financial Grade under the  Building

and  Construction Authority's Contractor Registration  System

and who have not been debarred from tendering by Ministry  of

Finance's Standing Committee on Debarment (SCOD) are  allowed

to tender for HDB's building and civil engineering contracts.

In  addition,  contractors who performed  poorly  in  current

contracts will not be awarded new Government contracts.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask the Senior

Parliamentary  Secretary how does the  HDB  ensure  that  the

quality of flats is not affected if a contract is novated  to

another   contractor  due  to  liquidation  of  the  original

contractor?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, in the case of

liquidation, it is a very unfortunate case.  The  HDB  has  a

close monitoring

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>

system to monitor the progress of construction works on site.

So  HDB can pick up signs.  For example, when a contractor is

slow  in completing the work according to schedule, then  HDB

picks  up one sign.  At some point, the HDB will talk to  the

contractor.  And the contractor, at some point, might also be

willing  to  novate his contract to another  contractor.   In

such  cases, the contractor who novates his contract over  to

another  contractor  will  be  debarred  from  HDB's   future

contracts.  So the HDB contractor who tendered the lowest sum

must  make sure that he can complete the project.  Otherwise,

he  will  be penalised from tendering future contracts.   And

HDB,  being the bigger developer in town, is a very important

customer to all contractors.

can  Government  help our local engineers and  architects  to

establish  a  track record that will enable them  to  compete

more effectively for regional and other global projects.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is an open

economy  where local architects and engineers compete  on  an

equal  basis  for  project  work.   Award  of  public  sector

projects  by  Government is open to both  local  and  foreign

consultancy   firms.   Singapore  is  also   bound   by   its

obligations   under   the   WTO   Agreement   on   Government

Procurement.  Our local firms will have to compete on  merit.

We  cannot offer protection or preference to our local firms,

such  as stipulate that foreign firms must team up with local

architects   or  engineers  when  tendering  for   Government

projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our local firms compete on merit, it will

<div align="center"><b>BUS AND MRT FARE INCREASES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  and Information Technology  whether  he  will

explain  the  justification for the increase in bus  and  MRT

fares.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology (Dr John Chen Seow Phun) (for the Minister for Communications and Information Technology):</b> Sir, the Public

Transport  Council met in April to consider the proposals  by

the  public transport operators to increase the fares for bus

and train services. On 20th April, the Chairman of the Public

Transport  Council announced the new fares  that  would  take

effect from 1st June.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When reviewing fare proposals, the Public Transport

Council  has  to  take  into  consideration  improvements  in

service  quality, rising costs and the need to balance  these

against  consumer  affordability and the long-term  financial

viability  of  the  transport operators.  In  approving  this

round  of fare increases, the Council has explained that  its

approval  was based on these considerations that I have  just

mentioned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council has also explained that the increase in

feeder  fares is intended to ameliorate in some  measure  the

pricing  anomaly  of feeder fares compared to  minimum  trunk

fares.  At present, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>

feeder fares are much lower than the trunk fares, even though

they  consume the same level of resources.  This  results  in

commuters often pressing for feeder services even though they

have   trunk  services  plying  the  same  route.   The  fare

adjustment   will   reflect  the  cost  of  operations   more

accurately,  and  incentivise operators to provide  a  better

feeder network to serve residents better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in fares for commuters travelling longer

distances  will  make the fare structure  more  equitable  by

requiring long distance commuters to bear a fairer  share  of

the  costs.   Today,  short  distance  commuters  are  cross-subsidising longer distance commuters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In approving the fare revision, the Public Transport

Council has moderated the fare proposals of the operators  to

keep  the  increase  at a modest level.  The  operators  have

projected that based on what the Council approved, their fare

revenue will only increase by 2.4% or less.  This is a modest

increase,  considering   that fares have  not  been  adjusted

since 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is best that operators regularly review public

transport fares so that any fare increase is in small  steps.

This   approach  is  less  painful  than  holding  back  fare

increases  until  cost pressures become intolerable  and  the

public is then faced with a massive increase in one exercise.

Operators  are aware that any fare increase is  capped  by  a

formula pegged to the cost of living, ie, at CPI + x%,  where

x is an adjustment factor for cost of operations such as wage

changes  and  productivity gains.  Based on this formula,  if

PTC  had  allowed fares to increase up to the cap every  year

from  1997, the fares would have increased by a total of 8.3%

after  this  year's fare revision, compared to the  level  in

1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Transport Council has exercised due diligence

in  carrying  out  its duty to scrutinise  the  proposals  of

public transport operators and in approving the latest  round

of  increases.   I  am  of the view that  the  increases  are

reasonable and justifiable, in view of the reasons  given  by

the Council.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, the Minister of State has given

long reasons for what he thinks are the justification for the

increases.  May I refer him to the statement that appeared in

the press sometime ago?  May I ask the Minister of State what

inquiries  had  he made before he made that public  statement

saying that the increases were just and fair?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, the comment that I made

regarding increases was made after the PTC's announcement  of

its approval.  Of course, the Ministry had to scrutinise what

the  PTC  had  deliberated on and whether it is indeed  fair.

Our view is that the PTC has done its duty and has looked  in

a  very detailed manner into all the factors before coming to

this conclusion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, does the Minister of State remember

that  in  his statement he said that the drivers had suffered

pay cuts during the recession, and it was only fair that they

should  now have their salaries increased, or words  to  that

effect?   May I ask the Minister of State whether  he  looked

into  the  accounts of the bus companies during the recession

to  see  whether  their profits had gone down  a  substantial

level  that  required the salaries to be cut,  if  they  were

indeed cut?  Had he made those inquiries?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, the PTC took into

consideration many factors.  Inflation was one  factor.   The

investments   that   the  companies  put   in   for   service

improvements  was  another  factor.  Productivity  gains  was

another  factor.   The  possibility  of  wage  increases  was

another  factor.  All these were considered by the  PTC  when

they  deliberated on these proposals.  Therefore, as  far  as

wage  increase is concerned, if they do not have an  increase

in  revenue,  it would be very difficult for the  company  to

consider a wage increase.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, I am afraid the Minister has not

answered my question.  May I ask him, finally, whether he has

looked  at  annual statements to see what profits  these  bus

companies have made over the last few years and whether  they

have been decreasing or whether they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>

have  been  increasing  every year?  Has  he  looked  at  the

accounts?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Yes, the PTC has looked into all

these factors.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Has the Minister of State looked at it?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> I am aware of the situation and

I  am  of the view that the returns are reasonable.   If  you

look  at the return on assets of the bus companies, you  will

be  surprised that it is quite low.  And even if they put the

assets into bonds, I am sure, without the hassle of all these

bus operations, it would give them a better return.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister  of  State  about the timing of the  increases?   He

mentioned that the last review was in 1997 before the  crisis

started.   Given  that the crisis started  in  1999  and  the

crisis  seems  to  be  over, do these increases  signal  that

public  transport as a whole is expected  to  go  up  as  the

economy goes up?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, as MCIT is overseeing the

transport sector, so I speak for the transport sector.  If we

look  at  the inflation figures since 1997, although we  have

been through the recession, there is still inflation.  And if

we  look  at  investments in buses, TIBS, for  instance,  has

spent $100 million in acquiring 300 new buses and it is going

to  expand its fleet by 30% this year.  SBS is going  to  buy

more superbuses and have a system using technology to improve

fleet  management  and so on.  All these are  reasons  for  a

revenue  increase.  If we do not allow fare  increases,  then

what  it means is that profitability and viability are  going

to  go  down,  and there will be no incentive to improve  the

system.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister of State,

finally, is he saying then that these increases were made  to

enable  the  returns for the shareholders to be satisfactory?

Is that the reason?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, may I remind the Member

that Parliament passed the Public Transport Council Act,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>

and  the  objective of the Act is to balance the interest  of

both  the  operators and the commuters.  And we have  debated

this  at  length  in this House.  If we are  to  balance  the

interest of both, then we must make sure that it is,  in  the

end,  a  win-win  situation for both.  If  we  say  that  bus

operators  cannot increase fares, then in  the  end,  it  may

become a lose-lose situation.

<div align="center"><b>BANK CHARGES BY DBS/POSBANK</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, many Members of the

House  have  raised questions about DBS' recent  decision  to

levy a $2 monthly fee on POSBank accounts with less than $500

balance  and  charges  for POSBank cheque  services.  Let  me

answer  all  these  questions  together,  by  explaining  the

background  of  POSBank's merger with DBS bank,  the  present

status of DBS bank, the Government's proper role, how we  can

resolve  the immediate problem, and how banking services  can

be kept affordable for all Singaporeans.

<br><br><i>POSBank</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until 1998, when POSBank was merged with DBS Bank,

POSBank provided free banking services to all its depositors.

As  a  result,  Singaporeans with modest savings  would  open

accounts  with  POSBank  rather than any  other  bank.  Small

accounts  comprised a majority of POSBank  accounts:  36%  of

POSBank  savings accounts had balances less than $100,  while

52%,   more   than  half,  had  balances  less   than   $500.

Furthermore,  because  opening a POSBank  account  was  free,

Singaporeans often opened more than one account with POSBank.

In  1998, POSBank had 5.2 million savings accounts, far  more

than the number of people in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi Daipi asked whether POSBank had been losing

money  on  its  small accounts. The answer  is  yes.  POSBank

estimated  that out of the 5.2 million accounts, 3.8  million

(three-quarters)  were  uneconomic, ie,  revenue  from  these

small  accounts  was less than the costs of  servicing  them.

POSBank  did not try to recover even part of this  cost  from

the  small depositors. Instead it cross-subsidised the  small

depositors using the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>

larger  accounts,  on which it could earn  profits  from  the

spread  between  its deposit and lending rates.  Indeed  from

1978 onwards, for 20 years, POSBank even paid higher interest

rates on small deposits than on large deposits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy was not sustainable. As our financial sector

developed,  commercial banks and fund managers  provided  new

services  and  products that offered higher  returns  than  a

POSBank  savings  account.  As  Singaporeans  became   better

educated  and financially more sophisticated, they grew  more

sensitive  to  the returns their savings were  earning.  They

were  no  longer content to park their savings in  a  POSBank

account, especially if they had substantial savings. To "make

their money work for them",  to use the American phrase, they

began  to shift their savings to other banks offering  better

fixed deposit rates, and into other forms of investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, in a growing market, POSBank's share of

savings  deposits  declined, from 64% in  1979  (nearly  two-thirds)  to 47% at the end of 1997, which is less than  half.

In  1997,  as  the Asian crisis intensified, commercial  bank

interest  rates rose. The gap between interest rates  offered

on   POSBank  savings  accounts  and  commercial  bank  fixed

deposits  widened.  Consequently, POSBank  began  losing  its

bigger  depositors who accounted for most  of  its  deposits.

Thus, depositors with balances of $50,000 and above comprised

only  3% of the total number of POSBank account holders, but,

nearly half, 48% of POSBank's total deposit base.  This group

started  taking  the  money  out  of  POSBank  to  put   into

commercial  banks.   In  March 1998, POSBank  was  forced  to

reverse   its  policy  of  paying  smaller  accounts   higher

interest, and instead started paying large accounts a  higher

interest rate than for small accounts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was clear, therefore, that POSBank did not have a

promising  future  as a stand-alone savings  bank,  providing

free  banking  services to small accounts on the  traditional

model.  This  was  one  reason why in  1998,  the  Government

decided to merge POSBank with DBS Bank. Merger

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>

gave the combined bank economies of scale, and enabled it  to

improve customer services. The objective was to build a  bank

large  enough  to  compete internationally, and  to  maintain

banking  services for Singaporeans that were affordable,  but

not necessarily free.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These issues were fully debated when Dr Richard Hu moved

the  Second Reading of the legislation to corporatise POSBank

on  12th October 1998.  Among other things, Dr Hu said in his

Second  Reading  speech (Hansard, vol. 69,  col.  1027,  12th

October 1998):

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government recognises that these market distortions

have  to  go  [he was referring to POSBank's tax  privileges,

below  market mortgage rates, and the difficulty in gathering

deposits]. However, to ease the burden of adjustment in  this

privatisation  exercise, we are taking care  to  ensure  that

painful  disruptions for POSBank's depositors  and  borrowers

are   minimised.   We  therefore  set  out   a   transitional

arrangement to help all parties adjust over time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transitional arrangement was to phase out the tax

exemption and to make the adjustments over a period of years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs spoke during the debate. Nobody opposed the

Bill. Dr S Vasoo supported the Bill but raised concerns  over

the service charge.  He said, and I quote him:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are several implications that one needs to pay

attention to.  One is the service charge, ie, whether service

charge to small account holders could be reviewed and whether

DBS  could  be advised that the service charge would  not  be

raised  unnecessarily  at the expense of  the  small  account

holders."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh See Kiat also supported the Bill, but he spoke

about the social objective of POSBank.  I quote him:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is after all still a social objective that a

national  institution like the POSBank can serve, the  social

initiative of promoting thrift and saving."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Cheng Bock supported the Bill. He had discussed

the problem thoroughly with Dr Wang Kai Yuen, who had been  a

board  member  of  POSBank, and Dr Tan was  expressing  their

shared views. Dr Tan explained clearly why the removal of the

subsidy was unavoidable. I quote him:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From a discussion with Dr Wang, I learned that a third

of  POSBank's  customers, including  children,  students  and

foreign workers, have deposits of $100 or less. In fact, over

90% of POSBank's deposit base is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>

contributed   by  only  20%  of  the  customers.   Therefore,

POSBank's accounts are being subsidised. Moreover,  the  cost

of  servicing  these accounts has been escalating  all  these

years,  as  costs of ATMs, staff and premises  have  gone  up

relentlessly. POSBank could not have gone on subsidizing such

a  large  proportion of its depositors. The  House  might  be

interested  to  know that the Bank had been  considering  for

some  time the recovery of a portion of these costs from  its

customers.  Some  measures  have  already  been  taken,   for

example,  GIRO  charges on service providers and  charge  for

coin  exchange.  More  were being  contemplated.  As  I  have

indicated earlier, whether POSBank is merged or not, the days

of free services from POSBank were numbered."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Mr Chiam See Tong who spoke during the debate only

asked  for the grace period for Credit POSBank interest rates

to   be  extended  from  4  to  6  years,  although  he  then

inexplicably  proceeded  to vote against  the  Constitutional

Amendment  to delete POSBank from the Fifth Schedule  to  the

Constitution. In contrast, after hearing the debate,  Mr  Low

Thia Khiang supported the Constitutional Amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winding up the debate, Dr Hu gave this reassurance:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"DBS has assured us that it will continue to provide

services for the small depositors and indeed children  up  to

12  years,  students  up to 21 years and  full-time  National

Servicemen  will all continue to be able to  have  a  POSBank

account without a service charge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective, as I have explained earlier, was to build

on  Government's wish to develop a strong bank in  Singapore,

and  at  the same time we wanted to ensure that the range  of

POSBank's services would be maintained as far as possible. Of

course,  over time, some things will have to change  but,  by

and  large, the best features will be maintained for as  long

as feasible."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear from this debate that MPs recognised the

need  for  POSBank  to change. Some sought  reassurance  that

service  charges would not be unnecessarily raised, and  that

DBS  would  not forget POSBank's social functions. Addressing

these  concerns, Dr Hu made clear that the market distortions

had  to  go, but that the Government had arranged to minimise

painful  disruptions for depositors and borrowers of POSBank.

He  stated  that  children, students and  full-time  national

servicemen  would  continue to have POSBank accounts  without

service charge, and that for all other small

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>

depositors banking services would remain affordable.

<br><br><i>DBS</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been 19 months since the Bill was passed, and

POSBank was merged with DBS. DBS is now introducing a monthly

fee  on POSBank savings accounts with less than $500 balance.

Most  banks  in  Singapore already impose similar  or  higher

charges.  DBS  has explained that it will still  make  losses

with  the  $2  fee, which only partially covers the  cost  of

maintaining such a small savings account. Furthermore, it  is

exempting from this fee accounts of those aged below 21 or 62

and above, full-time national servicemen, as well as those on

public assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several MPs have asked the Government to request DBS to

exempt  small  savings accounts from the $2  monthly  charge.

They  include Dr S Vasoo, Dr Lily Neo, and Mr Chiam See Tong.

However,  the  Government cannot do so. DBS is  a  commercial

institution,  and  must have a free hand to  make  commercial

decisions.  DBS has a natural interest in looking  after  its

customer  base, and in ensuring that any charges  it  imposes

are  well  explained  and justified to the  public.  For  the

Government  to direct DBS as to what it should or should  not

do,  on this or any other matter of business judgment,  would

defeat  the  purpose of merging POSBank with  DBS.  It  would

prevent DBS from making decisions on commercial grounds  like

other  market  players,  and make it  difficult  for  DBS  to

develop into a strong and competitive bank, in Singapore  and

in  Asia.  Ultimately, Singaporeans will be  best  served  by

strong banks which are able to reap the benefits of scale and

technology, and thereby provide Singaporeans with affordable,

high quality banking services.

<br><br><i>The Government</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng asked whether the imposition of bank

charges  is consistent with the Government's promotion  of  a

cashless  society.  The  answer is yes.  A  cashless  society

benefits all parties - not only the banks, but also companies

and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>

individuals who can receive and make payments electronically,

using  ATMs and GIRO. Electronic payments are efficient,  and

much  cheaper than traditional transactions. But  they  still

involve  costs,  which  banks  have  to  recover,  at   least

partially, from companies and individuals who use the system.

It  is  not possible for banks simply to absorb these  costs,

and provide the services for free.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked how many Singaporeans maintain

a bank account for GIRO transactions. We do not have an exact

number, but probably every worker in Singapore receives wages

through  GIRO,  which  would be about two  million  accounts.

However,   our   main  concern  should  be  the  lower-income

Singaporeans.  This  group  is  often  unable  to  build   up

significant savings in their bank accounts. Yet they need  to

have a savings account to receive their salaries, and to  pay

utilities and telephone bills by GIRO.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to CPF statistics (as at 31st March 2000),

there  are about 341,000 active CPF members, aged between  21

and 55, earning not more than $1,500 per month. These will be

the  Singaporeans  who may face difficulties  with  the  bank

charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang also asked if the Government

considers  bank charges on lower-income families a  desirable

outcome of a free-market economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To consumers, no new fee is ever welcome. Even $2 a

month   may   be  an  appreciable  expense  for  lower-income

Singaporeans. As the NTUC has pointed out, workers  receiving

their  wages by GIRO have little alternative but to  maintain

one  savings  account, yet lower-income workers may  need  to

draw  out  most  of their salary once it has  been  paid  in,

rather than leave $500 in their account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Government intervention in the market, which Mr

Low   seems  to  be  proposing,  is  not  the  solution.  Our

fundamental  approach to improving the lives of  Singaporeans

is  to  foster self-reliance, and to avoid state welfare  and

subsidies.  The  Government does subsidise  education,  basic

health-care and the assets of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>

citizens,  particularly  public  housing.  But  it  does  not

subsidise  consumption. In Singapore  consumption  items  are

priced  at  their  full economic cost, even  essentials  like

water, electricity, telephone charges, and basic food-stuffs.

The  result  has  been to create an efficient  economy  which

generates many jobs for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach has raised standards of living for all

Singaporeans,  and reduced poverty to a very low  level.  Our

record  in  reducing poverty is far better  than  many  other

countries   which  have  taken  what  looks   like   a   more

compassionate  approach, and used subsidies  and  welfare  to

help  their poor.  In Singapore, essentials of life  are  not

free, but nearly everyone can afford them.  We have no reason

to  treat  bank  charges  differently  from  other  items  of

consumption,   and  either  have  them  subsidised   by   the

Government,  or have the Government compel banks  to  provide

services for free.

<br><br><i>A Pragmatic Solution</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then can we help lower-income Singaporeans to cope

with  the bank charges? Mr Matthias Yao of the NTUC suggested

that  in  order to meet the requirement to have a balance  of

$500  with DBS, lower-income workers could transfer $500 from

their CPF accounts to DBS as a fixed deposit.  DBS could then

consider  this  sum sufficient to waive the bank  charges  on

their  savings  accounts.   This is a  practical  suggestion.

While   the   lower-income  workers   may   not   have   much

discretionary  savings,  many of them  have  significant  CPF

balances,  even in their Ordinary Accounts.   If  they  could

mobilise  these  savings, it would help them avoid  the  bank

charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPF has indeed been planning to liberalise the rules, to

allow  members to invest more funds from their  CPF  Ordinary

Accounts,  and  even their Special Accounts, with  banks  and

private  fund  managers.  It is doing so not specifically  to

address the issue of bank charges, but for long-term reasons,

following  the  recommendation of Mr  Mah  Bow  Tan's  Inter-Ministerial  Committee  on the Ageing Population,  which  the

Government had

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>

accepted.   The objective is for Singaporeans to earn  better

long-term  returns for their CPF savings, and thus  build  up

their retirement nest-egg.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liberalisation will naturally apply to all

qualifying financial institutions, and not just to DBS.   The

details will take a few months to work out, but there  is  no

in-principle difficulty.  It should be feasible to  lift  the

requirement that CPF members maintain the full Minimum Sum in

their  CPF accounts, and to allow them to take out even their

Minimum Sum, provided it is to invest in a selected class  of

safe investments for their retirement needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Matthias Yao's proposal, therefore, is in line with

the  Government's policy to free up CPF funds, and allow  CPF

members  more  latitude to deploy these  funds  prudently  in

suitable  investments  managed by the private  sector,  where

they  can  earn  returns equal to and  better  than  the  CPF

interest rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DBS has accepted NTUC's suggestion, and has decided to

defer  the  $2 charge and $500 minimum balance on  depositors

with one savings account, until the scheme for CPF members to

take out their CPF money to deposit or invest is ready.

<br><br><i>Affordable Banking Services</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the immediate question of helping workers to meet

bank charges on small accounts, the longer-term issue is  how

banking  services  can be kept affordable, to  businesses  as

well as to lower-income Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan expressed concern that further bank

mergers  in  Singapore would lead to more increases  in  bank

charges.  Whether bank charges go up in future will depend on

the  costs  that  banks incur in various  transactions.   But

charges  should not rise simply as a result of bank  mergers,

because  the  banking  industry in Singapore  is  not  overly

concentrated.  In other words, it is not dominated by two  or

three  very,  very  big  players.  We have  enough  banks  to

compete  against  one another.  The 5 local  banks  presently

have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>

61% of the market share.  In comparison, in Australia 4 major

banks have 68% of the market share, higher than ours, and  in

Canada  4  major  banks have 70% of the  market  share,  also

higher than ours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the biggest bank is DBS which has 26%

market share, about one-quarter, while OCBC, UOB and OUB each

has about 10%, and KeppelTatLee Bank has 5%.  Even if two  of

these smaller banks merged, the new combined bank would  have

no  more  than  20% market share.  And then the  two  largest

banks - DBS and the new bank - would together have less  than

half  of  the market.  Because DBS has got 26%; the new  bank

may  have  20% or less.  So added together, it is  less  than

half.   In comparison, the two largest banks in Hong  Kong  - HSBC  and the Bank of China group - together have 55% of  the

market,  more  than  half.   In Denmark,  another  small  and

developed market, the two largest banks also have 55%  market

share.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore banking market is less concentrated than

in  most other countries.  Bank mergers should therefore  not

lead  to lack of competition and high bank charges.  However,

if  this does become a problem, and MAS finds that banks  are

not   being  pressured  enough  to  cut  costs  and   improve

efficiency,  or  they are charging excessive  fees,  it  will

consider  opening up the market further to introduce  greater

competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh suggested that we consider fully

liberalizing banking in Singapore, so that foreign banks  can

be given an opportunity to provide the full range of services

that  the  POSBank  provided  in  the  past,  with  unlimited

branches in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS is implementing a phased programme of liberalisation

in  domestic  banking.  Whether or not to liberalise  banking

fully in Singapore, and allow foreign banks to have unlimited

branches  providing  a  full range of services,  is  a  major

policy  decision  with implications for our  whole  financial

system.   However, while a liberalised banking industry  will

result  in  more  efficient and competitively-priced  banking

services, it will not enable

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>

banks to provide free or subsidised banking services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every banking service involves a cost. POSBank could

provide  the  "free"  services it did in the  past  precisely

because  banking was a closed-door industry, and banks  could

reap surplus profits from large depositors to cross-subsidise

the  small  accounts.  Now that our banking  environment  has

become  more  open and competitive, it has become  much  more

difficult  for any bank to cross-subsidise small accounts  in

this  way.   Indeed, most foreign banks in  Singapore  charge

more,  or impose higher cut-offs for accepting accounts  than

local banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also asked if we would consider

implementing an alternative to the previous POSBank,  like  a

cooperative with a banking licence, to encourage savings.  In

the  same vein, Mr Seng Han Thong asked how we could  provide

low-cost banking facilities for low-income workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must continue to promote thrift and savings,

especially among the young.  We must also ensure that workers

have  affordable banking facilities.  However, setting  up  a

cooperative  bank  may  not be the answer.   Like  commercial

banks,  cooperative  banks incur costs in  providing  banking

services.   If  they  are small, they  will  be  at  a  major

disadvantage because they will lack economies of scale, which

are  becoming  more and more vital for keeping costs  to  the

minimum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooperative banks overseas do charge for their services.

For  instance,  several  American and Australian  cooperative

banks,  commonly  known  as credit  unions,  charge  fees  on

savings  accounts that fall below a minimum sum.   They  also

levy  charges on every counter withdrawal, and on  ATM  usage

above a stipulated level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These cooperative banks justify their charges by

explaining that this is an equitable system of cost  sharing:

charges  incurred for using particular services are borne  by

these  cooperative members using the services.  They  believe

that this is fairer for all cooperative members.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other cooperative banks do not impose banking charges.

But  instead  they charge membership fees.  These  membership

fees  are  really in lieu of banking charges,  or  a  minimum

account balance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worldwide the banking industry is undergoing rapid

consolidation   and   change.    Banks   are   merging    and

rationalising, closing branches, saving costs,  and  striving

to   improve   their  returns  on  equity.   Many   developed

countries, for example, Britain, the United States, Australia

and  New Zealand, are facing the same basic question: how  to

provide affordable banking services to the masses?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Zealand is an instructive example. Its banking

industry  is  fully  liberalised, leading  to  foreign  banks

achieving  complete domination of the market.  There  are  no

more  New  Zealand banks now.  The New Zealand  Deputy  Prime

Minister Mr Jim Anderton has recently advocated setting up  a

People's  Bank, also called a Kiwi Bank, which  will  involve

the  post office, New Zealand Post [NZ Post].  The Kiwi  Bank

is  intended to service the low income, as well as people  in

small or rural towns which commercial banks find uneconomical

to service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Anderton has said that the proposal would not proceed

unless it was financially viable.  But the Kiwi Bank has  not

yet been established to be financially viable.  A New Zealand

academic, Mr David Tripe, who is a director of the centre for

banking  studies  at  Massey  University,  Palmerston   North

recently  published an article analysing the  idea.   It  was

titled "Kiwi Bank's Draft of Idealism" [New Zealand Herald  4

April 2000].  He wrote, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The focus of the Kiwi Bank proposal seems to be on the

issues of bank fees and charges, and geographic shrinkage  in

the bank's networks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a common perception that there will be no

transaction  charges  [in other words, the  Kiwi  Bank  would

provide  services for free].  The reason other  banks  charge

for transactions is because they have a cost, and the fairest

source  of recovery is from those who impose those  costs  on

the banks.  Charges are not imposed because the banks have  a

sadistic desire to cause misery.  A Kiwi Bank run through  NZ

Post will have costs for transaction services. . Who will pay

these costs?

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be cost for staff providing counter services.

It  is  hard  to  see why these costs should be significantly

different from bank costs in providing the same services.  If

we  acknowledge the cost in processing transactions, we  have

to look at how that cost is recovered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The straightforward solution is to charge the cost to

those who incur it - levy customer transaction charges.   But

that may not be regarded as acceptable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose the Government decided that the costs should

just be added to NZ Post's costs, because it is a state-owned

enterprise.   [Some  people made that  argument  about  DBS.]

Increasing  NZ Post's costs in this way would  be  likely  to

force it to increase charges for other services, particularly

postage.   This  might make NZ Post's services  uncompetitive

compared with other operators .

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, the Government could cover transaction

costs  by  paying NZ Post a subsidy.  In that case, taxpayers

in  general would end up paying the costs of transactions for

Kiwi  Bank  customers.   This would  also  give  Kiwi-Bank  a

taxpayer-financed  subsidy  to  undercut  other   banks   and

financial  institutions  against which  it  was  supposed  to

compete."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Mr David Tripe did not conclude that the Kiwi Bank

was  a  bad idea.  He said he did not have enough information

to  decide.   But he made it clear that it was not  an  ideal

solution.   There  is  always  a  cost  to  conduct   banking

transactions,  a  fact not appreciated by  many  people,  and

someone has to pay for it.  The challenge and way forward  is

to   explore  ways  to  deliver  the  banking  services  more

efficiently and at lower costs.  Subsidy is not the solution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tripe's arguments about the Kiwi Bank apply also to

Singapore.   But our situation is different from New  Zealand

and  other  developed  countries, in two important  respects.

Firstly,  Singapore  is a city, not a country  with  a  rural

population.   So  the  problem of banks  being  unwilling  to

service  rural  areas does not arise.  There  are  no  little

hamlets  and villages with a few hundred people and you  have

to open a bank branch, and there is no business and no way to

recover   the  cost.   We  are  in  cities,  in  new   towns,

concentrated,  compact, easily accessible,  easily  serviced.

Banks  can  service Singaporean customers at quite low  cost,

although not for free.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, while lower-income Singaporean workers may not

have  much discretionary savings, most have significant  cash

balances  in  their  CPF.  For example, out  of  the  341,000

active CPF members earning less than $1,500, only 35,000 have

less  than $1,000 net balance in their CPF Ordinary Accounts,

and of these 35,000, 12,000 are below 30 years old.  In other

words,  as  they work and accumulate CPF, their CPF  balances

will  grow.  If we add in their Special Account, then  lower-income Singaporeans have even more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once CPF members can take these balances out to invest

for  long-term  retirement purposes, and earn better  returns

than  the  CPF  can offer, they will become highly  desirable

customers  of financial institutions.  Banks will court  them

for  the privilege of managing their retirement funds,  which

will  be  a stable, long term source of funding and  business

for the banks.  Under these circumstances, banks will need no

encouragement to provide these "low-income" Singaporeans with

basic banking services that are accessible and affordable.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Given that there is a perception that

POSBank was given to DBS "on a silver platter", and therefore

by  extension,  there is the expectation  that  some  of  the

social features should remain at least for quite a while, can

the  DPM kindly recap the reasons for not putting the POSBank

business  out  for  tender by the other  non-Government-owned

banks?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this was fully

debated at the time the question arose why we gave POSBank on

a  "silver platter" to DBS Bank.  In fact, it was not  given.

There   was   a   valuation.   There  was  an  arm's   length

transaction.   POSBank was sold to DBS Bank for $1.6  billion

worth of shares of DBS Bank.  This was two years ago, and DBS

Bank  shares  have  not  done  badly  since  then.   So   the

Government has actually sold POSBank to DBS Bank for  a  very

fair and substantial consideration.  But the reason we did it

with  DBS, rather than with any other bank, or put it  up  to

tender,  is because we had a social objective: we  wanted  to

promote savings, we had to consider the phasing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>

in  of  the full commercial rigours of the operation  and  we

were  assured that DBS Bank would have a similar mindset  and

would  understand this.  And indeed, arrangements were worked

out  with  DBS  Bank  to make sure that their  proposed  bank

lending rates, for example, would only be phased in gradually

over  a period of four or five years.  And at the same  time,

to  compensate  for that, the tax exemption  on  the  POSBank

deposits was also going to be phased out gradually, first, on

big  accounts next year, and then on all accounts come  2004.

So there would be progressive steps forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, of course, we were encouraging

Singapore banks to merge and we wanted to build up  a  strong

national  champion, a player which would be  substantial  and

efficient in Singapore and also in the region.  And we cannot

go  round  telling  the  private  banks  that  they  have  to

rationalise  and they would look at us and say,  "What  about

you,  DBS and POSBank?"  It makes sense.  That is why we  did

it, and I think it was the right decision.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Deputy Prime Minister

whether  our  Government is still recommending  that  POSBank

upholds  its  people's  bank concept,  or  was  that  concept

dispensed with when POSBank merged with DBS?  Why is it  that

a  hugely  profitable bank, like DBS, should not absorb  what

seems to be a negligible cost?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, the

people's  bank  is an emotive idea.  The only bank  which  is

called a people's bank that I know of is the People's Bank of

China  and  it does not take small deposits.  Banks  have  to

break even.  POSBank has to break even.  For a long time,  it

was  able to do so by cross-subsidising from the big accounts

to  the  small  accounts, paying big accounts less  interest,

providing  the small accounts services for free and absorbing

the  cost, and Singaporeans tolerated it out of habit.   They

banked  with  POSBank for many years, they  continued  to  do

that.  But Singaporeans nowadays, as MPs will know, are  very

sharp, pencil-sharpeners.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>

They calculate exactly where their money goes, how much it is

earning  and they want to put their money to work  for  them.

So  POSBank was finding that by offering bigger deposits less

interest,  it was losing deposits.  Singaporeans  would  say,

"You may be tax free, but I have made my calculations, and  I

am  going  elsewhere.   Never mind  the  tax,  I  get  better

service, I get overall better return."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So POSBank was reaching a position where it was unable

to  continue  with these free services and, as I  quoted  Tan

Cheng  Bock  and  other MPs too who spoke,  for  many  years,

POSBank has been pondering this problem, what to do about  it

and  how  to  introduce charges in a way which is acceptable.

Finally,  we decided better make a break, and transferred  it

over  to DBS Bank.  There will be a transition.  There is  an

interest  in promoting savings and thrift, and in encouraging

particularly  children,  and servicing  national  servicemen.

But  it  has to move to a commercial basis of operation.   So

the  services  will be charged properly,  but  they  will  be

affordable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DBS makes so much money. Why cannot it just absorb it?

You  can ask: the Government makes so much money, why  cannot

it  absorb this?  The reason the Government is not  broke  is

because we are very careful with our money and we only  spend

it when there is a strong merit.  And similarly, with DBS, or

any other commercial operation.  Every proposition has to  be

viable.  DBS earns a profit.  Is it humongous?  Well,  it  is

bigger than it used to be.  But if you look at the return  on

equity, it is below 10%.  It is not a respectable return.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam just now had an argument with Dr John Chen

as  to  why  bus companies need to earn respectable  returns.

All  corporations have to earn respectable returns.  That  is

the  way  the  market works.  If there were no  returns,  why

should  anybody buy DBS Bank shares?  Why should  DBS  be  in

business?   If  it  is  a Government department  providing  a

service  which  is absolutely necessary, and  which  provides

returns to the whole society, like education or public

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>

housing, then we say, yes, we subsidise.  If it is a  service

which  is  provided to a person, or a family, and the  family

needs  it and benefits from it, it may be essential, but  our

philosophy is, better let the service be priced, be  charged,

the   family  can  pay.   Because  the  economy  is  properly

structured that way without distortions and subsidies,  there

are  jobs, families have opportunities, they can earn income,

and  so  Singaporeans can pay their PUB bills, SingTel bills,

even  handphone  bills.   One day,  somebody  would  make  an

argument  here  that handphones are essential and  should  be

subsidised.  We have not reached that point yet.  But that is

the direction which we have deliberately not gone and I think

it has served us well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DBS, being a commercial operation, all the more it has

to  break even and every proposition has to be viable.   And,

as  DBS has explained, even if they charge $2 on these  small

accounts,  they are not going to make money.  They are  still

losing   money.   These  are  realities  which  we  have   to

understand and acknowledge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transition is difficult because we have become used

to it.  For many years, we had it for free.  So now it is not

free.   So  although $2 is not an enormous amount  of  money,

even a bowl of kway teow costs $2, the emotional reaction  is

there.   It is understandable.  So I think it is our  job  to

try  and  help to explain, and find workable solutions  which

will  solve  the problem for the long term in a  proper  way.

The  arrangement  to have CPF members to be  able  to  invest

their  own money with banks, financial institutions  or  fund

management  and they provide them a package of  services  and

this  $2  fee, or whatever it is, becomes just a  small  item

because  he becomes a significant customer.  That is  a  good

long-term  approach  because we  want  workers  to  be  self-reliant,  we  want them to have more retirement  savings,  we

want them to make their own decisions and judge.  At the same

time,  from  MAS'  point  of view,  we  also  want  the  fund

management industry and the banks to develop rather than have

the Government to choke everything.  So it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>

is  something which we can work out and, within the next  six

months, we would be able to work out packages and we would be

able  to offer entirely reasonable menus.  And I am sure  DBS

would  not  be  the  only bank which would be  offering  such

packages.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these

funds  at  the  moment placed in the CPF  are  risk-free  and

guaranteed  by  the  Government.   In  the  instance  whereby

members  transfer  their funds into fixed deposits  with  the

banks  for  the purpose of maintaining the Minimum Sum,  will

the Government guarantee these funds placed with the banks?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is that DPM mentioned earlier that

the  returns placed with the banks would be higher  than  the

CPF  interest rates.  But there are instances whereby the CPF

Board pays higher interest rates than the fixed deposit rates

of  the  banks.  So how can we ensure that the  funds  placed

with  the banks by lower income Singaporeans will not end  up

to  be  worse  off?   In other words, to maintain  a  minimum

balance, they are actually getting a lower interest rate than

what they should be getting by leaving it with the CPF Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is the idea raised by Mr Indjerit Singh

on  a  cooperative bank.  Before I ask the question, I  would

like to declare that I am a Director of NTUC Thrift and Loan.

In  the  instance of the cooperative unions in Australia  and

the US, the surpluses made by the cooperative unions actually

go  back to the members.  In other words, although members do

have  some  form of cross-subsidy at the front end when  they

pay  the  fees,  at the end of the day, all  the  profits  or

surpluses  made  by  the cooperative union  go  back  to  the

members,  and not to a group of shareholders.  So  there  are

some  merits  to  consider that there could  be  room  for  a

cooperative bank in Singapore, Sir.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all,

there  is no Government guarantee.  The whole idea of letting

workers look after their own funds is for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>

them to decide what they are going to do with it.  Some would

be  safer options, others would be more volatile options, but

perhaps  offer a higher average return, and the worker  would

look  at  his  own profile and choose.  If you want  to  say,

"Give  me  a  guarantee, at the same time offer me  a  higher

return so that I have my cake and eat it.", I am afraid  that

is  not  possible.  If you are talking about fixed  deposits,

then  the returns from the banks would be about the  same  as

what  the CPF is able to offer, because the CPF interest rate

is  pegged  to the private sector fixed deposit  and  savings

rate.   But if you are talking about retirement accounts,  in

other  words, I take the money, I am not just putting it  for

six months, or one year, or two years' fixed deposits, but to

be  invested  for my retirement, hopefully, many  years  from

now,  then that is a different ball game altogether.  Because

then,  the bank knows that this money is available,  it  will

not  be withdrawn at short notice.  They can invest it  in  a

range of assets.  Typically, a retirement account can earn 5%-7% on average, some years more, some years less.  Whereas the

CPF offers an interest rate which is based on the savings and

fixed  deposit account.  So I think that if you  are  talking

about  retirement  accounts, then we will be  able  to  offer

higher  returns and better long term prospects  for  the  CPF

members.  And we are going to change our CPF rules so that we

allow the whole menu to be offered by banks rather than  just

one option.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, may I ask

DPM  whether  DBS or POSB has considered the  alternative  of

charging  by transactions before imposing this $2  per  month

charge?   Because for the small depositors, they merely  have

one  or  two  transactions per month.   Therefore,  they  are

actually  using  much  less bank services,  compared  to  the

bigger  depositors who have several transactions  per  month.

That may be a fairer method for the low income depositors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is whether the bank has considered

other  means  to  provide low cost or no-frills  services  to

these low income depositors.  For example, could

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>

POSBank  consider setting up a no-frills or low-cost division

to service these depositors who could therefore be charged  a

lower rate?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I have just heard from DPM that there are 5.2

million savings accounts.  Many of these accounts seem to  be

dormant  accounts.   Could there be a  rule  to  enforce  the

closure  of dormant accounts so that there could be  a  lower

cost base for POSBank?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these are

propositions  which  are best addressed at  the  DBS'  Annual

General  Meeting  of  shareholders.  It  is  fair  to  impose

transaction  charges  and I think DBS would  have  to  impose

transaction charges.  But the question is: what is the  base?

If I open an account, then the understanding must be that the

account   will   be  used  for  at  least  one   transaction.

Otherwise,  why do I have an account?  If I  buy  a  car,   I

assume  it comes with tyres and a steering wheel.  The  radio

may  be  optional,  the sun roof may be  optional.   But,  at

least,  it comes with the tyres and steering wheel.   And  if

you  are  having an account, there are certain basic expenses

which  the bank would have to undertake or incur:  first,  to

open the account, second, to maintain the records, third,  to

compute your interest, and fourth, maybe, just to do  one  or

two  transactions a month.  So it is really for DBS to decide

how  they want to charge.  If it makes better sense to charge

by  transactions rather than to charge an account  fee,  then

there  will  be other banks which will offer such a  charging

basis and Singaporeans will be able to choose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, whether we can have a lower cost bank, a basic

no-frills  bank, it is possible if you want  to  do  it.   My

sense  of  the industry is that the bigger the bank  is,  the

lower  its overheads.  And the more you try and cut this  out

and  present it as a no-frills business, the more your  costs

are  going to be.  Because you have to have a large  customer

base  in  order  to have the ATMs, in order  to  justify  the

computer  system,  in order to provide the services  and  the

call  answering  services,  and  to  be  able  to  make   the

transactions with the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>

other  banks.   If you do your own and you try and  carve  it

out, I think your unit costs are going to go up.  Again, this

is  a  market matter.  If it were true that it is attractive,

somebody would do it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is your third question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Dormant accounts.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> To have the Government close the

dormant   accounts,  I  think  that  would  have  been   very

difficult.   Banks have to keep records.   You  look  at  the

Swiss  bank accounts from the Second World War of  the  Jews.

Fifty  years  later, the grandchildren are  coming  to  claim

them.   And you want me to close them?  What will I  do  with

the  money?  If it goes to the Government, there will be  big

trouble.   So,  I  think  that  is  not  really  a  practical

solution.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, is the DPM aware that the US

government  is  subsidising low income  families  to  operate

checking accounts?  It is reported in today's Lianhe  Zaobao.

Based  on  the rationale explained by DPM on the  subsidy  of

consumer  services  and what he termed as  banking  services,

does he think that the US government is being irrational?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is whether the Government will

consider  opening up the domestic banking market by  allowing

local  finance companies to operate banking services to serve

small  depositors  who  will need just simple  basic  banking

services.  DPM does not need to worry too much whether or not

these  are  viable.  Because when you open up,  some  finance

companies may offer banking service for free. The question is

whether the Government is prepared to open up the market.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, firstly on the American

government,  it  is  not  for us to  pass  judgement  on  the

American  government, least of all, on a one sentence  report

in  Lianhe  Zaobao, as reported by Mr Low Thia  Khiang.  They

have a different approach.  We have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>

explained our rationale. Cheques are a very integral part  of

the  American financial system.  It is not a positive feature

but  it is the way they work.  They write cheques for $2, $5,

$7,  small sums, and it costs $1 or $2 to clear each  cheque.

But  that  is the way their system is and they have not  been

able  to rationalise.  So perhaps that is one reason why they

have  had  no  choice but to subsidise.  But  that  is  their

problem. We do not have that problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as to whether we would give a banking licence

to  a  finance  company, I think that is a totally  different

proposition. A bank is a bank, a finance company is a finance

company.  The reason that we have not given banking  licences

profligately  is  because  a banking  licence  carries  great

responsibility  to operate in a very tight  manner,  to  make

sure  that  the deposits are safe and that the depositors  do

not  lose  their  money.  Finance companies operate  well  as

finance  companies, but to say that because it is  a  finance

company,  let  us  make it a bank, and it  will  offer  cheap

services  - when a bank comes along and says, "I am  offering

something  very  cheap", that is when banking regulators  get

quite worried and start to look very carefully to see whether

there is something not quite right.  So I do not think it  is

a  wise  thing to say that the Government will give a banking

licence  to  anybody.  Can the person make good  use  of  the

banking  licence,  operate a good bank and  provide  services

which  are  safe  for Singaporeans?  If so,  he  can  have  a

licence.  If not, that is unwise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lowest-cost banking service most likely in the next

phase will be Internet banking, no branches, no counters.  If

there  is  a  branch, every time when you go there,  it  will

charge  you  a  few dollars just to say hello to  the  teller

because  it costs money to keep the teller there and  to  pay

rent on the branch.  You use ATMs, dial up on the Internet or

do  phone  banking.  It is growing in the developed countries

and  is something that we are studying now on how we can also

introduce it in Singapore.  The costs are significantly lower

than having the bricks

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>

and  mortar  but,  at  the same time, it is  something  which

customers will take a while to get used to, particularly  for

the  older  Singaporeans.  If you tell  them  about  Internet

banking, it is not so easy. Even I find it difficult to  pick

up  a phone and it says, "If you want to find out the account

balance,  press  1, if not, press 2 and  so  on."   But  some

people  tell  me that it is easy to do so.  I  will  have  to

learn harder, but old folks will find it even more difficult.

It  is something which we will have to allow to phase in over

time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I welcome the suggestion of CPF

money  being transferred to banks other than DBS.  But  given

the  current  situation of the many branches  that  DBS  has,

compared  to  the other banks, Singaporeans  will  be  forced

anyway to go to DBS because it is more than just savings  for

retirement.  They  need  to  use  the  bank  for  many  other

transactions.   Can  I  request  the  DPM  to  consider   the

suggestion of giving approval to banks to have more  branches

and  ATMs  before  implementing this CPF transfer  scheme  to

alleviate this problem of $2?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I have is back to the suggestion of

a  cooperative  bank.   I  think it  is  a  suggestion  worth

considering.   We  have  proven  in  many  cases   that   the

cooperative type of approach does provide an alternative  and

viable  approach for many other services. This includes  NTUC

Fairprice  in  the  food services. In  fact,  NTUC  has  been

involved  in housing and there are many other examples  where

the cooperative system has provided a viable alternative to a

commercial deal.  I think maybe we should give an opportunity

for  a cooperative bank to work and perhaps NTUC may want  to

take  up the challenge to open up a cooperative bank  if  the

Government is willing to issue a licence.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, first of all on ATMs. While

DBS  has  the widest branch network, the other banks  have  a

very wide ATM network that is equal size to DBS Bank.  If  it

is  just  a matter of withdrawing your salary which has  been

giroed  in  every  month, you can have  an  ATM  anywhere  in

Singapore, whichever bank

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>

you bank in.  I do not think that is a practical problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On cooperative banks, I have explained my position why I

do   not  believe  they  are  viable.   If  NTUC  submits  an

application,  MAS  will have to consider it  very  seriously.

But  I  do not think it is a matter which NTUC will  be  well

advised  lightly to go into.  It is very difficult to  run  a

bank. Even people who are very competent at running big banks

find  it difficult to make money. To want to run a small bank

and not to lose money, you have to be very, very confident of

yourself.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, POSBank brought

over  to DBS a deposit base of more than $20 billion.  So  if

DBS makes a 1% differential, the profit per year will be $200

million.   So how can DBS say that they are losing  money  on

POSBank accounts?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, DBS said POSBank was

profitable.   So,  if  DBS takes over POSBank,  at  the  very

least,  DBS should not make it unprofitable.  But  that  does

not mean all the POSBank accounts were profitable.  As I have

explained,  most of the POSBank accounts - even when  it  was

with  POSBank  -  three quarters of their accounts  were  not

profitable, losing money.  And if DBS takes over, it  has  to

progressively rationalise this and that is what DBS has done.

It is not possible for the bank to say, "I will provide these

services completely for free."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly every bank in the world will have a certain

degree  of cross-subsidy between the bigger accounts and  the

smaller  accounts because there is a benefit to the  bank  of

having  a  catchment of customers, and of having people  whom

you can potentially do other business with.  You can sell him

insurance, unit trusts or you can do something else for  him,

if  he  needs to buy a bank draft or to transfer some  money.

So  it  is  worth  the bank's while to carry  some  of  these

accounts  which are not profitable.  But it is a question  of

degree  -  how  much you can afford to lose on  each  of  the

accounts  and what is sensible.  And I think DBS has  decided

that  zero-dollar charge is not sensible. All the other banks

have already decided this,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>

not just the local banks, but even the foreign banks. So they

have  decided that with $2, they still lose money,  but  they

lose  a little bit less, and because they lose a little less,

they are a little bit less unhappy.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I would

just  like  to find out whether in the civil service  or  the

statutory  boards, there is a directive or feeling among  the

heads  of  the various Government departments that  the  then

POSBank,  and now DBS, should be the only bank that should be

used to bank in the salaries of the staff. The reason is that

in  the past, it was captive and some of these services  were

free.   Now  that it has changed, and given the  Government's

liberalisation of the banking sector, is there a directive?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if an employee from the civil service wishes

to  choose the bank that the salary should be banked into, is

he or she able to do so?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, as far as I know, there is no

directive and an employee can be paid his salary to any  bank

he wants.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, may I ask the DPM about his point on

the gain of the society as a whole and who pays?  We focus so

far  on the idea that either DBS absorbs the cost or the bank

account holders do.  But there seems to me to be a benefit to

the  whole  society  in  having these  accounts.  Should  not

serious  consideration be given to support  Giro  schemes  by

having Government target subsidies for low income people  who

cannot afford it?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is: given that employers and people

who  take out money from accounts also benefit by having Giro

schemes,  such as telecommunications, PUB bills, etc,  should

not they contribute to the cost of maintaining low accounts?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, is it the Government's policy to avoid a sector

of  population  not having bank accounts  which  could  be  a

fallout of this?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> First of all, the question that

somebody  must pay, why should it not be the Government?   If

it  is  desirable, yes, we want to have a charge and we  also

want  to have cash-free payments.  Is it affordable for  most

of  the population?  Candidly, yes.  $2 is not going to  bust

you.  Is it necessary for the Government to subsidise in  the

same way as it subsidises education or basic healthcare?   Is

it different from water or electricity or rubbish collection?

I  would  say no, it is not different from water, electricity

or rubbish collection.  That is your first point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On your second point that employers should pay, I fully

agree.  Whether it is Singapore Telecom or PUB, if  they  are

using the Giro services, they benefit, then they should cover

the  cost  rather the banks covering the cost.  I  understand

that  this has not been the practice in the past but it  will

have  to  be the practice in the future.  Even if they  cover

part  of  the cost of the Giro transfer - every Giro transfer

costs  money -  DBS told me that it costs about 40  cents  to

make  a salary transaction and more than that to make a water

or  electricity transaction.  Even if they do that, there  is

still  the  cost of maintaining an account, of providing  the

ATM  service for the salary earner to withdraw the money,  of

printing  the  statements,  calculating  the  statements  and

mailing  the statements.  That alone costs 50 cents a  month.

So there are basic costs which cannot be avoided.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point as to whether this would lead to a

situation  where some people will not be able to afford  bank

accounts  at all, as I have explained, because of Singapore's

unique circumstances, that is not likely to happen and nearly

everybody will be able to afford a bank account.  It  is  not

unaffordable.  If there is a very small minority  who  really

has  a  problem, then we can treat it in the same way  as  we

treat   assistance  from  the  CDCs  or  the  MCDS's   public

assistance  cases to subvent those target groups,  rather  in

general  to  say,  "Since there are a few people  who  cannot

afford it, I make it free for everybody."  I think that is  a

wrong  approach.   There are a lot of people  who  are  quite

emotionally

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>

enraged or upset, perhaps out of sympathy, but certainly  not

because  they themselves cannot afford it.  They can  afford,

but they feel that somebody else cannot.  If there is a small

group which cannot pay, we look after that small group.   Let

us  not  all  get agitated and particularly let  us  not  get

agitated  to  the extent of thinking that most people  cannot

pay, because that is not true.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I think the small

account holders are in fact upset with DBS' decision  on  the

$2  charge  simply because they have no option as  they  will

continue  to be charged because it is for Giro payments.   In

the  light that DBS is carrying a large proportion of POSBank

account holders, is it not the moral obligation and corporate

responsibility  of  DBS to ensure that it minimises  as  much

disruption as possible for a large proportion of these  small

time  account holders?  I know that the suggestion by DPM  is

that CPF could be used to offset part of this cost but we are

opening  up a new pandora's box in the sense that CPF savings

are  for  retirement and would it stop there because  we  are

transferring money to fixed deposit savings accounts?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question I would like to raise is that there

are  those  who  are self-employed who do not  have  any  CPF

savings and they are also low income earners.  How are  their

problems  going to be solved?  Fourthly, are there any  long-term solutions, other than this CPF fixed deposit arrangement

that is being made?  Since the Government has been making CPF

top-ups  from  time to time, can every Singaporean  be  given

this  top-up  as  a base so that they would have  an  account

available and all these transactions could be managed?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, first of all, whether DBS has

a  moral obligation to look after these people, the answer is

that  DBS is looking after these people, not just because  of

moral  obligation  but because they want to  make  sure  that

their  customers  are reasonably looked  after.   As  I  have

explained,  19  months  have passed  since  DBS  merged  with

POSBank

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>

and  adjustments have been made in many other areas, and  now

this  area  has to be changed. There is never  a  good  time.

Whenever  you  do  it, there is always a step  to  be  taken.

Right at the beginning, the Government has served notice  and

DBS  has  also  explained  that  some  adjustments  will   be

necessary  and  this  is  one  of  the  adjustment  which  is

necessary.   $2 is not welcome, but I have said,  it  is  not

huge and most people will find it affordable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, are we opening a new pandora's box? The

answer  is no, we are not.  We are opening another window  to

liberalise  rules  which have become really too  constrictive

over  time.   When  there  were  no  instruments,  when   the

population  was illiterate, when the financial  industry  was

not well developed, it made sense for us to say you keep your

money  in the CPF and we lock it up.  Now that the population

is  educated, now that they have more savings, now that there

are many alternative avenues of investing your money, because

the  financial industry has grown, and Singaporeans  want  to

see  their  money grow properly because they  regularly  say,

"Why  such  low CPF returns?",  I think it is right  for  us,

progressively, to liberalise and allow people to  take  their

money  out,  not  to  spend, but to invest  for  purposes  of

retirement,  either in a fixed deposit or into  a  retirement

account  or  some  other form of investments  appropriate  to

their  financial  needs.  It is how people look  after  their

retirement  needs in many countries in the world, whether  it

is  Britain, whether it is America particularly.   Even  Hong

Kong  is  now setting up what is called a Mandatory Provident

Fund,  a compulsory contribution but with the private sector,

not managed by the government.  So I think allowing banks and

financial  institutions to manage more of the  CPF  money  of

Singaporeans  is  the  right  direction  to  go  in  a   very

fundamental sort of way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo's third question is answered by his fourth

question.  He asked what about the self-employed and can  the

Government  top  up.  The answer is that the  Government  has

been  topping up.  In fact, we have just paid $250 this  year

into everybody's accounts.  This is not the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>

first  time.  So even the self-employed should have a  little

bit of money in their CPF.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, it took 19 months

for the DBS/POSB to charge $2.  How long will this $2 minimum

charge  be maintained before the full cost of the service  is

charged?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, I do not know. This is a

matter for DBS to decide.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, may I ask the Deputy Prime Minister

whether  it  is  disadvantageous for depositors  to  transfer

their  money  from the CPF to the POSBank,  because,  at  the

moment, the CPF pays more interest than the POSBank?  Second,

the DPM mentioned earlier that he would subvent a small group

who  cannot pay.  May I ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether

it  is useful to set up, through means testing, a register of

Singaporeans eligible for different Governmental subsidies so

that appropriation of help can be more effectively granted to

those merit cases?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Firstly, CPF interest rates are

higher  than  commercial  fixed deposit  rates  now.   But  I

believe DBS has offered their package as being at the same as

the  CPF  rate, which is 21/2%.  So there is no loss  to  the

depositors who transfer their money over.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of means testing so that you know who is

eligible  for various Government help is something  which  we

have to study.  It is not just apropos this because this is a

small  amount,  but  in general.  If  we  want  to  make  our

assistance  targeted to reach the people who  need  it  most,

then,  as I explained just now in answer to Mr Simon Tay,  it

makes more sense to focus our attention on that group, rather

than  to make the whole service cheap when maybe only  5%  or

10%  of  the people using that service are going to need  the

subsidy, and the rest maybe are middle or high income earners

and they also benefit from a subsidy unnecessarily.  So it is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>

something  which we have to study.  It is not so easy  to  do

because when you have a means test, you also have a cut  off.

And there will be people at the boundaries just below or just

above  the cut off and they just missed it, and you not  only

are  unjust to the person who has just crossed the  line  but

you  also  encourage people to put themselves just below  the

line,  so that they will benefit from the subsidy.  It  is  a

problem  which the welfare countries have in an  acute  form.

In  America  and in Britain, they call it the  poverty  trap.

But I think we will have to study this carefully, apropos our

overall policies on helping the very low income Singaporeans.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, the CPF solution that the DPM

talked  about  can  work for those with CPF  accounts.   What

about  those  who  do  not  have CPF accounts,  like  foreign

workers?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, this is something which we will

have  to work out.  The solution will not be as neat  and  as

satisfactory.  I think in the long-term, the foreign  workers

will  have to pay the $2 or most likely their employers  will

have to pay if the foreign workers cannot.  They will have to

sort it out with their employers.  It may be possible to have

some kind of a phasing in period.  This is something which  I

will leave to DBS.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, when the CPF

liberalises  the transfer of funds as deposits in  DBS  Bank,

will  the DPM please confirm whether this scheme will be made

available to other banks as well in Singapore?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, I explained in my main

statement that the scheme will be available to all qualifying

banks and financial institutions.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, I just want to ask

the  Deputy Prime Minister whether the Government anticipated

the  implication of an increase in bank charges when  POSBank

was merged with DBS Bank.  If so, why is it that you have  to

uproot  the CPF system to accommodate the $2 service  charge?

Was this a reactive decision?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the DPM mentioned 351,000.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> 341,000.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> 341,000 earning less than $1,500.

How  many  of  these account holders with  less  than  $1,500

income  have  $500  to  invest  in  a  fixed  deposit,  after

deducting all their CPF commitments?  I just want to know how

many would have been left out of this scheme.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not understand

Dr  Tan  Cheng  Bock's  first question.   Is  it  whether  we

privatised POSBank in order to charge people $2?  No, we  did

not.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Did you anticipate these bank

charges?  And if so, did you make preparations?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> We anticipated that it would need to

be done.  We explained it and we made the statement here.  Dr

Tan understood this, and we also had a full discussion here.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> I just want to know whether it was a

reactive response?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> By whom?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Did you have a proactive scheme to

make  sure  that  when these bank charges were  imposed,  you

would have other schemes, apart from having to uproot the CPF

system?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Liberalising the CPF.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Liberalising the CPF. I understand

now.  Liberalising CPF does not arise from DBS.  Liberalising

CPF  arises from Mr Mah Bow Tan's Inter-Ministerial Committee

on  the  Ageing  Population, which had many  discussions  and

published  a  report, which I am sure Dr Tan Cheng  Bock  has

read,  and  which explained that it was necessary for  us  to

liberalise the CPF accounts, so that members would be able to

invest  them  for  better returns, and also to  have  savings

above  the  CPF.  As a result, the Government  accepted  that

report  and so the Finance Minister, in the Budget  Statement

this year, introduced the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>

Supplementary Retirement Scheme.  And as Dr Lee Boon Yang has

said and as I have confirmed, we have also been studying ways

to   liberalise  the  CPF  accounts  itself  to  remove   the

requirement to keep the minimum balance in cash in the CPF to

allow  the whole of the Ordinary Account to be invested,  and

even  to  allow the Special Account to be invested,  although

the  Special  Account probably will have to  be  invested  in

safer assets and instruments.  That is point number one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Point number 2 is, out of the 341,000 people, how many

of  them cannot afford to have $500?  As I have said, out  of

341,000  people,  only  35,000  have  less  than  $1,000  net

balance, and one-third of these are below 30 years  old.   So

if  you ask how many have less than $500 net balance, I think

it will be even less than that.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the DPM whether in

future there will be arbitrary increases of such charges.  Is

MAS  able  to intervene in such decisions of banks  that  are

going to make charges in future?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I understand that there is speculation at the

ground  level that the $2 charge that will be imposed by  DBS

is  to  help DBS recoup its losses in Thailand  -   the  Thai

Danu  Bank.   I think this speculation is quite rampant.   Is

the imposition of this charge to help DBS?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no idea

whether  banks  will make arbitrary future  increases.   Bank

charges  are not subject to the Price Control Act.  MAS  does

not  regulate  bank  charges.  We do  not  regulate  interest

rates,  unlike  some other jurisdictions.  If any  bank  acts

arbitrarily  and  just raises its fees and  offends  all  its

customers, the customers will just march to some other place.

That is the way the system works.  In fact, I would encourage

the  customers to march to some other place, but that is  for

the market to decide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Thai Danu Bank, I am confused because I have been

asked  whether DBS is making too much money and, on the other

hand, I am being asked whether this is happening because  DBS

is losing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>

money.  The answer to both questions is that they are wrong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I wonder whether the increase

in   charges   for  banking  services,  especially   checking

accounts,  is purported to push Singapore towards a  cashless

society.  The DPM was talking about encouraging customers  to

march  away  from  the bank.  In view of  the  imposition  of

POSBank's minimum charge, would DPM encourage POSBank's small

account  holders to march out of POSBank and to open accounts

with some other banks?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I do not understand the question

about checking accounts.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Would the charges on checking

accounts push Singapore into a cashless society?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Do you mean that we ought to charge

for cheques in order to persuade people to go cashless?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> No, that is not the purpose. If the

cheapest way to do it is by cheque, then we let people do  it

by  cheque.  If the cheapest way is by cash, we let people do

it  by cash.  If the cheapest way is by Giro, then they go by

Giro or ATM.  But each one has a cost and each cost ought  to

be  reflected.  Our problem is that none of these  costs  has

been  reflected, and everything has been apparently free  and

we  have  been applying moral suasion, telling people  it  is

good  for the country, cashless society, please do this, that

and  the  other.  "Don't write a cheque, use this."  But  the

price  signals  are the other way.  It is  free  to  write  a

cheque.   The  cheque book does not cost  money.   So  people

write  cheques.   It  costs the bank $2 to  clear  a  cheque.

Eventually,  it  costs  the  customer  $2  too.    Somewhere,

indirectly, it is bundled into your charges, but you  do  not

see it.  So you do not recognise it.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to move to a position where these costs are

properly  reflected  and  I think there  will  be  affordable

alternatives when all these costs are reflected, because,  in

fact,  Singapore  is  not an expensive country  in  which  to

provide banking services.  And then customers will choose and

if  it  makes  sense to write a cheque because it  is  a  big

amount of money, you write a cheque and you send it over.  If

it is $20 on your PUB bill, you may go to the ATM and pay, or

you  may  dial up and pay and that costs 10 cents instead  of

having to queue up at the counter, which really is not just a

matter of whatever counter charge may or may not be, but  the

cost  of  taking  a  bus to go there, spending  an  afternoon

queuing  up, paying and then coming back, all of which  means

time  to you and loss in production to the economy.  So these

are  all  costs  which  have to be  reflected  and  then  the

customers and business will be able to decide.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> May I ask the DPM

whether  he  would ask MAS to use moral suasion to  tell  the

banks to look at the other way of charging, ie, to give  some

sort  of  rebates  to  customers  who  use  their  lower-cost

services?   For example, payment through the Nets  electronic

funds transfer or through Giro.  Instead, right now they  are

all  looking  at trying to charge or increase  fees  on  cash

payments or counter services or cheque payments. I would like

to ask DPM to tell the MAS to use its power of moral suasion.

It is a very powerful weapon, Sir.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Heng over-estimates the power of the MAS. It is not for MAS to tell

banks  how to charge or to tell PUB or SingTel how to  charge

and  how  to  discriminate between counter payments  or  Giro

payments  or  cheque payments.  These are  adjustments  which

will  have  to  be  made.   There is a  Committee  on  making

Singapore  a cashless society.  The Service Improvement  Unit

has   been   studying  this  for  some   time.    I   believe

discrimination  ought to be made between the different  forms

of  payments.  How to do it, whether you push one up or  push

the other down,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>

depends  whether you are currently making too much  money  or

too  little money.  If it has got surpluses, then it can give

it  as a rebate.  If it does not have surpluses, it may  have

to  make it as an extra charge.  I think that will vary  from

case to case.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> I would like to ask DPM what would be

the  Government's response towards those workers who wish  to

ask  their  employers to pay their salaries in cash  so  that

they can avoid the bank charges.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I think it would be the wrong

direction  to  go  because  if the  employer  does  his  sums

properly, he will conclude that it is better for him  to  pay

the  worker $2 to pay his bank fees than it is to  spend  the

afternoon  paying in cash.  I used to be in National  Service

and many Members used to be in National Service.  Do you know

what the pay officer does?  He puts on his full battle order.

He  brings  his  rifles.  He draws rounds.  He mobilises  two

land rovers.  He sets up a control room with a big radio  set

and then he monitors the convoy going to the bank drawing the

cash,  coming back and then he posts guards and lines up  the

troops.   The  whole afternoon is spent paying people  money.

We  did  all  this because we had one armed  robbery  and  an

officer  died.  So I do not think we really want to  go  back

there.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>

have  enough time to debate the immigration offender problem.

Members  did  not have the opportunity to seek clarification.

Today,  we  will  have more time for this.   Let  me  try  to

summarise  the  main  issues  concerning  the  harbouring  of

immigration offenders.  They are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) why do we need to adopt a tough stance against

harbouring;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) why is there a need for the mandatory jail penalty;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) why do we treat employers and harbourers in the

same way;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) why do we need the presumption clause and the due

diligence requirements;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) has there been adequate publicity on the due

diligence requirements; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) do the authorities exercise discretion when

evaluating each individual case.

<br><br><i>Why adopt a tough stance against harbouring?</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because the immigration offender problem remains

a   serious  one,  and  those  who  provide  shelter  to  the

immigration offenders contribute to it.  Despite flushing out

more than 12,000 immigration offenders in 1989 when amnesties

were  granted, after the Act was amended to provide for their

caning,  the  number  of immigration offenders  has  remained

unacceptably  high.  The  number  of  immigration   offenders

arrested has increased steadily over the years.  In 1992, the

number of immigration offenders arrested was about 6,000, but

this number peaked to about 23,000 in 1998.  Despite rigorous

enforcement,  the  number of immigration  offenders  arrested

last  year  was still high, at about 17,000.  The  number  of

employers  and  harbourers arrested has also been  increasing

over the years, reaching a high of 388 for employers and  306

for harbourers in 1999.  I have asked the Clerk of Parliament

to  circulate to you the Table (Cols. 199 - 200) showing  the

arrest figures for the various groups



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000509/20000509-HA-0720199.htm">Table - Number of Arrests from 1992 to 1999 (Cols. 199 - 200)</a><br>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>

contributing to the immigration offender problem from 1992 to

1999.   [Copies  of  document distributed to  hon.  Members.]

Members  can  see  for  themselves  the  seriousness  of  the

problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immigration offenders' problem has almost tripled in

1992  from  6,000 to about 17,000 last year.  The  number  of

illegal immigrants has actually gone up almost 30 times, from

just  382  in 1992 to 11,500 in 1999. Although the number  of

overstayers   arrested  remains  at  about  5,000-6,000,   on

average, some years are a bit higher, but that is because  of

the visa requirement imposed on a number of nationalities who

want  to  come to Singapore.  Despite that, we have many  who

came  here  on social visit pass and overstayed in Singapore.

That  is  because many of them who come from  China  and  the

Indian Continent can easily blend with our environment,  live

in  our flats together with Singaporeans and therefore it  is

difficult  to  detect  them unless  enforcement  actions  are

stepped up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these immigration offenders pose a serious threat

to  Singapore's safety and security. Indeed, Singaporeans are

concerned  about  crimes committed by immigration  offenders.

They  are  not like the law-abiding foreign workers who  come

here through legal channels to work or stay in Singapore, few

of  whom commit crimes.  In fact, in 1999, only about 11  out

of  every 10,000 foreign workers commit crimes compared to 91

Singaporeans  out  of  every 10,000.   Immigration  offenders

would  not hesitate to break our laws, having already  risked

the  penalties of mandatory caning and jail.  If they  cannot

find  a job in Singapore, they are likely to resort to crime.

Police's  experience has shown this to be so.  In 1998,  four

unidentified  Indian  nationals,  believed  to   be   illegal

immigrants,  robbed and killed an elderly couple  who  rented

out the master bedroom in their HDB flat to them.  Only about

two  weeks ago, two PRC illegal immigrants were sentenced  to

life imprisonment for kidnapping a 14 year-old female student

last year.  There are other examples.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tackle the problem effectively, it is necessary to

come  down  hard  on all the parties who contribute  to  this

problem,  namely, the traffickers who smuggle in the  illegal

immigrants - the profits are very good, I think each of  them

is  paid  about 80 to 100 ringgit for each illegal  immigrant

they  smuggle in - the illegal immigrants or the  overstayers

themselves, the person who employs them, and the  person  who

gives  them shelter.  Apart from rigorous enforcement against

immigration  offenders  and  traffickers,  we  must  make  it

difficult  for the immigration offenders to find  work  or  a

place  to stay in Singapore.  It has to be clear to all  that

the  employment  or harbouring of immigration  offenders  are

serious  offences,  and  those who flout  the  law  would  be

severely dealt with.

<br><br><i>Why Need Mandatory Penalty?</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why do we need a mandatory penalty? It is to serve

as a deterrent.  The mandatory jail penalty for employers and

harbourers  is  not a new provision.  It was  introduced  way

back  in  1984  when Mr Chua Sian Chin was the  Home  Affairs

Minister.  In moving the amendment to the Immigration Act, he

stressed  to  the House the seriousness of the  offence.   He

said  that  by  offering  the  illegal  immigrants  and   the

overstayers  shelter, the landlords were in fact  encouraging

more  foreigners to remain in Singapore illegally.   Mr  Chua

pointed  out  that  employers and harbourers  were  the  main

source  of the problem.  Parliament passed the amendment  and

imposed  a  mandatory  minimum jail  term  of  6  months  for

employers  and harbourers of immigration offenders.   It  was

meant to ensure that the penalty is sufficiently deterrent so

that  it  would  not be worthwhile for anyone  to  employ  or

harbour  immigration offenders.  Singapore is  not  the  only

country  to  use  mandatory sentences as a deterrent.   Other

countries, such as the UK and US, also have them for offences

they deem severe enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, some Singaporeans felt that the mandatory jail

penalty  was  not  enough.  After the  Government  introduced

mandatory caning for immigration offenders and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>

a  presumption clause against employers in January 1989,  the

Straits Times editorial on 4th August 1989, titled "Cane  the

Bosses  Too",  made  the  case  that  strong  action  against

employers  of  immigration offenders should have  been  taken

earlier.  I quote from the editorial:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... It (namely, the January 1989 amendments) introduced a

presumption clause to make it easier to bring such  employers

to  book.   But  it left the penalty for the  offence  itself

unchanged.  Of course, there are those who might argue that a

minimum  jail  term of 6 months plus a fine is stiff  enough.

But  is it?  In case readers have forgotten, that was the old

penalty  for immigration offenders which was not sufficiently

effective  deterrent.  Surely what is  sauce  for  the  goose

should  be  the  sauce for the gander."  [It  meant  that  we

should also cane the employers.]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Straits Times editorial in August 1989 felt that it was

unfortunate that the Government in January 1989 did not "take

the  next logical step - that is, make the penalty for hiring

immigration  offenders so painful that  few  employers  would

dare  break the law".  The Government eventually took a  more

targeted  approach, and introduced mandatory caning for  only

the  "hardcore" employers who employ more than 5  immigration

offenders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, the Sunday Times in another editorial on

29th  October  1995 headlined, "No jobs here  for  illegals",

supported tough deterrent sentences against errant employers.

The editorial said, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The assurance that the Police will crack down hard on

those  who  employ illegal immigrants will be  received  with

widespread  relief.   In  the longer  term,  tough  deterrent

measures  will  also  help to protect  foreign  workers  from

exploitation, both by racketeers and unscrupulous employers."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, they are talking about the requirements for the main

contractors  to  comply  with due diligence  requirements  by

boarding  up  the worksites.  That was the amendment  that  I

moved in 1995.  Indeed, the Government will continue to  come

down  hard  on  those  who  employ  or  provide  shelter   to

immigration offenders.

<br><br><i>Why Treat Employers and Harbourers the Same?</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next issue, Sir, is why do we treat the employers

and the harbourers the same?  Should employers and harbourers

be treated differently?  The answer should

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>

clearly be "no", because both employers and harbourers  cause

the  same  damage to the State.  Both profit from  activities

that contribute to the immigration offender problem.  Without

work and a place to stay, immigration offenders will not find

it   worthwhile,  indeed  extremely  difficult  to  stay   in

Singapore.  That is why both the Ministry of Home Affairs and

the  then Ministry of Labour had from day one in 1984 decided

to  treat both employers and harbourers in the same way.  The

Ministry of Home Affairs and the then Ministry of Labour  had

issued a joint press statement to warn against harbouring  or

employing  immigration offenders.  The statement  highlighted

that  any  person  who  harbours or  employs  an  immigration

offender  would  face  the  same penalty,  which  includes  a

mandatory  minimum of 6 months' jail.  So  that  mandatory  6

months'  jail  was  enacted then.  Employers  and  harbourers

therefore  must  be  treated  in  the  same  way  for  either

employing or giving shelter to immigration offenders.

<br><br><i>Why Need Presumption Clause and Due Diligence Requirements?</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is why we need the presumption clause

and  the  due diligence requirement.  The presumption  clause

against  landlords  is also not new.  It has  been  in  place

since 1984.  Under the clause, a person who gives shelter  to

an  immigration offender is presumed to know the  immigration

status  of  the person he has given shelter to.   Why  is  it

necessary  to  have the presumption clause?   Because  it  is

extremely  difficult, if not impossible, for the  prosecution

to  prove  that  the landlord knows that  his  tenant  is  an

immigration offender, (unless, of course, he had told someone

else  who is prepared to testify in Court, or unless  he  had

written it down somewhere).  Hence, this approach is based on

common  sense, since the landlord is in the best position  to

explain  to  the  Court why, even though  his  tenant  is  an

immigration  offender, he nevertheless does not know  of  his

illegal status.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, despite the earlier presumption clause provided

for in 1984, the prosecution still faced difficulties in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>

getting  errant  landlords convicted.  These  landlords  were

able to secure acquittals by arguing that they had checked  a

photocopy of the work permit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1991, Justice F.A. Chua, in relation to a harbouring

appeal  case, said that the social policy of the  Immigration

Act   "would   not   be  achieved  if  mere  negligence   and

recklessness on the part of the accused to enquire about  the

status of the illegal immigrant or overstayer, if he knows or

has  reason to believe that the person is a foreigner,  would

be sufficient to rebut the presumption of knowledge."  Later,

in  another  appeal  case  in 1993, the  Chief  Justice  said

clearly in his judgement that "to allow an employer to  evade

the  section  by  shutting his eyes  to  the  immigration  or

employment status of his foreign employee, would make  proper

control and enforcement impossible.  It cannot be placing too

onerous a duty upon employers in Singapore to require them to

screen  their foreign workers before employing them to ensure

compliance  with immigration policy and the law."  Therefore,

from  the outset, both the Courts and the Government were  in

agreement that our immigration laws must not be defeated by a

harbourer or employer simply making a claim that he  did  not

know  that  the tenant or worker was an illegal.  The  judges

agreed  that  our  immigration  laws  should  be  interpreted

strictly  and that it was reasonable to impose some  form  of

screening on landlords and employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was why the Immigration Act was amended in 1993 to

expressly  require landlords to check the passport or  travel

document of the foreigner he intends to employ or let out his

premises to.  The Immigration Act was further amended in 1998

to  update  and  state  clearly what  the  requirements  are,

namely,  the  landlords are required to  check  the  original

immigration  or  work passes, check that the  particulars  on

these   passes  correspond  with  the  particulars   in   the

passports,  and  if the employers are named, check  with  the

employer  to verify that his prospective tenants  are  indeed

employed by them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>

These  checks  help  to  ensure that the  foreign  tenant  is

legally  in  Singapore, either on a valid work permit,  or  a

valid immigration pass.  Landlords are required to check  the

original passes because it is easy to fake photocopies.   The

checks  against the passport and with the employer are  meant

to  reduce the likelihood that the work permit or immigration

pass is a fake.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These checks are straightforward. The setting out of

these  due  diligence requirements in fact helps  homeowners.

They  are informed exactly what they have to do to rebut  the

presumption that they knew the illegal immigration status  of

their  tenants.  It is also in the interest of homeowners  to

conduct  the  checks.  It concerns not only  the  safety  and

security  of  the  community, but  also  their  own  personal

safety.    In  the  1998 case that I mentioned  earlier,  the

elderly couple were murdered because they rented out  a  room

to   suspected  illegal  immigrants.   This  would  not  have

happened if the couple had not taken them in.

<br><br><i>Has There Been Adequate Publicity?</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question I want to address is: has there been

adequate   publicity?    There  has.    The   due   diligence

requirements are stated clearly in the Immigration Act.  They

have been well publicised over the years - in the newspapers,

over  the  radio  and television, through  Crime  Watch,  and

through  SIR pamphlets.  In July 1998, HDB issued notices  to

all flat owners and tenants who were eligible to sublet their

rooms  to  warn  them  against letting out  accommodation  to

immigration  offenders.  The notice  spelt  out  clearly  the

checks  that are required of the owners to conduct  to  avoid

harbouring  immigration offenders.  These notices would  have

reached more than 80% of all home owners in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also personally, in Parliament and on other

occasions,   publicly  stressed  the   seriousness   of   the

immigration offender problem, and how landlords can  play  an

important  part by denying them a place to stay.   The  media

has carried my comments.  In short, there has been a lot

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>

of  publicity on the seriousness of the immigration  offender

situation,  especially on our enforcement efforts and  severe

penalties.  I am told that in the last few years,  there  was

on  average,  at  least  one report relating  to  immigration

offenders  every month.  Some of these reports in  particular

reminded  the public to be careful when employing or  renting

out their premises to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government cannot ensure that every landlord knows

the  due  diligence requirements.  But it has done enough  to

publicise them.  The problem really is that people  who  read

the  publicity or who have received the HDB notices  in  1998

did not care enough to take note, as, at that time, many felt

the matter did not concern them, since they were not planning

to rent out their flats or rooms.  In fact, when SIR sent out

pamphlets recently to remind all households late last month - I  think  they sent to hundreds of thousands of households  -

some  homeowners  actually rang up SIR to complain  that  the

pamphlet  is  unnecessary and a waste of public money!   Some

even  questioned whether SIR is suspecting them of harbouring

immigration offenders.  This shows that homeowners would  not

care unless the matter affects them personally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this consistent publicity backdrop, surely it is

reasonable to expect landlords to be extra careful when  they

let out their premises to foreigners.  For landlords who have

been  prosecuted, even if they did not fully comply with  the

due  diligence  requirements of the three  checks,  they  had

fallen short.  They may look like decent people, like you and

me.  But they were not "innocent", "innocuous" or "unwitting"

landlords as some people said.  Landlords know that they  are

dealing  with foreign tenants.  Yet, many do not even  bother

to  check their tenants' passports despite the widespread and

regular  publicity  over  the  years  about  the  immigration

offenders problem.  Some merely look at photocopies of  their

tenants'  work  permits.  Others just leave the  checking  to

their housing agents.  This is not good enough.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Are   There  Discretion  and  Guidelines  Supplied   by   the Prosecution?</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the authorities have been meticulous in examining

the  circumstances and facts of every case, before a decision

is  taken  as  to  whether to charge  a  landlord  in  court.

Internal  guidelines to determine whether an offender  should

be  charged in court have been in place all the while.   Over

the  years,  the  guidelines have been fine-tuned  to  ensure

their  relevance and effectiveness.  In the last  two  years,

about half of those arrested were not charged in court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo and Mr Noris Ong asked that we should have

flexibility  and a different set of punishment for  offenders

who  have  broken the law unwittingly or due  to  negligence,

such  as fines, that they should not be imprisoned.   I  have

set  out  the  background to the various  amendments  to  the

Immigration Act to show that the law cannot just  target  the

knowing  or the intentional offender.  As it is difficult  to

prove knowledge or intention, many landlords will be punished

with less strict penalties, such as fines.  If we were to  do

that,  then the problem of immigration offenders will not  be

minimised as there would always be any number of "first-time"

offenders.  This will embolden landlords to take risks,  thus

undermining  our  comprehensive  approach  to  tackling   the

problem.   The nature and magnitude of our illegal offenders'

problem  justifies a tough approach.  As  the  law  has  been

widely  publicised over the years, landlords  should  not  be

claiming  ignorance  as an excuse, and  say  that  they  have

breached  the law unwittingly.  For landlords who  know  that

harbouring of immigration offenders is an offence, their  act

in breaking the law cannot be innocuous, because grave social

harm  can  be  caused by their action.  Singaporeans'  safety

will  be jeopardized.  If a landlord knows the checks  he  is

supposed to conduct, but only does some cursory check, it  is

then  not a question of negligence.  Rather, he took the risk

of  not conducting all the required checks.  The law is  very

clear  -  a  landlord  is supposed to conduct  the  requisite

checks spelt out in the law.  For good reasons, the law  does

not require

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>

him to have wilfully failed to conduct these checks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, with more than adequate publicity over the years,

there  is  no reason to make an exception for any  particular

group, whether they be first-timers, retirees and so on.   If

we  let  first-timers off, the law would lose its  deterrence

and effectiveness, as the vast majority of the harbourers are

first-timers.   We  would  then have  an  even  more  serious

immigration offender problem on our hands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not the first Minister for Home Affairs to

deal  with this problem.  Mr Chua Sian Chin dealt with it  in

1984,  Prof. Jayakumar dealt with it in 1989 and amended  the

law  in 1993 to make it clear as to what landlords needed  to

check.   Still that was not enough, and hence, I amended  the

law  again  in  1998  to  state the  three  checks  that  the

landlords are required to make.

<br><br><i>Amendments to the Immigration Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, Mr Goh Choon Kang asked if the Ministry

will  consider  requiring housing agents to ensure  that  the

tenants  they  introduce  to landlords  are  not  immigration

offenders.   The  answer  is yes.  Amongst  others,  we  will

consider   extending  the  due  diligence   requirements   by

landlords to those who act as facilitators or middlemen, such

as  housing agents, in the renting of premises to immigration

offenders.   But this should not be construed as  a  move  to

absolve   the  landlords  of  their  responsibilities.    All

landlords  should  still personally check  the  documents  of

their prospective tenants.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We welcome bona fide tourists to visit Singapore. We

welcome  foreigners  to  work  here.   But  we  cannot  allow

foreigners  to  enter  or stay here  illegally.   No  country

allows  that.  Neither can we adopt a casual attitude towards

those  who employ or harbour immigration offenders.  We  need

to  be clear and consistent in our message and action that we

are serious about

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>

tackling the immigration offender problem comprehensively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Landlords must play their part by diligently ensuring

that  they  do not give shelter to the immigration offenders.

It  is  not too late to start checking the immigration status

of  their tenants.  By taking an active interest, they  would

help  to  make Singapore a safer and more secure place.   And

this would also be in their own interest.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I agree

with  the  tough policy on illegal immigrants and harbourers.

But  deterrence  is effective only if the  right  people  are

punished.   I refer to the Minister's final point  concerning

landlords  and  agents.  Sir, when a landlord  relies  on  an

agent  to perform the due diligence test and the agent  fails

to  exercise due diligence, the landlord is punished instead.

That  seems to many people to be wrong.  I would like to  ask

the  Minister whether his Ministry would consider introducing

a  defence that would permit a landlord to show that  another

party  is  responsible  and that if  he  shows  this  to  the

satisfaction  of  the  court, he,  the  landlord,  should  be

exonerated  and  the agent punished.  In this  way,  criminal

responsibility is correctly placed.  This type of defence  is

not  new.  It can be found, for example, in section 93 of the

Factories Act.  I should like to ask the Minister to consider

such  a defence in this particular type of case because  much

of the public annoyance seems to have come from the fact that

they thought that the landlords were unjustly punished.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I have explained, at great

length,  why the landlords are not unjustly punished if  they

did  not perform the due diligence requirements.  The law  is

very clear that they are required to take the three steps  to

check  the  passports, the work passes and travel  documents,

and  if necessary, check with the employers of those who  are

working here.  So they ought to know because of the publicity

that we have made over the years.  To allow landlords to make

a  defence to say somebody else has done the job for them  is

not enough because

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>

they just cannot pass the responsibility of renting a home to

somebody  else.   That  is  their  home,  they  have  primary

responsibility.   But I take the point that  there  could  be

others  who assist the landlord in renting out the  property.

I  have  just  said that we will amend the law to  also  make

those  who facilitate such renting of premises liable, if  it

can be proven.

<div align="center"><b>HARBOURING OF IMMIGRATION OFFENDERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Home Affairs)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> I will take up the point about duty. May

I  ask  the Minister whether he feels that the landlords  and

employers  are in the same category because it  seems  to  me

that  a  person who may be a landlord for his home is not  in

the  business  of  renting  out  his  house.   There  may  be

differences in education, background, knowledge and  language

abilities.  The documents which the Minister referred to  may

many a time be in English, which are harder to understand for

some  people  from  foreign  countries.   Should  there   not

therefore  be a difference in the kind of duty we  impose  as

between  an employer whose business is to have employees  and

the  landlord whose business may be otherwise?  Secondly, may

I get the Minister's assurance that where a landlord has seen

the  original  documents, he will not face prosecution  where

these  documents are actually faked because  there  are  very

good  fakes  running around.  And, thirdly,  may  I  ask  the

Minister whether he will consider some sort of administrative

procedure  to  give assurance, a safe harbour  to  landlords,

such  as, for example, whether the landlords and the  tenants

could go down with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>

the  proper documents to a neighbourhood police post and have

the police witness the process of verification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, we have to treat both the

employers and the landlords in the same category because both

facilitate the stay of the legal immigrants in Singapore, one

provides  them  with  job,  the  other  provides  them   with

accommodation.   No  doubt, there are people  with  different

abilities, education background, etc, but it is their duty to

go  and get someone to help them to check these documents  if

they  themselves do not know.  Not knowing and not being able

to  read  is not a defence in this law.  If the landlord  has

checked the document that is supposed to be original but,  in

fact, it is a fake, then it would be a good defence for  him,

if  he can argue that in court, and much depends on the facts

of  the  case,  rather than for me to go and  speculate  what

would happen if that happens, and so on.  I cannot answer all

these  hypotheses.   Only  the  court  can  decide  based  on

available evidence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the procedure to get the landlords and the tenants to

go to the NPP, I do not think it is necessary.  All they need

to  do  is  to  look  at the documents,  check  the  original

passport  and, if necessary, they can call up  SIR,  or  MOM,

rather  than to create another layer in another place  to  do

such a check.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> A follow-up question, Sir. Even though I

may  call up SIR and get the assurance that there is  such  a

work  permit, there is another step to see that the person  I

am  renting to is actually the person named in the  document.

Can  I  have  the  assurance of the Minister  that  if  these

circumstances prevail, the landlord would not be  prosecuted?

Secondly, on a similar vein, the problem of the procedure  of

letting  landlords know whether they are safe is a real  one.

If  we  are not careful, landlords can be very cautious about

even  renting  premises to legal immigrants and  surely  that

will  send the wrong signal in our search for foreign  talent

in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I do not think this law will deter

landlords  who  want  to  rent  their  properties  to   legal

immigrants

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>

because it is quite easy to determine a legal immigrant  from

an  illegal  immigrant.  And if the person has  checked  with

SIR,  SIR  would  give  him the confirmation,  provided  they

produce the original copies and not the photocopies.  Earlier

when  Mr  Inderjit  Singh  asked the  Minister  for  Manpower

whether  they  could  check  with  MOM  if  they  produce   a

photocopy,  the  Minister had said they  cannot.   They  must

check  the  original  copies.  From  the  original,  SIR  can

determine  whether that is an original pass from  the  record

that is available with SIR.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> I am not sure that the Minister has

answered  my  question  about the fact  that  I  have  got  a

document  in  front  of  me without a photograph.   But  that

document  does not actually belong to that person who  is  in

front of me.  In other words, there is a permit issued  in  a

certain  name, but the actual person in front of  me  is  not

really that person.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the work permit that we are

issuing now is almost like our NRIC.  It has a thumbprint,  a

photograph, the name of the person, the name of the employer,

and so on. So all the particulars are there. Check that.   If

he  happens to be someone who has been here for a  while  and

before  he  updates to a new pass, then do the logical  step,

that  is,  check with SIR or with MOM because  we  have  only

started late last year to issue NRIC-type of work permits  to

foreign workers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister how soon will the law be amended to include  housing

agents.   Secondly, can the Minister also  elaborate  on  the

existing  internal  guidelines he mentioned  just  now  about

deciding whether to charge a person?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, we are looking at other

amendments to the Immigration Act and once we are  ready,  we

will  present a Bill to the House for approval.   Yes,  there

are  internal  guidelines.  They are not meant to  be  public

because  if they know what these guidelines are, then  it  is

easy  for  them  to find the reasons why they should  not  be

prosecuted, and we cannot

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>

allow that to be abused.  Neither can we allow the guidelines

to be undermined.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, can I ask the Minister to

clarify whether the due diligence process requires just a one-time  check to verify the documents?  In other words,  if  at

the  point of checking, the foreigner is indeed legal at that

point  of  time,  and subsequently, either a work  permit  or

visit  pass expires, then the person becomes illegal, is  the

landlord  required  to continuously check  the  documents  to

verify whether the visitor is indeed a legal visitor?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> The landlord should really check the

work permit or the work pass to make sure that the period  of

tenancy covers the period that he has a valid work pass.   If

he  does not have that, then of course, the landlord has  got

to  be very careful.  But once he has performed the check and

later on if the tenant becomes illegal, for instance, because

his employer has cancelled his work pass, then that will be a

factor  that  the prosecution will consider in  not  charging

him.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Can I ask the

Minister  whether this checking process can be  made  through

Internet, ie, the Ministry provides the database with all the

work  permit  passes so that the landlords can check  through

the Internet?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Yes, in fact, the Minister for

Manpower  said  earlier on that this will be  made  available

within  the next three months and SIR is also doing the  same

thing  in collaboration with the Work Permit Department.   In

the  first  phase, they will put the names  and  the  Foreign

Identification  Number  (FIN)  and  other  details   on   the

Internet,  and subsequently, they will put in the photographs

as  well  because  it  requires some  time  to  prepare  this

process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assoc. Prof Chin Tet Yung: Sir, I would like to come

back  to  the  point  about  responsibility  of  agents   and

landlords.  If a landlord who is not well-educated decides to

trust  an  agent  and employs an agent specifically  for  the

purpose of checking the documentation and so on, would this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>

not  be  sufficient  as  far as the  landlord  is  concerned?

Because  he  or she may not be very familiar with immigration

documents but the housing agent professes to know a lot about

that  and is familiar with the checking processes and so  on.

Surely,  it would not be right, at the same time, to  require

the  landlord  to go through the procedure once more  because

after  all,  he  or  she  is much less well-informed  as  the

housing agent and if the housing agent, who is professionally

employed  for  the  purpose,  says  that  it  is  valid   and

everything  has  been  done and he can be  assured  that  the

labourer  is a legitimate immigrant to Singapore, why  should

the landlord be held accountable?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> It will be in the interest of the

landlord to see the documents himself.  For the agent,  right

now,  there is no law that makes the agent liable.   The  law

requires   the  landlord  to  perform  those  due   diligence

requirements.  Supposing the landlord gets the agent to check

it  for  him, and in a number of such instances that I  read,

the agent then disappeared and the landlord could not produce

him,  then  there  would  be difficulties  in  assessing  the

evidence.   As to whether eventually when we amend  the  law,

and  hold  both parties liable or not, I have just said  that

this does not absolve the landlord from his liabilities.  But

in  the  end,  the  Court will have to decide  based  on  the

evidence.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> I would like to ask the Minister a few

questions.   First,  I  would like to  say  that  I  have  no

sympathy  for  people  who  exploit  illegal  immigrants   by

harbouring  them, particularly employers.   But  there  is  a

group of people who need an income and I am concerned about a

large  number of older residents. The Housing and Development

Board  permits the rental of one room or two rooms  by  these

residents and many of them are less educated.  And  going  to

the  Ministry  of Manpower or Ministry of Home Affairs  is  a

cumbersome process.  Many of them might find it difficult  to

get  access. I think it is a serious problem and we  need  to

address  that.   Could  we work out a system  for  people  to

easily verify the bona fide of those they are renting out to?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern that I have, and the Minister might

care  to  address, is that we are criminalising  a  group  of

people  who are, in a way, just renting out their  house  and

who   may  be  unwitting  at  some  point  because  of  these

cumbersome  problems of trying to verify  the  bona  fide  of

these  people they are renting out to.  And to send  them  to

imprisonment  is,  in  fact, a very  heavy  penalty.   I  was

thinking whether there could be an option of either  a  heavy

fine  or  imprisonment, if it is proved that they are  really

harbouring  them, and also whether the Court could  be  given

the discretion to establish this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, for elderly residents who are really ignorant,

could  the  CDC  office or the Housing and Development  Board

levy  an  administrative charge on these people who  need  to

rent  out,  particularly  older residents,  and  provide  the

service   to  establish  the  verification  of  the  tenants'

background?   The respective Departments can  deal  with  the

Ministry  of  Home  Affairs or the Ministry  of  Manpower  to

establish the background of these people they are renting out

to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the thrust of Dr Vasoo's

question  is:  let us pass the responsibility  of  all  these

checks to somebody else and get the HDB or whoever to levy  a

fee.   They cannot pay the $2 DBS charge. I think if agencies

levy  a fee, we are going to have a lot of trouble with these

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as I have said, this is a serious point. No

landlord can disclaim responsibility. The law is very  clear,

regardless of whether he may be less educated, poor or needy.

Being  poor  does not mean that he can be exempted  from  the

law. Our laws must be applied to everyone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave a long answer just now as to why there is no such

thing  as  an  unwitting  offender.   The  Member  said   the

procedure is cumbersome and, therefore, the landlord did  not

want  to check.  Then he is not unwitting.  He is a party  to

it to allow this to happen.  On the system to verify, I think

the easiest thing is to look at the documents himself.  If he

does  not know how to check, ask his neighbour.  That is  the

simplest thing to do.  Or he can make a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>

phone call to SIR or MOM.  He can still call and verify.  But

at  the  same time, he must ask for the piece of  paper  that

supports  this  verification from SIR or MOM.   Do  not  just

depend  on the phone call and later on say that he  did  call

and  there was no evidence of that.  Primarily, the  landlord

is responsible regardless of his social status.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Is the Minister aware that to just get

through  to  the  Ministry of Home Affairs  and  Ministry  of

Manpower is a tremendous effort?  I have tried sometimes  but

I  had  great difficulty in getting through.  How about those

who  are  less educated who cannot get through?  And if  they

get  through, how are they going to verify?  Who is going  to

substantiate that they have in fact checked?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the Minister for Manpower has

just  told me that it is not a fair statement to make because

he  himself called his own office, MOM's Work Permit  Office,

and  he  could get through and he found the girl very  polite

and  very  helpful.   Of course, we must bear  in  mind  that

people do not just call SIR to check on the particulars of  a

foreigner.   People  call  SIR for all  kinds  of  enquiries,

whether  it  is  about passport, immigration pass,  permanent

residence  status,  social visit status,  visas  and  so  on.

Although there are many phone lines, during the peak periods,

they  can  be all occupied.  If they cannot get through,  try

again.   And if they still cannot get through, it  is  not  a

difficult  thing  to go to SIR. SIR has such  a  nice  office

environment,  very  friendly and all the signposts  are  very

clear  on  how to get to a particular place, and it is  right

next  to an MRT station.  If Dr Vasoo says that these  places

are   not  accessible,  I  would  not  accept  that,  because

Singapore is a very small place.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I have two questions. Firstly,

in   a  situation  where  the  landlord  has  exercised   due

diligence,   verified  the  documents  of  his  tenant,   but

subsequently,  the  tenant might bring his  friend  into  the

house  to  stay with him or sublet it without the  landlord's

notice,   will   the   landlord  be  prosecuted   under   the

circumstances?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Minister explained just now why there is a

need   for  mandatory  sentence  to  deter  would-be  illegal

immigrants.   But looking at the statistics, it seems  to  me

that  it  is  not  really effective even with  the  mandatory

sentence.   I  wonder  why  we want  to  impose  a  mandatory

sentence  rather than allowing the Court to decide  based  on

the  circumstances. Can we not trust the Court to  decide  on

the  different situations?  I think the Court will know  what

is  the  policy  of  the Government.  If it  is  really  that

serious to deter illegal immigrants, I believe the Court will

impose the necessary punishment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I cannot answer Mr Low's first

question directly whether or not the landlord will be  liable

when  the  tenant brings in an illegal immigrant and  lets  a

room  out  to  him.   Much  turns on the  facts  whether  the

landlord  is aware of this taking place and turning  a  blind

eye  to  it.   Because if the landlord turns up and  collects

rent,  and  he  rents it out to two persons and regularly  he

sees  many other people living there, then he has reasons  to

suspect.   In  fact, he should question his  tenant  who  are

these  people,  how  long they have been  there,  etc.   Much

depends on the evidence available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low said that the law is not effective even with

mandatory sentence.  I do not agree with that. Does  he  mean

to  say  that  the law is not deterrent enough  and  the  six

months'  jail is not enough?  Is he suggesting that?  Already

with  the minimum six months' jail, everyone is talking about

this  being too harsh.  Supposing we raise it higher,  people

will  feel  great pain.  I do not think that is the  problem.

The  point  is that for the illegal immigrants, Singapore  is

such  an  attractive place.  We have economic growth  whereas

many  countries where they come from do not have  employment,

or maybe if they have, the pay is not as good as Singapore's.

And  they find it attractive to come here, even to the extent

of  borrowing  money,  thousands of  dollars,  pawning  their

jewellery or whatever, and selling their homes and so on,  to

come  here  because they think they can make a better  living

here, earn,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>

save  and bring home the money.  It is a great attraction  to

come  and  work  in  Singapore.  For the  landlords  and  the

harbourers,  as  I have said, the due diligence  requirements

were  not  as  clearly  spelt out as  in  1998.   So  despite

prosecution  efforts,  many of the harbourers  and  employers

managed to get off.  But now with stricter enforcement by the

Police  and  SIR,  we see a larger number of  harbourers  and

employers  being arrested in the last three years.   This  is

because  we found the situation untenable.  With so  many  of

them coming into Singapore illegally and if our landlords and

employers continue to harbour and employ them, then  we  must

take tough action.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, as regards landlords, the

landlord  does  not  know  and  has  no  knowledge   of   the

subletting.   On the question of deterrence,  if  the  court,

even  without mandatory sentence in the legislation, were  to

impose very heavy penalty, is that not deterrent enough?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the minimum sentence stated in

the  legislation is to give the court an idea of what is  the

minimum we expect of the sentence.  That is why we have it in

the legislation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, the Minister mentioned that the

law  will  be reviewed.  Can I suggest that in reviewing  the

law,  maybe  we  want to consider passing  the  onus  on  the

eligibility to rent a room or a house back to the tenant,  or

to   the  employer?   And  to  implement  a  system  like   a

certificate  of eligibility where MOM or SIR actually  issues

for  potential  tenants  a  certificate  of  eligibility  for

foreigners,  and  a way to cross check travel  documents.   I

think,  in  this way, we probably pass back the onus  to  the

tenant.   We  separate  the  landlords  from  employers   who

actually employ illegal immigrants.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> What Mr Singh is suggesting is that we

add  another  layer for the landlord to check the certificate

of  eligibility.  Already with three checks, he  cannot  make

it.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, we will cut the three checks to

just  one  check, ie, the certificate of eligibility,   maybe

the  certificate against the passport.  I think that  is  all

that needs to be done.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I think it cannot be done because if a

work permit can be forged, an eligibility certificate will be

more easily forged.  So it is better that a landlord looks at

the  original  documents, ie, passport, work passes  and,  if

necessary,   call the employer and the SIR or MOM.   I  think

that  is a safer bet for him than to create another layer  of

bureaucracy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, further to Mr Inderjit Singh's

point, I think what he meant was that if we have a system  to

allow  a  person  to  go to the Internet and  do  an  on-line

search,  one  can  actually download the information  of  the

person  being  checked.  That information is on the  computer

and you can have a print-out.  And that will be the basis for

proof  or  evidence that you have done the necessary  checks.

Probably this can be done.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Yes, that is one piece of paper

showing  that he has checked with SIR or MOM.  There are  two

other  checks. He has got to look at the person's pass,  look

at  him,  look  at his passport, and compare the particulars.

If  he  does not do that, it is not enough just to depend  on

that website print-out from SIR or MOM.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, the explanation by the Minister seems

more  cumbersome, in the sense that landlords have got to  do

several checks.  What I would like to tell him is that  there

are  cases  which are genuine.  These people, to  an  extent,

carried  out  these checks.  Having done this, there  is  the

question  of getting some verification.  If they  cannot  get

that  verification because of the problems of getting  access

to  the  Ministry, we are, in fact, punishing some  of  these

people  unnecessarily.   Could we  not  give  the  court  the

discretion of imposing either a heavy fine or jail?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I have already said that there

will  be  no such discretion for imposing a fine, because  we

need  a mandatory jail sentence.  And even with the mandatory

jail sentence since 1984, we have not solved the problem.  So

let  us not try to find another way to give them a fine.   Dr

Vasoo  says  that the procedure is cumbersome.  The  Minister

for  Manpower  explained earlier, and I also reiterate  here,

that  it  is  quite simple to go to SIR.  Go to Lavender  MRT

station,  get  out there, go to SIR and get a print-out  from

them.   That is his check with SIR about that person whom  he

is wanting to rent his properties to.  But he must also check

his  passport and work pass to make sure that it is the  same

person.  He cannot shift the responsibility to anybody.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, how does a person prove that he

has checked the passport and the original documents?  Does he

need  a witness in case the person turns out to be an illegal

immigrant?   The  witness can say,  "Yes,  I  have  seen  him

verifying."

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, if he has looked at it, checked,

confirmed, etc, and he makes a copy for himself, then he  has

performed the due diligence requirement.  Eventually,  if  he

is  still taken to court and the prosecution did not  believe

him,  then  the court will have to decide based on  available

evidence.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether

everyone  is  required, under the law, to report  an  illegal

immigrant if he or she should encounter one?   Second,  if  a

medical doctor encounters an illegal immigrant patient, is he

bound under the same ruling?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the Immigration Act does not

require  the  reporting  of  an  illegal  immigrant  by   any

Singaporean  sighting  an  illegal  immigrant.   In  general,

Singaporeans cannot tell the difference just by looking at  a

person.   They  have  to  look at his papers,  ie,  passport,

passes  and  so  on  before they can determine  whether  that

person's stay here is legal or not.  So the Immigration

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>

Act  does  not  require reporting to be done.   But  I  would

suggest that they do so for their own safety, if they know of

any.   If  they  have people in the neighbourhood  whom  they

suspect  to be illegal immigrants, then they can give  SIR  a

call  or  make  a  police  report, and  they  will  do  quiet

investigations.   Police will not just raid  the  place  just

because somebody makes a phone call, and then the Police will

be  running  around  raiding  houses.   They  will  do  quiet

investigations and after they have determined the facts, they

will do something about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for doctors, I think the doctors have their own code

of practice, and it is for them to decide.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, I just want to follow up again because I

have  quite  a lot of elderly residents who do rent  out  one

room  of their flats from time to time.  As I have said, many

of  them  are not that literate.  I would like to ask whether

we could make it easier for them if we have a one-stop centre

where  they can ask their neighbourhood leaders or Residents'

Committee leaders to go and help them to verify.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Ask the MP?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Or the MP. And, finally, they have to answer

or be charged.  Because he says, "Look, he gave advice."

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the landlord has to perform the

due  diligence requirement.  If he cannot do it, he  can  ask

anyone to assist him.  As I said, he can ask anyone to assist

him to verify, and the court will take that into account.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, as I look at the number of

illegal immigrants here, there are 28,000.  Of course, if  we

add  the  overstayers, it will be about 32,000.  Compared  to

the  number  of foreigners here, this is a small  percentage.

But, in absolute numbers, this is quite large because, at the

moment,  there  are 28,000 illegal immigrants  in  Singapore.

And  even  if  two of them stay in one household,  there  are

14,000 households at risk at the moment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>

This  is  quite  serious to landlords and  people  who  allow

illegal immigrants to stay here.  Sir, I am wondering how did

so  many of them slip through our immigration checkpoints and

get into Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards overstayers, I understand. Of course, they

came  in legally but overstayed, and then they became illegal

immigrants.  But for first-time illegal immigrants,  how  did

28,000 slip through our immigration checkpoints?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, Mr Chiam has said in this House

that  he  cannot add, and I believe him.   In the Table,  the

first  row  is Immigration offenders (1) =  (2) +  (3).   (2)

means row two.  (3) means row three.  So row (1) = row (2)  +

row  (3).   Sir, he added them all up.  But do not worry,  Mr

Chiam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, my arithmetic was not quite

correct, but I was looking at the wrong column.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Wrong row!

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> How did the illegal immigrants manage

to  come here?  As I have said, Sir, our checkpoints are very

safe,  but  every  day illegals attempt  to  come  in  either

through  the  Woodlands or Tuas Checkpoints.   They  hide  in

lorries,   modified   cars   with   compartments,   in    the

undercarriage,  behind the seats and so on.   There  are  all

kinds   of  ways  and  means  for  these  people  to  smuggle

themselves  in,  because  it  is  quite  lucrative  for   the

traffickers to bring illegal immigrants into Singapore.  I am

told  that  for  every person they bring in,  they  can  make

between  80 - 100 ringgit.  If they smuggle three  each  time

and two runs a day, they will be quite rich.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that way, the illegals also try to come in by

boats.   They  take  a speedboat and rush  through  our  very

narrow  waters between Malaysia and Singapore, and  in  three

minutes they are there before the PCG could even reach  them.

And that is why we have deployed more than 50 boats every day

to deal with these people who come in by boats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br>4.14 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill before the House aims to bring the Multi-level Marketing and Selling (Prohibition) Act up to date and,

at  the  same  time, make it more responsive  to  changes  in

technology and the business environment.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Act was first enacted in 1973. The purpose

of  the  Act  is  to prohibit the objectionable  features  of

pyramid  selling.   These are schemes where participants  are

required  to pay a lump sum upfront to join, but the  driving

force to recoup their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>

upfront  payment is the recruitment of more and more members,

as  opposed  to  the  selling of  more  and  more  goods  and

services.   To illustrate, members of the House  will  recall

the  recent S888.com case, where participants pay $27,000  to

join  the  scheme, and receive a fixed commission  of  $3,000

from  S888  for every additional member they recruited.  This

right  to receive the commission subsists down to five levels

for each participant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such schemes will ultimately collapse, because the

supply  of willing recruits will run out.  When that happens,

many participants will lose their upfront payment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Act needs to be updated, Sir. The

definition  in the Act on multi-level marketing  and  pyramid

selling  is too narrow.  The penalty provided for  under  the

Act is inadequate.  In coming up with the Amendment Bill, the

Ministry has consulted relevant industry parties and  studied

relevant  trends  overseas.   Parties consulted  include  the

Direct Selling Association of Singapore (DSAS), the Consumers

Association  of Singapore (CASE), the Monetary  Authority  of

Singapore (MAS) for inputs on the insurance industry and  the

Trade  Development  Board  (TDB) for  inputs  on  franchising

schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now go through some of the amendments. The

thrust of the amendment in clause 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c)  is  to

have  a  general  definition  of  multi-level  marketing  and

pyramid selling in the Act.  This would remove the rigidities

in  the  current legislation, such as a participant  must  be

required  to  share his commission with another  participant,

before the scheme is deemed as pyramid selling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, clause 2(d) of the Bill will allow the

Minister  to  exclude,  by  order,  legitimate  schemes   and

arrangements from the ambit of the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 to 6 provide for the increase of the maximum

fines  prescribed for the offences from $30,000 to  $200,000.

Clause  7  introduced a mechanism whereby a  court  needs  to

impose a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>

penalty  in addition to any fine and/or imprisonment  ordered

as  punishment for an offence committed under section 3(2) of

the Act.   The amount of the penalty takes into consideration

the  amount of profit made by the promoter or participant  of

an  illegal  pyramid scheme and caters for a situation  where

the  maximum of $200,000 fine would manifestly be inadequate.

This  is  critical  to  ensure that  the  Act  serves  as  an

effective  deterrent  to potential offenders.   The  proposed

amendment will make our legislation more responsive in acting

against   pyramid  schemes.   At  the  same  time,  to   give

assurances  to  legitimate  businesses  that  they  are   not

unwittingly  caught by the Act, the Ministry has crafted  the

first Exemption Order.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The businesses to be exempted under the first Order are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) insurance businesses registered or approved by MAS

under the Insurance Act and the Insurance Intermediaries Act;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) master franchise schemes which satisfy stated

conditions;  and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) direct selling schemes which satisfy the following

conditions will also be exempted from the Act:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the benefit received by any promoter or

participant   is as a result of the sale, lease,  licence  or

other distribution of a commodity  and not as a result of the

recruitment of additional participants;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the promoter of the scheme shall not knowingly

make  false or misleading representation or omission relating

to the scheme or the commodity;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the promoter shall not make any representation on

the  benefits  of  the  scheme other than  the  sale,  lease,

licence or other distribution of a commodity; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, there should be a clearly stated policy on

refund or buy-back guarantee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order will come into effect on the same date as the

new Act. At the same time, we will also take this opportunity

to  transfer  the  Act from the Ministry of  Finance  to  the

Ministry of Trade and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>

Industry, as the Act deals mainly with trade transactions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill before the House today reflects the

determination  of  the Government to act  against  fraudulent

schemes  in  the market.   Our legislation is, by and  large,

adequate  in  this area.  Where necessary,  we  will  improve

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CASE has informed the House earlier that they will be

putting  up  a proposal for a Fair Trading Act for Singapore.

CASE  is currently studying the Fair Trading Acts adopted  by

countries  such as Australia and New Zealand. MTI will  study

CASE's  proposal when it is ready.  We will, of course,  have

to bear in mind the principles of minimal intervention to the

market  and caveat emptor.   If we do over-regulate,  we  may

stifle  innovation and push up compliance cost for businesses

which  would  eventually  be borne  by  consumers.   We  must

therefore  weigh the pros and cons.  Ultimately, the  key  is

for the Government to promote competition in the market place

and for consumers to stay alert and not be exploited.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like

to speak in support of this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister of State has explained, the Bill is

meant  to  enable the Government to prohibit pyramid  selling

schemes under a wider form of definition.  This is to protect

unsuspecting persons from being recruited or made use  of  by

undesirable pyramid selling promoters.  I also agree with the

change  of the maximum fines from $30,000 to $200,000 as  the

value of the benefit from such schemes has escalated over the

years.  Therefore, a higher limit of fine is needed to act as

a more effective deterrent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I support this Bill, I would like to take this

opportunity to pose a few issues to the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first query is to ask the Minister what form of

protection  or  control  can his  Ministry  exercise  if  the

pyramid selling

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>

scheme  is  perpetuated through the Internet.  If a syndicate

operates  from  another country and  uses  the  Net  to  sell

pyramid  selling schemes in Singapore, how are  we  going  to

take  such  overseas operators to task?  With more  and  more

Singaporeans being wired up through the Internet,  goods  and

services  can  now  be  easily transacted  through  the  Net,

without  the  promoters themselves of  such  pyramid  selling

schemes being physically present in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second issue I would like to pose to the

Minister is whether his Ministry has plans to look into  some

form   of  competition  law  or  anti-trust  law.   In   some

countries,   there   are  laws  that  prohibit   monopolistic

practices,   or  unfair  competition  or  unfair  competitive

practices.   For  example,  if a  certain  group  manages  to

monopolise or corner a specific product or service, then they

can  manipulate  the market or charge unfair  prices.   Under

such circumstances, the consumers will suffer.  This form  of

undesirable  trading practices is no different  from  pyramid

selling  schemes  as  ultimately  the  end-users  are   taken

advantage of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister kindly enlighten the House on the above

issues?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, even as I rise to support the

intent  of  the amendments, I am mindful of the proliferation

of  trading and marketing arrangements in cyberspace  in  all

form  and  manner  beyond the now conventional  B2B  and  B2C

relationships.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, and against clause 2, which seeks to

broaden  and  simplify  the definition  of  "pyramid  selling

scheme   or   arrangement",  the   incidence   of   unwitting

participation  could in fact be raised.   This  really  boils

down to ignorance of the technical definition on the part  of

an increasingly Net-savvy population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Government's philosophy of not over-regulating. However, I believe there is plenty of room for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>

guidance,  counsel  and  clarification  for  the  man-in-the-street.  Let me explain the challenges.

<br><br><i>Online retailing and marketing schemes emanating offshore</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague, Mr Leong, has alluded to, this poses a

challenge.  I believe many Singaporeans have e-mail  accounts

offered  outside Singapore and are frequently presented  with

special  deals.  When a Singaporean participates  in  such  a

scheme,  it seems straightforward enough.  He is a  wise  and

prudent shopper.  Suppose he is asked to email as many of his

friends  as possible to urge them to join this shopping  club

for a small fee so as to take advantage of this privilege  as

well.  In return for his effort, he gets credits which he can

utilise  to secure other goods and services.  And the  scheme

goes on with more recruitment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, would this now be considered as pyramid selling?

This  is  not  your typical get-rich-quick  scheme  with  its

telltale "make some easy money" carrot.  Given the fact  that

many  of  these  schemes  are truly globalised  and  somewhat

outside the jurisdiction of Singapore, how would such schemes

and perpetrators be treated?

<br><br><i>Need for public education</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where it is not clear cut, can Singaporeans get access

to  some counsel and advice?  These efforts can be Government

driven  or  supported.  For example, the US Postal Inspection

Service has posted on its website, a simple test of a  scheme

whether  the basis of the promotion is the sale of a  product

at  the  retail level, or an emphasis on recruiting more  and

more distributors to help one increase one's income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, the Federal Trade Commission provides useful

tips on its website, along with toll-free lines for consumers

to  file complaints, and publishes brochures as well on these

and other consumer matters.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in future, the Internet is likely to be the theatre

where the greatest selling scams will be played out, and home

to  various pyramid schemes.  Given this inevitable  scenario

and the limitations to bring such perpetrators to justice, it

would  appear  that consumer awareness is one of  the  better

defences.   Towards  this  end, I  would  like  to  urge  the

Minister to devote more resources for public education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the amendments.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, I would like to thank Mr Leong

Horn  Kee and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua for their comments and support

for the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, both Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua asked

what  if  the pyramid selling scheme originates from overseas

via the Internet. The first question is whether this will  be

covered  under  the  law.  Sir, if a pyramid  selling  scheme

originates  from a foreign jurisdiction, the  Act  would  not

apply  to affected persons and activities occurring overseas.

However,  if  a Singaporean takes part in such a  scheme  and

subsequently tries to perpetuate the scheme within Singapore,

then our law would apply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, I would like to respond to Mrs Lim Hwee

Hua's  second  point, ie, is there a danger that Singaporeans

may  unwittingly  take part in such a scheme that  originates

from  overseas.   Sir, if Singaporeans take part  in  such  a

scheme  and perpetuate the scheme in Singapore, they will  be

covered under the law.  Therefore, it is very important  that

Singaporeans  are fully aware of such a law and  do  not  get

themselves involved in such a scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully, following the passage of the law in this

House  today,  the  media and the consumer group  would  play

their part in helping to create public awareness.  I want  to

assure  both Members that even though the amended  law  would

cover all forms of pyramid selling, as I have mentioned in my

speech  earlier,  the  Minister  can  provide  for  exemption

through an order and the first Exemption Order will come into

effect at the same

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>

time  as the Act.  This means that for Singaporeans who  take

part  in  any pyramid selling scheme, as long as  the  scheme

aims  to  generate benefit for the members  not  through  the

recruitment of additional members but through the selling  or

leasing  of  more  commodities, as  provided  for  under  the

Exemption Order, they will be all right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee brought up a broader issue of

competition law and anti-trust law.  His concern  is  whether

some  businesses  may  monopolise the  market  and  therefore

introduce  undesirable  selling tactics  which  could  be  as

undesirable as the pyramid selling scheme.  Mr Leong's  point

is  well  taken.   Over  time, with advances  in  technology,

competition  will  get  keener and companies  are  likely  to

introduce more new ways of doing business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua also made the same point that besides

B2C and C2C, there will be new business models.  This morning

I  was  at  an  Internet conference and I  commented  to  the

participants that in the past we used to talk about B2B, B2C,

C2C.   Today,  companies are introducing  new  concepts,  for

example,   E2E   (end  to  end),  or  M2M   (marketplace   to

marketplace).   We  do  not know what kind  of  new  business

models  will be introduced tomorrow.  But what I do  know  is

that  from  A2A  to Z2Z, there are 676 possible combinations.

Therefore,  we  can all be rest assured that  in  the  coming

months  and  years, many companies will be  thinking  of  all

kinds  of  creative ideas in order to gain advantage  in  the

marketplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the part of the Government, we have basically

taken  three  types of measures.  The first measure  we  have

taken is to introduce competition in the marketplace so as to

reduce the possibility of a monopoly situation.  We have done

so  with the telecommunications market; the financial  market

is  now being liberalised progressively; and my Minister  has

announced  the impending liberalisation for power generation,

water   desalination,   and  so  on   and   so   forth.    So

liberalisation is the way to go to ensure that there will  be

enough healthy competition in the marketplace.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as we liberalise our market, we are also

introducing  measures to regulate the healthy development  of

various   sectors.   Take,  for  example,  in  the  area   of

telecommunications, we have IDA as the regulatory  authority.

If  any  business  or company wants to enter this  particular

market, it will have to apply for licences and abide  by  the

rules  of  the  industry.  This will hopefully  minimise  the

possibility   of  undesirable  market  practices.    However,

notwithstanding the setting up of a regulatory  body,  it  is

true that the marketplace may still see the emergence of some

of these undesirable anti-competition measures.  For example,

in   some  European  countries,  they  set  up  a  regulatory

authority,  the  NRA  (National  Regulatory  Authority),   to

regulate various vertical sectors within each country.   And,

at the same time, they have a National Competition Commission

that  will  look  into anti-competition measures  across  all

sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Singapore, over time, as we continue to

liberalise  our  market,  as  we  continue  to  set  up  more

regulatory bodies, I think it is also relevant for us to look

into  the need for the introduction of a competition  law  as

well as the need to set up a Competition Commission.  So  the

Member  may  be pleased to hear that this is an area  MTI  is

actively looking into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

for  a  new  town  such as Sengkang, with  more  than  20,000

dwelling  units  completed to date, has only four  outpatient

clinics.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is part of HDB's plan to provide sufficient amenities

and  commercial facilities in the development  of  any  town.

While  HDB  does  not  have an average outpatient  clinic  to

dwelling  unit  ratio in the planning of new  town,  it  will

ensure  that there is a range of facilities such as  clinics,

eating  houses, markets, schools, etc. in every town to  meet

the needs of the residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Sengkang Town, there will be 3 commercial centres to

serve  residents living in the eastern part of the  town.  In

each  of  these developments, there will be a full  range  of

facilities.  One  commercial centre  at  Rivervale  Plaza  is

already  completed and currently has 4 clinics. The  other  2

commercial centres along Rivervale Drive/Crescent and in  the

town  centre will be completing at the end of the  year  2000

and in year 2002 respectively.  More clinics are expected  to

open when these 2 centres are completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has also provided some commercial facilities in

multi-storey car parks. There will be 2 more clinics in the

multi-storey car parks at Anchorvale Link and Anchorvale

Road, which will be completing within the next three to six

months. HDB is also currently looking into the feasibility of

providing some clinics at the void decks of HDB blocks as

suggested by the Sengkang Town Development Steering

Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the Member that HDB will continue

to assist the Sengkang Town Development Steering Committee to

bring about timely provision of facilities, such as clinics,

in Sengkang.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33. <b>Mr Goh Chong Chia</b> asked the Minister for

Information and the Arts (a) whether the construction of  the

National  Arts Centre is within the original planned contract

period;  and (b) what will be its final contract sum compared

to its original cost estimate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh is referring to Esplanade-Theatres on the Bay,

which was originally planned for completion in February 2001.

Due  to  complexity  in  the  design  and  construction,  the

completion date is now targeted for November 2001. The centre

is expected to be operational by July 2002.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project was originally estimated to cost $513

million  in July 1995 when it was approved. This was  revised

to $595 million after the superstructure tender was closed in

September 1997.  The increase in project cost of $81  million

or  16%  was caused by inflation in construction cost, higher

costs   for  basement  construction  and  higher   costs   of

preliminaries  for the complex works.  A large  part  of  the

cost   increase  was  due  to  the  site's  very  poor   soil

conditions,  the Esplanade's unique structure and  additional

building  elements which are required to respond to the  site

conditions,  including  sound  insulations  from  underground

trains.   The additional costs had to be incurred  to  ensure

that the quality of the arts centre is not compromised.

Environment (ENV) on the issue of traffic noise. There is  an

on-going study to look at the noise impact from road  traffic

and  MRT  trains. This will review existing noise  standards,

recommend  noise abatement measures and land-use  designs  to

mitigate  noise  impact on residents.  The issue  of  whether

sound barriers should be erected along expressways will hence

be covered in the study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew has mentioned two residential developments at

Hillcrest Arcadia and Arcadia Gardens, which will be affected

by  the  widening  of the Pan Island Expressway  (PIE).  Even

after   the  widening,  the  residential  blocks   in   these

developments  will be about 50 to 100 metres  away  from  the

expressway.   This  setback is well  within  the  recommended

building  setback of 30 metres imposed by Urban Redevelopment

Authority  (URA). The Land Transport Authority  expects  that

the noise level in these two developments would remain within

the level prescribed by the Pollution Control Department from

the Ministry of the Environment.

<div align="center"><b>INVESTOR PUBLIC EDUCATION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister if

he  will  state the Government's philosophy on  and  role  in

investor  public education, and if it will drive or at  least

coordinate  efforts of Government-related agencies,  such  as

the Central Provident Fund Board.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises the importance of personal

financial    planning,   in   view   of   the    individual's

responsibility to ensure his or her own financial security at

old  age.  CPF members who have contributed to CPF throughout

their  working life should accumulate enough savings to  meet

their   basic   retirement,  healthcare  and  housing   needs

commensurate  with their incomes.  However, many Singaporeans

have higher expectations, especially if they wish to maintain

their  present lifestyles after they retire. Then  their  CPF

savings  alone  may  not be enough, and they  would  need  to

manage  their personal savings properly, to supplement  their

CPF  balances.  As retail investors, they must learn to  look

out  for  themselves, and be discerning in  choosing  from  a

growing range of service providers and products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater efforts at investor education will be useful.

The aim is to equip investors with the basic tools to carry

out informed financial investment decisions.  An NUS survey

commissioned by a bank last year showed that Singaporeans

believe they have enough knowledge to manage their money, but

most of those surveyed lacked understanding of basic

financial concepts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the point of view of the financial system as a

whole,  an informed investing public exerts market discipline

on  financial  institutions.   This  supports  our  long-term

objective of developing a more open and transparent financial

sector, driven by fundamentals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS has a role in promoting public understanding of the

benefits and risks of financial products, but we do not think

that  the  regulator can carry the full burden  of  educating

investors.    We   will  use  the  Internet  to   disseminate

information  to  enhance consumer awareness,  and  will  also

continue  to  support initiatives by trade bodies  in  public

education. For example, the Investment Management Association

of Singapore (IMAS), as the representative body of investment

managers,  has  established  an  Education  Sub-Committee  to

promote  greater  public awareness about the fund  management

industry,  through  public seminars, talks  and  forums,  and

publications.  Another  example is the  Securities  Investors

Association   of  Singapore  (SIAS),  which  has   identified

investor  education as a key activity and is working  closely

with several brokerages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Board will continue with its retirement planning

programme  called  "Take  Charge.  Plan  Early.  Secure  Your

Financial Independence Now". It will dovetail this with other

Government  agencies  such  as  the  Ministry  of   Community

Development  and  Sports, to reach out  to  different  target

groups.

<div align="center"><b>EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Minister for Finance if

he will explain how the issue of options under Employee Stock

Options  will  be  treated  for tax purposes  for  companies,

especially  in view of the anticipated increase in proportion

of compensation, and whether any limits will be imposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies are allowed a tax deduction for outgoings and

expenses wholly and exclusively incurred in the production of

income.  The grant of employee share options is the offer  of

a  right to the employees to acquire the company's share at a

future  date at a certain price. When the employees  exercise

the  options, the companies have to issue fresh shares to the

employees. Under our tax system, the company does  not  incur

any  outgoings or expense in the issue of new shares.  Hence,

the company does not get a tax deduction.

<div align="center"><b>LIGHT RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38. <b>Mr Lew Syn Pau</b> asked the Minister for

Communications   and  Information  Technology   whether   the

Government  will  consider building  a  Light  Rapid  Transit

system  between Newton Circus and Bukit Panjang MRT stations,

running  along the Bukit Timah canal and up along  the  Upper

Bukit  Timah Road corridor, in view of the increasing density

of residential housing and good schools located there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LTA is currently undertaking a number of feasibility

studies  for  further expansion of our rapid  transit  system

(RTS)  network. One of the RTS lines being looked into  is  a

medium capacity system along the Bukit Timah corridor.   Such

a  system  would serve the upcoming residential  developments

and schools in the area.  However, a detailed study will have

to be carried out to determine whether the line is physically

and  economically viable, given the site constraints such  as

the  existence  of the Bukit Timah Canal and many  multi-tier

interchanges along Bukit Timah Road.

<div align="center"><b>STAKEHOLDING BY LAW FIRMS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Ker Sin Tze</b> asked the Minister for Law whether

the existing law allowing law firms acting as stakeholders to

retain  the interest on the stakeholding fund will be amended

so that the interest will be paid to the owner of the fund.



<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stakeholder holds the money on behalf of both the

buyer and seller.  If the sale is completed without incident,

he  will pay the money to the seller.  If the sale is aborted

through  no  fault of the buyer, the stakeholder returns  the

money to the buyer.  In the meantime, neither the seller  nor

buyer  can rightfully claim that the money, and the  interest

earned  from it, belong to him as it is not certain who  will

finally   be   entitled  to  the  money.  Therefore,   in   a

stakeholding  situation, it is not  meaningful  to  speak  of

"owner of the fund".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law allows stakeholders to retain the interest

earned  on  the  stakeholding funds as remuneration  for  the

valuable service they provide to both seller and buyer.   The

stakeholder,  who holds the money on behalf of both  parties,

is  accountable to them for the safekeeping of the money.  He

must  act fairly as between the parties and pay out the money

only in accordance with law.  This is especially important in

cases where there is a legal dispute between the parties  and

they  both lay claim to the money.  As he provides a  service

which protects the interests of both buyer and seller, it  is

only fair that he is adequately remunerated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should clarify that it is not only law firms who act

as  stakeholders  in property transactions.  For  uncompleted

units  sold directly by developers, the Singapore Academy  of

Law  acts  as  stakeholder.  In other property  transactions,

parties  are  free to decide who the stakeholder  should  be,

even  though  they usually appoint the lawyer.   Whoever  the

stakeholder  is, the law governing the treatment of  interest

on the stakeholding fund is the same.

<div align="center"><b>MEDICAL EXAMINATION FOR FOREIGN WORKERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower whether all foreign workers are required to  undergo

a   medical  examination,  including  HIV  test,  before   an

employment  status  is  granted; and  whether  employers  can

legitimately  terminate  the  services  of  their  local  and

foreign  employees  who  are subsequently  found  to  be  HIV

positive.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All work permit holders have been required to undergo

and  pass a general medical examination since 1972. Over  the

years,  the  medical examination has been extended  to  cover

medical screening of contagious illnesses such as TB, malaria

and  HIV.  The requirement for work permit holders to undergo

the  HIV test was imposed in 1993.  Foreign workers who  fail

their medical examination including the HIV test will not  be

issued  with  a  work  permit  and  they  will  have  to   be

repatriated by their employers. Work permit holders who  wish

to  renew their work permits are also required to undergo and

pass the HIV test and a chest X-ray examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since March this year, my Ministry has extended the

medical  examination  requirement  to  foreigners  who   have

obtained an in-principle approval for an employment  pass  of

six  months'  duration or more.  The medical examination  for

employment  pass  holders includes  the  HIV  test  as  well.

Employment pass holders are also required to pass the medical

examination before their passes can be renewed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of an employee who has contracted HIV,

the  employer may terminate his employment due to  ill-health

and  inability to perform his duties.  However, the  employer

should deal with the termination sympathetically and consider

granting  some  form  of  financial  relief  to  assist   the

employee.

<div align="center"><b>AIDS PATIENTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Health  (a) whether he is aware of the rising number of  AIDS

patients and what steps his Ministry will take to contain the

spread;  and  (b)  whether  these AIDS  patients  can  afford

medical  treatment and, if not, what other sources of funding

are  available  for young patients who are also  the  primary

breadwinners for their families.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is fully aware of AIDS as a disease of

public health importance in Singapore.  As early as 1985,  we

implemented the National AIDS Control Programme, even  before

the  first  case of HIV infection was detected.   The  multi-pronged   control   strategy  comprises   health   education,

protection  of  the  national blood supply,  counselling  and

management  of the infected and their contacts,  surveillance

of  the disease, and the training of personnel.  With no cure

or  vaccine for the disease, the main focus in the control of

AIDS in Singapore continues to be on health education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 31st March 2000, a cumulative total of 1,194

Singaporeans  have  been reported to be  HIV  infected  since

1985.  Among them, there were 508 asymptomatic carriers,  283

with  full-blown AIDS and 403 have died.  Over the last  five

years,  the rise in the number of HIV infections in Singapore

appears  to  be  slowing  down, with  the  rate  of  increase

declining  from  29%  in 1994-1995 to 4%  in  1998-1999.   My

Ministry  will continue to monitor the situation  and  ensure

that all necessary and timely measures to control the disease

are taken where appropriate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIV/AIDS patients have access to subsidised inpatient

and  outpatient  care  like any other patient.   This  covers

hospital   charges,  radiological  and  laboratory   charges,

treatment   of  complications  with  standard   drugs   where

appropriate and consultation charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there is no subsidy for anti-retroviral

drugs,  which are considered non-standard drugs. This  is  no

different  from all other non-standard drugs  used  to  treat

cancers, hypertension, etc. which are also not subsidised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated monthly cost of "Optimal" therapy, which

involves  the  use  of  3-drug combination  and  including  a

protease  inhibitor,  is between $1200  and  $1600.   A  less

expensive  therapy  with  2-drug combination  and  without  a

protease inhibitor would cost about $600 per month.  Patients

are allowed to use $500 per month from their Medisave account

for  any of the anti-retroviral drugs that are registered  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The treatment of HIV/AIDS is very expensive. It delays

but does not prevent the onset of AIDS. The effectiveness  of

such therapy over the long term is still not known. Treatment

would  have  to be life-long as studies have shown  that  the

virus rebounds soon after treatment is halted. Therefore,  we

should channel our available resources to more cost-effective

treatments for the benefit of the majority of patients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIV/AIDS patients who require further financial

assistance  could  approach Action for AIDS  (AfA)  or  other

charitable organisations for help.

Education if he will include a component on AIDS education in

the  sex  education curriculum of secondary schools to  raise

the awareness of the young to this potential threat.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject of AIDS is taught in various Science and

Moral Education subjects in the curriculum.   Lower Secondary

Science,  a  compulsory subject for all pupils,  teaches  the

consequences and issues relating to pre-marital  sex.   There

are   lessons  on   the  harmful  consequences  of   sexually

transmitted diseases (STDs) such as syphilis, gonorrhoea  and

AIDS.  In the Upper Secondary Biology syllabus, the spread of

HIV  and methods by which it may be controlled are discussed.

The Human and Social Biology syllabus elaborates on the signs

and  symptoms  and causes of AIDS as well as its  spread  and

control.   AIDS is also taught in the Secondary 5 Civics  and

Moral  Education  (CME) syllabus under  the  broad  theme  of

"Responsible  Dating".  Pupils discuss  the  consequences  of

premarital sex such as contracting STDs and AIDS.   Talks  on

STDs  and  AIDS  are also regularly conducted by  the  School

Health  Service  of  the  Ministry of  Health  to  pupils  in

Secondary 3 and JC1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, MOE is developing a more holistic approach to

sexuality  education, building on what is already covered  in

the  existing  curriculum and bearing in mind  the  different

needs   of  students  at  different  stages  of  growth   and

adolescence.   A  multimedia package is being produced  which

will examine concepts and attitudes in sexuality education in

a  structured  manner.  This will be used as part  of  guided

discussions  about responsibility, consequences  and  choices

with  respect to one's sexuality.  Topics such  as  AIDS  and

STDs will be included in this package.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The successful implementation of sexuality education

requires  the  participation and support of the school,  home

and  community.   All have different but important  roles  to

play in the healthy development of our youths.
