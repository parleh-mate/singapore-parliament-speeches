<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>MASS TRANSIT SYSTEM</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Operational date)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong</b> asked the Minister for

Communications whether any positive  decision  has

been made on the proposed Mass Transit System,  in

view   of   the   rapidly  deteriorating   traffic

situation  and  the current pace of  physical  and

economic  development; and whether a Mass  Transit

System is likely to be operational before 1980.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Mass Transit Study

(MTS)  project commenced in July 1972. The project

is  undertaken with the assistance from the United

Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and with  the

World Bank as its Executing Agency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of the MTS, which is in two phases, is to

assist  the  Government in the  formulation  of  a

transportation  programme that  would  efficiently

serve  present  and  future needs  and  complement

overall  plans for long-range development  of  the

Republic.  Phase  I  of  the  Study  will  provide

recommendations  for development of  mass  transit

services  based  on comprehensive  evaluation  and

analysis of available transportation alternatives.

Phase II will be a detailed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>



feasibility study of the recommended system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase I of the Study was recently completed and

the Consultants are expected to submit their Final

Report around the end of this month. On receipt of

the  Final  Report,  the  recommendations  of  the

Consultants  would be reviewed  and  submitted  to

Government for decision. When a decision  is  made

on  the system selected for detailed study,  Phase

II  will commence. The details of Phase II  cannot

be  finalised pending a decision on Phase  I.  For

these  reasons, it is not possible to say at  this

stage  whether a mass transit system is likely  to

be operational before 1980.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is relevant for me, Sir, to point out that the

objective  of  the  MTS  is to  provide  long-term

solutions.  For  the short-term,  as  Members  are

aware,  vigorous  steps have been  and  are  being

taken  to improve the public transport system  and

the  traffic  situation.  These  measures  include

reserved  bus lanes some of which are  already  in

operation,  as  well as measures to  restrain  the

growth  of  the private car population. Plans  are

also  being  studied for the location  of  over  a

dozen  parking places around the periphery of  the

congested Central Business District to accommodate

between 25 to 30 per cent of private



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>



cars  entering  the Central Business  District  at

peak  hours and arrange for special buses to carry

such commuters into the Central Business District.

This  plan  is based on the park-and-ride  schemes

operational  in  several large cities  where  cars

which  do not use these peripheral car parks  have

to  pay  a fee to enter the restricted zone.  This

plan  when  finalised  will  be  published.  After

public  discussion the plans may be improved  upon

before implementation.

<div align="center"><b>BREAKDOWNS OF PUBLIC BUSES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Request for effective action)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  whether he is aware  of  the  many

breakdowns of public buses daily, and if  he  will

consider taking effective steps in the matter such

as  requesting the Singapore Bus Services  Limited

to  promptly tow away buses which have broken down

on  the  roads so that traffic flow  will  not  be

hindered for long and to engage more mechanics and

operate  a  two-shift system,  or  engage  private

motor  workshops, to expedite repairs of the buses

so that they may be put back into service quickly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, not only are

we  aware of the daily occurrence of public  buses

breaking  down  on the roads, but have  viewed  it

with  concern.  Since Singapore Bus Services  Ltd.

(SBS)  took  over  operation  of  the  public  bus

service   from  the  three  former   companies   - Amalgamated Bus Co. (ABC), Associated Bus  Service

(ABS)  and United Bus Co. (UBC) - on 1st  November

last  year,  it has been required to submit  daily

returns to the Ministry of Communications and  the

Bus  Services Reorganisation Committee  (BSRC)  on

the  bus operations. Included in these returns are

the  number  of  breakdowns occurring  daily.  The

returns  show  an  average of 35 breakdowns  daily

over  the  four  months  from  November  1973   to

February 1974. The breakdown figures were counter-checked with daily reports from the Police for the months



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



of November and December only. This represents 2.5

per cent of the daily average operational fleet of

1,400.  It  should be noted the buses operate  for

about  18  hours  a  day,  often  under  congested

traffic  conditions and severely overloaded.  This

would strain even the best of equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are as concerned as the hon. Member for

Sembawang  that buses breaking down by  the  roads

should  be  quickly  removed and  not  allowed  to

obstruct traffic. Through efforts of the BSRC. SBS

entered  into  an agreement with a  private  motor

repairer  to  tow away and repair its buses  which

breakdown by the roadside in the city area. At the

request of the BSRC, SBS also undertook to  obtain

other  private  motor repairers to assist  in  the

repair  of  its buses which break down,  including

those    breaking    down   by    the    roadside.

Advertisements   inviting   such   private   motor

repairers to undertake this work were published by

SBS in the Press on 14th, 19th, and 20th February.

It   is  expected  that  SBS  would  finalise  the

arrangements  with those companies which  respond,

shortly.  SBS is also finalising arrangements  for

installation of mobile VHF communication equipment

in  its repair vehicles with the control centre at

its  main  workshop. This, when  installed,  would

speed up the repair of roadside breakdowns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, under the Road Traffic (Removal of

Vehicles)  Rules,  the  Police  are  empowered  to

remove  broken  down vehicles on the  roads  which

cause  obstruction and to charge  the  owners  for

removal  and  storage  fees. The  present  removal

charge for a bus is $60 and the storage charge  is

$20  per day. The Registry of Vehicles and Traffic

Police   are  reviewing  this  with  a   view   to

increasing  the rates as a deterrent  to  roadside

breakdowns  and  incentive to better  maintenance.

The   Traffic  Police  are  also  arranging   with

suitable  private contractors for towing  away  of

buses  broken down by the roadside which  are  too

large   to   be   towed  away  by  their   present

contractor.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key, Sir, to reducing the number of buses

breaking  down  by the roadside  is,  however,  to

maintain the buses properly. SBS inherited most of

its  present bus fleet from the three  former  bus

companies, and many of these buses, I am sorry  to

say,  were very poorly maintained. More  than  400

were  out  of  repair and laid up when  SBS  began

operations on 1st November last year. Through  the

efforts of the BSRC, an agreement was entered into

by  SBS  with a private motor repairer  to  repair

these  400  buses  at an estimated  cost  of  $1.2

million  and to put them back on the road as  soon

as possible over the six months from November 1973

to  April  1974. Unfortunately, owing to the  poor

state  of  maintenance, many of  these  buses  are

irreparable   without   replacement    of    major

components.  Up to 28th February last month,  only

43  of  the buses have been repaired and put  back

into  operation. However, SBS now has,  on  order,

227   replacement  engines,  gearboxes  and  axles

costing  an  estimated  $2  million.  It  is  also

undertaking  some  of the repairs  itself  and  is

arranging  with  additional private  repairers  to

assist in the work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure higher standards of maintenance of the

buses  in future, SBS is leasing a 17.6-acre  site

at Braddell Road for 15 years from the Housing and

Development Board to put up a proper central depot

and workshop. Plans for the workshop are now being

drawn  up  by the architects commissioned  by  SBS

with  the  assistance of consultants from  certain

major motor suppliers and repairers. SBS has  also

employed   a  qualified  mechanical  engineer   to

supervise  its workshops operations.  Arrangements

have,  in  addition, been made for SBS to  recruit

more  motor  mechanics and to undertake  a  proper

scheme  for motor mechanic trainees in conjunction

with  the  Registry  of Vehicles,  the  Industrial

Training Board and the Singapore Industrial Labour

Organisation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All public buses are required to be inspected and

certified fit by the Mechanical Inspection Unit of

the  Registry of Vehicles once every  six  months.

These   inspections  have  been  intensified   and

proposals are being studied by the BSRC to  ensure

that buses appearing for inspection in future have

properly  documented and certified service  record

cards. Under the proposals, these cards would show

the  repair jobs and servicing carried out on  the

buses in the six months preceding each inspection.

Buses   which   do  not  meet  the  standards   of

maintenance specified by the Registry of  Vehicles

would  not be passed for use on the roads and  the

bus company would be penalised for operating buses

which  are  not up to the standard of  maintenance

required.  False  certification  of  the   service

record cards would also be subject to penalty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Sembawang may be assured that

every  effort  is being directed towards  ensuring

proper maintenance of our public buses with a view

to  avoiding  roadside breakdowns and providing  a

maximum operational fleet.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

fully sympathise with the Minister on the state of

the  bus  service  in Singapore. From  the  points

which he has raised, I would like to ask him a few

supplementary questions. Firstly, it would seem to

me  that  the introduction of bus lanes on certain

roads  has created new problems. The right of  way

for  smaller vehicles is one such problem.  It  is

all  right if we are in a mini-car alongside a big

bus.  Actually out of fear for our own safety,  we

give way to the bus. What happens if an army truck

happens to be parked at the red light next to  the

bus? Who has the right of way to turn left?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of bus lanes also leads to a

slowing  down  of  traffic.  All  buses  following

behind  a  bus  that  stops at  a  bus  stop  will

naturally  have to stop. This will mean  that  the

entire chain of buses have to stop, whether or not

there  are passengers getting off from the second,

third or fourth bus. I am sure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



these problems have been thought over carefully by

the  Ministry,  and the Minister  will  have  good

answers to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question concerns the efforts made by

the  Ministry of Communications to encourage  more

and  more people to use public transport. I notice

that there are no schedules of routes at bus stops

to help commuters. I think it would be a good idea

if  the Ministry could ask SBS to publicise at all

bus  stops  a schedule of all the buses that  come

that way, giving the routes and Service number  of

every  bus. I am sure this can be done and  should

be done with haste.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I notice that the SBS has recently

introduced  some 40 to 50 jumbo buses. This  jumbo

bus  can  carry 90 passengers. I am told  that  at

certain  junctions cars following  closely  behind

this  jumbo  bus have got to reverse in  order  to

allow this jumbo bus to turn into a small lane.  I

am  sure  the  Ministry can also ask  the  SBS  to

reschedule  bus routes so that these  jumbo  buses

will   not   cause  any  inconvenience  to   other

commuters on the road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the question of conductors, I am sure

that  the  provision of just one conductor  for  a

jumbo bus is going to create more problems for the

commuters  and also for the bus conductors.  I  am

inclined   to  believe  that  unhealthy  incidents

between  commuters and conductors may increasingly

occur  if we do not provide one more conductor  to

each jumbo bus. Let us say that we should have two

conductors instead of one conductor in each  jumbo

bus. Can I have the answers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I shall endeavour to

answer  the rather long-winded question  with  its

many  provisos.  Firstly, on the question  of  the

reserved  bus  lanes  and  the  problems   arising

therefrom.  Problems  will always  arise  when  we

start  on  something new. There will  be  teething

problems.  Even the bus drivers and bus conductors

realise for the first time now that they have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>



the  right of way when they are in the bus  lanes.

The answer to the question of right of way is very

simple.  When  there is a reserved bus  lane,  the

right of way is the privilege of the buses. Anyone

getting into this lane will be booked, and he will

have  to exercise greater care. If a driver  of  a

vehicle, be it an army truck, wishes to turn left,

then if there is a bus lane on his left, he should

first have to give the right of way to the bus. He

should be more patient before turning left because

he  has  to  see that the passage is clear  before

making  his turn. Otherwise he will get  a  ticket

for the offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question about the change of

buses  and  so on and whether adequate steps  have

been  taken to review the situation, I can  assure

the hon. Member, as well as members of the public,

that this matter is constantly under review. If it

is  found that certain adjustments have to be made

to improve the flow of traffic, we will do so. May

I  also assure the hon. Member that it is not just

the Ministry of Communications and a few officials

in  the  Registry of Vehicles who are involved  in

the  drawing  of  lines on the  road.  We  have  a

technical team of road engineers and planners from

the Ministry of National Development. They are the

ones  who  really plan the whole  scheme  and,  of

course,  it did receive our criticism as  well  as

that of the Traffic Police in the Ministry of Home

Affairs.  The whole scheme of reserved  bus  lanes

was not just the work of one Ministry. I would say

that at least three Ministries were involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is about encouraging more

commuters  by  providing certain facilities  which

the   hon.   Member  considers   should   be   the

responsibility  of the bus company.  There  is  no

doubt  that  the bus company should do  much  more

than  just  print some bus guides.  In  fact,  the

company  will  have to make up for  lost  time  by

having  more officers appointed so that  they  can

communicate with the public,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



and the business of the BSRC is to ensure that the

needs of commuters are looked after.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point raised by the Member is that at

each  of  the  main  terminals  there  should   be

sufficient boards to indicate routes of the  buses

that  leave the terminus, and so on. This takes  a

little bit of time to eventuate. I can assure him,

however, that every effort will be made to get the

SBS to provide a public bus service that is up  to

standard.  But we have our difficulties,  and  the

first is the objective to get 400 buses, which are

now off the road, to be back on the road. Once the

public  get  the buses to travel in, then  we  can

think of other improvements to the service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his last suggestion about having two

conductors to one bus, may I say that  it  is  our

hope  that  ultimately there will be no conductors

in  the  bus. But that is a long way yet. This  is

something  which  we  would  like  to  see   -that

ultimately  each bus will be operated  by  only  a

driver  and the commuters need only to drop  their

shillings  for a ride, depending on distance,  and

there would not be any conductors at all. But I do

not  wish  to agitate my good Friend,  who  is  in

charge   of   the   Singapore  Industrial   Labour

Organisation,  by  causing a  ripple  amongst  his

midst. That is quite a distant dream.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  as  hon.  Members know,  about  400  to  500

physically broken-down buses have been sent to the

grave.  What I would like to know and very  firmly

ask is whether the bus service is going to improve

in  three months' time, or never at all? Or is the

Hon. Minister for Communications still thinking of

doctoring the SBS and "transplanting" engines  and

whatnots, rather than performing the last rites of

the SBS and the funeral service?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I am sorry to hear that

the  hon.  Member thinks that I am  doctoring  the

SBS.  Having seen the collapse of one bus  company

(the Singapore Traction Company) in December 1971,

it  is my last wish that the SBS will collapse.  I

think it is only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>



fair that we should give the bus company some time

to get on its feet, because it is only four months

since  the company started operations as a  single

organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have stated, there are a number of

deficiencies, including 400 buses not put  on  the

road.  To be fair, I must say that SBS has entered

into  a  contract with a motor repairer to  repair

the  400  buses in six months' time, that  is,  by

April  1974.  We  should therefore  not  judge  it

before  then.  If  it is necessary  for  "surgical

operations" to be done, perhaps I would  be  in  a

position to do it then, but not now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Sir, there has been

Some   talk   that   public   transport   may   be

nationalised. I would like to have  the  views  of

the    Minister   on   this   talk    about    the

nationalisation of the transport service.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Minister, is it relevant to the

main question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, this supplementary

question  looks  like  an extension  of  the  many

supplementary questions that have been  raised.  I

believe  it has been stated in this House sometime

ago  that  the present Government has no intention

to  nationalise the public transport. If a  Member

puts in an Oral Question and then withdraws it,  I

am  not  in a position to answer it. And since  he

has  not  raised it, I would say that the position

remains  the  same  -  there is  no  intention  to

nationalise public transport at this stage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I would like to ask  the  Minister

whether he is aware that the buses are emitting  a

lot  of  smoke,  and  whether  the  Singapore  Bus

Services  Company is being penalised  for  running

such  smoky buses. Every day we see buses emitting

black smoke. What measures are being taken by  the

Government to remedy this situation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The question is very simple,

Sir,It  is a matter of either having  a  bus  to

carry passengers although the bus appears to  have

smoky



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>



exhausts, or to look after the smoky exhausts  and

thereby have less buses on the road. The answer is

simple:  let  the  buses run and  look  after  the

passengers first.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National  Development (a) whether  there  are

statistics  of the lifts installed in Housing  and

Development Board estates, private housing estates

and  in  Government  and  private  buildings;  (b)

whether  these lifts had been checked and approved

by the Government department concerned before they

were  installed  and  again,  after  installation,

before  they were put into operation; (c)  whether

steps  have  been taken to set up a body  to  make

compulsory periodic inspections of all lifts after

installations; and (d) for public safety  and  the

cleanliness   of  lifts,  if  he   will   consider

introducing  legislation to require  lifts  to  be

operated by lift attendants only.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as at the 31st

of  January this year, there were 1,350  lifts  in

Housing   Board   estates  and  another   117   in

Government  buildings.  There  are  no  statistics

available for private buildings at the moment. But

with  the introduction of the Buildings and Common

Property   (Maintenance  and   Management)   Rules

sometime  this year, statistics of lifts  in  such

buildings  will  become available.  The  lifts  in

Housing  Board  flats are installed in  accordance

with  the  Board's specifications  and  under  the

supervision  of the Board's electrical  engineers.

The  lifts  are tested for a period of  two  weeks

before   use.  They  are  cleaned  regularly   and

serviced  and  oiled fortnightly. The  Board  also

maintains  a 24-hour Lift Emergency Unit  to  deal

with breakdowns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifts in Government buildings are checked and

approved  before  and after installations  by  the

electrical branch of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>



the   Public  Works  Department  which   is   also

responsible   for   their   maintenance.   Regular

cleaning is carried out by the user department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifts in private buildings were previously

subject  to  the 1931 Lift by-laws which  required

owners  of buildings to engage and authorise  lift

contractors  to carry out regular maintenance  and

to   ensure  safe  operation.  As  this  piece  of

legislation is not adequate to cope with the high-rise  developments, the Building Control  Division

has  been given the responsibility for the control

and  installation of lifts and escalators  by  the

Building  Control Act of this year.  The  Division

proposes   to  introduce  regulations  that   will

require lifts to be installed and maintained by  a

professional engineer in accordance with the  code

of   practice  for  installation,  operation,  and

maintenance of lifts. The code is being  finalised

in  conjunction  with the Singapore  Institute  of

Standards and Industrial Research.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the Building Control Act which I

have  mentioned,  action has also  been  taken  to

ensure  the proper maintenance of lifts in private

buildings under the Buildings and Common  Property

(Maintenance  and Management) Rules which  I  have

mentioned. The Commissioner of Buildings  will  be

responsible to ensure that owners keep their lifts

in clean and proper working condition at all times

and  have  them  serviced  monthly  and  inspected

annually at least. It is not practicable  to  make

it compulsory for all lifts to be operated by lift

attendants,  as too large a number  of  attendants

will be needed and it will be difficult to recruit

or   retain   such   persons.  The   Housing   and

Development  Board would then require about  3,375

lift  attendants  to man the 1,350  lifts  now  in

operation.  The presence of a lift  attendant  may

ensure that the lift is clean, but not necessarily

safe. The Robinson fire is an example.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation is being drafted to ensure that stand-by generators are installed in all public lifts so

that  they can be brought down to a safe floor  in

the event of fire or a power failure. There



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



will also be provision for all public lifts to  be

provided  with a communication system, whereby  if

the  hon.  Member for Sembawang is  trapped  in  a

lift, he can always call for help from outside.

<div align="center"><b>CIVIL SERVANTS SPORTING LONG HAIR</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Action against)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Health  and  Home  Affairs if he  is  aware  that,

though   action   has   been   initiated   against

Government  servants having long hair,  there  are

certain  Government employees still sporting  long

hair,  and what action he intends to take  against

such persons.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since May last

year,  all  Government departments  and  statutory

boards  have  each appointed a senior  officer  as

Enforcement   Officer   to   ensure    that    the

Government's    anti-long    hair    policy     is

conscientiously   implemented.   The   Enforcement

Officer  checks (a) on the staff and ensures  that

appropriate  disciplinary action is taken  against

those who sport long and unkempt hair; and (b)  to

ensure  that the policy that males with long  hair

will  be  attended  to last is enforced.  He  also

submits  monthly reports to the Ministry  of  Home

Affairs,  giving  details of the  number  of  male

officers  sporting long hair and the action  taken

against them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance has also issued circulars

warning male Government servants that the sporting

of  long  hair constitutes a disciplinary  offence

and  may result in their dismissal. Up to December

of  last  year, more than 4,000 male  officers  in

Government  departments and statutory boards  have

been  called up and warned for sporting long hair.

Among  them  were three Division  I  officers,  25

Division  II officers, and the rest were  Division

III and IV officers and daily-rated employees. All

those  who  were  warned did not sport  long  hair

again, except for seven Division IV officers, five

of whom were dismissed and the other two resigned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the Government's anti-long hair

policy  is  having its intended effect. There  has

been  a  marked improvement in the hair styles  of

civil servants since the anti-long hair policy was

introduced.  However, there may be isolated  cases

of  Government employees sporting long hair  which

may  have escaped the attention of the Enforcement

Officer.   Government  departments  and  statutory

boards  have  been reminded to exercise  continued

vigilance  over all their employees  and  to  take

action against them. The Member for Sembawang  may

rest  assured  that any male civil  servant  found

sporting  long  hair  will be appropriately  dealt

with.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I raised this question three months ago but I

had  no  opportunity  to raise  any  supplementary

questions  at  all in this House. Now  that  three

months   have  passed,  I  was  hoping  that   the

authorities concerned would pay more attention  to

this  matter.  But recently I notice that  certain

Government   servants,   particularly   those   in

Division  IV, are still sporting long  hair.  Even

Police Inspectors are now sporting long hair.  Can

the Minister pay more attention to this matter?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, although the question

was  put  in  three months ago, as the Member  for

Sembawang has said, the figures given in my answer

are up to-date. As far as those sporting long hair

are  concerned, as I have said, appropriate action

had been and is being taken. But in the event that

they  have  escaped the notice of the  Enforcement

Officer,  then if the Member himself has seen  any

offenders, he can make a report.

representation and armed with statutory powers  to

investigate    into    public    complaints     of

unjustifiable    price   increases    and    other

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, a special Anti-Inflationary  Agency,

as  proposed  by the hon. Member for  Jalan  Kayu,

will  not  be  necessary  at  this  juncture.   My

Ministry  already possesses the machinery  to  co-ordinate the formulation as well as implementation

of  various anti-inflationary measures.  An  Anti-Inflationary Committee has been formed within  the

Ministry  to  look  after  all  aspects  of  anti-inflation policies. Legislation, such as the Price

Control  Act and the Control of Essential Supplies

Act already enacted, give the Government statutory

powers  to  take  drastic punitive action  against

manipulation   by   traders.   Private   consumers

associations  such  as CASE  can  liaise  with  my

Ministry  on  various  anti-inflationary  measures

which are being implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Government has to play the main role in

combating  inflation, success hinges crucially  on

the   co-operation  of  all  concerned,  including

employers  and  employees, manufacturers,  traders

and  consumers. I believe that there is no  better

way to counter the present rise in prices than  by

curbing our demand especially on luxury goods;  by

abstaining from panic buying and hoarding, as well

as  being  more selective in our shopping  habits,

and  in  specially  bad cases of  profiteering  or

manipulation,  by a boycott of the  goods  or  the

sellers concerned.

on the Order Paper.

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, noting the Report of the

Commission  on  Parliament Staff as  contained  in

Paper Misc. 1 of 1974, accepts the recommendations

of  the  Commission as contained in  paragraph  16

thereof  and  resolves  in  accordance  with  such

recommendations.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members may be aware from the Report,

which was presented to this House as Paper Misc. 1

of  1974, that a Commission consisting of you,  Mr

Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

Defence, the Minister for Finance, the Chairman of

the  Public  Service Commission, and  myself,  was

appointed  to  study the terms of service  of  the

staff of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission has met and has made certain

recommendations  as contained in  the  Report.  To

attract  and to continue to attract good  officers

to  the  Parliamentary service, and  also  in  the

interest  of the present staff of this House,  the

Commission has considered it necessary  to  revise

the  terms of service of the senior posts such  as

will appropriately equate them, in terms of salary

and status, to the rest of the civil service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission recommended that the three senior

posts of the Parliamentary service be restructured

as recommended



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



in paragraph 13 of the Report. It  is  the

view   of   the   Commission   that,   with    the

restructuring  of  the  two  existing  promotional

posts   of   Clerk  Assistant  and  Second   Clerk

Assistant,  there will be a wider  basis  in  that

serving  officers  in  the Administrative  or  the

Legal   Service   may   be   attracted   to    the

Parliamentary service either on secondment or even

on substantive appointment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission did not, however, recommend any

change with regard to the post of Clerk, (Grade E)

as it is satisfied that the salary attached to the

post is sufficiently attractive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, noting the Report

of the Commission on Parliament Staff as

contained in Paper Misc. 1 of 1974, accepts the recommendations of the Commission as

contained in paragraph 16 thereof and resolves in accordance with such recommendations.

II  of  the  Civil  List is insufficient  to  meet

increasing expenses, such as the 9 per  cent  wage

supplement   and  the  higher  rate   of   Central

Provident  Fund contributions. The increase  under

Class III is mainly for improvements to the Istana

grounds.  A  smaller provision is  required  under

mowers and other equipment for the maintenance  of

the  grounds as well as two colour TV sets for the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Economic Survey of Singapore in 1973</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary estimates show that Singapore's Gross

National Product (GNP) at current prices  grew  in

1973  by $1,832.7 million to $9,892.9 million,  at

an  annual growth rate of 22.7 per cent.  Allowing

for  the  large price increases during  the  year,

real  GNP probably grew by only 11 per cent, which

is  not altogether surprising considering the many

uncertainties   in   the   international    scene,

particularly those caused by the "oil crisis".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose therefore, as in previous years, to

survey external developments of direct bearing  on

Singapore's welfare before analysing the State  of

the Domestic Economy in 1973.



<br><br><i>Survey of international Economic Events</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International economic developments in the past

two years have shown by their effects on the world

economy   the   strong  interdependence   of   all

countries,  but  more especially  of  those  which

depend  substantially  upon  international  trade,

capital   flows  and  tourist  spending  for   the

generation  of  domestic  output  and  employment.

Singapore,  by  virtue of its size and  geographic

location,   cannot  help  but  be  influenced   by

external economic conditions.



<br><br><i>"Oil Crisis"</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of frequency and intensity, the economic

crises  of  1973 surpassed those of  the  previous

year.  Of  greatest impact was  the  "oil  crisis"

which   threatened  the  very  fabric  of  Japan's

prosperity. The "economic miracle" of  its  rapid,

sustained development post-war was worked  on  the

increasingly larger importation of cheap petroleum

energy  resources for its industries, mainly  from

the  Middle East. Although less dependent  on  oil

supplies for its economies, other major industrial

countries  including  the  United  Kingdom,   West

Germany  and  France, and to a lesser extent,  the

United States, were not spared. The warning  signs

of impending petroleum shortages had appeared some

time before but the "oil



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



crisis"   was  actually  triggered   off   by   an

announcement  by the Arab oil-producing  countries

in  October  1973  that  oil  would  be  embargoed

against  certain  countries  and  that  production

would  be  reduced by 5 per cent every month  with

effect from the end of September. In November, the

cutback was proposed to be raised to 25 per  cent,

but  was  subsequently relaxed by 10 per  cent  in

December.  The real problem remained, however,  in

the  phenomenal  increases in  oil  prices.  Since

October, the posted prices of crude oil (on  which

taxes and royalties to the oil-producing countries

are  calculated) had been escalating,  threatening

oil-consuming countries with catastrophic  balance

of  payments problems. The unilateral increase  of

70 per cent in posted prices by the Gulf States in

October 1973 was followed by further increases  in

December  1973,  bringing  the  posted  prices  to

US$11.60 per barrel, a four-fold increase compared

to the pre-October prices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The production cutback, oil embargo and the high

oil prices accentuated the underlying recessionary

pressures   on   major  industrialised   countries

already existing before the oil crisis and it  was

feared  that  the  economic growth  of  the  major

industrialised   countries   would   be   severely

affected.



<br><br><i>Economic Slow-down in the Industrial Countries</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boom conditions which prevailed in the major

industrial  countries in the latter half  of  1972

continued  into 1973; the average growth  in  real

GNP  for  these  countries was estimated  to  have

increased by 6.5 per cent as compared with 5.5 per

cent the previous year. The rate of growth in  the

two    halves    of   1973,   however,    differed

considerably. Real output in the first half of the

year  accelerated as expansionary policies adopted

earlier began to take effect. In the second  half,

there   was  a  tapering  off,  with  real  growth

estimated at 4.5 per cent against 7.2 per cent  in

the first half. Several factors contributed to the

slower  growth rate. To counter inflation, several

countries had adopted restrictive measures



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>



which   subsequently  curbed   growth   as

aggregate  demand moderated. Physical constraints,

including  high rates of capacity utilization  and

tightness   in  labour  markets,  set  limits   to

continuing  expansion.  The  growth  momentum  was

further  checked  when  the oil  crisis  developed

towards the end of the year.



<br><br><i>Worldwide inflation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1973 was also characterised by high prices

throughout  the  world. An  excessive  demand  for

primary  commodities  reflecting  the  upsurge  in

economic   activities  propelled  prices  upwards,

while  a  shortfall  in  agricultural  output  and

subsequent   steep  increases   in   food   prices

reinforced the inflationary momentum. Despite  the

later  anti-inflationary policies adopted  by  the

major  industrial countries, prices  continued  to

spiral.   The   GNP  deflator  (a  commonly   used

indicator  of  the  inflation rate)  rose  in  the

United States by 7.1 per cent in 1973 (against 3.3

per  cent  in 1972), Japan 10.5 per cent (4.8  per

cent),  West Germany 6.2 per cent (6.1  per  cent)

and  the  industrial countries as a whole 6.9  per

cent  (4.7 per cent). Consumer prices rose at even

higher  rates, being 8.4 per cent for  the  United

States  (compared to 3.5 per cent in 1972),  Japan

19.9 per cent (4.8 per cent) and West Germany  8.3

per  cent (5.8 per cent). The developing countries

were not spared, as the rapid price increases were

transmitted to them via imports. In 1973, consumer

prices rose in Hong Kong by something of the order

of  24  per cent against 6.1 per cent in 1972  and

9.5  per  cent  against 4.9 per  cent  in  Taiwan.

Singapore's own rise in consumer prices  over  the

two  years of 22.9 per cent and 2.1 per  cent  did

not  therefore appear excessive, having regard  to

the fact of our being non-food producers.



<br><br><i>International Trade</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parallel with the upswing in economic activity in

1973,   international  trade   registered   marked

increases.  In  terms of volume, world  trade  was

estimated to have risen by 13.6 per cent  compared

to 8.6 per cent for 1972. In terms of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



value  in  US Dollars, the growth of international

trade was even more remarkable with an increase of

over  37  per cent or more than twice the rate  of

the  previous  year.  The  increase  reflects  the

depreciation of the US Dollar for the larger  part

of the year as well as the high rate of inflation.

However,  this rapid expansion in world trade  was

accompanied  by  growing  shortages   of   certain

commodities and policies restricting exports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What could be the most significant event in 1973

relating  to  international trade set a  hopefully

opposite trend away from restrictive policies.  At

the    Multilateral   Trade   Negotiations   (MTN)

Ministerial  Meeting in Tokyo, in September  1973,

countries  including non-GATT  members  agreed  to

enter  into multilateral trade negotiations  aimed

at the expansion and liberalization of world trade

with  consideration also to increasing the exports

of  developing  countries to developed  countries.

However, as progress in the MTN would be dependent

on so many factors, including an early solution to

the   problems  of  the  disordered  international

monetary system, it was expected that negotiations

would  be  extended over a couple  of  years.  Any

assessment  of  the  outcome  of  the  MTN   would

therefore he premature at this stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among other developments of note in 1973 was the

entry  of Britain into the European Common Market,

when  she  began to align her customs  tariffs  to

those   of   the  EEC,  and  to  phase   out   her

Commonwealth preferences. Singapore's  exports  to

the  United  Kingdom  were  affected,  though  not

severely. As against this, we were able,  together

with our ASEAN neighbours, to secure the EEC's in-principle  agreement  for  improvements   to   its

Generalised System of Preferences for our exports,

especially  in regarding as within the  percentage

requirements  of its rules of origin of  products,

the    proportion   contributed   by    cumulative

manufacture  in  countries  of  the  ASEAN  region

instead of by manufature



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



within  Singapore  alone.  The  EEC  also

agreed  to recognise Singapore's special  position

as  a  Market for primary commodities produced  in

the region.



<br><br><i>International Monetary Situation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my Budget Statement last year, I made

reference  to  1972  as a year  of  high  monetary

instability  and  to  the  unsettling  effects  of

currency   developments   in   early   1973.   The

subsequent  part of 1973 witnessed no  significant

improvement  in the situation. In  fact,  the  oil

crisis during its period of buildup and subsequent

development  added further elements of uncertainty

and instability to the monetary situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the devaluation of the US Dollar in

February for the second time in 14 months and  the

floating of major currencies of the world, the  US

Dollar  continued to weaken for some months  after

its  devaluation and only strengthened towards the

closing months of the year. These developments had

their  repercussions on Singapore, for the earlier

weakness  of  the  US  Dollar  led  to   a   large

speculative   capital  inflow,  with  inflationary

effects  caused  by  domestic over-liquidity.  The

need  to  curb  this inflow, coupled with  concern

over  imported inflation, led to the  decision  to

float  the  Singapore Dollar  on  June  21,  1973.

Several  other countries revalued their currencies

in 1973 citing the curtailment of inflation as the

main   reason.   These  countries   included   the

Netherlands, Norway, Australia and New Zealand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US Dollar staged a dramatic recovery towards

the  end  of 1973 as her balance of trade improved

and  as her own large domestic energy sources gave

rise to a general expectation that the US would be

relatively  less badly hit by the oil crisis  than

other industrial countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The depreciation of the Japanese yen in late 1973

resulted  from a deteriorating balance of payments

as  well  as  the  threat of economic  dislocation

arising from the Arab countries' oil cutbacks.  In

the  United Kingdom, the Pound continued to weaken

in the face of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



industrial  unrest,  and intensified  inflationary

pressures.  The French franc and the Italian  lira

also   showed   weakness  stemming   mainly   from

industrial unrest and certain political factors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These violent changes in major currency exchange

rates   point  to  the  need  for  an  early   and

satisfactory reform of the international  monetary

system.  However, only minor progress was made  by

the  IMF and its Committee of Twenty during  1973.

The  first outline of reform was presented to  the

Board  of Governors of the Fund at the IMF  Annual

Meeting  at  Nairobi in September 1973. Discussion

of   the  changes  recommended  was  taken  up  by

technical  groups.  Developments  since  the   IMF

Annual  Meeting have changed somewhat the  outlook

for reform. First, the termination of the 1968 two-tier gold agreement followed by the termination of

the  IMF Agreement on South African gold sales  to

finance    payments   deficits    indicate    some

recognition  of  the desire to  de-sterilize  gold

reserves for use by central banks and the  urgency

of  agreeing on the future role of gold  vis-a-vis

reserve  currencies. Secondly, the effect  of  the

energy  crisis  would probably  be  to  delay  the

deadline  for  Agreement of Reform originally  set

for  July  31, 1974 by up to 1�-2 years. Moreover,

balance  of  payments difficulties caused  by  the

energy crisis have changed the positions on reform

which  various countries have taken. Some of  them

will  no  doubt  re-examine the  effect  on  their

individual  interests  of  the  reform  proposals.

Nevertheless,  the current economic  uncertainties

indicate  the desirability of reaching an  interim

solution  which  could  be further  developed  and

modified  over a period of time until  a  complete

restructuring of the international monetary system

is  achieved. There is some consensus that in such

a system, the existing flexibility for adjustments

in  exchange  rates would be useful in  cushioning

any  sudden  shocks caused by extreme  balance  of

payments  difficulties arising  from  the  massive

increase  in  the petroleum import  bill  of  oil-consuming countries.

<br><br><i>State of the Economy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the domestic economy. We shall look

first  at  Singapore's performance as measured  by

its Gross Domestic Product.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1973, according to preliminary figures, our

Gross  Domestic Product at current prices grew  at

the  record  rate of 22.0 per cent. But inflation,

which  had  over the years been at  very  moderate

rates  in  Singapore,  even when  it  was  rampant

elsewhere,  finally caught up with  us.  The  very

rapid rate of GDP growth is attributable partly to

the  large  price  increases in 1973.  Discounting

these  increases, the growth of GDP at 1972 prices

is  estimated at only around 11 per cent, which is

lower than the average growth of 12.5 per cent for

the   past  four  years.  In  analysing  the  main

components  of  Singapore's  growth  which  I  now

propose to do, it is necessary, if one is  not  to

be   lulled  by  the  apparently  expansive   boom

conditions of 1973 into a state of euphoria,  that

one  should remember to mentally deflate  all  the

figures  which  are  given at  current  prices  to

arrive at the more sober real growth rates.



<br><br><i>Gross Domestic Product by Industrial Origin</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturing sector continued to be the

leading   growth  sector  in  our   economy.   Its

contribution   to   the  Gross  Domestic   Product

increased to 26.2 per cent in 1973 from  24.6  per

cent  in  1972. The growth in construction  slowed

down in 1973, resulting in a slight decline of its

share  in total GDP from 7.6 per cent in  1972  to

6.7  per  cent  in  1973. This  relatively  poorer

performance   of  the  construction  sector   was,

however,  compensated by the  performance  of  the

wholesale  and retail trade sector which  grew  at

25.8  per  cent  compared  to  6.1  per  cent  the

previous year.



<br><br><i>Manufacturing Sector</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturing industries contributed a total

of $2,378.8 million to GDP in 1973, an increase of

$545.6 million or 29.8 per cent (compared with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



28.2  per cent in 1972 and 25.0 per cent in 1971).

This   increase  in  the  value   added   by   the

manufacturing sector accounted for about one-third

of  the total increase of $1,637.9 million in GDP.

As a result of its rapid growth, the manufacturing

share  of GDP has increased from 16.7 per cent  in

1967 to 26.2 per cent in 1973, and with its direct

effect  in generating trade in the imports of  raw

materials  and  exports of manufactures,  and  its

indirect effect on the services sector, maintained

its  position  as the most dynamic sector  of  our

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manufacturing industries continued to show

increasing orientation towards exports and  higher

quality products. Overall, some 45 per cent of our

domestic  manufactures  were  exported.  In  1973,

developed  countries  continued  to  be  our  main

export market absorbing about half of our domestic

exports,  as  compared to less than  one-fifth  in

1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While increases in output and value added were

registered in all the major industry groups,  some

industries  have continued to be the mainstays  of

the  manufacturing sector. Petroleum  refining  is

still the largest individual industry in the value

of  its products, its contribution to total output

of  the  manufacturing sector accounting for  25.6

per cent. Its rate of growth in output was 9.9 per

cent  in  1973, compared to 8.2 per cent in  1972.

However, the contribution of petroleum refining to

the  total  value  added to  the  product  by  the

manufacturing  process in Singapore  has  declined

from  15.7  per cent in 1972 to 13.4 per  cent  in

1973.    The    electrical   machinery    industry

contribution  is  larger than  that  of  petroleum

refining, its value added accounting for 23.1  per

cent of total value added. Petroleum refining  has

in   this  respect  also  been  overtaken  by  the

transport     equipment    industry     (including

shipbuilding and ship-repairing). The  manufacture

of  textiles and garments and the more traditional

food,  beverages and tobacco industries are  other

large sectors taking 9.8 per cent and 8.9 per cent

respectively.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1973 has therefore been a good year for

Singapore's manufacturing sector, in spite of  the

uncertainties   prevailing  in  the  international

monetary  situation as well as  the  "oil  crisis"

which  developed towards the end of the year.  Our

strategy of promoting high technology and  export-oriented  industries  has  also  begun   to   show

encouraging  results  as  an  examination  of  the

foreign investments committed in 1973 will show.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total investment commitments in manufacturing

rose  from  $336 million in 1972 to  $819  million

last  year, an increase of 144 per cent. 01  these

commitments, the foreign investment component rose

from $255 million to $602 million, an increase  of

136  per  cent. Most of the investment commitments

were   for   higher  technology   industries,   in

particular  petroleum and petrochemical  products,

chemical   products,   metal   products/mechanical

engineering  and  professional,  scientific,   and

precision  equipment.  These  industries  together

accounted   for  86.7  per  cent  of   the   total

investments committed in 1973.



<br><br><i>Construction</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction industry in 1973 faced shortages

as  well  as  high prices of labour  and  building

materials,  and managed to grow by  only  9.1  per

cent  as compared with 39.1 per cent in 1972.  Its

percentage  share of GDP accordingly dropped  from

7.6 per cent in 1972 to 6.7 per cent in 1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private non-residential construction as a whole

showed  a  decline of $26.5 million in 1973  or  a

negative growth of 6.7 per cent primarily  due  to

the  completion  of  work on new  oil  refineries.

However,  other types of nonresidential  buildings

such  as  shopping and office complexes registered

increased growth. In the public sector, the growth

was  mainly  attributable to the  construction  of

public housing which grew by $86.2 million or 34.8

per   cent.   Some  contribution  to   growth   in

construction  was also provided by the  relatively

high   increase  of  21.2  per  cent  in   private

residential construction.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i> Wholesale and Retail Trade</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution from Wholesale and Retail Trade

activities  which had been slowing  down  for  the

past  five years picked up in 1973, increasing  at

the  record  rate of 25.8 per cent which  is  more

than  four  times the rate achieved  in  1972  and

about 1� times the average rate of growth for  the

period  1967-73. As a result, the  share  of  this

sector  in GDP grew from 26.3 per cent in 1972  to

27.1 per cent in 1973. The main cause for the high

rate  of  increase in 1973 was the world commodity

boom,  and  in particular the high produce  prices

especially   those  of  rubber   and   other   raw

materials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is shown by the fact that of the total

increase of $505.8 million in contribution to  GDP

by  this  sector,  entrepot  trade  accounted  for

$259.5 million, while domestic trade accounted for

the  remaining $246.3 million. The value added for

the  entrepot trade sector registered a growth  of

38.4  per  cent in 1973 (as compared to a negative

growth  of  0.8  per cent in 1972) while  domestic

trade  grew by 19.2 per cent (as compared to  10.1

per cent in 1972). As a result of its large growth

in  prices, not in volume, the relative  share  of

the entrepot trade in the total GDP which had been

registering a declining trend since 1969 showed an

increase  from 9.1 per cent in 1972  to  10.3  per

cent  in  1973,  while that of the domestic  trade

sector  in the total GDP showed a marginal decline

from 17.2 per cent to 16.8 per cent.



<br><br><i>External Trade</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of total external trade in 1973 soared

to new heights with increased prices registering a

record  increase of 36.9 per cent over 1972  which

more  than  trebled the 11.8 per cent accomplished

the  previous  year  despite  the  world  currency

problems and energy crisis. Of the total value  of

$21,476 million of external trade, $12,562 million

was  imports and $8,914 million exports.  For  the

second  year  running, the  rate  of  increase  of

exports exceeded that for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>



imports,  the  former reaching a spectacular  45.0

per  cent  and  the latter 31.7  per  cent.  Both,

however, showed higher rates of growth as compared

to  14.5  per  cent and 10.1 per cent  over  1972,

respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vigorous expansion of external trade in 1973

was  due  to the larger volume of trade  with  our

trading  partners, the significant price increases

in  most primary commodities such as rubber,  palm

oil  and  timber, as well as the general worldwide

inflation. High prices of primary commodities also

accounted  for the very high growth of  re-exports

in  1973  of  35.3  per  cent  far  exceeding  the

corresponding  rate of 1.7 per cent  achieved  the

previous year. It is heartening to note that  even

after  eliminating the effects of price increases,

total exports still registered an increase of 14.1

per  cent  which  is as high as that  attained  in

1972,  while  re-exports  grew  at  6.0  per  cent

(thrice  the  rate  of 1.7 per  cent  achieved  in

1972).  On  the other hand, the growth in  imports

after discounting for price increases was slightly

lower  at  some 6.2 per cent compared to 10.1  per

cent  in  the  previous year. The high  growth  in

exports  was  made possible mainly  by  the  rapid

expansion  in our domestic exports,  the  bulk  of

which  comprises  local manufactures.  At  current

prices, domestic exports reached $4,791 million in

1973, representing an increase of 54.5 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia remained Singapore's leading trading

partner,  accounting for 17 per cent of our  total

trade based on estimates of January-November  1973

figures. The currency split, the severance of  the

rubber  market, the separation of the joint  stock

exchange   as   well   as  the  establishment   of

independent   timber  boards  in   Singapore   and

Malaysia  emphasised further the  separateness  of

the  two  economies. These have had only a minimal

effect  upon  Singapore's trade  performance.  Our

trade  with  Malaysia remained buoyant.  Our  next

three   largest  trading  partners  in  order   of

importance  continued  to be  the  United  States,

Japan and the United Kingdom.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Government Services and Public Utilities</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1973, Government services contributed $559.7

million to GDP, an increase of 18.2 per cent  over

that  in  1972.  This rate of  growth  was  almost

treble  the previous year's rate of 6.7  per  cent

and was also higher than the average annual growth

rate  of  13.3 per cent for the 6-year  period  in

1967-73. However, the share of Government services

in  the total GDP was 6.2 per cent for 1973, which

was  slightly lower than that of 6.3 per cent  for

1972.  The  main  increases  were  in  respect  of

services   provided  for  internal  security   and

defence, education and health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public utilities sector maintained a steady

growth  rate  of 13.8 per cent which  is  slightly

higher  than the 13.1 per cent achieved  in  1972.

Its  share  of  GDP, however, declined  marginally

from 2.3 per cent to 2.2 per cent.



<br><br><i>Ownership of Dwellings</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value added by ownership of dwellings to GDP

increased  by  about  19.9 per  cent  from  $343.2

million  in  1972 to $411.4 million in  1973.  The

relatively  high growth rate was,  however,  lower

than  the 24.5 per cent achieved in 1972,  leading

therefore to a slight decline in its share of  GDP

from 4.6 per cent to 4.5 per cent.



<br><br><i>Other Services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution of this sector to GDP increased

by  $315.6  million  or 16.6  per  cent  to  reach

$2,221.9 million in 1973. The performance of  this

sector  was attributable mainly to the  growth  of

the banking and insurance, and tourism services in

the   private   sector,  as  well  as  Government-controlled  enterprises,  such  as  the  Port   of

Singapore Authority and the Singapore Airlines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting the Government's effort to promote

Singapore as a major financial centre of Asia, the

contribution  of the banking and insurance  sector

to GDP increased by $35.3 million or 23.8 per cent

in   1973.  Because  of  its  relevance   to   the

Government's monetary policies and the effects  of

such policies on our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>



Balance  of Payments, I propose to deal  with  the

growth  of  our  financial  institutions  at  some

length later in this Statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tourism sector registered a substantial

increase  in its value added of 27.9 per cent  (as

compared  to  26.1 per cent registered  in  1972),

increasing its share of GDP from 5.5 per  cent  in

1972  to  5.8  per cent in 1973. This high  growth

rate  is the result of the rapid growth of tourist

arrivals.  The number of visitors to Singapore  by

air  and  sea passed the million mark in  1973.  A

total  of  1,134,000  visitors (including  149,800

Malaysian visitors from West Malaysia) arrived  in

Singapore by air and sea, representing an increase

of  28.9 per cent over the corresponding total for

1972.   By   country   of   residence,   Australia

maintained   the  leading  position  among   major

overseas tourists-generating markets for the third

year  running,  with  173,900 visitors  giving  an

increase of 25.0 per cent over 1972. However,  the

fastest  growing market was Japan which  generated

113,400  visitors or an increase of 59.1 per  cent

over the preceding year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign military expenditure showed an increase

of  11.4  percent, from $141.1 million in 1972  to

$157.2 million in 1973. However, as a component of

total GDP, its share declined from 1.9 per cent in

1972 to 1.7 per cent in 1973.



<br><br><i>Gross Domestic Expenditure</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now examine the other indicator of

economic  health, the Gross Domestic  Expenditure.

In  1973, estimated Gross Domestic Expenditure  at

current  prices,  consisting  of  consumption  and

capital  formation, showed an increase of $1,655.3

million,  or 21.2 per cent over that in  1972,  to

reach a total of $9,450.6 million. The higher rate

of  increase compared to that experienced in  1972

of  about  15.5  per  cent is to  a  large  extent

because   of   price   increases   especially   in

consumption goods. The high growth rate of GDE was

reflected  mainly in the relatively higher  growth

of  consumption of goods and services of 25.4  per

cent   as   compared  to  that  of  fixed  capital

formation of 11.6 per cent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Consumption</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both private and public consumption grew

considerably in 1973, the former by 25.7 per  cent

from  $4,545.1 million in 1972 to $5,714.3 million

in  1973,  and  the latter by 23.7 per  cent  from

$905.2  million  to  $1,119.8  million.  Inflation

especially in imported food prices was responsible

for a large part of this growth. The corresponding

growth  rates in 1972 were 11.2 per cent and  14.5

per cent, respectively, which had already begun to

reflect  price  increases although at  much  lower

levels than 1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While every major component of private

consumption showed large increases in 1973,  three

components,  food,  clothing  and  transport   and

communications registered the fastest growth  with

rates  of more than twice or three times those  of

1972. Expenditure on food, accounting for 15.8 per

cent  of total GDE, grew by $366.3 million or 32.5

per  cent  to  $1,491.9  million,  reflecting  the

substantial  rise  in prices of  food,  especially

rice.  Clothing  expenditure increased  by  $208.2

million  or  31.6  per  cent  to  $867.6  million.

Expenditure   on   transport  and   communications

increased  by $179.5 million or 28.9 per  cent  to

$801.5  million. Another component of  consumption

expenditure that more than doubled the growth rate

in  1972  was expenditure on beverages and tobacco

which  grew by 19.7 per cent to $442.3 million  in

1973.



<br><br><i>Gross Fixed Capital Formation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building, other construction and works comprised

46.1 per cent of the total fixed capital formation

in   1973.  Capital  formation  in  machinery  and

equipment, largely directed towards expanding  the

manufacturing sector, accounted for  another  35.4

per  cent while expenditure on transport equipment

accounted for the remaining 18.5 per cent. Of  the

three components of capital formation, expenditure

on transport equipment registered the highest rate

of  increase of 61.8 per cent as compared to  only

3.9 per cent in 1972. A large part of the increase

was  due  to the purchase of aircraft. Expenditure

on buildings,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



other construction and works grew by 9.2 per cent,

which  was  disappointingly low compared  with  an

increase  of  39.9 per cent in 1972.  So  was  the

expenditure on machinery and equipment, which,  in

fact,  declined by 1.6 per cent as compared to  an

increase  of  19.1  per cent in 1972.  The  dismal

performance of these two categories of expenditure

was due partly to the fact that the balance of the

construction  work  for  the  oil  refineries  was

completed in early 1973, and partly perhaps to the

fall  in  investment commitments in  1972  arising

from currency uncertainties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall slower growth of Gross Fixed Capital

Formation  was experienced by both the public  and

private sectors, which grew by only 15.6 per  cent

(as compared to 54.8 per cent in 1972) and 9.8 per

cent (16.0 per cent), respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is disquieting that the growth in 1973 should

have been stimulated mainly by large increases  in

consumption   expenditure  while   gross   capital

formation  showed relatively low growth. Moreover,

even  the  low  growth  achieved  in  gross  fixed

capital  formation  was  contributed  largely   by

expenditure  on  transport  equipment   and   only

marginally by machinery and equipment. The latter,

in  fact, registered a decline. Growth in 1973 was

regrettably  generated substantially by  increased

consumption  spending,  which  was  manifested  in

higher  imports, while investments  declined  from

31.5  per cent in 1972 to 28.8 per cent of GDP  in

1973.



<br><br><i>Inflation and Prices</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I mentioned it briefly in the early part

of  this  Statement, it is necessary to expand  on

the  problem of inflation. This is in the main  of

external origin. The consumer price index rose  by

an  average of 22.9 per cent in 1973, compared  to

2.1 per cent in 1972. Food prices rose even faster

at  35.5  per  cent, compared to 2.7 per  cent  in

1972.  Even  this did not reflect the increase  in

price of rice, the staple food of the majority  in

Singapore.  Assisted  by a  ban  on  exports  from

Thailand, the retail price of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



Thai  rice  rose spectacularly from  35  cents  in

December  1972 to $1.07 cents per kati in December

1973,  or  an  increase of more than three  times.

This  was  the  sharpest increase in prices  since

1960  when  the  consumer price  index  was  first

introduced. Most of this inflation was  caused  by

external  forces,  outside our control.  Estimates

based on the unit value index for imports revealed

that  import prices rose by 12.5 per cent in  1973

while  food import prices rose by as much as  19.1

per  cent. Actual import price increases have,  of

course, been higher than these indices showed,  as

the  estimates have a downwards bias.  As  a  very

open  economy which imports most of its  food  and

raw  material  requirements from other  countries,

Singapore  is inevitably affected by any  rise  in

their   prices.  Inflation  measured  by  consumer

prices  in the advanced countries has been running

at rates of between 8.0 per cent to 20 per cent. A

good   indicator  of  the  worldwide  inflationary

pressures  can  be  found in the  World  Commodity

Price  Index compiled by the Economist. This shows

that  the price of food commodities rose  by  56.5

percentage   points  during  1973,  a   percentage

increase  of 35 per cent over the same period  one

year  ago.  The corresponding figures  for  fibres

were 109.1 percentage points and 56 per cent,  and

for  all items 73.3 percentage points and  51  per

cent, respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, domestic forces worked to accentuate the

"imported inflation". While increases in prices of

finished   goods  could  be  expected   from   the

increased   cost  of  imports  or  of   production

(including  higher  materials  import  cost),  the

inflationary  situation  gave  rise   to   greater

opportunities  for  profiteering,   and   traders,

including producers, often marked up prices higher

than  required  by the increase in costs.  On  the

other  hand, consumers often over-reacted  to  the

inflationary   situation  by  panic   buying   and

hoarding  of  certain  commodities,  creating   or

aggravating a tight supply situation, and  causing

the much higher prices they feared.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government took whatever measures were

practical to tackle the inflation problem locally.

Apart  from  monetary and fiscal  policies,  which

will be discussed below, the Government thought it

desirable  to diversify the sources  of  our  most

essential  food supplies as well  as  of  the  raw

materials for our industries. It decided to revive

the  scheme  for  a  rice  stockpile  which  would

eliminate  any  fear  of  shortages  by   ensuring

availability of supplies for six months and  would

result in more stable prices for consumers.  Also,

the   Sugar  Industry  of  Singapore,   in   which

Government  has  an interest, by  prudent  forward

purchasing, had assured the availability and price

stability of its sugar supplies. Some panic buying

of  sugar occurred on one or two occasions  during

the  year, but confidence was quickly restored  by

plentiful supplies being quickly made available by

the  Company  at the same unchanged  price  of  45

cents  per  kati, which it undertook to  maintain.

Moves  to  stamp out or reduce profiteering  which

was undoubtedly the cause of these and other panic

situations   have,   so  far,  proved   difficult.

However,  credit  must be given to  the  Community

Centres  which  helped to sell rice and  publicise

its availability at reasonable prices, to the NTUC

for  the  good start it made in helping to  ensure

lower    prices   for   consumers   through    its

establishment of Welcome Supermarkets, and to  the

Armed  Forces  which also opened  its  first  SAFE

Supermarket. These actions served notice upon  our

wholesalers  and retailers that their  greedy  and

anti-social actions will lead to consumer  support

going   permanently  to  public  and  quasi-public

enterprise  and corporations and affect  adversely

their  system of private enterprise, which if  not

abused  during periods of shortages, is  the  most

efficient as it allows for free competition.



<br><br><i>Employment and Wages</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now touch briefly on the employment

position  in 1973. It is estimated that more  than

50,000 new jobs were created in 1973, the bulk  of

which was found in manufacturing (24,400), trade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



(11,700), transport and communications (4,200) and

other  services  (7,300). Such a massive  new  job

creation  was,  however, not in  accord  with  our

strategy  of raising the productivity  of  labour.

This  increased by only 3.6 per cent in 1973, less

than  half that achieved during 1970-72 which  was

7.7  per cent, a result which runs counter to  our

objective  of  enhancing  efficiency  through  the

upgrading   of   industries   and   orderly    but

significantly  large enough wage  increases.  Home

market  supply activities (wholesale,  retail  and

other   services  activities)  in   which   labour

productivity  was far below the national  average,

continued to absorb large numbers of workers which

should,  for  the  greater part,  have  gone  into

manufacturing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Wages Council increase for the

lowest paid workers in 1973 was 9 per cent with no

setoff  of wage benefits given under normal yearly

increments   in  wage  schemes.  But  even   this,

equivalent  to an increase of about  15  per  cent

monthly  wages, was in due course  offset  by  the

rapid  rise in the cost of living which, according

to  the  present imperfect cost of  living  index,

averaged  22.9 per cent last year. Real wages  for

workers therefore declined. Furthermore, as prices

increased, on the very rough figures available, it

is  thought that business profit margins  for  the

manufacturing   sector   as   a   whole   expanded

considerably  over the previous  year.  Therefore,

despite  having  to pay the NWC  agreed  increased

wages  in 1973, employers apparently did not  feel

sufficiently  induced  to  economise   on   scarce

labour.



<br><br><i>Domestic Monetary Situation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must now examine our domestic monetary

situation.  Singapore continued to grow vigorously

as  a  financial  centre  in  1973  despite  anti-inflationary policies restraining credit expansion

and   the  influx  of  US  dollars.  As  Singapore

expanded  its  international financial  links  and

developed   increasing   sophistication   in   its

domestic  monetary institutions  and  instruments,

the   monetary  and  other  sectors  became   more

interdependent.  It is therefore  of  interest  to

review the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



major developments in the domestic monetary sector

in the past year.



<br><br><i>Financial Institutions</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1973 witnessed a growing sophistication in the

development of our money and capital markets, with

the  establishment of 11 new banks and one merger,

bringing the total number of banks as at  the  end

of December to 54. One local bank (the first local

bank  to be formed since the establishment of  the

Development  Bank of Singapore in 1968)  commenced

operation  in February 1974. Total bank assets  in

1973  grew  by  31 per cent which, although  lower

than  the  35  per  cent  achieved  in  1972,  was

attained  in  spite of monetary measures  to  curb

credit expansion. Total deposits increased  by  23

per  cent,  slightly  lower than  in  1972.  Total

assets  of  finance companies  rose  at  a  higher

annual growth rate of 33 per cent compared with 23

per  cent in 1972. Deposits also grew at a  higher

annual  rate of 25 per cent compared with  24  per

cent  the  previous  year while  total  loans  and

advances  grew at the even higher rate of  45  per

cent  as  against  28  per  cent  for  1972.  Hire

purchase  finance and housing loans again absorbed

the  major  portion  of finance companies'  credit

operations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its fifth year, the Asian Dollar Market

continued to expand rapidly, stimulated partly  by

the  Government's  tax  concessions  and  exchange

control   liberalisation  measures.  The  market's

resources  swelled  to over  $15.5  billion  (over

US$6.3  billion)  by the end of  1973,  showing  a

growth rate of almost 85 per cent during the year.

Although  in percentage terms this is  lower  than

the  growth  rates of previous years, in  absolute

terms,  the  increase is still the largest  annual

increase  so  far  and  the  Asian  Dollar  Market

continued to generate international confidence and

interest in Singapore as a financial centre. There

were  significant developments also in  the  Asian

Dollar  bond  market with the  floating  in  early

November  1973 of the United Overseas  Bank  US$30

million convertible Asian Dollar bearer bonds, and

in early December 1973 of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



US$10  million  Asian Dollar bonds by  the  Orient

Leasing  Company of Japan. Further, Asian Currency

Units   (ACUs)  have  been  participating  in   an

increased number of consortia loans in 1973. As at

the  end  of  1973,  17 merchant  banks,  actively

involved in the underwriting business and  in  the

Asian Dollar Market, supplemented and complimented

the services provided by banks. The three discount

houses   grew  significantly  with  total   assets

expanding more than seven times, from $49  million

as  at the end of November 1972 to $369 million as

at the end of December 1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year 1973 saw two events affecting the Stock

Exchange  in  Singapore, namely, the establishment

of  the  Securities  Industry Council  in  January

1973, and the break-up of the joint Stock Exchange

of  Malaysia and Singapore in May 1973 along  with

the termination of the Currency Interchangeability

Agreement  with  Malaysia  and  the  new  exchange

control  measures  imposed by  Malaysia.  However,

practically all the counters which were listed  in

the  previous joint Stock Exchange were listed  in

the  Stock  Exchange of Singapore  throughout  the

rest  of  the  year. The rate of new  listings  of

Singapore incorporated companies was also  stepped

up. The new Stock Exchange therefore went off to a

good  start in June 1973 and the current depressed

state  of  the  Stock Market must be  regarded  as

contemporary  with  similar  conditions  in  major

stock markets round the world.



<br><br><i>Monetary Policies</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the uncertainties of the

international    currency    markets    and    the

inflationary  pressures within  the  economy,  our

monetary  policies were designed to stabilise  the

economy without adverse effects on our growth as a

financial   centre.   Anti-inflationary   monetary

measures   implemented  in   1973   included   the

imposition of a 5 per cent (subsequently raised to

9  per  cent)  Special Deposit on the net  foreign

liabilities  of banks, the raising of the  minimum

reserve ratios for banks and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



finance   companies  and  the  increase  of   bank

interest  rates for deposits and loans  by  �  per

cent  in April and subsequently by another  1  per

cent in December. Banks were also requested by the

Monetary Authority of Singapore in early  1973  to

exercise   caution   in   extending   loans    for

speculation  in the then feverishly bullish  stock

market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures were intended to counter unstable

developments   in   the   international   monetary

situation which were contributing increasingly  to

imported  inflation  in  Singapore.  Despite   the

devaluation  of the US Dollar for the second  time

in  February  1973,  the US  Dollar  continued  to

remain under speculative pressure in international

currency markets. The situation developed into one

of widespread floating exchange rates in March. As

the  major  EEC  currencies and the  Japanese  yen

floated upwards against the US Dollar to which the

Singapore  dollar was then pegged, an artificially

low  external  value resulted  for  the  Singapore

dollar,   which   thereby   attracted   a    large

speculative   inflow   of   foreign   funds   into

Singapore,   swelling   the   already    excessive

liquidity in the economy. It was therefore decided

in  June  1973  to allow the Singapore  dollar  to

float  upwards  to  stem  any  further  inflow  of

unwanted  funds. The Singapore Dollar went  up  to

11.8  per cent over par exchange rate with the  US

Dollar  in  July 1973. At present  it  is  ranging

between 2-3 per cent above par.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as an anti-inflationary monetary

policy  was adopted, the need to promote a healthy

growth  of  the  monetary sector  was  recognised.

Measures  to  stimulate the  growth  of  financial

institutions  included the reduction of  corporate

tax on income earned on offshore loans from 40 per

cent  to  10  per  cent,  exemption  from  tax  on

interest  received from Asian Dollar bonds  issued

in Singapore and the waiver of stamp duty on Asian

Dollar bond certificates and promissory notes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



issued  by  or in favour of or negotiated  through

merchant banks. Exchange controls were liberalised

in  July  1973 and Singapore residents were  given

permission to invest up to specified limits in the

Asian   Dollar  Market.  The  Monetary   Authority

continued  to  provide  the discount  houses  with

lender  of  last resort facilities with occasional

intervention  in  the money  market  in  order  to

smoothen out unhealthy fluctuations. Priority  was

also  given  for the establishment of  a  training

programme to upgrade the skills of bank officers.



<br><br><i>Balance of Payments</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of uncertainties in international trade

and  of  monetary  instability,  our  balance   of

payments  for  1973  continued to  be  favourable,

although the overall surplus of $333.6 million for

1973 was lower than the $582.6 million surplus for

1972.  One  reason which slowed down  the  further

accumulation  of official foreign reserves  during

1973  was that in June 1973, the Singapore  dollar

was floated upwards to relieve the pressure caused

by  an  abnormal  influx  of  US  dollars  due  to

international  investors seeking a safer  currency

than the then weak US Dollar. Under the regime  of

a   floating   exchange  rate,  there   was   less

speculative  incentive to convert  into  Singapore

dollars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The persistent trade deficit, which increased in

1973  by  $301  million  to  $3,471  million,  was

financed largely, as in the past, by earnings from

the services sector as well as by capital inflows.

Recorded  net earnings from services increased  by

$102  million to $901 million, largely on  account

of  higher  net  receipts from investment  income,

travel and other transportation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the capital account, net long-term capital

imports  fell by $117.6 million to $622.5 million.

Government   official  long-term  borrowing   also

declined as there were in 1973 no substantial  new

loans of the nature of the DM bond or Asian Dollar

loan  of 1972. Private long-term capital, however,

increased by $24.9 million to $577.1 million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Official Reserves</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year ended with Singapore's total official

assets  standing at $5,707.5 million, an  increase

of  $776.6 million from the $4,930.9 million  held

at   the  end  of  1972.  The  healthy  state   of

Singapore's reserves will stand us in  good  stead

to  weather  any storms which the oil crisis,  the

worldwide inflation, or the international monetary

and balance of payments uncertainties may bring in

1974.



<br><br>[The Minister for Finance continued --]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be useful for me here to recapitulate

the  main  points of this Economic Survey  and  to

state what I consider to be its main conclusions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Survey has shown that despite

adverse    circumstances,   Singapore    performed

reasonably well in 1973 to achieve the high growth

in  Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at current prices

of  22.0 per cent. We have not yet constructed  an

accurate GDP deflator. An estimate of real  growth

is  around 11 per cent. Our leading growth sector,

manufacturing, continued to maintain its buoyancy,

growing   at   29.8  per  cent.   External   trade

registered a record increase of 36.9 per cent with

exports  growing at a very high rate of  45.0  per

cent,  exceeding the growth rate  for  imports  of

31.7  per  cent. The contribution to  GDP  of  the

wholesale  and retail trade sector (consisting  of

entrepot and domestic trade) grew at 25.8 per cent

which was more than four times the growth achieved

in   1972.  The  value  added  by  entrepot  trade

increased at a record rate of 38.4 per cent  while

that  of  domestic trade grew by  19.2  per  cent.

Other  Sectors  registering high  growth  included

government services (which grew at 18.2 per cent),

public  utilities  (13.8 per cent),  ownership  of

dwellings  (19.9 per cent), banking and  insurance

(23.8 per cent), and tourism (27.9 per cent).  The

contribution  of foreign military  expenditure  to

GDP   rose   by   11.4  per  cent.  However,   the

construction  sector showed a poorer  performance,

growing at only 9.1 per cent. The surplus  in  our

balance of payments was maintained although at a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



reduced  sum  of $333.6 million, and our  official

reserves  ended  the year with a healthy  $5,707.5

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the economy expanded creditably in 1973,

there were major weaknesses or adverse factors  in

our  economic  position. First,  despite  a  full-employment  situation, economic growth  last  year

was contributed largely by a quantitative increase

in  the  labour  force rather  than  by  increased

productivity.  More  than  50,000  new  jobs  were

created, representing an increase of 7.7 per  cent

of  the employed labour force. The value-added per

worker  rose by only 3.6 per cent, less than  half

that achieved over the period 1970-1972. This runs

counter to the results we expected from our policy

measures   for   an  increasingly  labour   scarce

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the high growth of Gross Domestic

Expenditure was achieved largely through  a  rapid

growth  of  consumption of 25.4  per  cent,  while

gross  fixed capital formation rose by  only  11.6

per   cent.   Economic  expansion  was   therefore

sustained mainly by rising consumption rather than

by  increased  savings channelled into  productive

investments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, while there was high economic growth,

there  were  also strong inflationary  conditions.

Consumer  prices rose by an average  of  22.9  per

cent over the previous year, largely the result of

importing  worldwide inflation. As  inflation  for

many  countries was at equally high or even higher

rates,  our export competitiveness was fortunately

not  jeopardized.  However,  the  rising  cost  of

living  severely  affected  the  real  income   or

purchasing  power of the earnings of our  workers,

particularly those in the lower income groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, there appeared to be no solution in

sight    to   the   problems   of   a   disordered

international  monetary  system,  and  the   sharp

changes in rates and general uncertainties of  the

major currencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, 1973 saw the beginnings of the

energy crisis and the problems



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



which  a reduction in oil supplies and higher  oil

prices  would bring upon all economic  and  social

activities  as  well  as  upon  the  international

balance of payments position of different nations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning our attention from the economic scene in

1973 to that of the current year, what can we  see

regarding  our  prospects for economic  growth  in

1974?  And  what  are the broad economic  policies

that are required to overcome the problems that we

are likely to face in the coming months?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my earlier budgets, it was possible for me to

describe  external factors such  as  international

inflationary   conditions,  monetary  instability,

economic  stagnation or recession as looming  over

the  horizon  or posing a threat. But  they  never

posed   as  immediate  threats  to  the  continued

expansion  of  our  domestic economy.  We  are  no

longer  in  that,  it  seems  to  us  now,   happy

position. These recent external events have become

factors unfavourable to our domestic economy.  The

problems   carried  over  from  1973   which   are

presented  by the oil crisis, and by inter-related

worldwide  inflation,  monetary  instability   and

currency   rate  uncertainties,  restrictions   on

international  trade  and economic  stagnation  or

recession,  will  directly  affect  our   internal

conditions  either for growth or stagnation.  Some

examination  of  the  impact  of  these   external

factors  on our economy would therefore be  useful

before we examine the purely domestic factors.



<br><br><i>External Factors: The Oil Crisis</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world entered 1974 in a somewhat better state

in  regard  to oil supplies than it had  dared  to

hope  during the earlier months of the oil crisis.

As  a  result of the decision in late December  to

restore  production cut-backs from 25 per cent  to

15  per  cent  of  the September 1973  level,  the

threat  of oil starvation in 1974 becomes somewhat

less likely. However, until a final settlement  is

reached in the Middle East negotiations for peace,

it would be premature to assume that oil embargoes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



and production cut-backs could not be extended and

reimposed  or made even more severe  than  in  the

past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of higher oil prices, in any case,

remains.  The average price of crude  oil  is  now

well  over US$8 a barrel, a four-fold increase  in

price over the pre-October 1973 rate. It may  rise

even  higher  depending on  the  price  which  oil

producers  may have to pay to the OPEC states  for

what  is known to the industry as "buy back"  oil,

oil which producing countries are free to sell  to

third  parties  if  they choose.  Some  very  high

prices indeed have been paid in a few auctions  of

such  oil,  which could eventually  influence  oil

producers' and therefore oil consumers' prices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High oil prices impose very large burdens on the

balance  of  payments of consumer  nations.  These

burdens on developing nations with limited foreign

reserves  and  rapidly dwindling foreign  aid  may

prove  unmanageable. They also add to the  already

severe  inflationary pressures affecting  most  of

the  economies of the world since the second  half

of  last  year. Of course, they bring to  the  oil

producing countries greatly increased oil revenues

which they are unable to absorb by expenditure  on

even  massive  development projects at  home.  The

resulting revenue surpluses accordingly accumulate

as  very  large  holdings  of  external  reserves,

estimated  to grow at over $50 billion or  more  a

year.   Reserves   of   such   magnitude,   unless

sterilized in long term asset holdings, are likely

to cause monetary instability and violent currency

rate   fluctuations  by  its  movements  in  large

capital  flows  and  reflows,  from  currency   to

currency  seeking  the most profitable  or  safest

investments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These disturbances could have disastrous

international consequences. Much depends upon  how

the  large  oil importing and exporting  countries

react  to the oil shortages and increased  prices.

Already,  there have been sharp movements  in  the

exchange  rates of major currencies. The date  for

the  reform  of the international monetary  system

will be set back indefinitely as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



the  major  developed countries  turn  from  their

contemplation    of    its   seemingly    academic

complexities  to  grapple with  their  own  urgent

monetary   problems.  An  economic   slowdown   is

expected   in  the  major  industrial   countries,

accentuating  the trend which was developing  even

before  the  oil  crisis. According  to  the  OECD

estimates, made in December, 1973, the forecast of

growth  has been scaled down in the United  States

to  only  2 per cent in 1974 (from 6 per  cent  in

1973),  in Japan to 8 per cent (from 11 per cent),

and  in  West  Germany to 3 per cent (from  6  per

cent).  If,  in addition, the large oil  importing

countries pursue beggar-thy-neighbour policies  by

resorting  to competitive devaluations to  promote

exports  and  setting up trade  barriers  to  curb

imports  and  reduce  their  balance  of  payments

deficits,  then  the world will head  for  a  very

severe economic depression.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, there are welcome signs of a

general, if not unanimous, recognition by both oil

consuming and producing nations that the  problems

of  energy shortages and pricing should be  solved

by  consultation together, and not by the attempts

of  individual  countries or groups  of  countries

acting  alone without regard to their  effects  on

other  countries. There is awareness also  of  the

need to avoid a disruption of the world trade  and

monetary  system. There even is growing acceptance

of   a  moral  obligation  by  the  oil  producing

countries  to channel part of their oil  surpluses

through  the  IMF, the World Bank or other  multi-national  banks  to the developing  countries,  in

particular,  to  assist them in their  balance  of

payments  and  development financing difficulties.

There  is  hope therefore of an accommodation  and

adjustment between oil consuming and oil producing

nations,  and  of  a new equilibrium  between  the

prices  of  oil  and of other goods and  services,

which will remove or reduce the present resort  to

bartering  with  the  oil  producing  nations  and

restore  the  trade  and payments  functions  once

again to the world economic system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an equilibrium must, in any case, eventually

be reached even without



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



deliberate agreement. In the long  term,  the

price   of   oil  must  take  into   account   the

possibilities  and the cost of working  previously

uneconomic oil deposits, of winning oil from shale

or  tar  sands, and of discovering large  new  oil

sources through the intense exploration which  has

been  stimulated in other areas. And it would also

certainly  have  regard to the ready  availability

and  cost of alternative proven sources of energy,

such as nuclear power.



<br><br><i>Singapore's Economic Situation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until such an equilibrium is reached, whether

sooner  or later, each country must cope, as  best

it  can and without beggaring its neighbour,  with

the   problems  as  they  affect  its   individual

economy. How will Singapore manage?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One effect of the oil crisis will be on our

balance  of  payments. Unless we  can  reduce  our

present  domestic consumption of oil of  around  2

million  tons  annually, Singapore  will  have  to

spend  more  than $290 million this  year  on  oil

imports for purely domestic consumption equivalent

to 6 per cent of the value of Singapore's domestic

exports last year. If there is no serious downturn

in  international trade, however, we may expect to

recover  some  of the increased  cost  of  oil  by

higher   export   earnings   on   those   of   our

manufactures, including petroleum products,  which

use  higher cost oil among their inputs.  We  need

not  fear being undersold as our competitors  will

also  have to pass on such higher costs  to  their

customers. It is possible also that with the  OPEC

countries'    large    oil    revenues     seeking

international investments, capital inflows into  a

financial  centre such as Singapore  can  be  more

than  sustained. However, if, by a combination  of

adverse circumstances, we should end the year with

an  overall  adverse balance of payments  for  the

first  time in many years, we shall, in any  case,

have  more than adequate reserves to tide us  over

the   period  until  stability  returns  into  the

international economic system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another effect will be on the already serious

inflation in Singapore. The oil



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



industry has estimated that an increase of US$1 in

the  price  of crude oil would raise the  cost  of

living  or the rate of inflation by 1 per cent  in

industrialised countries. Though the impact  would

be  less  for a country like Singapore,  there  is

unlikely  to be any relief for us from the  burden

of imported inflation this year or from the direct

effects  of  the higher price of oil  on  our  own

manufactures. Inflation will, unfortunately,  work

its relentless way into our economy through higher

prices  in  partially oil based products  such  as

chemical  fertilisers for food; steel, cement  and

other   building   materials;   paper,   synthetic

textiles,   plastics  and  many  other   essential

commodities  we  have to import, and  through  the

escalating   costs   of   transportation,   public

utilities  and other services. In spite of  better

weather and better harvests, there appears also no

sign  as yet of any substantial drop in the prices

of  food grains or other agricultural commodities.

Perhaps  exporters are holding back sales to  keep

up  high prices and importers are buying more than

their  immediate  needs to store  against  a  poor

harvest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is very little one can do about such high

import prices except to ensure that these are  not

aggravated  by manipulation and profiteering.  The

Government  will  take measures  to  minimise  the

effects  of inflation. Tariffs will be continually

reviewed  for the purpose of removing or  reducing

them,  where  possible, to  curb  inflation.  More

consumer     cooperatives     and     Welcome-type

supermarkets  will be helped to set themselves  up

in  the  main population centres. But, I  strongly

urge  that  our  people  should  restrain  demand,

refraining from hoarding and purchasing in advance

of their normal requirements. People should become

more  selective  in their shopping  for  essential

commodities.   Cutting   down   expenditures    on

unnecessary purchases and increasing their savings

and  channelling them into productive investments,

our people can help themselves to fight inflation.

At  the  same  time,  traders caught  manipulating

supplies  to raise prices, retailers giving  short

weight of rice or bread will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



find  their  business  cut off  by  withdrawal  of

supplies or licences to import or export.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, price controls are not suitable as a

means  of curbing inflation in a very open economy

like  Singapore's. Even large countries, like  the

USA which is less dependent upon imports and which

has adopted the system of price controls, have had

only  modest  and  temporary  success  in  curbing

inflation. When controls continue beyond realistic

limits,  goods  disappear. So  when  controls  are

lifted,  another  bout  of large  price  increases

immediately occurs. My view is that it  is  better

for  Singapore to let market forces  operate.  But

checks  will be mounted to ensure that wholesalers

will  deal  fairly with the public, and themselves

help the Government to check the manipulation of a

minority,  for  which they, as a  class,  get  the

blame.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of inflation is a complex one with

implications  on  growth.  If  the  wrong  set  of

solutions  is  implemented, economic  growth  will

suffer,  generating unemployment which is  a  more

serious problem than that of an inflation. As long

as  the  economy  is  able through  larger  export

earnings to bear the increase in import prices due

to  inflation,  we shall be able to  maintain  our

economic  growth. There may be need,  however,  to

correct  the adverse effects of inflation  on  the

real  wages of workers and this will no  doubt  be

considered  in  due course in the  National  Wages

Council's  recommendations on wage increases  this

year.



<br><br><i>Fiscal and Monetary Policies</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a situation of rising prices, the Government

is  faced with a difficult policy choice. There is

an   inherent  conflict  between  the   need   for

increased expenditure to sustain expansion of  the

economy   and   the   equal  need   to   alleviate

inflationary    pressures   by   curbing    public

expenditure.  And in deciding policy  we  have  to

take   note  of  the  economic  recession   widely

forecasted  in America and the industrial  centres

in the latter part of the year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A policy of cutting down public expenditure

indiscriminately would sacrifice growth,  and  not

help  reduce,  to  any significant  extent,  price

increases.  The best policy in these circumstances

is  to  dampen increases in recurrent expenditure,

but  at  the  same  time, to  allow  in  full  all

development expenditure required for the expansion

of   productive  capacity  essential  to  economic

growth.  The  budgets of Government,  and  of  the

statutory  boards, will therefore  be  scrutinised

both  for their growth potential as well as  their

inflationary impact. The measures we  take  should

have  the  beneficial effect of increasing  public

savings and investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monetary policy will likewise balance the

objective  of achieving sustained economic  growth

and the need to dampen inflationary pressures. The

existing  anti-inflationary monetary  policy  will

not be relaxed, but consideration will be given to

the  need  for  minimising as far as possible  any

financial  constraints  to  economic  growth.   To

reinforce  this objective, a package  of  monetary

measures  will  be  implemented  by  the  Monetary

Authority of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Authority is consulting with the

Association  of Banks to raise interest  rates  on

deposits to encourage higher savings. At the  same

time  banks'  prime lending rate  will  be  raised

slightly to check wasteful spending as well as  to

align it with comparable interest rates to reflect

the real cost of funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Special Deposit ratio which was

modified from 9 per cent to 5 per cent in December

1973  will  be  reduced to  zero  per  cent.  This

Special  Deposit requirement was imposed to  check

the  large  influx of foreign funds in early  1973

and  has  served  its purpose. The funds  released

will   be   available  for  financing   productive

activities  within  a system of  selective  credit

control administered by the Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Authority would also be ready to

consider some reduction in the reserves ratios  of

banks and finance companies provided the resources

are  used  to  finance investment  and  productive

activities in priority sectors in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



economy. Banks and finance companies will have  to

submit  monthly  data  on  their  loan  operations

relating  to  changes  and  usage  of  credit   by

purposes.   This  information  will   be   closely

monitored  by the Authority within a framework  of

ceilings  and  guidelines for  credit  to  various

sectors.  Where  credit is being  channelled  into

productive activities the Authority will  be  more

flexible. But credit for inflationary spending and

speculation will be reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all these efforts, we may still find

inflation  too obstinate a disease to  respond  to

local  treatment.  We need not  be  overcome  with

gloom  if  these unsettling economic circumstances

persist.  Nor  should we be  dismayed  if  in  the

latter  part  of  this year, as a  consequence  of

inflation  and the inability of the major  nations

to  keep up demand at inflated prices, a recession

of  serious proportions sets in. This is  not  the

first nor will it be the last time that we have to

meet   the   challenge   of  adverse   conditions.

Singapore  overcame successfully even more  severe

disruptions like separation from Malaysia in  1965

and  the  rundown of British Bases  in  1968.  Our

survival  depends, as then, upon a robust approach

to  life, that the world does not owe us a living.

Nothing is for free. Hence, the virtues of  thrift

and  hard work and our resilience and capacity  to

adapt  to  changing circumstances saw us  through.

The  question is whether we have not already  been

softened  by  the  increasing  affluence  now   so

clearly  and  even  delightfully  evident  in  the

colourful dress and appearance of our bright young

things. This change in life style is shown in  our

sombre statistics indicating a propensity to  save

less and consume more. With annual economic growth

no  longer  to be expected as of right,  we  shall

have to rely on the qualities of hard work, thrift

and grit to see us through a difficult time ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1974, we are in better shape than we were in

1965  or  1968  to  deal with  a  severe  economic

crisis.  First,  there  is now  full,  or  perhaps

overfull, employment to cushion the shock of any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



business  recession  and  retrenchment.   If   our

economy does not grow quite as fast as in the past

or even if it stagnates for some time, we need not

fear,  as  we  did  in the past,  the  spectre  of

widespread unemployment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, our economy is now more diversified

than  it  was  in the Sixties. Being more  broadly

based   on   manufacturing,  trade,  construction,

transportation,  tourism and a  growing  financial

sector,  the  economy should  be  better  able  to

withstand a recession in any one sector or market.

Specific anti-recession measures could be  put  in

hand,  if  necessary.  For example,  the  enormous

backlog  of Housing Board building could  take  up

any  slack of building activity as well as provide

job  opportunities for those thrown out  of  work.

Other public sector projects can also be used  for

the  same  purposes. Short of a  disastrous  world

slump, which economic forecasts consider unlikely,

Singapore should be able to earn a modest, if  not

comfortable, livelihood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must, however, improve our ability to cope

with  the  present  circumstances.  What  specific

remedies can we devise in each sector?



<br><br><i>Manufacturing Sector</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the leading growth sector of our economy,

manufacturing   will  continue  to   receive   the

Government's full encouragement and support either

for  new  industries or for expansion of  existing

ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choice of industries must finally lie with

the  investors or entrepreneurs. But the Singapore

Government   and   its   agency,   the    Economic

Development  Board,  will  always  give  help   on

preferred   new  industries  or  assist   in   the

upgrading of existing ones which take into account

Singapore's existing and future factor endowments.

We   shall  press  forward  with  our  policy   of

promoting    skill-intensive,   high    technology

industries.  This policy is showing  results.  The

progress  in  upgrading industries can  be  gauged

from the expected labour productivity (measured by

value added per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



worker)  of  the  new  industries.  It  has   been

estimated that the average value added per  worker

of the major new projects under implementation and

in  the pipeline will show a 120 per cent increase

over  that of similar industry groups in 1973.  We

do  well  therefore to concentrate our efforts  on

the  industrial  promotion of these  higher  value

added  industries  and to offer  them  appropriate

incentives.  Moreover, our strategy  of  enhancing

the value added by our manufacturing operations is

entirely  appropriate in the current situation  of

rising freight, fuel and raw material costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High technology industries require a large supply

of  skilled  workers.  While the  Government  will

continue for the time being to be liberal  in  its

immigration  policy  towards skilled  workers,  an

adequate solution can be provided only by creating

our  own ample supply of trained workers. We  will

accordingly  continue  to  make  substantial  sums

available  for  massive technical  and  industrial

training,  and the Government has earmarked  $12.3

million  for such training in FY 1974 compared  to

$9.7  million  in  FY  1973. With  the  successful

implementation of our industrial training  policy,

our  dependence on immigration of foreign  workers

for   growth  can  then  be  scaled  down  to   an

acceptably modest level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Board now has under its

administration  various  training  programmes  for

workers. In industrial training, we have the joint

training  programme, overseas training  programme,

industrial  development  scholarship  scheme   and

apprenticeship training scheme. There is also  the

new   industrial  training  subsidy   scheme   for

sophisticated  industries  which  I  announced  in

October   1973.  The  response  to  this  training

subsidy  scheme  has been very good.  So  far,  42

companies have expressed interest and 12 have  put

up concrete proposals for training. Moreover, last

year,  53  trainees were sent overseas  under  the

overseas  training  programme and  177  machinists

underwent   training  under  the  joint   training

programme. All the training



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>



programmes I have mentioned are regularly reviewed

so that our targets of building up and providing a

large  reservoir of skilled workers can be met  in

the most efficient way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our industrialisation gathering momentum, I

expect  that  in 1974 our strategies in  upgrading

industries  and providing adequate incentives  and

training  subsidies  for  manufacturers  will   be

sufficient  to cushion any decline in  performance

by the manufacturing sector caused by the economic

slowdown   in   the  industrial   countries.   Our

manufacturing industries should be  able  to  meet

the challenges posed by the energy crisis, without

too serious a dislocation of their operations. The

high  oil  prices should be reflected in terms  of

higher  prices  for our industrial  goods.  In  an

inflation-prone world, when other countries with a

higher base in manufacturing costs are expected to

inflate by 7-12 per cent in 1974 (depending on the

countries  concerned),  our  competitive  edge  in

overseas  markets  will be maintained,  as  buyers

will   still   find  Singapore  goods   relatively

competitive even at the new prices.



<br><br><i>Employment, Productivity and Wages</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a situation of full employment, labour

productivity   through   the   modernisation   and

upgrading   of  industries  can  be  promoted   by

appropriate  wage policies, formulated  to  induce

employers to be more efficient in their  usage  of

scarce  labour. A desirable secondary  product  of

such  policies  is  to help workers,  particularly

those in the lower income brackets, to recover  by

wage increases the loss in their real incomes  due

to inflation. But these wage increases would still

have  to  be related to productivity increases  to

avoid generating further inflationary pressures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To upgrade industries and raise productivity,

wages  must  be made sufficiently high to  attract

labour  from  low productivity sectors  which  are

less  able  to  afford such wages  into  the  high

productivity sectors. There need not be any  undue

concern that somewhat higher increases in wages in

1974   for  Singapore  workers  will  affect   our

competitiveness



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>



in    overseas   markets.   According    to    the

International Labour Organisation (ILO) Year  Book

of  Statistics 1972, manufacturing wages in  Korea

since  1967 have gone up by 37.8 per cent  and  in

Hong Kong by 14 per cent. These countries are  our

major competitors. On the other hand, according to

our own Census of Industrial Production, Singapore

experienced increases in wages in manufacturing by

much  less  over  the same period. Moreover,  when

compared  to the developed countries  to  which  a

major portion of our exports are destined, that is

the  United States of America, the United Kingdom,

Japan  and  West  Germany,  workers  in  Singapore

obtained much lower wages, compared to workers  of

the United States of America who draw six times as

much,  of  the United Kingdom 3.6 times, of  Japan

3.1  times  and of West Germany 3.7 times.  Higher

wage  increases for Singapore in 1974 will  narrow

this  differential only very slightly,  given  the

wage cost spirals in these countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of greater concern would be the risk of

unemployment considered in the economy as a whole,

which we must weigh against the beneficial effects

of  a  higher  wage rise. Although  employers  are

expected to pass on at least a part of their  wage

increases in prices to their customers,  there  is

still  the  possibility  of  an  undesirably  high

degree  of  unemployment.  In  our  labour  scarce

economy, however, a slackening only of the present

overfull employment situation could be beneficial.



<br><br><i>Trade Sector</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the international monetary uncertainties

and  the  oil  crisis, Singapore's external  trade

grew  at  a record rate in 1973. In 1974, however,

the  deflationary policies already adopted by  the

major   industrial  countries  to  curb  inflation

coupled with the adverse effects of the oil crisis

and    the   consequent   uncertainties   of   the

international situation are expected to slow  down

the  economic growth of these countries  in  1974.

World trade is therefore unlikely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>



to  show the boom conditions it exhibited in 1973,

and  the economic slowdown of our trading partners

will  equally affect our trade with them.  On  the

brighter side, however, our neighbouring countries

in  the  South-East Asian region especially  ASEAN

countries are relatively unhurt by the oil  crisis

and  will continue to enjoy high prices for  their

primary exports. Their buoyant economies should be

a plus in our relations with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Middle East, it is not unlikely that

negotiations  for a settlement of the Arab/Israeli

conflict  can progress sufficiently for  the  Suez

Canal soon to reopen. In that event, international

trade  would  most likely recover  a  lot  of  its

buoyancy.  On balance, therefore, it would  appear

that  there  will be some slowdown in world  trade

but this should not be so serious as to generate a

world  depression,  and we can remain  hopeful  of

surmounting  without  undue hardship  the  adverse

effects of such a slowdown in world trade.



<br><br><i>Services Sector</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore must continue to improve its

capabilities  as  a  brain  services  centre.  Our

increasingly  sophisticated  financial,   banking,

insurance,     transport    and     communications

institutions should take on a regional, and even a

global  role. Among special developments  relevant

to  the  Services  Sector  in  1974  will  be  the

situation  caused  by  the oil  crisis  which  has

intensified  the  search for oil. Singapore,  with

its  capacity for building oil drilling  rigs  and

production  platforms  and  its  offshore   supply

bases,  should  be  well  placed  to  service  any

increase in offshore prospecting activities in the

South-East  Asian  or even in  the  Pacific  Basin

area. With higher prices for oil and other primary

commodities, the economies of ASEAN are likely  to

remain   buoyant.  This  buoyancy  will  stimulate

demand   on   services,  especially  in   economic

engineering supply and construction services.



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1974 therefore poses a number of new challenges

for Singapore. High oil prices will exert pressure

on the Balance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>



of Payments of Singapore as it will do on those of

other  oil importing countries. Inflation and  the

uncertainties in the international monetary system

will  continue to plague world economies with  the

result   that  Singapore,  like  all   the   major

industrial countries, is likely to experience some

deceleration  in the pace of its economic  growth.

To  meet these new difficulties, concerted efforts

by  employers and workers, producers, traders  and

consumers must match the Government's own  efforts

to   achieve   continued  economic  growth,   with

inflation kept down as low as possible. If we  all

pull  together, in the first half of this year  at

least,  we  may  still be able to achieve  a  real

growth rate of some 10 per cent per annum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers and employees alike must move

vigorously  also  towards productivity  increases.

Wastage  must be reduced both in the home  and  in

our factories to counter the growing shortages  in

industrial  raw  materials  and  consumer   goods.

Consumers,  both  industrial and domestic,  should

economise  on  their  consumption  of   fuel   and

electricity,  so  as  to make more  available  for

industries.   We   should  cut  down   unnecessary

consumption  especially on luxury goods.  Thus  we

should  correct  the unhealthy situation  of  last

year  when consumption expenditure registered very

high  increases and surpassed the growth of  fixed

capital formation.



<br><br><i>The Budget</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to turn now to the Estimates. But

first,  I should like to explain some of the  more

important  presentational changes which have  been

made  in  this  year's Estimates.  Last  year  the

provisions  in  the  Main  Estimates  which   were

entered  for "Contributions" to various  statutory

boards  and  non-profit making  organisations  not

directly  responsible to the Minister for  Finance

were deleted from the Ministry of Finance Head  of

Expenditure   and  shown,  it  was  thought   more

appropriately,   under   the   Ministries   having

responsibility  for  the  functional  policy   and

performance  of  these  bodies.  This  year,   for

similar reasons, the provisions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>



entered  for  "Loans" to these bodies  which  were

still  shown  last  year  under  the  Ministry  of

Finance  Head  have  also  been  devolved  to  the

respective  Ministries.  However,  the  terms  and

conditions of the loans will continue to be set as

before  by the Ministry of Finance, which was  the

reason  for  retaining  the provisions  previously

under  the  Ministry of Finance Head.  With  these

changes,  the  share  of total Budget  Expenditure

properly  allocable  to the  Ministry  of  Finance

would also now be more correctly shown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In previous years' Estimates, for comparison with

the  new  Budget requests, the provisions  in  the

current   Budget   were  reproduced   exactly   as

Parliament  had approved them. Our experience  is,

however,  that there are invariably organisational

changes  during the year such as the establishment

of  new  units, the merging of units, the transfer

of   functions  from  one  unit  to  another,  the

conversion  of units into statutory  boards,  etc.

The  figures  for  the current financial  year  as

approved  by  Parliament,  therefore,  no   longer

reflect the existing organisational structure, and

to  that  extent, comparisons between the  figures

for  the  new  financial year and  those  for  the

current  financial year shown exactly as  approved

by  Parliament will clearly not be valid. From  FY

74,  therefore,  I propose to show more  correctly

the  current financial year's figures so that they

can  be  directly and therefore more  conveniently

compared with the new financial year's figures. In

this  way,  for  example, we have  some  means  of

assessing  the changes in the proposed  provisions

for  FY  74 requested under the two new  Heads  of

Expenditure,  namely,  "Primary  Production"   and

"Police".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned in my last Budget Address that my

officials were exploring the possibility of a  re-structuring  of subheads in the Main Estimates.  A

set  of  proposals was subsequently developed  and

presented  to  the  Estimates  Committee  of  this

Parliament,  and, I am pleased to say,  agreed  in

toto.  These  proposals  have  given  this  year's

Estimates a new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



look  and I hope, Members will also find it a more

useful and helpful budget document.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, all subheads are now coded and grouped

into two major categories, namely, Expenditure  on

Manpower  (EOM)  and  Other Operating  Expenditure

(OOE).  In  the  EOM category only  political  and

superscale posts are shown in detail. Other  posts

are  shown by Division of service so that the user

of   the  Estimates  readily  gets  a  picture  of

manpower  cost and manpower mix rather than  feels

lost  in  a myriad of details. Those who need  the

details  may,  however, find them  in  a  separate

Establishment  List which has  been  tabled  as  a

Command Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The codification of subheads will facilitate

studies   of  like  Government  expenditure.   For

example,    present   circumstances    call    for

surveillance  over the consumption  of  water  and

electricity by all departments and all the figures

of expenditure by individual departments on public

utilities  can  now be aggregated  easily  because

they come under the same code. If the increase  in

such  expenditure is too rapid it is  possible  to

trace  more  easily than before, those departments

which are principally responsible for causing  the

increase. Similarly, studies can be carried out in

respect  of inputs such as maintenance of vehicles

and   vessels,   rations  and   diets,   printing,

transportation, etc. Within limits,  two  or  more

departments or sub-divisions of a department doing

similar  work  should  have similar  patterns  and

scales of expenditure in relation to those inputs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst such an input-oriented view on expenditure

is  necessary  to detect waste or inefficiency  in

organisational units, it is equally useful to  see

how funds are allocated to the major functions  of

government  such  as  defence,  justice,   health,

transport and communications, etc. Such a function-oriented    approach    transcends    departmental

delineation and is possible again because  of  the

codification  of the subheads. The coverage  of  a

particular   function  can   be   specified   with

reference to the sub-head



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



codes  which generally will not change  from

one year to another. In fact the various Divisions

and   departments  which  have  to  prepare   past

expenditure  figures, study budget allocations  or

estimate  future  expenditures have  agreed  to  a

common  functional classification  of  expenditure

and  this  has  been made possible  largely  as  a

result  of the codification of subheads. A  fuller

presentation  of  expenditure is now  possible  as

this year's Memorandum on the Main and Development

Estimates for FY 74 shows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the new format of the Estimates has already

brought  benefits. My officials will  continue  to

search for improvements to the Estimates format so

that  more  information may be made available  for

management purposes.



<br><br><i>Budget Cornerstones</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government budget for FY 74 is designed to

restrain  operating expenditure and  channel  more

funds into desirable development projects. Revenue

is  expected to reach $2,035.4 million  in  FY  74

owing  to  the  satisfactory growth  rate  of  the

economy  in  1973. Total provision for expenditure

in  FY  74  under the Main Estimates  is  $2,299.5

million of which $480 million is a transfer to the

Development   Fund.  Such  a  large  transfer   is

required   because   the   total   provision   for

expenditure under the Development Estimates in  FY

74  is $1,561.6 million or 32.6 per cent more than

that in FY 73.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced as we are with inflation, all Ministries

and departments are expected, indeed required,  to

scrutinise their operating expenditure patterns to

cut  out  waste or unnecessary operations.  Direct

operating  expenditure excluding the Armed  Forces

is  allowed to increase by slightly more  than  19

per  cent  only. Allowing for the general increase

in  prices and the additional manpower costs  such

as wage supplements and other allowances, there is

hardly any growth in real terms and in the context

of  ever  increasing workloads,  this  means  that

Ministries and departments have to exercise  great

care  over their expenditure in the next financial

year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards manpower, the search for manpower

saving methods of work continues. Grass-cutting in

school  compounds will be progressively undertaken

by  grass-cutting contractors and  the  number  of

school   servants  accordingly  reduced.  Security

alarms will be installed in schools so that school

watchmen  can  be  phased  out  eventually.   More

mechanised  road sweepers will be  introduced  and

existing   staff  will  be  redeployed   for   the

cleansing  of new housing estates and roads.  Over

and  above  the mechanisation effort, a  stringent

control  was imposed on the creation of additional

posts  so  as  not to add fuel to the inflationary

fire.  As  a  result  of these measures,  the  net

increase in the permanent establishment for FY  74

including those created by Establishment  Warrants

is kept down to 1,762 posts or 2.9 per cent of the

establishment level in FY 73.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, of course, does not mean that expenditure

on  manpower will also be held down to a  2.9  per

cent  growth.  In fact, as I have stated  in  this

House,  the  Government and statutory boards  will

adopt National Wages Council's recommendations and

will  require  to make provision for  payments  in

accordance with such recommendations. At the  same

time,  I should mention here that as the NWC  wage

increases  are already fairly substantial  and  as

shown   by  their  interim  $25  wage  supplement,

already  would have regard to the rising  cost  of

living,  ad hoc revisions of salary for particular

services except where necessary to remove  obvious

anomalies, will not generally be entertained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst some restraint is imposed on operating

expenditure,   there  will   be   no   let-up   on

implementing desirable development programmes  and

projects.  I  mentioned  earlier  that  the  total

outlay under the Development Estimates for  FY  74

has  increased  by  32.6 per cent.  Of  the  total

provision,  about  28 per cent  is  allocated  for

direct  expenditure by Ministries and  departments

as  well  as  the Armed Forces. The  remainder  is

earmarked  for  loans  to  statutory  boards   and

commercial and industrial enterprises.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Expenditure</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Treasury Memorandum on the Estimates explains

in  some  detail the expenditure provisions  under

each Head of Expenditure and there is no need  for

me  to  repeat what is already stated  therein.  I

would  like  to highlight, however,  some  of  the

major  areas  of  Government  endeavour  and   the

allocation of funds to these areas, viz.  Housing,

Education  and  Industrial  Training,  Health  and

Environment, and Road Transport.



<br><br><i>Housing</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low-cost housing continues to be the key area of

building  development. In fact, some  other  major

projects  have had to be rejected or postponed  in

order  to ensure that there is sufficient building

capacity  and  supplies for the implementation  of

the  low-cost  housing programme. For  FY  74  the

provision  of  loan  funds and  subsidies  to  the

Housing and Development Board is some 48 per  cent

higher than that for FY 73. The share of total net

provision allocated to Housing has increased  from

12 per cent to 15 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the basic infrastructure facilities

directly   related  to  housing  is,  of   course,

sewerage. Provisions are made for low-cost housing

estates  such as Bedok New Town and Telok  Blangah

New  Town, the East Coast Reclamation Area and the

North  and South Precincts under the Urban Renewal

Programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More schools will be built in new satellite towns

and major housing estates. It is expected that  12

schools  will be completed and provision of  funds

for  the  building  of another 20  schools  to  be

commenced in FY 74.



<br><br><i>Education and Industrial Training</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the construction of schools goes on, the

Ministry  of Education is pressing ahead with  its

programmes   to   increase  the  second   language

exposure  time in primary schools and to implement

curricular  changes  in secondary  schools.  After

taking into consideration the changes in enrolment

in  primary and secondary schools, a net  increase

of 233 posts is provided for FY 74.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the greater emphasis on quality, there will

be   a  corresponding  increase  in  the  cost  of

education. This will be reflected not only in  the

salary of teachers, but also in the higher cost of

equipment,  chemicals and materials for laboratory

work  and workshop practice. It will therefore  be

necessary to increase the education fees from time

to  time,  to  remind our people of  the  enormous

State subsidies in education, and parents of their

responsibility  in  paying  towards  the  cost  of

bringing up and educating every additional  member

in his family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an earnest of our interest in technical and

industrial  training,  grants  to  the  Industrial

Training Board, Singapore Polytechnic and Ngee Ann

Technical College have increased by $4 million  or

19.4  per  cent.  Even  more  significant  is  the

increase  by $2.6 million or 270 per cent  in  the

provision  for  the  overseas industrial  training

scheme,  the  industrial  development  scholarship

scheme   and   subsidies  for   local   industrial

training. It is hoped that industry will,  on  its

part, take an increasingly active participation in

industrial  training  through  apprenticeship  and

other   programmes.  `The  production  of   enough

personnel  with the necessary industrial  training

skills  must,  in the long run, be a joint  effort

between industry and Government.



<br><br><i>Health and Environment</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent energy and materials shortages have

reminded  us  once again of our  lack  of  natural

resources   and   therefore  the   importance   of

upgrading  what  we do have - our human  resources

and  our  environment. The allocations for  Health

and  Environment add up to almost 20 per  cent  of

total  net provision in the Estimates. Improvement

of  medical facilities for the people will proceed

on  a  broad  front by the further development  of

medical specialities, the opening of new hospitals

and the expansion of existing hospitals. Of these,

the largest single project is still the re-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



development of the Outram Road General  Hospital.

All require investment in buildings, equipment and

manpower, that is, the training of nurses and  the

upgrading  of  skills  of doctors.  Unfortunately,

these  are  too  often taken for  granted.  It  is

necessary that hospital charges be increased  from

time  to  time  to help symbolically  towards  the

increasing cost of medicine and drugs, disposables

and rations and diets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, increasing expenditure on health

facilities  will not lead to better  standards  of

care  if  the population growth is unchecked,  and

pollution of the environment goes unabated. If the

number  of  patients increases hand in  hand  with

total   expenditure  on  health   facilities,   no

improvement can be expected. For FY 74, the  grant

to  the  Singapore Family Planning and  Population

Board is increased by two-thirds and more Maternal

and  Child Health Clinics will be opened  in  low-cost  housing  estates. In the area  of  pollution

control,  I  have mentioned the sewerage  projects

which will be undertaken in FY 74. The development

of   proper  markets  and  hawkers  centres   will

continue and the Refuse Incineration project  will

be implemented a stage further.



<br><br><i>Road Transport</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I should say a few words on the

provisions   for   the   improvement    of    road

transportation,  a  subject  which  has   recently

attracted much attention both from the public  and

the  Government. Provisions for the  construction,

widening  and  realignment of  roads  and  bridges

total  $28.1  million. Another $5 million  is  set

aside  for special projects recommended by a  high

level  Road Transport Action Committee. This total

allocation of $33.1 million is 8.4 per cent of the

provision  for  direct expenditure  by  Government

departments  on development projects and  reflects

the  high priority which Government gives  to  the

solving of problems in road transport.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Revenue</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must now consider the question of financing

the  proposed  expenditure. It  is  expected  that

external  loans,  domestic loans, loan  repayments

and  interest  and dividends will  together  yield

$1,057.5  million. This together with the expected

Government  revenue of $2,323 million at  existing

tax  rates  will  just about meet  the  net  total

provision for expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue estimate of $2,323 million for FY 74

represents  a  14.1  per cent  increase  over  the

latest estimate of revenue to be collected  in  FY

73.  This  rate  of  increase in  revenue  is  not

unreasonable  despite  the gloomier  international

scene  this  year. One reason is that the  largest

single  source is income tax and this is dependent

on  the previous year's earnings rather than those

of  the present financial year. Another reason  i5

that  inflation tends to increase revenue  through

indirect taxes which are based on prices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For FY 74, income tax is expected to reach $700

million  or  20.7 per cent more than  the  revised

estimate  for FY 73. It also represents around  30

per cent of total revenue for FY 74.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property tax is the next largest single source of

revenue.  For  FY 74, this source is  expected  to

yield $230 million or 12.2 per cent more than  the

revised  estimate for the current financial  year.

Other  main  increases in revenue  in  FY  74  are

expected  to  come  from  land  sales,  additional

registration  fees  on  motor  cars,  road  taxes,

customs duties on liquors, petroleum products  and

tobacco  as  well  as  regulatory  charges.  These

together  account for 52 per cent of the  increase

over the revised estimate of revenue for FY 73.



<br><br><i>Taxation Policy and Changes</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now we come to the question of new tax

measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members will be glad to learn that there

will be no new taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose instead to give a number of tax

concessions. The reliefs, which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



I shall describe in detail, will cost some $8.8

million, which can be broken down

as follows :-



<pre>

                                           Million

(1) Raising of exemption and remission

        limit under Estate Duty              $7.0



(2) Increase in Relief for Parents and

        Grandparents                         $0.6



(3) Exemption of the Balancing Charge

        on Singapore registered ships

        from tax                             $1.0



(4) Tax only on the Interest Portion

     of Annuity Instalments                  $0.2

                                             ----

                                Total        $8.8

                                             ====

</pre>



<br><br><i>(1) Higher Exemption and Remission Limits of Estate Duty</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present tax rates, estates are exempted

from  duty  on the first $10,000 of its value.  In

addition,  since  March  1972,  any  estate   duty

payable has been remitted for estates which do not

exceed  $25,000  in value. The intention  of  this

remission  was to ensure that families buying  the

low-cost  Housing  and Development  Board  housing

units under Government's scheme for encouraging  a

property-owning democracy would be in no danger of

losing their homes because of inability to pay the

estate  duty. It was not intended to  benefit  the

majority  of  the tax-payers owning estates  above

this  value which would, however, still enjoy  the

exemption   on   the  first  $10,000   which   was

introduced in 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representations have, however, been made about

the   inadequacy  of  the  present  exemption  and

remission limits by the public through the  press,

and  also  by hon. Members in this House. Property

owners  hope the Government will extend  exemption

or remission to the terrace or semi-detached house

or  even the owner-occupied family detached house.

Since  prices  of land and houses  have  increased

substantially in the past few years, it is  argued

that  wage earners may find it difficult  to  bear

the full burden of estate duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I have considerable sympathy for these

suggestions,  I  have  rejected  the  demand   for

complete exemption from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



estate  duty  in  respect  of  one  owner-occupied

family house. Such an exemption would benefit  the

wealthy   more   than   others   and   result   in

discrimination against other forms of assets  like

shares,  deposits  and  life  insurance  policies.

However,  recognising the need to  ensure  against

undue hardship and possible disruption of families

as  a result of burdensome estate duty payments on

the death of a breadwinner, I now propose to raise

the exemption and remission limits of estate duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention is to give relief from estate duty

by  a combination of exemption and remission.  The

exemption  will  be for the first $50,000  of  the

value  of  the estate which represents an increase

of  $40,000 over the existing exemption  limit  of

$10,000.  The remissions will be one declining  by

steps of 10 per cent of the duty payable. Thus  90

per  cent  will  be remitted of  the  estate  duty

payable  for  the  next $20,000 in  value  of  the

estate, and 80 per cent, 70 per cent, 60 per cent,

etc, of the duty for every succeeding $20,000  in

value  of  the estate up to $230,000.  This  would

mean  that  if  an estate is worth up  to  $50,000

only,  no  duty will be payable. If the estate  is

worth $150,000, the duty payable is $3,337 and  if

the estate is worth $230,000, the duty payable  is

$14,037.   Estates  which  are  worth  more   than

$230,000  will  be  subject to full  duty  on  the

amount exceeding $230,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised exemption and remission limits will

apply  to  estates passing on or after 1st  April,

1974. The proposal will give full relief to people

in  the lower income group living in all, even the

largest, HDB flats, who form about 40 per cent  of

the  population. The people in the  middle  income

group  living  in  owner-occupied  terrace,  semi-detached  and even detached houses will  have  the

burden of estate duty considerably reduced.  Those

who  wish  to reduce or avoid estate duty  further

can  transfer  the property as a gift  during  the

lifetime of the owner or create joint



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



tenancies  or tenancies in common or  mortgage  or

charge  the property, thus reducing the  value  of

the estate.



<br><br><i> (2)  Revision of Tax Relief for Dependent Parents and Grandparents from $300 to $750</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year when I announced the relief to

taxpayers  for supporting parents or grandparents,

many  hon. Members felt that the tax deduction  at

$300  per  dependant was inadequate. I have  given

this  matter further consideration and I am  happy

to inform hon. Members that the relief will now be

increased  from $300 to $750 per dependant.  There

will   be   no  change  in  the  other  conditions

announced  last year. The increase in  the  relief

will  also take effect from the year of assessment

1975, that is, based on 1974 income.



<br><br><i>(3) Balancing Charge on Sale of  a  Singapore Registered Ship</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Profits from the operation of Singapore

registered ships are exempted from income  tax  as

an  incentive  for ship-owners to  register  their

ships  in  Singapore. However,  when  a  Singapore

registered  ship  is sold and the  sale  price  is

higher than the written down or depreciated value,

a balancing charge arises which under ordinary tax

liability,  is  subject to  income  tax.  If  this

liability  is  not  removed, it  could  discourage

local   shipowners  from  upgrading  their  fleets

through  disposal  of older vessels  and  possibly

also  act  as a disincentive to foreign shipowners

from setting up shipping companies in Singapore to

operate Singapore registered ships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage the registration of ships in

Singapore, we have already provided for income tax

exemption for profits, low registration  fees  and

annual tonnage fee, rebate of half the tonnage fee

if 25 per cent of the crew are Singapore citizens,

a  simplified registration and mortgage system and

income   tax   exemption  for  crews  working   on

Singapore  registered  ships.  After  giving  such

incentives, it was not specifically intended  that

there  should  remain a liability to  tax  of  the

balancing  charge  on  the  sale  of  a  Singapore

registered  ship.  I  therefore  propose,  by  the

removal of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



this liability, to add still another incentive for

the  registration of ships in Singapore  from  the

assessment year 1974.



<br><br><i>(4) Income Tax on Annuity Instalments</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim to develop Singapore as an important

insurance  centre is in line with our  efforts  to

develop  Singapore as the "brains" service  centre

of  South-east  Asia. Hon. Members  will  remember

that  I  have in previous Budgets announced fiscal

incentives to foster the growth of the finance and

insurance industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a further step to assist the insurance

industry,  I  propose to revise the basis  of  the

income  tax  on annuities. Annuities, at  present,

form  a  very small part of the insurance business

here  because, among other factors, tax is imposed

on the whole of an annuity instalment received.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An annuity purchased by payment of an insurance

premium  or  premiums provides for the payment  of

periodic   sums   of  money  to   the   purchaser.

Essentially, the payment represented by an annuity

instalment  consists  of  two  elements:  one   is

repayment of part of the capital, and the other is

the   payment   of  interest  on  the  outstanding

capital. At present, both elements comprising  the

whole  of  an  annuity  instalment  received   are

subject  to  income  tax.  This  is  an  anomalous

situation because only the interest portion should

properly  be  considered  as  income  and   taxed,

leaving the capital element free of tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from the assessment year 1975,

therefore, I propose to change the basis of tax to

charge   only  the  interest  element  of  annuity

instalments. This measure will not only assist the

insurance industry but also popularise a different

and attractive form of insurance cover.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above remarks conclude the account of tax

concessions I propose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there still appears to be some lack of

understanding  of  Government's  taxation  policy,

particularly   with  reference   to   recent   tax

measures,  let  me  take the opportunity  here  to

state it once again. For the growth of revenue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



to  meet rising Government expenditure, it is  our

policy  to  rely mainly upon a rapid expansion  of

the  economy  and upon an efficient machinery  for

enforcement and collection of the taxes which such

an  economy  can  afford to pay. While  major  and

painful  new taxes or increases in tax  rates  for

the  purpose purely of raising additional  revenue

will generally be avoided, it may be necessary  in

order to implement our social or economic policies

that  from  time  to  time,  we  impose  new   tax

disincentives, or give incentives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last really new taxes were introduced at the 1968 December Budget and were prompted by the need

to  raise revenue for building up our own  defence

forces  consequent upon the withdrawal of  the  UK

armed   forces  from  the  Republic.  Since  then,

revisions  mainly  have  been  made  to  taxes  on

private  motor  vehicles, cigarettes  and  tobacco

products,  liquors and petroleum. These  revisions

raised  additional revenue but were made quite  as

much   to   alleviate   traffic   congestion   and

pollution;  to  bolster Government's  anti-smoking

campaign; and to discourage consumption of  luxury

and  non-essential items. If such higher taxes and

duties encourage the people to forgo or reduce the

consumption  of  these items, the whole  community

will  benefit through the better flow of  traffic,

reduced  pollution, better health  and  a  smaller

national expenditure on imported luxury items. Tax

revisions  have not affected food items  or  daily

necessities. On the contrary, during the financial

year 1973, Government lifted import duties on  149

items  of  a  wide range of foodstuffs,  household

appliances  and construction materials,  resulting

in  a  potential loss of revenue of $21.4  million

per annum. And, of course, the tax concessions now

announced and costing some $8.8 million per  annum

give   some   recognition  to   changed   economic

conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to make it clear, however, that it

is  not part of Government policy to subsidise  or

to  continue to subsidise activities which are not

viable   in   the  long  run,  and  it   will   be

Government's intention to recover, so far as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



is   consistent  with  Government's  policies  for

social  justice,  all costs for the  provision  of

Government services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is useful to re-state the principles which

determine the philosophy on which our way of  life

is  based.  Since  1965, one principle  which  has

enabled  us  to survive and to thrive  is  not  to

encourage  passengers. Nothing is more  likely  to

ensure  our  bankruptcy  and  disintegration  than

feather-bedding  and  subsidies  in   pursuit   of

equality,  not of opportunities, but  of  rewards.

Over  and  over  again,  in developing  countries,

political  parties  have  won  office  by  putting

attractive  proposals  of  subsidised  food,  free

education  and  health services to a semi-educated

electorate, unable and later unwilling to face the

hard  facts  of  economic life.  Inevitably  these

countries   have  ended  in  economic  chaos   and

bankruptcy.  If  any political party  succeeds  in

selling  this `something for nothing'  philosophy,

it  will be particularly bad for Singapore. For we

make  our  living through organised servicing  and

production, not with the help of the sun and  rain

to  produce food and agricultural commodities.  So

when  the  financial  rot sets  in  and  the  firm

framework  which  rewards  effort  and  enterprise

gives  way,  there  are no  soft  rice  fields  to

cushion  the hard fall. And the fall will be  most

painful for the poor and the unskilled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the price of imported oil goes up, it is no

less  than  madness to subsidise PUB  charges,  as

some letters to the press have urged, particularly

when we want people to cut down on consumption  of

electricity and oil. On the contrary, in the  case

of petrol, a tax was added in order to further cut

down non-essential travelling by motor cars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to meet steep price increases in

foodstuffs,  and  the  effects  of  increased  oil

prices,  the Government has accepted the  National

Wages  Council's  recommendation  to  give  a  $25

interim  allowance. There is  a  likelihood  of  a

further increase in July.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the cost of running buses has gone up

-  half because of wages, half due to higher  cost

of  diesel  oil,  spare parts and  tyres.  So  the

Government  has had to allow the bus companies  to

put up bus fares. There have been suggestions that

the  Government nationalise the bus companies  and

subsidise the commuter. But what happens when  the

Government  nationalises a company which  has  not

yet    got   institutionalised   management,   and

corruption  on  a  scale  rampant  in  the  former

Singapore Traction Company inevitably results? Let

us  first  get  management and  services  improved

through  tighter supervision from the Ministry  of

Communications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hospital ward charges for `C' class patients have

gone up by a token $1 per day, since January 1974,

when  the actual cost per patient per day went  up

$8  from $37 in 1972 to $45 in 1973, the result of

increase  of wages of all hospital staff  and  the

cost of equipment and medicines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underlying rationale is, whoever makes use of

these services must pay a token share towards  its

cost,  to  check abuse in the unnecessary  use  of

these   services.  This  has  happened   in   even

developed countries like Britain. There, a  Labour

government   in  1968  was  forced  to   introduce

prescription charges. Human nature being  what  it

is,  the  charge,  however small compared  to  the

actual cost, helps to cut down wastage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With miscellaneous school fees, a cognate

principle applies. Every parent must bear a  token

sum, to remind him that the bigger his family, the

higher the burdens on his family and on the State.

We  must  employ  every means to  impress  on  our

people  the need for family planning, or abortion,

or serialisation. That there is a small surplus in

miscellaneous fees for the cost of ECA, means that

more activities can be catered for, and principals

and  senior  teachers can be more  imaginative  in

planning  activities  such  as  educational  tours

during  holidays.  The  hefty  increased  cost  of

education, at about $324 per annum for  a  primary

school student,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



and $582 per annum for a secondary school student,

is  carried by the Government. This, as  with  all

subsidies,  comes  from  taxes  paid  for  by  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest single tax revenue is from income

tax,  paid for on a graduated scale, those earning

more paying more, to subsidise those earning less.

It is nearly 30 per cent of total revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of the more you can earn, the more

you  must pay for the poor, when carried  too  far

has  led,  in  many  countries  like  Britain,  to

professionals   migrating   to   North    America,

Australia and New Zealand. They see no reason  why

they  should  work  to pay for  the  indolent  and

irresponsible.  We are in a poorer  position  than

the  British,  for  we  are  short  of  top  level

personnel. If our trained administrators, managers

and professionals leave, those left behind, nearly

all   of   whom   cannot  emigrate,  will   become

unemployed and suffer grave privation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every society has its quota of idealists, and of

hypocrites, especially amongst the intelligentsia.

The  idealists believe in equal rewards. But  many

are  hypocrites, pretending to feel sorry for  the

poor.  They  are the people who, whilst  lamenting

the  extra  dollar on miscellaneous  school  fees,

quietly  send  their children abroad to  expensive

schools in Australia, Britain and elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those of us who intend to stay, let us take a

hard  look  at our circumstances. To  protect  our

long-term interests, everyone, even our poor, must

face up to our responsibilities to each other, and

to  the  country. To spread the belief in  heavier

and  heavier  subsidies  to  cushion  the  adverse

effects  of  world economic forces on  our  lives,

means encouraging and making more people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



into  passengers.  People who can  help  push  the

economy  by  striving to earn and pay  a  part  of

their  essential needs will just sit back, waiting

to be carried for free. This is the road to ruin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's duty is to ensure the wellbeing

of  all,  including the poor. We best do  this  by

ensuring that people get better and better paid as

they  improve  their training  and  attain  higher

skills.   The   basic  formula   for   Singapore's

continued success, without raw materials, is  hard

work.  There  is  no magic strategy  for  economic

growth which can feed us without work. This budget

reflects a realistic appraisal of our position  in

a  world where only those who make the effort will

make the grade.
