<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>POST OFFICE SAVINGS BANK</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Sale to DBS Bank)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok</b> asked the Minister for Finance

whether the Government disclosed fully the reasons (including

the  Y2K  issue) for the sale of Post Office Savings Bank  to

DBS Bank in 1998.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the sale of POSBank to DBS Bank was made  known

to  the public at a press conference which I presided on 24th

July  1998  and at the Parliamentary sitting on 12th  October

1998.   I  explained the two reasons for the sale.   Firstly,

the  rapid  growth  in world trade and globalisation  of  the

world  economy  has  led  to  vast  changes  in  the  banking

industry.   Corporate and individual customers now  demand  a

wide  range  of sophisticated services.  Increasingly,  banks

are  evolving into financial supermarkets, and are no  longer

just   deposit   takers  and  lenders.   These  developments,

together  with the opening up of financial markets worldwide,

have  led  to  a  spate of mega-mergers, as banks  merge  and

consolidate  their strengths in order to remain  competitive.

Size  has  become very important in the banking  sector.   It

provides  the  leverage  for the effective  cross-selling  of

financial  products  and harnessing of  costly  technological

changes.   It also gives the banks the ability to reach  deep

into   a  range  of  markets  that  are  increasingly   being

deregulated, and to take advantage of opportunities available

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>



in these markets.  Bigger banks are better placed to cater to

the  discerning  modern banking customers.  This  acquisition

would  therefore place DBS in a better position to  face  the

competitive challenges that lie ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the acquisition would enable POSBank to better

serve   its   increasingly   sophisticated   customers    and

depositors.  To meet competition from commercial banks and to

retain its customer base, POSBank had to speed up the rate at

which  it  was  growing its range of products  and  services.

However,  organic growth on its own would be a  slow  process

and  the  best way POSBank could grow quickly was to actively

seek out complementarities with other banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Y2K was not a reason why the Government sold POSBank.

In  fact,  POSBank  had commenced its system  review  on  Y2K

compliance  prior to the sale and had plans to be Y2K  ready.

The  Government is confident that POSBank would have been Y2K

ready by 2000.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, the Minister says

that  the  divestment was to better serve POSBank's customers

but  it does not appear to be the way things have turned out.

The  question really is that at that time of the  divestment,

did  the  Government envisage that there will be severe  cut-back  of  the services of POSBank by DBS?  And secondly,  why

was  DBS allowed to close bank branches when the existing DBS

computer  system  could  not handle POSBank's  accounts?   In

other  words,  it appears to be very poor planning  that  was

very badly implemented.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The Government is in no position

to tell DBSBank what it should do with the purchase.  When  I

said  that the sale will make it better for the combined bank

to   service  its  customers,  I  mean  to  serve  its   more

sophisticated  customers.  The bulk  of  POSBank's  customers

were   small  customers,  together  with  a  group  of  large

depositors.  This structure, it was foreseen, could not  last

much longer because it was losing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



money of its large depositors to other commercial banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the quality of the service which POSBank has been

able  to  render post merger, I believe DBS Bank has  already

made  public  statements on its services.  The Member  should

ask  DBS  directly if more information is needed  or  put  in

another question on this particular issue.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, Government is appropriately

represented at DBS Bank, especially at the board level, is it

not?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> It is a commercial bank. I

think  it  would be wrong for Government to impose conditions

on how it should operate.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, the Minister

has   said  that  the  sale  of  POSBank  was  to  serve  the

increasingly sophisticated needs of the consumers.  But  does

he not know that there are a lot of unsophisticated consumers

who  have  simple needs and therefore would actually  need  a

very simple no-frills bank, and this may perhaps lead to  the

Government   re-thinking  this  issue  as  the  New   Zealand

government had done?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I do not want to reopen the

issue of what POSBank is doing in serving its customers.   It

has come out publicly to explain why and, as I have said,  if

you think this is an issue which needs to be reopened, please

submit a separate question.

<div align="center"><b>ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Number arrested)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  if  he will furnish information over the last  three

years (i) the number of illegal immigrants arrested, by their

countries  of  origin, and (ii) the number of  employers  and

agents arrested for employing illegal immigrants compared  to

the  number  of  landlords arrested  for  harbouring  illegal

immigrants.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   last  year,  the  Home  Team  arrested  about   16,500

immigration offenders, comprising both illegal immigrants and

overstayers.  This represents a 3% decrease compared  to  the

17,000  immigration offenders arrested in  1999,  and  a  28%

decrease   compared  to  the  23,000  immigration   offenders

arrested in 1998.  While the situation has improved over  the

past  three  years, the figure last year is still 18%  higher

than  the 14,000 arrested in 1997.  The immigration offenders

arrested  came  from all over the region, mainly  Bangladesh,

China  and  India.   The  immigration  offender  problem   is

therefore still a serious one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for harbourers and employers, there has been an

increase in the number of arrests over the last three  years.

Last   year,   590   people  were  arrested  for   harbouring

immigration  offenders, compared to 306 in 1999  and  166  in

1998.   572  people  were arrested for employing  immigration

offenders.   This  is  an  increase over  the  388  employers

arrested in 1999 and the 270 arrested in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 10 housing agents arrested last year for

abetting to harbour immigration offenders, compared to  three

in 1999 and one in 1998.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, if I

heard  the  numbers  correctly, it seems that  employers  are

relatively few, 572, but the number of landlords seems to  be

quite  high.  Is it not clear that people will only  overstay

if  they had a job and therefore should we not do more  about

the  employers?  Secondly, the number of agents  arrested  is

10.   Is  that not stunningly low compared to the number  for

landlords?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the first point on the

relativity  of  the figures, the figures are  in  fact  quite

close.   Because for last year, 590 people were arrested  for

harbouring  immigration offenders whereas 572, just  slightly

down  by  18  people, were arrested for employing immigration

offenders.  I agree with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



Mr Tay that we have to attack the problem on both fronts.  In

fact,  we have made it very clear that we treat each category

of  people  with  the same approach in terms  of  enforcement

action.  This has been done.  SIR, together with MOM, carries

out  enforcement raids at places where immigration  offenders

may  be working or places where they are gathering.  In terms

of  the  law too, they are of the same parity.  So under  the

Immigration  Act, an employer who is prosecuted  and  charged

successfully  with  employing an  immigration  offender  also

faces   the   minimum  mandatory  six  months'  imprisonment.

Indeed,  if  he engages or employs more than five immigration

offenders, he also faces mandatory caning.  So there  are  no

two  ways about it.  As I have said, concerted actions on all

fronts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for agents, the current law is such that when agents

are  charged, they are charged under the abetment  provision.

We  have  announced  in this House that  we  are  looking  at

changing  the law so that the agents will also have  to  face

the  same requirement of due diligence.  After all, they  may

be  the  ones who are in touch with the immigration offender.

With  the due diligence requirement of the harbourer  or  the

employer,  the agents will be subject to the same  standards.

So the low numbers are because of this fact, because they are

charged  for  abetment and for abetment  you  have  to  prove

knowledge.  That is more difficult.

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

recently  it  was reported in the press that  a  few  illegal

immigrants, including a newly-born baby, were arrested  in  a

makeshift shelter, actually a storm drain.  I would  like  to

ask  the  Minister  of State whether such  developments,  ie,

illegal  immigrants  going literally underground,  are  as  a

result  of  the  tougher  stance taken  by  the  Ministry  on

harbourers   of   illegal   immigrants   and   whether   such

developments were anticipated by the authority.  Although  we

understand the rationale for the Government's action, I would

like to know whether the Ministry has considered the hardship

befallen  such economic refugees as a result of  the  tougher

action.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I think we should be

careful about this because it is a serious problem.  So  when

we  look at the whole situation and make it more onerous  for

harbourers to harbour illegal offenders, one consequence will

be  the fact that it would be more difficult for them to find

accommodation.   That actually explains  why  in  the  months

after  the  enhanced  publicity,  more  were  caught.    More

Singaporeans  were also reporting them.  This is  an  extreme

case  where this immigration offender was found with a child.

In  other  cases,  yes, they will have some  difficulties  in

finding  accommodation and finding employment.  But  that  is

the  purpose  of  the law.  So that also  sends  a  deterrent

message  to other people who will know that if they  come  in

illegally, they face difficulties.  And at the same time, the

fact that they have to come out from their quarters, and some

will  hide  in the forest, that will also enable the  Police,

together with MOM and other agencies, to catch them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan:</b> I will come back to the point

made  by  Mr Simon Tay that the number of employers  arrested

appears very disproportionate to the number of harbourers  of

illegal immigrants arrested.  If so, if your Ministry  agrees

to  this  fact, whether tougher action will be taken  against

employers of illegal immigrants?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I think it must be so

because  Singapore is porous, so immigration offenders  come.

So   the  numbers  are  large.   It  must  be  so  that  more

immigration  offenders are caught than the employers  because

the  places  where  they  work in  Singapore  would  be  more

limited.  But, as I have said, the focus of the law  is  also

on the employers and the law is already very harsh.

<div align="center"><b>MEDIA WATCH COUNCIL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Formation)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay</b> asked the Minister for

Information  and the Arts if it is appropriate  to  foster  a

media  watch  council  to monitor and  review  newspapers  in

Singapore, given their recent proliferation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Information and the Arts (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is already a Publications

Advisory Committee (PAC), which provides advice on content in

local publications, including newspapers.  The Committee  was

set  up  in 1982 and now comprises a Chairman and 73  members

drawn from a cross section of society.  MITA consults the PAC

on publication content that may have breached our guidelines.

The  PAC  reflects the views of the public and helps MITA  to

maintain the quality of publications in Singapore.  There  is

no  necessity for a separate media watch council  to  monitor

and review the newspapers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister,

first, is it very apparent that the PAC is able to cope  with

the  increased  number of publications since more  newspapers

have  come on board and they are daily affairs?  Second,  are

the  PAC  and the Ministry actually quite satisfied with  the

veracity and guidelines of good judgement and morality  shown

by the new newspapers, particularly?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a fact that

the  Ministry  receives very few complaints from  the  public

about  the  newspapers.   When complaints  that  violate  the

guidelines are received, we can refer these complaints to the

PAC.   So  it has not been a problem so far.  The system  has

worked  well.   As far as I can assess from reading  the  new

newspapers,  although there is increasing  competition,  with

vigilance  on our part, the Ministry's part as  well  as  the

PAC, the general quality has not gone down.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, the Minister has said

that the quality has not gone down.  But I would like to  ask

him if it is not indeed time, even if it is just the existing

committee,  to be looking into issues like, as Mr  Tay  says,

morality and ethics, and to stop this practice of newspapers,

for  example,  putting  out  articles  which  appear  to   be

investigative   reports   but   which   are    really    paid

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> If the Member has specific complaints

of  cases,  he  can  bring  them to  my  attention.   We  are

reviewing  the process all the time and we are  watching  how

the   newspapers   develop.   Of  course,   with   increasing

competition, we realise that there is a tendency to  publish,

for  example, photographs of women, which are more revealing.

So  we  have  to  watch them all the time.   But  my  general

feeling  is,  with  what is being done  at  the  moment,  the

situation is fine and we need not over-react.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Does the Minister say he must watch them

all  the  time?  I hope he means the newspapers, and not  the

women.   But,  seriously, my concern is also about  veracity,

because to my recollection, one of the newspapers made a very

unfortunate headline  ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tay, could you ask your question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Yes, Sir. There was a particular

incident,  Sir,  where a newspaper made a particular  mistake

over  the  tragic accident of the SIA crash and  clearly,  it

deviated  from the previous principle of better,  slower  but

accurate, whereas they came up fast, but wrong.  And  I  want

to  ask  the  Minister whether this has received a  reprimand

from  the PAC, or the Ministry, or whether any action  should

be taken in future about this kind of reporting.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> I cannot remember exactly what is

this  incident  about  the SIA crash  that  was  inaccurately

reported.   But I am sure you have noticed that whenever  the

papers make mistakes, they are quite fast in correcting their

errors.   For example, when Ministries detect the errors,  we

will  write  to  them and the correction will come  out  very

quickly.   So  if there are instances where the  public  feel

aggrieved  about errors, they should write to the newspapers.

And  I  am  sure the newspapers will be careful  about  their

professionalism  and  be clear about  their  credibility  and

accuracy.

<div align="center"><b>POLYTECHNICS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Recruitment of foreign students by "agents")</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Thomas Thomas</b> asked the Minister for Education

(a)  if he is aware that polytechnics use "agents" to recruit

foreign  students;  and (b) what steps are taken  to  prevent

abuse.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Peter Chen) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Sir, all our four

polytechnics  have actively sought to create a  more  vibrant

learning  environment  by recruiting good  foreign  students.

Polytechnics have taken more pro-active marketing measures to

recruit  foreign students.  And polytechnic staff  have  made

visits to foreign countries for direct recruitment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my Ministry is aware that there are recruitment

agencies  that provide assistance, on a fee-paying basis,  to

foreign students who wish to apply to Singapore polytechnics.

But  the  point is that our polytechnics do not engage  these

recruitment agents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the most important point to remember is that

admission  into our polytechnics is by merit and applications

submitted by these agents are assessed in the same manner  as

all other student applications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our polytechnics have from time to time explained to

potential  students  that  the  polytechnics  do  not  employ

agents.   Students  and  their parents  should  exercise  due

caution   in  dealing  with  recruitment  agents  purportedly

representing our polytechnics.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

if  the  polytechnics  do not employ  these  agents  and  the

polytechnics tell the parents to be careful, then why are the

polytechnics recruiting students through these agents?   What

is the role of these agents?

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> Probably, the best example of such

agents  is a Government body called the China Service  Centre

for   Scholarly   Exchange.    This   body   would   put   up

advertisements on polytechnic education opportunities.  These

are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>



dissemination of information, and all polytechnics have  used

this  in connection with their recruitment, but they  do  not

employ   the   agents.   The  fees  are  not  paid   by   the

polytechnics.   And I wish to reiterate the  point  that  the

admission  to  our  polytechnics, like many  things  else  in

Singapore, is purely by merit.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Is there some process to ensure that

the  fees  that  these  agents charge are  not  excessive  or

exploitative?

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> We cannot prevent people from paying

what  they  wish to pay.  But our understanding is  that  the

fees  charged  by this particular body are in the  region  of

2,100  renminbi,  which is about $400, and they  are  charged

only  for the successful applications.  I wish to remind once

more  that  success depends entirely on merit and  any  tests

taken  by these students and candidates are brought  back  to

Singapore  and assessed overall.  They are not  done  on  the

spot.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Could the Minister also enlighten us

on  the  processes  that  the  other  bodies  use  for  other

countries other than China?

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> There are some countries which are

better  established.  China is in a sense  new.   Our  second

largest number of students is from Malaysia.  So it is  quite

well established.  In fact, applications are available on the

Net, and there are a lot of applications as well.

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD FLATS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Cancellation of applications to purchase)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Ong Kian Min</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  (a)  from  July  to  December  2000,  how   many

applications for new Housing and Development (HDB) flats have

been cancelled by the HDB due to the applicants declining  to

proceed  with their applications; (b) whether there has  been

any increase in such cases compared

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>



to  that for January to June 2000; and (c) what are the  main

reasons for the applicants' decision not to proceed with  the

purchase.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr John Chen Seow Phun) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Sir, under the Registration for Flats System (RFS),

applicants  for new flats are queued based on  a  first-come-first-served  basis  to  select flats.   RFS  applicants  may

request  HDB  to cancel their applications at any  time  from

application  to before taking possession of  the  flat.   The

reasons for not proceeding with the flat purchase are varied.

It could be that some are now not in urgent need of a flat or

that  some may have chosen to buy resale flats.  The HDB does

not   require   RFS  applicants  to  give  the  reasons   for

cancellation of their applications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between July and December 2000, there was an average of

1,100  cancellations  of RFS applications  per  month.   This

represents  a  fall of 45% when compared to  the  average  of

2,000  cancellations per month for the period between January

and June 2000.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister

of  State  whether it is fair for HDB to force applicants  to

either  select  or cancel the flat at the time of  selection?

Also, can HDB allow applicants to keep their queue number for

subsequent selection of flats?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, under the RFS, applicants

who have been shortlisted to select a flat are not allowed to

stay  on the queue.  If they do not book a flat, when invited

to  do  so,  their applications will be cancelled.   This  is

because  HDB has committed the flat supply to them since  the

building  contracts have already been awarded.  Moreover,  if

we  allow  shortlisted applicants to hold on to  their  queue

positions, many may do so in order that their queue positions

will  be  ahead  when  good  units in  better  locations  are

offered.  So that is the reason why we require them to cancel

their  applications.  And if they want  to  purchase  a  flat

later, they would have to re-queue again.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Since the number mentioned by the

Minister  is 1,100, it is not really a big number.   Why  can

the HDB not allow more flexibility because it is not fair for

applicants  to  queue  for three or five  years  because  the

number  of flats offered at that time could be very  few  and

might  not  be  suitable,  and  if  you  cancel  their  queue

positions,  they  have to go all the way back  of  the  queue

again?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, for first timers, the

waiting time is about one year to 11/2 years.  The reason why

we  have so many dropouts, so to speak, is because during the

boom period, 1996-1997, a lot of people queued up by paying a

few hundred dollars and, because of the recession, they found

that  they really did not need a flat and they felt that  the

prices might not go up, so they dropped out of the queue.  It

is  not  fair to allow them to stay on the queue and  deprive

those who have genuine needs because these people simply,  as

I  said,  want  to  just  wait until  there  are  good  units

available before they select a flat.  If there is none,  they

do  not want to select a flat, but they want to retain  their

positions in the queue.  I do not think that is fair.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, the Minister of

State  mentioned  good units.  Does he  mean  there  are  bad

units?  And if so, are they cheaper?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, choosing a unit is a very

subjective  matter.  People choose according to floor  level,

location, maybe even feng shui, I do not know.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Tay Beng Chuan -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. To ask the Minister for National Development (a)

whether any prompt action has been taken to address the  over

supply of Housing and Development Board (HDB) shops in public

of  increasing  fierce  competition  from  the  fast  growing

private    shopping    complexes   and   mega    departmental

estates.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Question No. 6, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government is aware that traditional HDB

shopkeepers  are  facing keen competition from  big  shopping

malls,  food  courts and supermarkets.  They have  also  been

affected by a change in the shopping and marketing habits  of

Singaporeans.    As  I  assured  the  House  yesterday,   the

Government is currently working out a programme to  help  HDB

shop retailers.  And we will announce the package once it  is

finalized.

<div align="center"><b>NEW HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD FLATS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Adjustment of prices)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Ong Kian Min</b> asked the Minister for National

Development,  in  view  of the drop  in  resale  Housing  and

Development (HDB) flat prices and the large number of new HDB

flats available, whether the HDB is considering adjusting the

prices of new HDB flats.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Sir, HDB reviews the prices of HDB flats

regularly   to   ensure  that  they  remain   affordable   to

Singaporean households.  In pricing its flats, HDB does  take

the  prevailing resale prices of comparable HDB resale  flats

into  consideration.  The other factors include the locations

and attributes of the flats.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister

of  State what is the frequency at which HDB revises its flat

prices?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, every quarter, when there

is an offer of flats, we would review the prices.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Is there a case to consider more frequent

reviews  of  flat  prices, given that there  is  considerable

volatility in the resale market?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, the reason why we do

quarterly  reviews is because we offer the  flats  quarterly.

The  Minister has mentioned that we are looking into  a  more

flexible  and  responsive system of allocation  according  to

timing  and  location.  So we will take the Member's  concern

into consideration.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang:</b> Sir, the Minister of State did not

answer  my  question on the prices for the  "bad"  units.   I

think  if  they  are cheaper, more people may take  up  these

units.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, as I said, for the prices,

we  take into consideration the attributes of the flats.  So,

flats  that do not have a good facing or are on lower  floors

in the same block and location, are generally cheaper.  Flats

that  are  not  selected for, say, one to three years,  would

probably command a lower price too.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister  of State whether new HDB flats are still affordable

to  the  lower-income group, bearing in mind that this  group

has been adversely affected by the recent economic crisis and

might not have recovered in line with the subsequent recovery

in the economy?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, as I mentioned in my

reply, affordability is a key consideration, and the Ministry

is  always  mindful  of helping the lower-income  group.   In

fact, if Members can recall, not long ago, we introduced  the

Special  Housing Assistance Programme (SHAP) for  the  lower-income  group  and people who are earning,  say,  $2,000  and

below.   They can now buy a 3-room buy-back flat and can  get

up to 95% in loans from the Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, is it a concern that if prices of

new  HDB  flats are lowered, it would then lead to a drop  in

HDB  resale  prices  and,  subsequently,  a  decline  in  the

property market on the whole?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, as I said, again, the key

consideration  is affordability.  Everybody  knows  that  the

prices  of  new HDB flats lag behind prices of  resale  units

and,  I  think, for good reason, because HDB flat  prices  do

contribute to stability of the whole property market.

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT LINKED COMPANIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Review of performance)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Tay Beng Chuan -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry (a)

whether his Ministry has conducted a critical review  of  the

performance  of  Government linked companies (GLCs)  and  its

impact  on the Singapore economy;  and (b) whether the strong

presence of the GLCs in our domestic economy will impede  our

current  efforts  to create a pro-enterprise environment  for

businesses,  especially  the private  entrepreneurs  and  the

small and medium enterprises.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Question No. 8, Sir.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, GLCs operate on a commercial basis,

like  private-sector  companies.  They  do  not  receive  any

subsidy  or  preferential treatment from the Government,  and

are  subject  to  the same regulations and market  forces  as

private entrepreneurs and SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The influence of GLCs on our economy is often over-stated. There is a perception that GLCs dominate our

economy.  Even a recent US Embassy report over-estimated that

GLCs  contributed 60% to our GDP.  This is not correct.   The

Department  of Statistics (DOS) has studied this  matter  and

found  that  GLCs  contribute just 12.9% to  our  GDP.   This

refers  to  companies  where  the  Singapore  Government  has

effective  voting shares of 20% or more.  In  contrast,  MNCs

play a much bigger role, accounting for 42% of our GDP.   The

Department of Statistics will be releasing its detailed study

soon.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although complaints are made from time to time, there is

clear  evidence that the presence of GLCs has not compromised

the ease and attractiveness of starting up new businesses  in

Singapore.   For  example, Singapore was ranked  8th  in  the

Startup Index of the 2000 Global Competitiveness Report.  The

number  of new companies registered yearly have also been  on

the  rise, with the number registered in the 2000 up 16% from

five years earlier, and 70% compared to 1990.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to ensure that our markets

remain  open and competitive, and that the playing  field  is

level  for  all companies.  It is not Government's policy  to

favour  GLCs and, if there are valid criticisms, we will  act

on  them.  In fact, the Government is reviewing its rules and

regulations  to  make sure that these rules  and  regulations

facilitate,  and not inhibit, private enterprise,  especially

for the New Economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: should we reverse-discriminate against

GLCs  in Singapore in order to favour private companies?   If

we  do  this, Singapore consumers will lose out.  As long  as

their practices are competitive, we should not force GLCs out

of  the  local market.  In any case, our domestic  market  is

small.   To  grow, Singapore companies have  to  look  beyond

Singapore  and,  for  this reason, the Government  encourages

Singapore companies, including our GLCs, to venture overseas.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I think the Minister's revelations

of the figures are quite interesting, given the feeling among

many that it is not the case.  Could I invite the Ministry to

also reveal the figures according to sectors - manufacturing,

etc  -  so  that we can get a clearer picture?  Additionally,

would  the Minister share his views about the possibility  of

having competition law in Singapore to ensure a level playing

field for all, including GLCs?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will ask

the  Department  of  Statistics  to  consider  including  the

statistics which Mr Simon Tay has asked for, when it releases

its detailed report on its study.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for whether we should introduce a competition law in

Singapore,  such  as is found in some of  the  more  advanced

countries,  we are still reviewing this matter  in  MTI.   In

fact, we are under some pressure to do this, in the course of

our   negotiations  on  Free  Trade  Agreements  with   other

countries.  But there are complications involved.  We propose

to do this step-by-step, and the Energy Market Authority that

we  are  setting  up,  will  be  a  first  step  towards  the

establishment of such a regime where, for industries which we

identify explicitly, certain rules governing competition will

apply.   But  as to whether we should apply this  across-the-board in Singapore for all sectors, it is a step that we  are

not yet ready to take.

<div align="center"><b>USAGE OF MANPOWER IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Optimisation)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Tay Beng Chuan -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. To ask the Minister for Finance (a) whether there is

any  conscious and concerted effort in the public  sector  to

optimise  the  use  of  manpower  and  other  resources   and

eliminate  wastage  and  inefficiency  which  will  lead   to

accelerated  increases in Government spending;  and  (b)  how

will he ensure that the large wage rise for the civil service

will  not lead to successive increases in Government charges,

fees  and  taxes  as in the case of the recent  increases  in

Government hospital charges and university fees, and  bearing

in   mind,   Second  Minister  for  Finance's  assurance   in

Parliament,  on  25th August 2000, that Government  will  not

have to impose tax increases to pay for the wage rise for the

civil service.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Question No. 9, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Government's policy has always been to keep the public sector

as  small  as possible, consistent with the need  to  deliver

quality services to the public.  This is to allow the private

sector to retain the bulk of the nation's resources and serve

as the engine of growth.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, there are built-in mechanisms to curb the

growth  of  recurrent Government expenditures.   Budgets  for

existing  functions are allowed to increase at less than  the

GDP  growth rate, and Ministries must, therefore, deliver the

same  services with constant productivity improvements.  They

must  continually improve their efficiency and  effectiveness

in the use of manpower and other resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure good governance, the civil service must retain

a  fair  share  of  good people.  Civil service  wages  must,

therefore, be reviewed from time to time to keep them in line

with   those   of  the  private  sector.   In  making   these

adjustments, civil service salaries will always lag, and  not

lead, their private sector equivalents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hospital charges and university fees have to be adjusted

upwards  periodically not only to reflect rising  wage  costs

but  also  to provide for increasingly sophisticated  medical

services and advances in university education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both hospital charges and university fees are heavily

subsidised  and  the  Government  will  continue  to  do  so.

Patients  in  C  class  wards in restructured  hospitals  are

subsidised  at  a hefty 80%, while those in B2,  B2+  and  B1

wards are subsidised at 65%, 50% and 20%, respectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our universities, undergraduates pay only about one

quarter of actual costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I reassure Mr Tay that the Government will

not raise taxes on account of civil service wage adjustments.

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 7 of the Civil

List and Pension Act (Chapter 44), resolves that the Schedule

to  that  Act be varied by deleting the figures "$2,232,000",

"$104,300", "$2,177,200", "$1,000,130" and "$56,400"  in  the

second  column  and  substituting the  figures  "$2,391,600",

"$113,000",    "$2,653,200",    "$945,600"    and    "$1,000"

respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose that a provision of $2,508,200 be

supported  for  Class  I expenditure  for  FY2001.   Class  I

expenditure   would   cover  the  President's   salary,   his

entertainment allowance and the acting President's allowance.

The  higher  provision for FY2001 is to cater for the  salary

revisions announced in financial year 2000 and a higher  cost

of hosting official functions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for Class II expenditure is meant for the

salaries of the Istana Personnel.  The provision is higher at

$2,653,200  mainly to meet the salary revisions announced  in

2000,  higher employer CPF contribution rate and other salary

increases resulting from the NWC recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A provision of $945,600 is required for Class III

expenditure  to meet the expenses of the Istana's  household.

The  higher  provision is mainly to cater for an increase  in

utilities tariffs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A budget of $1,000 is provided for Special Services for

consultancy charges under Class IV expenditure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore necessary to vary the provisions in the

Schedule to the Civil List

<div align="center"><b>PART I REVIEW OF THE ECONOMY</b></div>

Economic Performance in 2000

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are starting off on a good footing in the new

millennium.  Last year, our economy outperformed expectations

and  grew  by  9.9%, a rate not exceeded  since  1994.   [The

economic growth rate in 1994 was 11.4%.]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All sectors enjoyed higher growth in 2000. In

particular, manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade grew by

a  strong 15%. Financial and business services rebounded from

marginal  growth in 1999, to 4.1% and 6.6% respectively.  The

contraction of the construction sector

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



continued, but was less severe than that in 1999, and  showed

signs of reversal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong external demand was the cause of growth. The

world  economy is estimated to have expanded by 4.7% in 2000,

the  highest growth rate in 12 years.  In particular, the  US

economy  was  the  key  driver  behind  global  demand.   The

bursting  of  the  dot-com bubble did not stop  the  US  from

registering a stellar growth of 5.0% last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electronics, which was a major engine for the recovery

in  1999,  continued to take centre-stage  in  2000.   Global

semiconductors sales surged by a remarkable 31%, up from  19%

in  1999.  This gave our manufacturing sector a strong boost,

with major downstream benefits for many other sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year 2000 was also a great year for investment

promotion.  Manufacturing investment  commitments  reached  a

record  $9.2  billion.  Many of these were in key  knowledge-intensive   industries  like  pharmaceuticals  and   high-end

electronics  that  will position us well for  future  growth.

EDB  also  secured  $1.9  billion  of  commitments  in  total

business  spending  for  services  last  year.   Against  the

uncertain  political  environment  in  Southeast   Asia   and

competition  from  China,  the  achievements  of   EDB   were

especially remarkable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our job market benefited from the strong economic growth

in  2000. More than 110,000 jobs were created, far surpassing

the  40,000  in 1999. Retrenchments tailed off, falling  from

14,600  in  1999  to  11,500 last year.   As  a  result,  the

seasonally-adjusted  unemployment  rate  fell  to   2.8%   in

December 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strong economic performance was due not only to

fortuitous  external  developments, but  also  to  our  sound

economic  policies  and the hard work of  Singaporeans.  Full

credit  should go to our workers, who have patiently  put  up

with the CPF cut. This was instrumental in retaining investor

confidence and enabling our industries to stay globally

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



competitive,  as  we rode out the Asian economic  crisis.  In

recognition  of the strong growth, another 4%age points  have

been  restored to the employers' CPF contribution  rate  last

month, bringing it to 16%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while our overall economic performance was very

good,  not all businesses benefited. Besides the construction

sector,  some  industries like wood and paper  products,  and

retail  segments  such as watch, jewellery and  neighbourhood

shops,  did  not do well. Many SMEs were not able to  benefit

from  the  strong global demand.  The robust growth was  also

not  reflected in the asset markets. The STI ended 22%  lower

last  year, while the residential property price index dipped

1.0%.

Outlook for 2001

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot repeat the exceptional performance of 2000

this  year.  While the overall outlook for 2001 remains fair,

we must be prepared for slower growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External economic prospects have become less rosy. The

US  economy  has decelerated quite sharply in  the  past  few

months. Poorer corporate results and weak stock markets  have

begun  to  feed through to slower consumption and investment.

The  chances of a hard landing have increased, prompting  the

Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 100 basis points  so

far  this  year.  The consensus is that the US  economy  will

grow by only 2 to 2.5% this year.  But if it turns out lower,

we will be in for harder times ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Japanese economy is expected to remain weak this

year.  In  fact, its recovery is beginning to show  signs  of

stalling. Household expenditure has remained anaemic  due  to

job  worries  and continuing deflation. Japanese exports  are

already slowing on the back of weaker US demand. These  could

in turn dampen business investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, growth in Europe should be able to provide

some  support  for  the  slowing external  demand.   Although

growth in Europe peaked last year, it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



should  remain  healthy at about 3% in 2001,  underpinned  by

robust consumption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, global electronics demand will moderate from

its  stellar  growth  of last year.  Some  industry  watchers

expect sales of semiconductors to slow significantly from the

heady  31%  growth  last year to just 5-10%  this  year.  But

continued  healthy  demand  in  segments  such  as  PCs   and

telecommunications  products will provide  some  support  for

growth in the electronics sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slowdown in the US economy and electronics demand

will affect the region. While Asia has, by and large, bounced

back from the crisis, it has not yet been nursed back to full

health. Asian banking systems remain weak, and there is still

much  restructuring to be done. In several  Asian  countries,

internal political problems add to their complications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to keep a close watch on the dark clouds looming

in  the  horizon. But there is no ground for excessive gloom.

Domestically, the composite leading index continues to  point

to growth ahead.  The business expectations survey shows that

firms  in the financial services, catering and hotel segments

expect  business  to  improve in the  next  6  months.  While

manufacturers have turned cautious about growth prospects  in

the  next 6 months, the new plants coming on stream this year

in  the  electronics, chemicals and life sciences  industries

will  help  to buttress growth.  The construction  sector  is

also  bottoming out and looks set to register positive growth

this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the global economy is likely to become more

volatile,   we   are  well  positioned  to   ride   out   the

fluctuations.   Our restructuring efforts and upgrading  over

the  years  have paid off and we now have a more  diversified

and  resilient economy. We have a strong manufacturing sector

and  a  good  spectrum  of  thriving services.  Our  domestic

exports are fairly well spread out among the major markets of

United  States, European Union and Asia.  Although we have  a

dominant electronics sector, we are steadily building up  our

chemicals cluster. Even within electronics,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



there   is   strong   diversification.   Semiconductors   and

telecommunications  equipment  have  emerged  as  new  growth

drivers,  as  our  production share of disk  drives  and  PCs

declines. The external wing of our economy is firming up  and

regionalisation efforts are paying off.  Income  from  abroad

has  risen  by more than 8% on average for each year  between

1990  and  2000.  This  provides a  supplementary  source  of

earnings for our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this broad and robust economic base which has

enabled   us  to  emerge  from  the  Asian  economic   crisis

relatively  unscathed. In fact, in relative  terms,  we  have

come  out of the Asian crisis stronger and are able to  start

the  new  millennium  on a solid footing.  With  this  year's

budget,  the  Government  will  continue  to  facilitate  the

upgrading and restructuring of our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this year, taking all factors into account, the

Ministry of Trade and Industry forecasts a growth of 5 to 7%.

But  if the external environment turns for the worse, it  can

have  a substantial impact on our growth, given our very open

economy.  We will continue to monitor the situation closely.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4>PART II THE FY2001 BUDGET</h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I move on now to the Budget for Fiscal

Year 2001.

FY 2000 BUDGET OUTTURN

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I do so, I would first like to recap on the

FY2000  Budget  and  touch on changes  made  to  improve  the

presentation of the Budget in the Budget Book.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I presented the FY2000 Budget to the House last

year,  operating revenue was estimated at $31.4  billion  and

total  expenditure at $29 billion, yielding a budget  surplus

of $2.4 billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, last year's GDP growth of 9.9% exceeded all

expectations. As a result, revenue growth has turned out

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>



to  be much stronger. On the other hand, total expenditure is

expected  to  be about $1 billion lower at $28  billion.  The

lower  expenditure  is  due to reduced development  spending,

partly  offset by unforeseen compensation payments to Singtel

and   Starhub.  In  addition,  last  year,  Government   also

announced  several  surplus sharing measures  totalling  $1.8

billion which included the CPF Top-up, the Medishield  Scheme

for  the Elderly and contributions to the Eldercare Fund  and

the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking into account all these changes, a budget surplus

of  $3.5  billion is now forecast for FY2000.  However,  this

budget  surplus cannot be directly compared with the forecast

made in February last year because of several changes made to

the presentation of the FY2000 budget. I will now explain the

rationale underlying these changes.

CHANGES TO THE BUDGET PRESENTATION

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year, I moved the Constitutional

Amendment Bill to require the Government to protect at  least

50%  of  the Net Investment Income (or NII) earned from  past

reserves. The issue of whether or not to protect NII was  one

that the Government has carefully considered for a long time.

Previously, NII used to accrue fully to current reserves  and

was all spendable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The composition of operating revenue has since been

changed to include a new item called "NII Contribution". This

is the portion of NII that is available for the government-of-the-day to spend. NII now also incorporates interest earnings

from developmental loans which have been classified under the

item   "Others".  The  item  "Others"  is  consequently  much

smaller.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has also reclassified expenditure on land

reclamation projects. These are projects which help to  build

up  the  nation's  land  bank for long-term  use.  They  were

previously  funded as development expenditure  using  current

revenues. This arrangement could be a disincentive

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



for  future governments to take on such projects as  benefits

would only accrue in the long term. While this Government has

not  shrunk from carrying out reclamation projects, we should

make changes to address this potential problem to ensure that

such   projects   continue  to  be   undertaken   by   future

governments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land reclamation should be viewed as a long-term

investment.  From  FY 2001, expenditures on land  reclamation

will  be  funded from capital receipts from land sales.  Such

expenditures  are reflected as land-related  expenditures  in

the Budget Book.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the changes I have outlined above,

refinements   have   also   been   made   to   the   sectoral

classification of ministries. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs

has  been shifted to the newly renamed "Security and External

Relations" sector, while Ministry of National Development has

been  transferred to the "Social Development"  sector.  These

changes  have been made to better reflect the main  functions

of  the  two  ministries.  For the same  reason,  the  sector

"General   Services"   has  also  been  renamed   "Government

Administration".

ENTERING THE NEW MILLENNIUM: A PLACE FOR EVERYONE

Objectives of the Budget

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the FY2001 Budget proper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget time is a time to take stock of the economy and

the  Government's  work in the past year.  This  year  is  an

especially  opportune time to look back and see  how  far  we

have come, as well as look forward to where we are headed for

the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past 35 years, the Singapore economy has

undergone  many changes, as we continually adjust  to  global

conditions in search of sustained economic growth. Because of

the  hard work, enterprise and unity of all Singaporeans,  we

have  been  able  to seize new growth opportunities  as  they

present themselves.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>



We  have created a resilient and prosperous economy that  has

weathered many storms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the new millennium ushers in a new age in which

ideas,  knowledge and talent are the main drivers of  growth.

It  is an era where it is the economies that are best able to

generate  and  attract wealth-creating ideas,  knowledge  and

people that will succeed. Therein lies great opportunity  for

Singapore  -  a  country whose greatest  advantages  are  its

people,  and  its connectivity to the rest of the  world.  By

positioning  ourselves  as  a  knowledge-based  economy,  and

leveraging on our strengths, we can ride the waves of change,

and continue to lift living standards in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as in the past, the Government and people of

Singapore  must come together and make the necessary  changes

to  our  economy, to ensure that Singapore remains  the  best

home for all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we make these adjustments to anticipate and

embrace  global  trends and changes, we must continue  to  be

mindful of our local context: those who can run faster should

pave  the  way  for  the  rest; however,  those  who  may  be

unwittingly left behind must not be left with no help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government realises that realignments of our economy

have  often meant displacement of jobs, or even disappearance

of industries, but for every door closed, we have opened many

others, leading to greater opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand that it is not easy for workers to

continually  learn new skills and work in a new  environment,

or  for  enterprises to quickly change direction  and  pursue

business  prospects in new areas.  It takes a great  deal  of

courage  to  embrace  changes, and take  the  steps  to  walk

through  new  doors  of  opportunity.  The  transition  often

entails adjustments which are sometimes painful. But we  want

to help. We want to lessen the hardship for those who find it

difficult to adapt to the changes.  But change we must.   And

at  the  end  of  the  day,  we have  to  ensure  that  every

Singaporean  has  a  place  in  the  Singapore  of  the   new

millennium.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main thrusts of this year's budget are therefore: at

the  macro  level, to position Singapore for  a  new  era  of

growth,   by  increasing  our  attractiveness  not  only   to

businesses  as a place to invest in, but also to  individuals

as  a place to live and work in.  And at the micro level,  to

give  every individual worker the wherewithal to weather this

difficult  but  necessary period of transition  to  this  new

stage  of  economic  growth,  to  assist  promising  business

enterprises in getting established, and to help businesses in

dying trades shift out to other industries.

Projected FY2001 Fiscal Position

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now touch on the FY2001 fiscal position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating revenue for FY2001 is estimated at $34.3

billion,  including  a  $0.9 billion contribution  from  NII.

Operating and development expenditures are budgeted at  $18.7

billion  and $9.4 billion respectively. Total expenditure  in

FY2001  thus  comes to $28.1 billion. Special transfers  will

total $1.9 billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on these projections of revenue, expenditure and

special  transfers,  a budget surplus of  $4.4  billion  [The

figures  are  rounded to one decimal point.] is expected  for

FY2001. Once again, we are in the happy position of having  a

budget  surplus. Having a surplus allows us to take  measures

to  enhance our competitiveness, share with Singaporeans  the

fruits  of the nation's success, and at the same time add  to

our reserves.

Expenditure Priorities

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in previous years, the largest share of the

Government's  FY2001 expenditure budget goes  to  the  Social

Development  sector,  which  accounts  for  43.4%  of   total

expenditure.  Education,  Health, Community  Development  and

Sports, Information and the Arts and Public Housing will  all

get  substantial increases in their budget allocation.  These

increases are in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>



line with the Government's policy of educating the young, and

looking  after  the  people's welfare, health,  cultural  and

housing needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next largest sector is the Security and External

Relations sector. We will continue to invest heavily  in  the

security  of our nation and in building warm ties with  other

countries. Although this sector takes up 36.6% of  the  total

expenditure budget, it is money well spent, for without peace

and  security,  we would not have secure homes  and  economic

growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic Development is the third largest sector. This

sector  takes  up 15.0% of the total expenditure  budget.  It

represents   our   continued  investment  in  infrastructure,

creation   of   new  economic  activities  and  comprehensive

development of our workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government Administration sector remains the

smallest  sector,  comprising 5.0% of the  total  expenditure

budget. We will continue to keep this the smallest sector  as

our  policy is to keep central administration small  and  let

operational ministries have the bulk of the resources.

POSITIONING SINGAPORE FOR THE NEW ERA OF GROWTH

Creating a Framework to Stay Competitive

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideas and entrepreneurial spirit of individuals and

businesses  are  the  foundation of our  new  knowledge-based

economy. Innovation and enterprise will be the key drivers of

this   new   economy.  More  than  ever  before,  positioning

ourselves for the future can only be done in a broad  way  at

the  national  level. Ultimately, it is up to  companies  and

individuals to identify specific commercial opportunities and

threats and respond accordingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Government can and will do, however, is to

continue  to  ensure  an  environment that  is  pro-business,

encourages  individual effort and the drive  for  innovation,

and facilitates the blossoming

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>



of  new ideas. At the same time, the Government will continue

to  create  the  conditions to attract  and  retain  talented

Singaporeans  and  foreigners to live in  and  contribute  to

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the latest World Competitiveness Yearbook ranking, we

retained  our  overall standing as the  world's  second  most

competitive  economy after the United States.  We  were  also

ranked  the  country  that  was  best-adapted  for  long-term

competitiveness,   and  the  economy  whose   companies   and

Government take the shortest time to adapt to changes in  the

economic cycle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, rather than making us rest on our laurels,

these  positive showings in international rankings must  spur

us  on  to  keep  up and not fall back. The global  challenge

demands  continuous effort.  Country after country is pushing

on,  reducing taxes to be more competitive, cutting  back  on

social expenditure they can no longer sustain, all wishing to

build the next Silicon Valley.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies such as that by the Political and Economic Risk

Consultancy Ltd., or PERC, have pointed out that one critical

area for improvement is the quality of manpower. We recognise

that  human capital will be our competitive edge for our next

phase  of  economic development.  We must develop  our  human

capital pool to the fullest.

Education and Training

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for Singapore to succeed in our next phase of

economic  development, we will require a  different  type  of

workforce   -  one that is able to acquire, apply and  create

knowledge in flexible and innovative ways to generate greater

value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the jobs that Singapore expects to create in 10

to  15  years, we require a workforce where 65% have at least

post-secondary education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as of 1999, only 35% of our workforce have post-secondary education or higher. There is thus a risk of

workers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



being  structurally displaced if they do not upgrade or learn

new skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is addressing this issue through a multi-pronged approach. First, we will continue to invest heavily

in education to ensure that new entrants to the workforce are

well-equipped  to meet the challenges of the new  millennium.

Our  students must be equipped with the right skill sets  for

the  knowledge  age,  which include creativity  and  critical

reasoning  skills.  For this, the Ministry  of  Education  is

allocated  a  budget  of  $6.3 billion,  the  second  largest

amongst all the ministries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we will also be spending more than $30 million

on  the Manpower Development Assistance Scheme (or MDAS)  and

other  initiatives that will help everyone in  the  workforce

upgrade their skills and knowledge continuously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, to promote lifelong learning, Government has set

up  the  Lifelong  Learning Endowment Fund announced  by  the

Prime  Minister  last August. The Government is  contributing

the first $500 million to the fund in FY 2000. I am happy  to

announce  that  the Government will contribute  another  $500

million to the Fund in FY2001. This will bring the Fund to $1

billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will equip our workers with the skills to take on

existing  and new jobs, create new products and services  and

capture   new   markets  in  this  new  stage   of   economic

development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even as we try to maximise the potential of our

people,  we  can never produce enough to meet all the  talent

needs of our economy. We must therefore continue to draw  the

best  and  brightest  from around the world  to  our  shores.

Besides  adopting  a  welcoming attitude  to  foreigners  and

talent-friendly  immigration  policies,   we   need   to   be

attractive as a place to work, live and play.

Deregulation  -  Priming Our Local Enterprises for the Global

Economy

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must continue to promote a competitive domestic

market. Competition

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



begins  at  home. Our firms cannot compete globally  if  they

cannot  compete locally. Local competition will spur them  to

be   more   efficient,  creative  and  innovative.   Besides,

competition  will  benefit consumers  by  moderating  prices,

improving services, and increasing product choice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to deregulate our economy. We have

opened up the telecommunications sector with a big bang.   We

are  progressively liberalising the financial sector.  We are

gearing  up  for  a full opening of the electricity  and  gas

markets this year. We will refine these policies in the light

of experience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made significant progress in the setting up of a

new  energy  market  regime since  its  announcement  by  the

Government  in March last year.  Amongst other measures,  for

the  electricity  industry, the system and  market  operation

functions  will be transferred from PowerGrid to  the  Energy

Market Authority of Singapore (EMA).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retail sector of the energy market will be

liberalised in phases. Beginning later this year, the  market

for  large  consumers will be progressively made contestable.

The  retail  market  for the remaining one million  consumers

will  only  be  opened up after 2002 as  all  households  are

affected and a detailed study will have to be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gas industry will be restructured in a similar way

to  support  a  competitive  framework  for  the  electricity

industry.   The  ownership of the gas transportation  system,

which  is  a  natural  monopoly, will be separated  from  the

contestable sectors of gas import, trading and retail.

Managing the Restructuring of the Economy

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our economy transits into a knowledge-based economy

and a new stage of economic growth, we will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



promote growth sectors and high value-added industries  which

will  help  us  move up the value chain. The Government  will

encourage the emergence of promising local businesses in such

growth  sectors.   Businesses in sunset  industries  will  be

helped to move out to other more profitable sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to support R&D efforts in

order  to add value to industry and move the country  towards

higher  value, knowledge-intensive economic growth.  Our  R&D

efforts  have  produced positive results to date.  They  have

helped  workers in R&D companies increase the value they  add

to  their  jobs, and also helped raise the share of high-tech

exports  from  Singapore   -  from 52%  of  non-oil  domestic

exports in 1990 to 66% in 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, the amount committed by Government has

more than doubled, from $2 billion allocated for the first 5-year National Technology plan to $4 billion for the second 5-year  Plan (NSTP2000). The next phase of our R&D plan is  the

$7 billion Science and Technology Plan 2005 (S&T 2005), which

will last 5 years from 2001 to 2005.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In FY2001, we will spend a total of $625 million in this

area to support activities and programmes that will serve  to

strengthen  industry  R&D, develop R&D  manpower  capability,

promote  technopreneurship, enhance knowledge  infrastructure

and promote economically relevant international R&D.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote life-sciences, EDB has set up a $1 billion

R&D  fund  and a $1 billion investment fund to attract  life-sciences  R&D and start-up activities. A pharmaceutical  park

will  be  developed  at  Tuas, and space  for  life  sciences

facilities will be set aside at the Buona Vista Science  Hub.

Manpower  capabilities for the life sciences are  also  being

developed through various programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To raise the performance of local enterprises, the

Productivity  and Standards Board (PSB) will  help  firms  to

modernise

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



management, adopt IT and increase efficiency.  It will assist

companies in restructuring and moving up the value chain,  or

moving  into  growing ones. This will help to rejuvenate  the

business   scene  and  allow  resources  to  be   re-deployed

efficiently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those local enterprises that are promising, we will

continue  to help groom them into world-class companies.  The

existing   Economic  Development  Assistance  Scheme   (EDAS)

provides  local firms with technical assistance and training,

and  helps  them  to  adopt new technologies,  amongst  other

initiatives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For businesses which are not doing well or facing

shrinking business prospects, we want to help them cope  with

the   change  either  by  upgrading  and  modernising   their

operations, or shifting to industries with better  prospects.

The  retail sector is an area the Government has looked  into

with  relevant  public and private agencies.   The  Singapore

Productivity and Standards Board will be releasing a  10-year

strategic  plan titled Retail 21 shortly. This plan  examines

the  challenges faced by the retail sector, and sets out  new

strategies  for  growth and expansion  of  the  sector.   The

objective   of  Retail  21  is  to  double  retail  workforce

productivity by the year 2010. We look forward to hearing the

recommendations of Retail 21.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One group of enterprises within the retail sector that

needs  particular  assistance  is  the  neighbourhood  shops,

markets and hawker centres in HDB estates.  The Minister  for

National  Development assured the House  yesterday  that  the

Government  will  lend  them  a  helping  hand.  We  will  be

announcing  a  programme that includes elements of  upgrading

assistance,  incentives  to  help  ease  the  retirement   of

operators  who wish to do so, and re-training for alternative

employment  and trades.  The focus of the programme  is  thus

not  just  on  short  term remedies, but  also  on  long-term

restructuring for the benefit of all concerned.  The Ministry

of  National  Development will provide more details  of  this

Assistance   Programme  during  the   Committee   of   Supply

proceedings.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these efforts have a common goal - to facilitate

restructuring, and help our companies move up the value chain

and into growing industries.

Connecting to the Global Economy

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has thrived by being plugged into the global

economic network. In fact, we have just been ranked the  most

globalised economy in the world. Last year's total  trade  of

$470  billion was about 3 times the size of our GDP.  We will

continue to strengthen our economic linkages with the rest of

the  world.   So  while Singapore remains  committed  to  the

launch of a new multilateral trade round at WTO, we are  also

pursuing  deeper trade liberalisation initiatives with  like-minded  countries  through bilateral  Free  Trade  Agreements

(FTAs).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first bilateral FTA with New Zealand has already

gone  into operation. This year, we aim to conclude FTAs with

Australia,  Japan,  Mexico  and  the  US.   We  are  also  in

exploratory  talks with Canada, India and the  European  Free

Trade Association (EFTA). Through these FTAs that span across

regions and continents, we hope to anchor Singapore firmly as

a global trading node.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closer to home, we will continue to work towards greater

economic  integration with our neighbours through  the  ASEAN

Free  Trade Area (AFTA), ASEAN Investment Area (AIA), and  e-ASEAN  initiatives.  Deeper economic integration will enhance

ASEAN's  attractiveness as a destination for  global  foreign

direct  investments  (FDIs).  This is  particularly  crucial,

given  the rise of China and the inevitable diversion of  FDI

to Northeast Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promoting global free trade and regional economic

cooperation will help Singapore to continue to do well in the

global economy.

Public Services for the New Economy

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A forward-looking Government must continuously

anticipate and welcome

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



change,  and  harness  the forces of  change  in  the  global

environment.  The  Government  must  deliver  services  in  a

responsive and timely way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E-government is the Public Service's response to the

increasing   pervasiveness  of  ICT  or   info-communications

technology.  The  advent of ICT has triggered  rising  public

expectations of service standards. We are leveraging  on  ICT

to  build  an  e-government for the  21st  century,  and  put

Government  services as well as intra-government transactions

online.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E-government will be a major transformation in the

delivery of Government services. The Government will be  able

to  provide services faster, more efficiently, and in a  more

convenient way. By the end of 2001, nearly two-thirds of  all

Government services will be available online in some form  or

other, making them accessible 24 hours a day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all these will be wasted time and energy if the

public  does  not adjust to a different way  of  seeking  and

receiving the services they want. Public officers, too,  must

adjust  to faster transaction speeds and the tearing down  of

organisational boundaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as for other changes that are necessary for

Singapore's transition into the knowledge age, the Government

is the facilitator who will put into place the infrastructure

to  help  Singaporeans  improve their living  standards,  but

ultimately  it is up to individual Singaporeans to  make  the

choice  and take the necessary steps. In this case, it  means

acquainting themselves with ICT or overcoming mindsets  about

traditional  forms  of service delivery.  Only  then  can  we

ensure  that we get the most value out of the ICT  revolution

to improve our living standards.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now turn

to the proposals for tax changes and other provisions.

<div align="center"><b>ACHIEVING OUR OBJECTIVES</b></div>

Creating the Best Environment for Business

A New Corporate Tax Regime

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is committed to creating the best

conditions for private enterprise to flourish, while adhering

to the principles of fiscal prudence. Our aim has always been

to  keep business costs down wherever possible and to  ensure

that  our corporate tax rate remains competitive.  In  recent

years,  many  developed  economies such  as  Germany,  United

Kingdom,  Australia  and Ireland have lowered  corporate  tax

rates in order to stimulate and attract investments. We  have

to keep pace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in the New Economy, picking winners will

become  harder. Hence, while we will continue to provide  tax

incentives  to  spur the growth of strategic  industries,  we

will also lower the tax rate generally so that new industries

can mushroom and thrive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, our corporate tax rate was reduced by half a

percentage point to 25.5%. This year I have decided to reduce

the  corporate tax rate by a further one percentage point  to

24.5%,  to  take  effect  from YA2002.   This  will  help  us

maintain   our   tax  competitiveness  in   an   increasingly

globalised world.  It will also help lower the tax burden  of

businesses  in  Singapore in the coming  year  when  economic

growth is likely to be less robust.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government also recognises that small businesses are

an important component of the Singapore economy. To help such

companies, I have decided

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



to  introduce a tax exemption scheme that will help them grow

and get established.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from YA2002, three-quarters of up to the

first  $10,000 of a company's chargeable income, and one-half

of  up to the next $90,000 will be exempt from corporate tax.

The  remaining chargeable income will be taxed at  the  newly

lowered rate of 24.5%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that many small and medium enterprises and

start-ups  will have their taxes reduced by more  than  half,

for  the same chargeable income. Based on current data, about

two-thirds  of taxable companies will be taxed at  less  than

half  the  previous  tax rate. Companies,  most  particularly

smaller enterprises, can look forward to being able to plough

more  of  their profits back to their businesses  to  exploit

growth opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All companies, not just the small and medium-sized ones,

will  enjoy  the  tax exemption. The benefits  passed  on  to

companies  arising from the lower corporate  tax  rate  under

this  new tax regime are estimated to amount to $680  million

annually.  This  overall lowering of  the  tax  burden  is  a

demonstration  of  the  Government's  resolve  to  keep   our

corporate  tax rate competitive globally, and our  belief  in

the importance of creating a pro-business environment that is

conducive to entrepreneurship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax exemption will not apply to Singapore dividends

received by companies. Such dividends will be taxed at 24.5%.

IRAS  will  release further details on how the new  corporate

tax regime is to be applied.

Raising Productivity  -  the CSOP scheme

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's environment, the most successful businesses

will  be  those that are able to motivate their employees  to

greater   innovation   and   enterprise.   Performance-linked

compensation systems, such as employee stock option

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



schemes, can be powerful tools to achieve this objective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a special provision for start-ups, I introduced the

Entrepreneurial Employee Stock Option Scheme last  May  where

50%  of  stock option gains is exempted from income  tax  for

employees of such companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, I indicated I would introduce a separate

scheme  that  would  be  available to  the  more  established

companies.  Today, I am glad to announce the  "Company  Stock

Option" scheme, or the CSOP scheme for short.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the scheme, income tax exemption will be granted

for up to $1 million worth of stock option gains arising from

the exercise of the employee's options over a 10-year period.

Out  of the $1 million, the first $2,000 worth of gains  each

year  will be given 100% tax exemption. This makes the scheme

very attractive for the lower-paid employees. In addition,  I

have  also  decided  to exempt from income  tax  25%  of  the

remaining  gains. Coupled with the absence of  capital  gains

taxes  and  our  low  personal tax  rates,  the  taxation  of

employee  stock  option  gains  in  Singapore  will  be  very

attractive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSOP scheme will be available to all companies that

meet  certain  conditions. One key condition  that  companies

have  to  satisfy before they can qualify for the  scheme  is

that  they will have to offer the stock options to  at  least

half  the  employees  in the company. This  is  to  encourage

companies to provide the benefits of the scheme to lower-paid

workers  as  well.  The scheme will be available  to  options

granted  with  effect  from 1st April 2001.  Details  of  the

scheme  can be found in Annex 1.  -  [Cols. 56-7  -   Company

Stock Option Scheme].

Exemption of Withholding Tax for Software Payments

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technological advances have made the use of info-communications technology or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



ICT,  and consequently software, increasingly widespread.  We

foresee  a  future in which almost all products and  services

will  require the use of software either in their  production

or operation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to lower the cost of doing business in

Singapore,  as well as encourage our businesses to  make  the

best  use of technology. The Government is also committed  to

creating an environment that is conducive to the growth of e-commerce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these in mind, and as part of our continuing

efforts  to  enhance  Singapore's  competitiveness,  I   have

decided  that  payments  for  the  following  categories   of

software   made  to  non-residents  will  be  exempted   from

withholding   tax.   These  are:  site   licences,   software

downloaded  from  the  Internet by  end-users,  and  software

bundled  with  hardware. This change  will  take  effect  for

payments due on or after today.

Writing Down Allowances for Intellectual Property

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasingly, intangible assets such as intellectual

properties  and  their  exploitation will  be  a  significant

source of competitive advantage in the Knowledge Economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance Singapore's competitiveness in this respect,

I  have  decided  to  improve the  current  incentive  scheme

relating to patents and know-how. The improved scheme extends

the  scope  of  coverage to more categories  of  intellectual

properties. Writing down allowances over a 5-year period will

be  granted for capital expenditure incurred on the following

categories  of intellectual properties acquired on  or  after

today:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Patents;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Copyrights and Related Rights;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Trade Marks;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Registered Designs;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Geographical Indications;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Layout Designs of Integrated Circuits; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) Protection of Confidential Information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This improved scheme will also cover a wider range of

industries.  It will be administered by EDB and IDA.  Details

will be released by them shortly.

Reduction of Property Tax Rate

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to reduce business costs, I have decided to cut

the  property  tax  rate from 12 to 10%.  This  will  improve

Singapore's  cost competitiveness vis-a-vis other  countries.

The  cut will apply to all properties: commercial, industrial

and  residential.  It will cost the Government  an  estimated

$336 million a year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cut in property tax rate will take effect from 1st

July  2001,  when the 25% property tax rebate for  commercial

and  industrial  properties  ends.  The  reduction  will   be

particularly helpful to small businesses that are tenants  of

JTC  and HDB properties. These businesses have been the  main

beneficiaries  of the property tax rebate for industrial  and

commercial  properties, passed on by the JTC, HDB  and  other

landlords.  The  Government  would  like  to  encourage   all

landlords to pass on savings from the property tax  rate  cut

to their tenants.

Giving a Boost to Individuals

Reduction in Individual Income Tax Rates

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce the tax burden for individuals, as well as

reward  individual effort and enterprise, I have  decided  to

cut  income  tax rates of all income bands with  effect  from

YA2002. The tax rates of all bands will be reduced by between

two  and  five percentage points. The top marginal  tax  rate

will  be  reduced from the current 28% to 26%. All individual

taxpayers  will  pay  less tax, with the majority  paying  at

least 25% less tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In percentage terms, lower-income and middle-income

taxpayers  will  benefit  most.  For example,  an  individual

earning $35,000 a year will enjoy tax savings of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



about  30%.  Taxpayers who earn $100,000 a  year  will  enjoy

savings of about 20%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994, we introduced GST and at the same time gave

taxpayers a  $700 GST-related income tax rebate to soften the

initial  impact of GST. The rebate was lowered  by  $50  each

year until it reached $500 in YA 1998. In order to streamline

the  individual tax structure, I have decided to  reduce  the

rebate  over  time,  and incorporate its  benefits  into  the

individual tax structure. To this end, the first $7,500 of an

individual's  chargeable income will not be  taxed,  and  the

$500  GST-related income tax rebate will be reduced  to  $250

correspondingly, as a first step.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net effect of all these changes to the individual

income tax regime is to make all taxpayers better off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cutting personal tax rates will lower the tax burden of

workers and encourage individual effort. Competitive personal

tax  rates  will also help Singapore retain its local  talent

and attract new foreign talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above measures will result in tax savings of $300

million  a  year for taxpayers. The new income tax rates  are

attached in Annex 2.  (Cols. 58-9).

Raising the Tax Exemption Limit for CPF Contributions

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Self-Employed

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently self-employed persons can claim tax relief for

CPF  contributions  amounting  to  20%  of  their  income  or

$14,400,  whichever is lower.  Essentially this is  only  the

employee's portion of the CPF contributions for employees  of

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the knowledge-based economy, we can expect more

people  to  be  self-employed.  They should be encouraged  to

save  for their old age to the same extent as those  who  are

employees.  The self-employed is, in a way, both employer and

employee.   Today,  he  is  granted tax  deductions  for  CPF

contributions up to what employees are required to contribute

for their ordinary wages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy will be adjusted so that self-employed

persons basically receive the same tax benefits from the  CPF

scheme  as  both employer and employee combined  with  effect

from YA 2002. A self-employed person will get tax relief  for

CPF contributions amounting to 36% of his income, subject  to

a  maximum income of $72,000. This way, entrepreneurs running

their own businesses will not be disadvantaged. Self-employed

persons  will be more motivated to save for their  retirement

by  voluntarily contributing more to their CPF accounts.  The

tax  benefits  they  will gain from this policy  change  will

amount to $6 million or more per year. This change will  take

effect for CPF contributions made from this year.

Weathering the Transition

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to our ability to stay focused, act as a nation

and  make the necessary strategic changes in our economy lies

in  the unity of our people. We must continue to build on the

social   cohesion  and  political  stability  that  we   have

painstakingly developed over the years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will help those who are facing

difficulties  in  the  transition  period  as   our   economy

restructures. In the short run, the Government  will  provide

temporary assistance to those who need help to tide over hard

times. In the long term, the best way to help them is to give

them   the  means  to  help  themselves,  through  education,

training and retraining.

Sharing the Budget Surplus

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's package of "share-outs" will be the most

generous  to date. This package is possible both  because  of

our  past adherence to the principles of fiscal prudence  and

the  hard work of all Singaporeans, that have allowed  us  to

build up a substantial surplus. Sharing the budget surplus is

an important way by which everyone benefits from the nation's

success.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



CPF Top-ups

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible Singaporeans have, in January this year,

received  the first payment of the $500 to $1,700 CPF  Top-up

announced  by  the Prime Minister in August  last  year.  The

second payment, costing $1 billion, will be given within  the

next  12  months. The CPF Top-up is a tangible way of sharing

the nation's success with Singaporeans. It was also unique in

that  it  was the first time that a CPF Top-up was structured

to give more to those in the lower income group.

Personal Tax Rebate

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the good performance of the economy in 2000,

an  across-the-board one-off tax rebate of 10% on  individual

income tax will be granted in YA 2001, up from the 5% for  YA

2000.  This  is another way of sharing budget surpluses  with

taxpayers. It will save taxpayers a total of $485 million.

Utilities Save

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an extension of the utilities rebates given to HDB

households from 1997 to 2000, the Government will  be  giving

utilities rebates totalling $350 to households living  in  1-to  3-room  HDB  flats, $300 to households living  in  4-room

flats  and  $250 to households living in 5-room flats.  These

will be given in 10 equal monthly payments from July 2001  to

April  2002.  There will be two months in the year  in  which

households have to make full payments, so that they  will  be

encouraged  to save on water and electricity. As  such,  this

scheme will be renamed Utilities Save.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Households living in 1- to 3-room HDB flats will get $35

a month, those in 4-room HDB flats $30 a month and those in 5-room  HDB  flats $25 a month. Any unutilised  amount  of  the

Utilities Save given in any month will be rolled over  to  be

used in the subsequent months. This Utilities Save scheme  is

more generous

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



than the $100 and $200 utilities rebates given last year  and

amounts to a total of $226 million.

S&C Charges and Rental Rebates

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will extend and increase the rebates on

HDB Service and Conservancy (S&C) charges and rentals granted

over recent years to Singaporeans living in rented and owner-occupied HDB flats. The new package will be the most generous

to date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Households living in 1-room flats will receive rental

rebates of $12 per month, rebates for S&C charges of  $8  per

month,  four  months'  net  rent and  five  months'  net  S&C

charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Households living in 2-room flats will receive rental

rebates  of $8 per month, rebates for S&C charges of  $7  per

month, two months' net rent and four months' net S&C charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Households living in 3-room flats will be given rebates

of  $4  per  month for S&C charges and four months'  net  S&C

charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for households living in 4-room and 5-room flats,

they  will be entitled to three months and two months of  net

S&C  charges respectively. More details can be found in Annex

3.  (Cols. 61-2).



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2001/20010223/20010223-HA-0730061.htm">ANNEX 3 - Rebates for Service and Conservancy Charges (S&CC) and   Rental Payments</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated cost of the entire package of rebates is

$107 million. Low-income households which do not live in  HDB

flats   can  continue  to  receive  help  from  the  Citizens

Consultative Committees (CCCs) Assistance Scheme.

The Singapore Allowance

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help pensioners drawing low pensions cope with

inflation,  the Government introduced an ex-gratia  allowance

called  the Singapore Allowance in April 1974. This ex-gratia

allowance  is  an  additional  payment  over  and  above  the

pensions  that the Government pays to pensioners residing  in

Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Allowance was last revised in August 1997,

when the quantum was increased by $10, from $130 to $140  per

month,  and  the gross pension ceiling raised  from  $900  to

$950.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has decided to increase the Singapore

Allowance  further by $10 to $150 per month,  and  raise  the

gross  pension  ceiling from the current $950 to  $1,050  per

month.  The revision will give an additional $1.7  million  a

year to pensioners residing in Singapore, of which there  are

about  12,100.  The change will take effect  from  1st  April

2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encouraging Philanthropy - Tax Deduction for Shares

Donation

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Government is taking the lead in ensuring that

the  fruits of success are shared with the less fortunate  in

society,  we hope that Singaporeans who are better  off  will

choose to give more back to society by way of time, expertise

and donation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to current tax deductibility for donations

to  qualifying  institutions, I  have  decided  to  make  the

donation of shares tax deductible also. This opens up another

avenue for charitable donations, and is a recognition of  the

fact that a rising number of companies are using shares as  a

form of remuneration for their employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a start, tax deductions will be granted to

individuals who donate to Institutions of a Public  Character

(IPCs)  shares  which are listed on the SGX and  unit  trusts

readily  tradable in Singapore. The concession will apply  to

donations made from January 2001.

Transfers

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$1 billion is being proposed for the second payment of

the  CPF  Top-up  of $500 to $1,700 announced  by  the  Prime

Minister in August last year. In addition, the Government  is

proposing to contribute another $500 million to the  Lifelong

Learning Endowment Fund, bringing the total to $1 billion.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ElderCare Fund was set up to help lower-income and

lower-middle income households with the cost of nursing  home

care,  while  the  Medical Endowment Fund helps  lower-income

individuals with their medical bills so as to ensure that  no

one  will be left without access to medical care because they

cannot afford it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further build up the ElderCare Fund and the Medical

Endowment  Fund, the Government will contribute $250  million

to  the  ElderCare Fund (bringing the total to $750  million)

and  $100 million to the Medical Endowment Fund (bringing the

total to $800 million) in FY2001.

MISCELLANEOUS TAX CHANGES

Duties on Cigarettes

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our continuing national effort to discourage

smoking,  especially  among our youth,  the  excise  duty  on

cigarettes will be increased from $150 to $180 per  kilogram.

Duties on cigarettes were last revised in February 2000.  The

change  will  take  effect from today. The estimated  revenue

gain is $102 million per year.

CONCLUSION

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of Budget 2001 at the macro level is to

position  Singapore for the challenges of the global  economy

in the new millennium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cuts in the corporate and property tax rates, the

new corporate tax structure, and the exemption of withholding

tax  on  software payments  -  these will all lower  business

costs, and help us maintain our international competitiveness

as a business location.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the global economy becomes more knowledge-based, to maintain competitiveness, it is no longer

sufficient for us to just cut costs, or wring the last bit of

efficiency  out  of  existing systems.  Innovations  and  new

ideas  will  play an increasingly important role in  creating

wealth  for  companies  in Singapore, and  consequently,  for

Singapore as a nation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we are encouraging productivity and

entrepreneurship,  through the new  corporate  tax  structure

favouring  small enterprises and start-ups, a more favourable

treatment  towards  stock  options  for  employees  of    all

companies  and  not  just  start-ups,  and  raising  the  tax

exemption limits on voluntary CPF contributions by the  self-employed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we will help our companies to move up

the  value  chain  and into growing industries  by  our  $868

million   spending  in  R&D  and  the  Economic   Development

Assistance  Scheme, and give assistance to local  enterprises

as they adapt to changing market conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though businesses are important, even more important are

the  people.  This is why we are investing nearly $7  billion

in  the education of our children and continuous training  of

our   people,   through   our   investment   in   educational

institutions, the Manpower Development Assistance Scheme, and

the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund, among many other ways.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Government will continue to create

the  conditions  to attract and retain talented  Singaporeans

and foreigners to live in and contribute to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of this year's budget at a micro level is,

as I mentioned earlier, to help everyone in Singapore make  a

successful  transition  into  the  knowledge-based   economy.

Education and re-training are key. Adjustment takes time  and

effort.  The lowly skilled are in greatest danger  of  losing

their  jobs. The lower-paid need the most help, but  most  of

all  they  must  want to help themselves. The Government  can

lend  a  helping  hand  in  the  process.  We  are  therefore

implementing a slew of measures to ease the financial  burden

on  individuals,  and  share the  economic  surplus  that  we

enjoyed in year 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are cutting individual income tax rates

significantly, giving a one-off 10% tax rebate on  individual

income tax,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



continuing with rebates on S&C charges and rents, and helping

HDB  households  through  the Utilities  Save  scheme.   This

package  of  measures has been intentionally designed  to  be

progressive, to benefit the less well-off more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we focus on enabling the economically active to

adapt  better in the new millennium, we do not want to forget

the  others.   This  is  the  reason  for  allowing  the  tax

deduction   of   shares  donation  to   IPCs   to   encourage

philanthropy,  as  well as the Government's  contribution  of

$250  million to the ElderCare Fund and $100 million  to  the

Medical Endowment Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a place for everyone in Singapore, and everyone

will  benefit from good governance. It will take  effort  and

even  a  fair amount of difficulty to reach where  we,  as  a

nation,  want  to  get to.  This Budget serves  to  encourage

everyone to stay united and succeed together.  [Applause].
