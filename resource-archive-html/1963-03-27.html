<br><br><!-- Inche Yusof bin Ishak (His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara (Inche Yusof bin Ishak)</b> <i>(In Malay)</i>: Honourable Members  of

the  Legislative Assembly of the State of Singapore ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my privilege and pleasure to open this

Fourth  Session of the Legislative  Assembly  on  a

quiet note of confidence. The House has had a  long

vacation and I am sure all Honourable Members,  Mr

Speaker  and  also  the staff of  this  House  have

recovered  from  the stresses and  strains  of  the

rigorous  Third  Session which ended  in  September

last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Session, there will not be the same air of

excitement and uncertainty. The referendum  on  1st

September  helped to settle many things.  Singapore

has  weathered  the  storm; the tempest  has  spent

itself.  All  is  calm and tranquil.  But  we  must

always  be  vigilant. There are still some  in  our

midst  actively trying to disrupt national security

and sabotage our plans for Malaysia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 5</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True they have this time lost the open argument

and their dishonesty has been exposed. But they are

reforming and re-aligning their forces. The  recent

decision of the Internal Security Council  did  not

remove  the Communist United Front framework.  Only

the  key  activists in the Communist  United  Front

Conspiracy  have been neutralised. And  several  of

these    eluded   the   security   net.   Communist

underground leaders are still at large. These anti-national elements know that they have been defeated

in  this round of the battle for Malaysia,  but  we

must always be prepared to meet any renewed attacks

before 31st August, and there will be the grim long-term battle thereafter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile there will be hard work for the State

Advocate-General  and the legal  draftsmen  in  his

Chambers.  They have to ensure that all the  points

agreed to in the White Paper Command 33 of 1961  as

amplified  or  amended in the formal  exchanges  of

letters   between  the  Prime  Ministers   of   the

Federation and Singapore are duly enshrined in  the

Constitutions, both of the Federation  of  Malaysia

and of the State of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members of this House will have noticed

in  the last seven months, while all was peace  and

tranquility, that many works of construction  which

were  planned  in  the  years  1959  to  1961  have

progressed  rapidly  and are day  by  day  reaching

completion.  Every  week sees the  opening  of  new

housing   blocks,   schools,   community   centres,

clinics,  creches,  new  roads,  old  roads   being

widened,   street   lights,  drains,   stand-pipes,

electric supply and all the other things which make

Singapore a civilized place for everyone, rich  and

poor alike, to live in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the careful budgeting and the economy

measures  taken in 1959-60, and the  prosperity  in

1961 to 1963, the financial position of the country

is sound. There are funds to see us through all the

major  projects  for  tile immediate  years  ahead.

Among  these projects are the Toa Payoh  new  town,

the re-building and re-development of the old city,

and the Jurong industrial base.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most significant and gratifying of all has been

the  quiet  and steady expansion of new  factories.

Every  other  week  sees the opening  of  some  new

industrial  enterprise. Every month  sees  a  major

project  take shape in the Jurong Industrial  Site.

The future augurs well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With merger and Malaysia the internal threat,

disorder,  uncertainty, instability  and  Communist

United  Front attacks will all slowly  recede.  But

new   problems  have  appeared  over  the  horizon.

Honourable Members of the House must have known  of

the   deep   regret  the  people  felt   over   the

differences that have arisen between the Federation

of  Malaya  and  the Republic of  Indonesia.  These

differences were in part due to the rapid  fruition

of the plans for Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We welcome recent developments to ease relations

between Kuala Lumpur, the heart and capital of  our

new  Malaysia, and Jakarta, our most immediate  and

powerful neighbour. We know that there are friendly

powers  both  in  this region  and  in  the  world,

interested  in the maintenance of world  peace  and

security, who are doing all they can to reduce  the

tension that now exists. We hope that their efforts

will   succeed   and  will  restore  the   friendly

relations between Malaya and Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, over the last year our Ministers and

leaders  of the trade union movement have,  through

their contacts with Afro-Asian nations, contributed

to   a   greater  understanding  among   Afro-Asian

political  leaders of Malaysia, and thereby  helped

counter  the  hostile anti-Malaysia  propaganda  in

these countries by the enemies of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wish to live in peace with all our neighbours

in  South-East Asia. But we realise our destiny  is

irrevocably  interwoven with that of  Malaysia.  So

whatever minor differences may arise from  time  to

time   between  Singapore  and  Kuala  Lumpur  over

chickens  and  eggs, or pigs and paints,  we  stand

solidly  with them on all the vital questions  that

affect  Malaysia, the integrity of our territories,

and  the  survival of our people. We have a  vested

interest  in Malaysia and its continued prosperity,

and we must always be prepared to defend it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><i>FINANCE</i></div>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the stresses and strains of the political

situation and its effect on the economy in the last

three  and a half years, the financial position  of

the  State has shown steady progress throughout the

period.  In 1959, when the present Government  took

over,  there  was  a  balance in  the  Consolidated

Revenue  Account of only $87.2 million.  There  was

not a single cent in the Development Fund!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end of the last year the Consolidated

Revenue Account has increased to $215.4 million and

the  Development Fund stood at $120.0 million. This

increase in the financial reserves of the State  is

all the more significant because it took place even

after  substantial capital outlays  made  from  the

Development  Fund  of more than $100  million  each

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Four-Year Plan introduced in 1961 is now in

full  swing.  Early teething troubles have  largely

been  solved.  All Ministries and  departments  are

bending   their   energies  to  carry   out   their

development   projects.  The  Economic  Development

Board   is   now  firmly  established,  effectively

playing its role in industrial development.  It  is

the  Government's principal agency in the promotion

of  industrial growth. It is also charged with  the

management of new industrial estates established in

the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four small-scale estates are in various stages of

completion  at Redhill, Tanglin Hill, Tanglin  Halt

and Jalan Ampat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tremendous effort has gone into the creation of

the  9,000  acre industrial complex at  Jurong.  By

early next year we shall see the completion of most

of  the  major industrial facilities  such  as  the

wharves,  power, water, telephone, roads and  other

facilities. The railway connection between the main

line and Jurong is in an advanced stage of planning

and construction work will begin by June 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of Malaysia on 31st August this

year  will  give an added impetus to our industrial

growth. There



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



should  be  an  intelligent overall policy  of  co-ordinated  development of all  the  territories  of

Malaysia.  We are confident that it is  within  the

wisdom and competence of the leaders of Malaysia to

bring this about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the immediate years ahead we must not fritter

away  our financial resources on lavish expenditure

over prestige projects which will not increase  the

sinews of our economy. We must increase the rate of

capital  formation  in  our State.  The  people  of

Singapore must he prepared to resist the temptation

to  strive for short-term benefits which  have  the

effect  of  weakening our economic  strength.  With

Malaysia, our opportunities will be greater. But so

too   will  be  our  responsibilities.  The  Borneo

territories  need  capital  for  development.   The

Central Government has promised to do its utmost to

provide  the necessary finance. Singapore  must  be

prepared  to  make its contribution  in  loans  and

other assistance to help the Central Government  in

helping development of the Borneo territories.



<div align="center"><i>HOUSING</i></div>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board has made rapid

progress  in building public housing for the  lower

income  groups. By the end of 1962, in  just  under

three  years, the Board completed 21,232  units  as

against  23,019  units built by the  S.I.T. in  32

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the units completed by the Board are

located  at  Queenstown, Bukit Ho Swee,  MacPherson

Road,  St. Michael's Road, Alexandra Hill.  Kallang

and  Tanjong Rhu. Some 12,000 units are  now  under

construction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dynamic effort mounted by the Housing and

Development  Board  has  broken  the  back  of  our

housing shortage. Now we must look ahead. Hitherto,

the  main  objective of the State's public  housing

programme  has been to provide clean healthy  homes

at low rentals to the tens of thousands of families

living in our over-crowded slums. In this way,  the

most  intolerable features of slum  congestion  and

squalor are alleviated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



But  our  slums still remain with us. The time  has

come  to  mount a direct assault on them.  We  must

demolish  the old insanitary and rickety  buildings

which  stand  in much of the central areas  of  our

city, and we must build on these sites modern multi-storeyed shops and homes. In other words, the  time

has  come for us to rebuild our city. To start  off

this  project  the  Government  plans  to  demolish

Outram  Prison and let the Housing and  Development

Board  build  on  its site several  thousand  units

which can house an approximate 50,000 persons  from

the  slum areas to make way for rebuilding the  old

parts of our city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cantonment Road housing scheme of 334 new

shops  and houses is only the beginning. The  whole

task  of  rebuilding our city is one of  monumental

proportions. It will need finance of  more  than  a

thousand  million  dollars  and  will  engage   our

energies  over several decades. But at the  end  of

it,  we  shall have built a new city of beauty  and

distinction, worthy of the industry and  enterprise

of  our people, and in keeping with our position as

the financial, industrial and commercial centre  of

South-East Asia.



<div align="center"><i>PUBLIC UTILITIES</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rapidly growing population and an accelerated

rate  of housing and industrial developments  makes

it necessary to increase water, electricity and gas

services.  Loans  from  the  World  Bank  on  terms

designed to help developing countries industrialise

and  finance the water and electricity projects are

now under negotiation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenders for the construction of the Scudai River

Water  Scheme  have been called for. By  next  year

some 15-30 million gallons of water from Scudai per

day will be added to our water supplies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An agreement with the Johore Government for the

Johore  River  Project has been  signed.  The  City

Council  has engaged a firm of Consulting Engineers

of  international repute to plan and supervise  the

work.  This project is expected to be completed  in

1967.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction of the new Pasir Panjang `B' Power

Station   with  an  ultimate  capacity  of  240,000

kilowatts  has  begun.  The first  60,000  kilowatt

machine  should be ready during the first  half  of

1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36 rural development schemes to supply electricity

to rural areas have started.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New low-cost construction methods have been

devised  to  speed  up  the  rural  electrification

projects.



<div align="center"><i>LANDS AND PLANNING</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 10-acre Geylang Serai Development Site,

acquired  in  May 1962, is rapidly developing  into

the  first  of our regional multi-purpose community

development  scheme with school,  community  centre

and  creche,  markets  and  shopping,  housing  and

recreation facilities for the entire area.  At  the

same  time, an important portion of Changi Road  at

the  Joo  Chiat Road junction will be  improved  by

road widening.



<br><br><i>Roads and Sewerage Works</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the West Coast/Jurong Link Road was

completed  giving access to the Industrial  Estate.

Work  has  started on the New West  Coast  Road,  a

continuation of Ayer Rajah Road leading to the  new

Jurong Industrial Estate. There was some delay over

work   on   War  Department  property   but   these

difficulties have been resolved and now it will  be

completed by the end of this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The part of the Outer Ring Road system from

Holland  Road to the Rumah Bomba Circus was  opened

in  1962. This year it will be extended from  Rumah

Bomba  Circus to Redhill Industrial Estate,  Farrer

and  Braddell Roads. Work is proceeding on the  new

$25  million sewerage works intended primarily  for

the Toa Payoh new town.



<div align="center"><i>CONSTRUCTION</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bridgeworks like the Jalan Besar Roundabout,

Mountbatten Circus and the Dhoby Ghaut Bridge  have

improved  traffic  circulation.  The  Dhoby   Ghaut

Bridge  reconstruction will alleviate  flooding  by

providing  an additional waterway. For  1963  three

new bridges



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



spanning   the   Bukit  Timah   Canal   are   being

constructed  to  enable the one-way traffic  scheme

for   Bukit  Timah  Road  and  Dunearn  Road   from

Woodlands to Newton Circus to be implemented.



<div align="center"><i>ROADS AND FLOOD PREVENTION</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development work in accordance with the State's

Development   Plan  is  proceeding  satisfactorily.

Various  drainage projects have been  completed  or

are  nearing  completion in Radin Mas, Paya  Lebar,

Ulu  Pandan,  Alexandra,  Queenstown,  Whampao  and

Geylang. The improvement in drainage will safeguard

against flooding in these areas.



<br><br><i>Swamp Reclamation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pilot project in swamp reclamation by the Public

Works   Department  at  Sungei   Poyan   is   being

successfully completed. The reclamation covers  175

acres  of  swamp of which about 75  acres  will  be

available as farmland, 50 acres for fish ponds  and

50 acres for prawn ponds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the success of this pilot scheme, the

Government is going ahead with plans to reclaim the

adjacent   areas  near  Sungei  Berih,  and   other

estuaries along the West Coast.



<br><br><i>Standpipes and water pressure</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year was a year of improvement to kampongs

and  the  rural  areas.  111 additional  standpipes

costing $180,000 were installed. Larger water mains

in  these  densely populated areas  were  laid  and

water pressure improved. 93 kampong roads were made

up  amounting  to  60 miles of new  and  additional

roads  for  the  State. Street  lights  and  public

telephones  were  installed. The  Prime  Minister's

visits to the rural constituencies have helped  get

closer  co-ordination between  Government  planners

and  the  rural people for whose welfare all  these

roads,  drains, electricity, water-pipes,  clinics,

community  centres  and  veterinary  services   are

intended.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Primary Production Department</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Production Department continues to

improve farming techniques and productive capacity.

In  addition to existing services provided  by  the

Department,  new  services  are  being  planned  to

assist  the  farmers to increase  their  productive

capacity and reduce the cost:



<br><br><i>Veterinary and Agriculture Services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intensive steps are being taken to control and

eradicate Pullorum disease among poultry. Chicks of

higher egg laying capacity are being produced  from

specially   selected  imported   poultry   at   the

Experimental Stations. Such chicks will be sold  to

Singapore farmers at cost. Good Berkshire boars for

sale  to  farmers at low prices are being increased

in  January  this year, an Artificial  Insemination

Service  for  pigs  was started. This  enables  the

extension  of  stud  boar  service  to  many   more

farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of successful experiments, the

department  can now provide a cheap  and  effective

fertilizer mixture as a substitute for prawn dust,

which is not only costly but also unhealthy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Primary Production Extension Service to spread

the facilities available was started. An officer is

stationed  in  each  of  the  rural  districts  and

farmers can approach him for assistance and  advice

at   any  time  including  evenings.  This  Primary

Production  Extension Service is also available  at

all  the  rural  community centres  to  assist  and

advise  farmers  and  to  provide  various  Primary

Production  services. Talks and film  shows,  which

arc being produced by the Department, will he shown

at these community centres in the evenings.



<br><br><i>Creches and Homes for the Aged</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More creches for children of working mothers are

being  planned. One new creche was  opened  in  the

Mountbatten  area in 1962. Another two new  creches

will  be  completed this year, one in the Bukit  Ho

Swee  area and the other in the Rochore area.  Each

creche  will  be  capable  of  looking  after   120

children.  Another new creche has been included  in

Road  10-storey flats. A site for a  home  for  old

people  has been selected at Woodlands.  The  first

phase  will be completed this year. When completed,

the home will house more than 500 old people.



<br><br><i>National Theatre</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Theatre to which the people of

Singapore  have contributed more than  $700,000  is

expected to be completed by the end of May or early

in  June 1963. A South-East Asian Cultural Festival

to  celebrate the opening of the Theatre will  take

place  in  August. The National Theatre  will  have

covered  seating for 3,500 persons. This  could  be

extended to 7,000 in due course. The space provided

for open-air audience can accommodate about 12,000.

When completed, this will be one of the finest  and

largest  theatres of its type in this part  of  the

world.



<br><br><i>National Art Gallery and Academy of Arts</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are plans for a $l¼ million National Art

Gallery and an Academy of Arts situated next to the

National Library.



<br><br><i>National Library</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The services of two Colombo Plan experts have been

obtained  to  advise  on the expansion  of  library

services,  particularly to serve the needs  of  the

people  literate  in the Malay, Chinese  and  Tamil

languages.  Their  recommendations  are  now  under

consideration.



<div align="center"><i>TELEVISION</i></div>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Television Singapura came into being on 15th

February  with the inauguration of a Pilot Service.

The official inauguration will be on 2nd April when

a  four-hour  service will be  provided.  A  second

channel  will begin later this year. The  technical

quality  of  T.V. reception has  been  of  a  high

standard, and public response has been quicker than

the   expectations   of   both   the   Broadcasting

Department and T.V. dealers.

<br><br><i>Trade Union House</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piling work for Singapore's Trade Union House-cum-international conference hall of $4.15 million,

began in August last year. The building is expected

to  be completed by November 1964. It will have  an

auditorium   for   international   conferences,   a

theatrette, flexible conference rooms, a  reception

hall  and  a  lounge, offices for trade  unions,  a

research  section and library, canteen  facilities,

etc.



<div align="center"><i>LABOUR</i></div>



<br><br><i>Industrial Arbitration Court</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1962 the Industrial Arbitration Courts not only

arbitrated   in   31   cases  and   certified   264

agreements, they also succeeded in getting  parties

to  a dispute to enter into negotiations instead of

pursuing arbitration. 12 cases reached agreement in

this way.



<br><br><i>Labour Research Unit</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently the Government accepted representations

from the National Trade Union Congress and set up a

Labour  Research  Unit in December  1962.  It  will

provide  assistance to trade unions in  formulating

claims,   in  negotiations  and  arbitration.   The

International  Labour  Organisation  will  send  an

expert to plan for the healthy growth of the Unit.



<div align="center"><i>HEALTH</i></div>



<br><br><i>Hospital Services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor strength in the service has been

increased.  In  1959 there were  247  doctors;  now

there are 319 doctors.



<br><br><i>Training</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School of Nursing has more than doubled its

teaching   facilities  for  nurses  and   assistant

nurses. A School of Radiography for the training of

Radiographers will be set up this year, as part  of

the X-Ray Department of the General Hospital.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Surgical Block for Thomson Road Hospital</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction of a surgical block at Thomson Road

Hospital  began  last year. The buildings  will  be

completed by the end of this year and will  have  4

surgical   theatre  suites,  an  X-Ray  Department,

Casualty  Department  and follow-up  clinics.  With

these facilities the Thomson Road Hospital will  be

completed as a fully functioning general hospital.



<br><br><i>Surgical Block for Tan Tock Seng Hospital</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Tan Tock Seng Hospital another surgical

block is to be established. Plans to provide for  4

surgical  suites  have been approved  and  building

operations  will begin in the latter  half  of  the

year.



<br><br><i>Hospital Ward Units at Woodbridge Hospital</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hospital wards have been opened at the Woodbridge

Hospital  for  the care of the chronic  sick.  This

will,   when   additional  simple  and  inexpensive

buildings   are   built  on   the   site,   provide

accommodation for 400 chronic sick patients.



<br><br><i>Out-patient Services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two clinics were completed at the end of last

year - one at Somapah Road and another at Queenstown.

Two  more  have  recently been  completed - a  large

combined  clinic  at  Still Road,  and  a  standard

clinic  at Sembawang. Another clinic to he operated

in  a community centre at Prinsep Street is nearing

completion.



<br><br><i>Dental Services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphases in the Dental Services will he on the

development  of  the School Dental Service.  During

1962  a total of 9 new Dental Clinics was put  into

operation. Twelve new School Dental Clinics will be

established  in  1963. A large two-storeyed  School

Dental  Clinic,  equipped  with  14  Dental  Chairs

capable  of  serving a large number of schools,  is

being built at Balestier Road.

<div align="center"><i>COMMUNICATIONS</i></div>



<br><br><i>Civil Aviation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore International Airport continues to

retain  its  place as one of the best International

Airports  in this region. A new Passenger  Terminal

Building   and  a  new  Parking  Apron  are   under

construction and will be ready for service in early

1964.



<br><br><i>Marine</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the third year in succession Singapore

continues  to  maintain its position as  the  fifth

largest port in the world, the second largest  port

in  the  Commonwealth, and the busiest port in  the

Far East.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this Session the Port Authority will be

formally created.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four new deep-water berths were completed and came

into operation in 1962. Plans for another four  new

deep-water berths at the East Lagoon are now  being

prepared  by  the Singapore Harbour Board  and  the

Economic Development Board, and preliminary work on

reclamation  has already started. This  project  is

estimated to cost $40 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Jurong a bulk-handling harbour is planned with

a  total length of wharves of 9,000 feet for ocean-going vessels and 3,000 feet for coastal vessels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A contract for $14.3 million has been let for the

first   phase   of   this   harbour   construction,

consisting of 3,000 feet of ocean-going  berth  and

2,000 feet of coastal berth. The first berths  will

be  completed  by  the end of  this  year  and  the

balance by the end of 1964.



<br><br><i>Postal Services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Postal traffic has continued to grow. Two post

offices  have  been  completed  during  the   first

quarter  of this year. Six others will be built  in

the course of 1963.



<br><br><i>Telecommunications</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the establishment of Malaysia by August

31st this year, when telecommunications will he the

responsibility  of the Federal Government,  it  has

been agreed by the Governments of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



the  Federation of Malaya and Singapore  and  Cable

and Wireless Ltd, not to proceed with the formation

of the Singapore Overseas Telecommunications Board.

Cable  and Wireless Ltd, has therefore been granted

an  extension of their licences for two years. This

will  enable  the  future  Central  Government   of

Malaysia  to review the whole question of overseas

telecommunications.



<br><br><i>Singapore Telephone Board</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,000 new telephone lines were installed and 50

new Public Call Offices, mostly in the rural areas,

were opened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Telephone Board plans to install 300

new Public Call Offices during 1963.



<br><br><i>Vehicles</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of vehicles registered in Singapore

continued to increase at a steady rate. At the  end

of  1962 the number of motor vehicles had increased

by 15,666 to 133,645.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A six-storey car park is now being built at the

junction  of Cecil Street and Market Street  at  an

estimated  cost  of  $2.45  million.  It  will   be

completed  at  the  beginning  of  1964  and   will

accommodate about 700 vehicles.



<div align="center"><i>EDUCATION</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the present Government assumed office in mid-1959, the enrolment in our primary and secondary

schools  was  just 300,000. This year,  our  school

enrolment  passed the 416,000 mark. In three  years

the   number  of  children  attending  schools  has

increased  by  over 100,000 or one-third  over  and

above that for 1959. Every child whose parents want

a  place  in a primary school can now be  accepted.

Another  noteworthy feature was the rapid  increase

in  our  secondary school enrolment from 44,000  in

1959  to  more than 82,000 this year, that  is,  an

increase of 86 per cent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has had to step up its school

building programme. 15 new schools including the 10-storey Selegie Integrated School were completed  in

time  last year for the beginning of the  1963  new

school  year  in  January.  Expenditure  on  school

buildings  alone is expected to reach  $10  million

this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously, children who were over-age for their

classes had to pay fees. As from January 1963,  all

those born in Singapore or born of parents who  are

Singapore  citizens are eligible for  free  primary

education, irrespective of whether they  are  over-age  for  their classes. We have now  free  primary

education for all our children of school going age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teaching of second languages in all schools

will  be stepped up still further. Classes for  any

second language will be provided where there  is  a

minimum  of 15 pupils to form a class in  place  of

the former minimum of 25 pupils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Teachers' Training College will start a new

course  this  year  for holders  of  Higher  School

Certificate   qualifications.  Special   up-grading

courses  for  Malay teachers will also  be  started

this  year  with the aim of raising their  previous

training  up  to  the level of the  Certificate  of

Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special course in the National Language for

qualified  teachers will continue to be held.  Over

5,000 persons, the majority of them teachers,  have

passed  the Government Examinations in the National

Language Standards I, II and III.



<br><br><i>Adult Education Board</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lembaga Gerakan Pelajaran Dewasa, which took

over  the  functions  of the Singapore  Council  of

Adult  Education in 1960, concerned itself at first

only  with language and literacy classes and a  few

further  education  courses. But  since  1961,  the

Lembaga has not only raised the efficiency of these

classes  but  has also extended its  activities  to

provide  secondary  evening education  up  to)  pre

University level for some 5,000 students annually.

<div align="center"><i>CONCLUSION</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only five months to go before the

31st of August. They will be months of hard work

for  those  Ministers and officials  responsible

for re-drafting the constitution of Singapore as

a  State  within the framework of the Federation

of Malaysia. There is also the intricate problem

of  working out Singapore's contribution to  the

Federal  Government  for  Federal  Services   in

Singapore, as agreed in the White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first six to twelve months

following   the   31st  of   August,   the   new

constitutional  arrangements  will  have  to  he

smoothly    implemented.   Defence,    Singapore

Infantry  Regiment and the other  Armed  Forces,

Police  and  Prisons, all come under the  direct

control   of   the  Federal  Government.   Other

departments  such as Customs and Excise,  Income

Tax,  Broadcasting and Television, will all have

to   follow   overall  Federal   policy   whilst

remaining     under    State    control.     The

implementation of these arrangements after  31st

August  will  require a great deal of  tact  and

patience.    We   are   confident   that    with

understanding   and   brotherly   give-and-take,

temporary dislocations can be kept to a minimum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our firm determination to ensure that

those  departments which go over to the  Federal

Government   should  maintain  the  highest   of

standards between now and the 31st August.  Even

more   important,  we  must  ensure  that   they

continue to keep those standards ever high after

the 31st of August.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime construction must press ahead.

1963,  the year Malaysia comes into being,  will

he  marked  in Singapore by massive construction

in  public housing, schools, community  centres,

creches,  hospitals,  clinics,  roads,  bridges,

drains,  electricity, water, and most  important

of all, in the number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



new factories that will give jobs to our people,

and  build  a  modern  industrial  city  out  of

Singapore.  This  is a task  to  which  we  must

dedicate ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a task which can and will succeed if the

highest standards of integrity of public service

are  maintained, not only amongst the  political

leaders  and the Government officials, but  also

amongst the leaders of trade unions and of trade

and commerce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can take pride at the steady progress we

are   making  as  one  plan  after  another   is

completed  week by week, day by day. The  people

have  quite  rightly a distaste for  unnecessary

political party strife, and there has been  less

of it. Moreover, no more great issues divide the

people.   We   must  proceed  apace   with   our

construction. Above all, we must be united,  for

if  we  allow  the  enemy from outside,  working

through anti-national elements in our midst,  to

divide  us,  then  we shall  lack  the  strength

necessary  to  resist their pressures.  We  must

always  also  resist  the pressure  of  internal

enemies  and  prevent them  from  upsetting  our

stability and prosperity, for it is the material

progress  of  ordinary people that is  the  best

guarantee of the constant failure of their  arid

dogma  of violence and the continued success  of

our tolerant and prosperous society.
