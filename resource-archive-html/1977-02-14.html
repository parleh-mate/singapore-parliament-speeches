<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I desire, on behalf of the House, to express our

sense  of  the  loss we have sustained and  our  deep

sympathy with the family of the hon. Member.

<div align="center"><b>OBITUARY ON THE LATE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>HON. MEMBER MR N. GOVINDASAMY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the death of Mr N. Govindasamy is a sad

start to our proceedings in this Session. The late Mr

Govindasamy had not been well for more than a year

and Members are aware of that fact. He could have

retired last December but he chose to continue to

serve his constituents, the Party and the trade

unions. He was re-elected with a thumping majority

last December. He was sworn in only last Monday and

looked forward so much to taking part in our

forthcoming debate. What a pity it is that he died

this morning in the prime of his life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Govindasamy was for long a staunch supporter of

the  workers and he was their fiery champion in  this

House. They will miss him and so will we. But knowing

Mr  Govindasamy.  I think he would  not  want  us  to

adjourn for his sake. The funeral will be held  later

this afternoon, and those Members who are not due  to

speak today can attend the funeral.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I place on record, Sir, the deep sympathy of

Members  of  this  House for his loss.  We  send  our

condolences to his bereaved widow and four children.



<br><br>2.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As a mark of respect to the late hon.

Member, I propose that the House observe a two-minute

silence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House rose and paid respect.

<div align="center"><b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b></div>



<br><br>2.35 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, notwithstanding the Standing Orders, this

House  do  adjourn at 6.00 p.m. today."  -  [Mr  E. W. Barker]





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4>PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>DEBATE ON PRESIDENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(First Day)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Chiang Hai Ding -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chiang Hai Ding (Ulu Pandan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the following Address in reply to the Speech of

the President be agreed to:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore.

express our thanks to the President for the Speech

which he delivered on behalf of the Government at the

opening of the First Session of this Parliament.".'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President, in his succinct Address, presented a

frank  review  of  the  main security, economic  and

social  problems that our country will  face  in  the

next  few years. He called upon Members of the House,

especially those not holding office, to subject every

major policy to the closest scrutiny. In this current

debate we will miss the late Member for Radin Mas. He

was a good friend and his was a cheerful presence  in

this  House.  Our thoughts must go to his  widow  and

children.  Our  thoughts also today must  go  to  the

Member for Bukit Merah who lies stricken in hospital.

Those  of us who are present in the House today  will

surely  heed  the call of the President  and  do  our

duty. There is much to debate and there will be  more

to do afterwards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Address, the President warned Singaporeans

against soft options. There have been none. There can

be none. Our people have paid their way, all the way.

The  General  Elections  of 1  976  demonstrate  that

Singaporeans are sophisticated; they reject  attempts

by  opposition parties to beguile them with  promises

of "something for nothing" and "everything for less".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More Singaporeans today pay income tax than 10

years  ago.  In  1965 only 4% of the population  paid

income  tax;  today 8% do so. And the Singaporean  is

paying more as well. In 1965 he paid, in the form  of

income  tax, property tax, estate duty, customs  and

excise,  about  l0% of his per capita income.  Today,

the Singaporean pays something closer to 20%. Only in

this  way  has  it been possible for Singaporeans  to

enjoy  the quality of life that they do. It is  never

true  that the best things in life are free. We  have

to  work for them. Teachers do not teach our children

for  free. Doctors do not minister to their  patients

for  free. The Housing and Development Board does not

give   away  apartments.  But  the  productivity   of

Singaporean  and  their  contribution  to  the  state

coffers, make it possible for the state to subsidize,

not  give for free, education, medical treatment  and

housing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asian societies lay great store by proper

education. Singapore is no exception. At the risk  of

repeating  the obvious, we must guard against  "over-education".

In another island-economy. Taiwan,  there

are  university graduates who do translations to earn

$2.50  a  day while carpenters earn $25 a  day.  Lest

Members  conclude  that this is an Asian  phenomenon,

the  "job crisis" plagues advanced economies as well.

In   France, universities  are  described   as   the

"unemployment machine", because half the graduates in

recent  years cannot find jobs. From America  in  the

northern  hemisphere to Australia in the  south,  the

story  is  the  same.  We cannot  waste  our  limited

resources to educate people who do not meet the needs

of  our  economy. We cannot afford any waste. Of  all

the  countries in the world. Singapore  is  the  most

dependent on imported food.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to strike the right balance between

higher  standards  of education so  much  desired  by

parents, and the proper type of education to  provide

their children with a bright future. The Ministry  of

Education   is  to  be  congratulated  on   correctly

emphasising technical education which includes  trade

and  artisan  programmes conducted by the  Industrial

Training Board. I believe,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



however,   that  we  must  constantly  ask  ourselves

whether  we  are  doing  enough  to  train  Singapore

professionals, in the banks, the insurance companies,

in  the fields of personnel management and the  like.

all  of which are vital to the growth of our economy.

The   work  of  artisans  must  be  complemented  and

supported  by that of professionals. The strength  of

our economy is vital to our national resilience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the President noted, the Americans have departed

from  Vietnam and Thailand. There are new governments

in  Vietnam,  Laos  and Cambodia.  There  is  only  a

residual and miniscule Western presence in Asia. When

the Western powers depart, the political institutions

they  leave behind invariably go by the board.  Very,

very  few of the countries of Asia and Africa,  which

became independent after World War II, have continued

to work the democratic system they inherited; such  a

system consists of more than one political party  and

assumes  the  holding of periodic elections  for  the

people to choose their representatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, for the third time, the people have

returned the PAP to all the seats in this House. Such

a situation is possible in the British Parliament. It

has  not  happened,  but that is  another  story.  It

almost happened in the then Federation of Malaya. The

Tunku's  party, campaigning on a platform of Merdeka,

won 51 of the 52 contested seats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members well know, there are variations within

the  democratic system as described above.  Countries

in  the  Commonwealth which adopted  the  Westminster

model   will   find  it  difficult  to  describe   as

democratic a government in which the chief executive,

the President, is not elected, nor the Vice-President

nor  the  Cabinet  Ministers. This was  the  case  in

America after Watergate. Yet American writers  insist

that   democracy   in  America  exists   and   indeed

flourishes. In that country, for the first  30  years

after  1776, there was a loosely-structured one-party

system  of  government.  During  George  Washington's

first   presidency,  all  important  differences   of

opinion  were expressed within the government  party,

and the government party



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



was  a  party of stability, dedicated to  the  belief

that  the  first imperative of government  in  a  new

nation  was to govern and sustain itself. Two  pieces

of  legislation  passed  in 1798  are  of  particular

interest to new nations. The Aliens and Sedition Acts

gave  the  President the power to order  out  of  the

country  any alien whom he thought dangerous  to  the

public  peace  or whom he had reasonable  grounds  to

suspect  of  plotting  against his  government.  Such

aliens  did not have recourse to courts of  law.  The

Sedition  Act was intended to cope with citizens,  or

aliens,  who  too severely criticised the government.

It  was  a  serious offence "to publish  a  false  or

malicious  writing  against  the  Government  of  the

United  States, the President or Congress  with  the

purpose  of stirring up hatred or resistance  against

them."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps we have more to learn from

the   Americans   than  merely  their   science   and

technology,  their  management skills  and  marketing

know-how.  But  let  us look ahead.  A  book  on  the

"Limits  to  Growth" listed five basic  factors  that

determine growth on this planet: population increase.

agricultural   production,   nonrenewable    resource

depletion, industrial   output    and    pollution

generation.  On  a global scale, it  is  argued  that

unless  mankind voluntarily imposes limits to growth.

disaster  will follow. Opposite viewpoints exist,  of

course. They argue that conditions in the world  will

become better and brighter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is Singapore headed for? We do not even

possess two of the factors listed which affect growth

-  agricultural production and non-renewable resource

depletion.   None  of  us  would  want  to   generate

pollution unnecessarily. Must we inevitably reach our

limits   to   growth?  Or  can  we  go   on   growing

indefinitely?  As  a  still  emerging  LDC  (or  less

developed country), we have no option but to  try  to

grow.  Except  population-wise. We have  very  finite

resources. Ingenuity and technology can overcome some

of  the  limiting factors. As we run out of  land  to

build  houses, we build high-rise apartments; and  we

reclaim land from the sea. As we run out of roads, we

cut



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



back  on cars and we consider travelling underground.

As  the growth of our entrepot trade slowed down,  we

industrialised;  and we developed banking,  insurance

and  ancillary services to provide a living  for  our

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have overcome the limitations of our Island by

linking  our national economy with international  and

regional  economies.  The leadership,  political  and

bureaucratic, have undoubtably given some thought  to

the long-range problems that confront our mini-state.

The  Ministry  of  Defence, for  example, for  which

strategic  planning is of the utmost  importance, is

considering  National  Service  for  women,  as   the

population  growth  slows down  because  Singaporeans

accept  that "Two is Enough". We have done very  well

so  far in the face of formidable odds. In the short-run,

there will be difficulties, but these  are  not

insurmountable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what of the long-term? Let all of us in this

House,  and others outside who are in the  public  as

well as in the private sectors, give more serious and

sustained consideration to our long-term development.

The  discussion of matters of our economic well-being

leads  us  to  what I believe to be the  nub  of  the

President's Address, which also received attention in

the  several  Addenda  of  the  Prime  Minister,  the

Minister for Education and the Minister for Culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are told what we must not do as a

people. We must "not abandon the cardinal precepts of

our long-proven culture systems". We must not seek to

model   our   lives  on  "Western  mores  and   their

contemporary  life-styles".  Our  children  will   be

taught not to adopt the "life-style and values of the

West  that  are  alien  and pernicious  to  Singapore

society."  We  are  advised to "unequivocably  uphold

Asian  precepts" and to provide our  young  with  the

"necessary  cultural ballast against the  erosion  of

traditional norms and values".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what are these important, desirable things? The

Prime  Minister tells us what we ought not to be;  we

cannot  be  "a  simple copying of either  China, the

Malaysian archipelago, or India, from whence most of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



our ancestors came. Nor can we be a copy of Britain."

The  Minister  for  Culture  enjoins  us  to  develop

Singapore's "rich cultural heritage derived from  the

Malay,  Chinese,  Indian  and western  civilisations,

and,  through their cross-fertilization, to evolve  a

national   identity."  The  Minister  for   Education

believes  that he has an action plan - "to  inculcate

social discipline and national identity and to  imbue

in pupils moral and civic values" through the subject

called Education For Living. I am happy that we  have

begun to discuss this crucial subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have far to go before Singaporeans possess

characteristics   that   can   identify    them    as

Singaporeans, that  set us apart  from  others.  For

Singapore   to  thrive,  we  have  to   engender   in

Singaporeans  an intense and passionate devotion  and

love  for  country.  This cannot be  legislated  into

existence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a student, I recall seeing a film based on the

life  of  Chopin, composer, and pianist. He quit  his

homeland. He won fame. He enjoyed himself. He was the

"constant companion" of the leading woman's libber of

the age. One day, a Polish thought struck him. He was

reminded   that   his  country  lay   under   foreign

domination  and that his compatriots were  suffering.

To  bring  home to Chopin the fact that he seemed  to

have  forgotten his country, his visitor poured  into

his  hands a little bag of earth brought from Poland.

And  Chopin wept as he saw and felt his native  soil.

He  gave  concerts to raise money for  his  country's

struggle  for  freedom. And in so  doing  ruined  his

health and died. It is a romantic story but it is the

patriotism that matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was therefore saddened to hear over RTS the other

night  that  three  of our National Service  officers

(two  of  them  medical doctors and one a  university

student)  called up for National Service had  shirked

their  responsibility. These men have no  patriotism.

They took all that Singapore can give them. Then they

packed up and quit. They had put self above all else.

These   few  are  exceptions  but  they  were   well-instructed

Singaporeans.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we go about inculcating patriotism? We start

without  some of the advantages enjoyed by other  and

older  nations, such as a historical state with  some

claims  to greatness, the existence of some inspiring

monuments,  memories  of  a  long, heroic   struggle

against  foreign invaders and colonizers.  I  do  not

have the answers. But the answer does not lie in  the

misbegotten subject Education For Living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that our children, in addition to knowing

their  mother tongue, must also learn the history  of

the  countries whence their ancestors came, why  they

came,  what they had to endure, what factors  enabled

them  to survive, to develop and to prosper, and  how

they  have come to found a nation - Singapore. Indeed,

as   a  matter  of  deliberate  policy,  we  have  to

encourage  our children to identify with  places  and

events, and especially people in Singapore. Who  was

Cheang Hong Lim who had a square named after him  and

who  until  recently was represented in  this  House?

What  of  Hoo Ah Kay, popularly known as  Whampoa, a

name  given to an electoral division, which was  once

eliminated, then resuscitated? Many Members represent

constituencies  named after people whose  lives  have

meaning, interest and instruction for our young, such

as  Aljunied, Braddell, Kuo Chuan and Mountbatten.  I

must  not  forget MacPherson constituency represented

by the Minister for Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we have a shared and active knowledge of our

past  as  a means to appreciate the contributions  of

the  people who settled here, then we can dream of  a

common  future. When will Singaporeans begin to  have

such  a  dream? A dream such as an American  freedom-fighter

had. Martin Luther King in his  most  famous

speech, made just before he was assassinated, said,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in

the  American  dream   I have a dream  that  my  four

little  children will one day live in a nation  where

they  will not be judged by the colour of their skin,

but by the content of their character.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the last one dozen years we

have begun to build a new Singapore, independent  and

sovereign. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



physical   landscape   has  changed   almost   beyond

recognition in many parts of our island. However, our

children  need  to  possess a  common  hope  for  the

future, a  vision  common to them all,  a  Singapore

dream, which   will  inspire   them,   create   new

sensitivities  and  release their energies  to  build

upon  what  we have already achieved. Then  when  our

children  raise their glasses to a toast Wo  Kuo  Wan

Suay  they  will be pledging, "My country, will  live

10,000 years".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

in  support  of  the  Motion of the  Member  for  Ulu

Pandan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of the Elections of 1976 showed that

the  Government  received  strong  support  from  the

working  classes including those who were  relatively

less  well-off, for example, those who lived in  one-room

flats in HDB premises. The Ministry  of  Labour

report  of  the labour force survey. 1976,  indicated

that  27% of employed persons received under  $200  a

month, while 42% received between $200-$399, and this

amounts  to nearly 70% of the population of  employed

persons. And it could not have been but that the bulk

of  these  people and their family connections  voted

for us. It should therefore be the Government's right

aim to continue to devote as much of its resources as

possible towards improving the lot of these people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last elections, some opposition

candidates moved hither and thither chattering  about

building  a  caring society as though this Government

did  not  care  for  the people. Included  among  the

goodies  many  opposition candidates were  trying  to

sell  was  the offer of subsidised living. Correctly,

as  the  Member for Ulu Pandan has pointed  out,  the

voters  refused  to  buy  this.  It  is  not  through

sentimental concepts that the quality of life of  our

people  is best improved but that our compassion  for

our  people  should be the basis of  sound,  careful,

determined planning



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



and  execution of policy to bring about  improvements

for our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the years since 1959 through a careful

husbanding of our resources, spending has  been  made

possible  on improved provisions towards  building  a

better  society  all  round.  Whatever  the  area  of

Government  effort  a Member of Parliament  may  find

himself  particularly interested in,  he  can  assure

himself  of  significant successes achieved  in  that

particular area of Government activity. For  example.

I  have  been  particularly interested in educational

development and I have tried to make myself a  little

knowledgeable regarding Government's efforts in  this

area.  There  is  no  doubt  that  by  any  criteria.

including those applied by foreign education experts.

the  Government's achievements in education have been

impressive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burden of the Education Ministry, in the

addendum, is  the  qualitative  improvement  of  our

education  provision, which can only be a consequence

of  the Government's past practical achievements, one

of which most people think has been in overcoming the

problem  of numbers by giving a place to every  child

in  primary  school.  Certainly  this  has  been  one

attainment  but,  in my mind, one of the  outstanding

achievements  has  been in the breakthrough,  number-wise

as  well as in terms of the diversification  of

provisions,  in the area of secondary  schooling.  In

1959,  the  percentage of persons of the correct  age

enrolled  in primary schools was 88%. In  1975, this

percentage  rose to over 98%. In 1959, the percentage

of  persons  of  correct  age enrolled  in  secondary

schools  was  19% while in 1975 the  number  rose  to

about  50%. More significantly Secondary I enrolments

increased from 11.5% in 1959 to nearly 55%  in  1975.

namely  the enrolment in Secondary I rose from  about

4.000  to  over 30,000. While Primary I enrolment  of

those  persons aged 6 increased by nearly 27% between

1959  and  1975, the enrolment  in  Secondary  I  of

persons  aged 12 increased by more than 7 1/2 times.  As

secondary education was closely related to better job

opportunities, does this not show how practically and

realistically the Government cared?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959, the then Finance Minister who is now

Deputy  Prime  Minister showed with  what  dismay  he

viewed  the  problem of providing education  for  the

increasing  number  of  children  having  to   attend

school.  The  Minister said [Hansard, Vol.  11,  col. 785, 25.11.59]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The large number of babies born every year may be a

welcome  testimony to the virility of the  population

but   it   Sets  in  Store  problems  of  nightmarish

proportions for the Finance Minister.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this not display anxiety? Does this not show

that  the  Government cared in such a  way  that  the

Government showed itself financewise firmly committed

to  educational development? From 1960 to the present

year, allocations for education have shown continuous

growth. In 1964, despite a fall in the GNP and also a

fall  in  Government recurrent expenditure generally.

educational recurrent expenditure went up  9.2%  over

the previous year's expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other MPs who are interested in other fields may

well record the same sense of responsible concern  in

other areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But apart from concern being expressed in policy

action  there are indications, throughout the various

addenda of more specifically humane considerations  -

for  example: the concern for industrial  safety  and

health expressed in the very concrete steps that  are

being  planned,  including the  establishment  of  an

occupational   safety  and  health   institute;   the

thinking  manifested in the intention of the Ministry

of  Health to lay greater emphasis on primary  health

care, preventive medicine and health education;  the

sympathy  for  the old expressed in the establishment

of   the   home  nursing  foundation.  Such  measures

illustrate  a  practical concern for  people, not  a

sentimental indulgence in vague expressions of care.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Sir, going through the various addenda to

the  President's Address, one is struck by  the  very

tangible, material, concrete, rational,  hard-headed

proposals  outlined. Although the addenda  relate  to

general policy declarations, we can read



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



about   percentage  growth, extension  of   national

service   to  women,  National  Wages  Council,   the

expansion of the domestic telephone network,  and  so

on,  including even the trite (but still  particular)

intention  of  the Ministry of Science  to  launch  a

follow-up to the Science and Industry Quiz.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when we stray to some areas covered by the

addenda  on the Education and Culture Ministries,  we

find  that  we have wandered into a rather misty,  if

not  actually foggy environment, where the  landscape

has  become diffused, and the configuration a  little

blurred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Culture is concerned with evolving

a   national  cultural  identity  and  will  organise

activities  to promote a better appreciation  of  our

cultural  heritage,  and in the process  protect  our

young  against the erosion of traditional  norms  and

values. Later on, Sir, when we come to the debate  in

the Committee of Supply, I hope we will hear from the

Minister  concerned, the specifics of such action  as

his  Ministry  intends to take. I  remember,  Sir,  a

bitter  complaint from an official  of  the  People's

Association about what a budget official once  asked.

It seems that at a meeting with budget officials, the

People's  Association representative stated that  his

agency  was involved in efforts to build a  sense  of

national identity, and inculcate the right values  in

our  people. The Treasury official was very impressed

and  asked the PA official how many good Singaporeans

the  PA  had  produced. Perhaps the  question  was  a

heartless one, but it indicates the difficulty  of  a

hard assessment of this thing called "values".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this difficulty, Sir, we find the addendum

on  the  Ministry of Education declaring  that  great

pains will be taken to ensure that pupils imbibe  the

tried, not simply tried and tested Asian cultural and

moral  values but the tried and tested Asian cultural

and moral values. I shall ask the Ministry to tell me

since  they  appear  to have already  identified  the

tried and tested virtues, what these virtues are  and

how they propose to teach these values.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the pillars of development

in  our  society has been the success in  our  family

planning policy. With an appropriate reduction in the

growth of our population we are now able to plan  for

measures  more  effectively, measures that  it  would

have  been difficult to envisage as possible even  10

years ago, because money that we will now be able  to

spend on these measures would otherwise have gone  on

the  spending of less and less money on more and more

people.  Yet in some ways family planning would  have

gone  against the traditional grain. Family  planning

is  a  modern  idea in the sense it  is  administered

today. Traditional agrarian cultures (whether east or

west) would extol the virtues of a large family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show that values may be difficult to determine.

and undergo change, let us just observe what they are

doing  to Confucius in China today. They are  calling

him  sage  of  the  reactionary classes.  Yesterday's

Confucian  stipulation  of  three  cardinal   guides,

namely, that subject must be guided by sovereign, son

must be guided by father, and wife must be guided  by

husband, has  been described in Mao-thought  as  the

authorities   -   political,   clan   and   masculine

authorities  - that are the embodiment of  the  whole

feudal  system  and  ideology  and  the  thick  ropes

binding   the   Chinese  people,   particularly   the

peasants.  It is interesting to note how the  Chinese

today reject male chauvinism - a point that this all-male

house might find worthy to note. In China again,

today,   the  ideologues  have  attributed  a  highly

sinister political motivation to the Confucian aim of

Yu chiao wu /ui which was traditionally taken to mean

giving education irrespective of class barriers. This

has  been described by Chinese communists as  humbug,

as  they think that Confucian modes were designed  to

make  the masses pliable instruments in the hands  of

the rulers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when you think of literature as containing

lessons,  in a spate of criticism of Water Margin  in

1975,  Chairman Mao was noted as having  pointed  out

that the merit of the book Water Margin lay precisely

in the portrayal of capitulation - meaning, of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



course,  capitulation to the feudal  principles;  and

Mao  pointed  out  that  Water  Margin  served  as  a

teaching material by negative example to help all the

people  recognise capitulationism.  Even  Ge  un  suo

neng, an  lao fen p'ei will change if the  communist

millennium is attained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk of values, therefore, let us talk of

values - for what purposes, just like the Chinese  in

China  today  discuss their values in  terms  of  the

political   aims  and  in  terms  of  the   practical

condition of their society today. What is the kind of

society  we want to develop? Let us start  with  this

idea that we want a society that is reasonably secure

and  properly educated with reasonable prospects  for

economic  advancement. We therefore  stress  economic

development, dissemination of modern techniques  and

rational attitudes with full exploitation of the mass

media  to  disseminate those attitudes and to  change

traditional  outlooks  that  stand  in  the  path  of

development  and  in  the path of  modernisation.  We

realise  the  importance  of  industrialisation   and

urbanisation,  the  establishment  of  a   management

elite,  bureaucratisation  that  is  necessary,   the

espousal  of  analytic intelligent  modes  of  social

appraisal, the  inculcation of  a  sense  of  common

destiny  and belonging and the inculcation of  humane

and  loyal regard as between one citizen and another.

I do not think that this is an unreasonable statement

of social aim for Singapore. But whether people agree

with  me  totally, or disagree with what I have  said

partially or even totally, there must be a social aim

underlying  the kind of values we want  to  give  our

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be illustrated by the experience of Japan.

When  the  Japanese experienced the  emergence  of  a

modern constitutional government and the build-up  of

their  administrative  system  of  a  modern  unified

state, the education system underwent changes.  There

emerged  a two-tier structure of education  in  which

elementary  education confined to basic literacy  and

numeracy   attached  importance  to   ethics,   moral

education  to  foster  Japanese  citizens  who  would

acquire the ethics of the family system



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



and   pledge  allegiance  to  the  family   and   the

community.  At  the  apex,  the  educational   system

positively  adopted  the modern civilisation  of  the

West,  emphasised  science,  developed  an  elite  to

engage  in  the  operation of modern  technology  and

managerial organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me emphasise. Sir, that in their basic

education, the Japanese emphasised the importance  of

fostering  Japanese values. In our  case  instead  of

stressing Singapore references, as the Member for Ulu

Pandan  has  recommended, we are  thinking  of  Asian

values.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I have very serious doubts as to whether such a

thing  as "Asian values" really exist... It may exist

as  an  image but it has no reality. If  it  has  any

meaning  at  all  it  is merely a convenient  way  of

describing the heterogeneous, conflicting and complex

network  of beliefs, prejudices and values  developed

in the countries which for geographical purposes have

been grouped as being in Asia'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are not my words, although I agree fully

with them. These words constitute a quotation from  a

recent  publication. Asian Values and  Modernisation.

page  95, and belong to our own Foreign Minister  who

goes on later to emphasise that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`there is much in traditional values (whether Asian,

Western  or  African) which are far more  modern  and

more  likely  to  give impetus to modernisation  than

some contemporary values.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I am making is that we have to ponder and

select, and the basis is what I have already referred

to  -  relevance to Singapore's development  and  her

people's harmonious living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a further point has to be made. It is not

only  the  children in our schools  who  need  to  be

educated   to   values   that  will   contribute   to

Singapore's development and the harmonious living  of

our  people. The adult citizens of our Republic  have

to  be  continually exposed to the play of influences

that  will  result  in  further  improvement  to  our

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sooner we get rid of the idea that education is

principally the responsibility of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



the Education Ministry, or that education takes place

in a certain location, for example, schools, within a

certain period in a day, viz, according to the  class

time-table, on certain days, that is those  that  are

not  school holidays - the sooner we get rid of  this

idea  that  education is confined to a certain  place

and time, the better. It is our people as a whole who

need  continuing education, not only those of  school

age.  In  Singapore those who are receiving education

or  who  have recently received education are exposed

to  a whole weight of influence of those who have not

been fortunate recipients of much schooling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study of the Labour Ministry's report on the

labour  force survey, 1976, would show  that  of  the

total  number of persons over 10 years  of  age,  23%

have received secondary education and beyond. At  the

same time. 23% have never attended school. The higher

the age group the higher the percentage of those with

little  schooling or none at all. I have learnt  from

the   Social  Welfare  Department  that   they   have

estimated that for 1974, among the population over 50

years.

94%  had less than secondary education while 83%  had

no qualifications attained whatsoever.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, out of a total of over 910,000 economically

active  persons, of those under 30, 48% have received

schooling  up  to secondary school and beyond,  while

only  3 1/2%  have never attended school.  This  is  our

achievement. However, of those above 40,  1 5%  have

received schooling up to secondary level and  beyond,

while 45% have never attended school. In addition, of

those above 40 in the economically active population,

40%  have less than secondary education. This  is  in

addition  to the 45% who have never attended  school.

If  we  assume  that  one of our treasured  Confucian

values still prevails - that of the influence of  the

elders  over  younger persons - then we  must  reckon

with  the  problem of the influence of the relatively

unschooled  over  the relatively better  schooled.  I

must  make  it  clear  that those  with  less  formal

schooling can and do certainly convey good values  to

our  younger  citizens. But the  pace  of  change  in

Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



makes  it necessary for those in the older age groups

to  be continually exposed to such influences as will

contribute  to the harmonious growth of our  society.

And  in  my mind, the Education Ministry may well  be

the   least  qualified  to  perform  this  task.  The

Education Ministry does not even seem to be  able  to

highlight  effectively  the work  of  its  own  Adult

Education Board, judging by the "press" the  AEB  was

given in the addendum on the Education Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, other Ministries have seemed to understand

better  the  importance of continuing education.  The

Ministry of Finance has contributed significantly  to

educational  investment through  its  joint  training

schemes,  and other programmes; and we see  from  its

addendum  that  it will spend more  on  its  training

centres,  and  that  it has a programme  in  view  to

induce  owners  or managers of small  enterprises  to

learn to optimise use of personnel and equipment  and

improve marketing capacity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Ministry of Labour has its Productivity

Board   which  will  help  further  in  training   of

supervisors    and   junior   and   middle-management

executives.  The Ministry of Health  has  stated  its

objective  of  organising  regular  national   health

campaigns;  I  have  no  doubt that  the  Environment

Ministry which as a training and education department

has its own programmes of public instruction which  I

hope  will  include education in the  area  of  anti-pollution

measures. And, of course, the Ministry  of

Culture as we have seen has its own activities geared

towards the cultural development of Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foregoing indicates that we have a very

efficient   infrastructure,  spread  throughout   the

Government  network, for public  education.  I  think

that  there is one theme that this network should  go

all  out to stress, and that is, the Singaporean  has

to  be given example in as many ways as possible, of

how  he  has to balance his own self-interest against

the  interest  of the other person,  for  this  other

person represents the interest of the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be done in many tangible ways. For example,

in the civil service and statutory



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



bodies  -  I  know they are working hard  on  this  -

efforts  should be made constantly to  temper  action

with humane consideration. It should be made clear to

motorists  prone  to selfishness and irresponsibility

that  they  will not get away, as they are  doing  in

large   numbers, with  what  we   should   consider

unSingaporean  behaviour. Those  employers,  managers

and  supervisors  whose negligence or  even  lack  of

forethought has caused industrial accidents  or  ill-health

should  be  given  their  own   lessons   on

consideration  and responsibility. At  the  level  of

organisation of neighbourhood groups in HDB and other

areas,  the  emphasis should be on consideration  and

cooperation.  Here  the question  of  noise  nuisance

arises.   Perhaps   the  Government   could   explore

thoroughly  the feasibility of stricter measures  and

legislation  to  combat noise  pollution.  Those  who

offend  in other forms of pollution should be brought

to book with despatch. In all these areas, Government

agencies  should set a special example. We must  also

remember that in national service everything must  be

done to instil in national servicemen a proper regard

for one another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the improved deployment of police national

servicemen  to fight crime, the quality of  behaviour

of people towards one another should improve with the

added  sense  of security gained. And we  should  not

forget  our old people. Many of our very old  people.

because  many  of  them  were foreign-born,  have  no

relatives or few people to depend on. The burden will

not be great for the State to give greater assistance

to such cases, although we should stress that the old

should  be taken care of by their children or nearest

relatives, as far as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir,I refer to the expressed intention of

Finance  to introduce a new style budget. It  is  not

clear  what the details are, and I hope you  are  not

thinking  that I have made a startling jump from  the

question  of  inculcation  of  human  values  to  the

question of budget. Actually, Sir,I suspect that our

new  style budget will contain elements of  what  has

been  described  as  Programme,  Planning,  Budgeting

System    (PPBS).   This   system   was   at    first

enthusiastically adopted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>



in  the  United  States during  the  time  of  Lyndon

Johnson  who  thought  of this  system  as  a  modern

management tool that would enable a finer life to  be

brought to every American at the least possible cost.

The expectations were inflated. However, for whatever

budget  system we adopt, there will still remain  the

necessity  for  good interpersonal relations  between

Finance officials and officials from other ministries

in  order  to make the system work. Here  is  another

area  where  good  example  of  Singaporeans  working

together may be given.



<br><br>3.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

fully support the Motion moved by the Membei for  Ulu

Pandan in expressing our thanks to the President  for

his Address at the opening of this Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general tenor of the President's Address and

the various ministerial policy statements is that  we

must  work  even  harder, keep  costs  in  check,  be

vigilant,  so  that we may achieve a modest  economic

growth  rate of 6-8% per annum. Few Singaporeans,  if

any,   should   dispute  this  and   the   underlying

philosophy of the Government, "From each his best, to

each his worth", as we in Singapore are like men in a

boat  rowing upstream. We have to keep on rowing just

to remain stationary. To make progress we have to row

with  all  our might. If we stop rowing  we  will  be

pushed  back  by the current. This is the inescapable

fact of life of nations without natural resources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance in his addendum to the

Presidential Address has not stated whether the  6-8%

expected  growth  rate is real growth  or  growth  in

monetary terms. I presume it is the former. Still, it

would  be  interesting to know what sort of inflation

rate  has  been allowed for. The world is fearful  of

another  bout of inflation. Inflation hits  different

people  with different force. It may be good for  the

businessmen but it crushes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>



the salaried employees and the lower income group. In

reviving the vitality of our economy, it is  my  hope

that  this  is  being  done  without  the  orchestral

accompaniment of inflation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also do not know whether the expected growth in

the country will be export-led or generated mainly by

domestic  pump-priming. We know,  however,  that  the

Government will make finance for exports more  easily

available.  This is a correct step. It  is  important

that   future  growth  in  Singapore  be  export-led.

Singapore  has always recorded a chronic  deficit  in

merchandise trade. This is not worrying per se as  we

have no natural resources and must import most of the

things  we  need. What is worrying, however,  is  the

continuous  growth  of the deficit.  Our  merchandise

trade  balance recorded, for example,  a  deficit  of

$3.0 billion in 1972. In 1975, it has doubled to over

$6.0   billion.  The  deterioration  can  be   partly

attributed  to  world-wide inflation  and  the  sharp

increase in crude-oil prices. But it also signals the

need to pay more attention to exports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, however, our balance of payments is

healthy.  It  has  a  surplus of  $700  million, for

example, in 1974, though this was reduced  in  1975.

The  strength of our international payments situation

is reflected in the strength of our currency. But the

strength of our balance of payments is derived mainly

from  the capital account, owing principally  to  the

inflow  of foreign investment and foreign funds.  But

we  cannot always expect foreign investments to  flow

in in abundance. The point which I wish to make here.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, is that as a people we must  export

in  order  to  pay for our imports. We cannot  always

depend  on  capital  inflows.  If  Japan,  which  has

relatively little natural resources, can have current

account  surpluses, so can we, provided we work  hard

for  it.  I suggest, Mr Speaker, Sir, that Government

highlights  the  performance of our domestic  exports

just as we always highlight economic growth rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move now to a problem associated with economic

growth   -   job-hopping.  I   note   that   official

disincentives are now being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>



considered to discourage job-hopping. Job-hopping  is

not  an  easy problem to tackle, for whilst we should

discourage  job-hopping, defined simply as  too  many

frivolous job changes in too short a time, we  should

not strangle genuine labour mobility. In an expanding

economy  with  new industries being set  up,  labour.

like  all  resources, must be efficiently  allocated.

The  market mechanism, the invisible hand, generally

allocates  economic resources amongst competing  uses

effectively.  The  more perfect the market  mechanism

the  better. Job-hopping is, therefore, a consequence

of  too rapid an economic growth more than a cause of

economic  ills. Let me make it clear that  I  am  not

supporting job-hopping - I am against it, but if job-hopping

becomes a national disease, we  should  not

just  stop  it through legislation - we  should  look

into the cause of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labour turnover should, therefore, be monitored. I

am  not sure that this is being done. I would like to

suggest  here a source for improving the  timeliness.

range  and  quality  of  labour  statistics.  As  all

employers   have  to  make  Central  Provident   Fund

contributions on behalf of their employees, this is a

good  source for labour statistics. This  source  has

not  been  sufficiently tapped and much labour  force

data  which  could be a by-product of CPF collections

have to be separately collected. Admittedly, the  CPF

Board  does  not  require labour  statistics  in  the

administration   of  its  responsibilities   and   is

therefore   understandingly   reluctant   to    incur

expenditure  for  its  own  account  to  capture  and

process  labour  data for use in the  formulation  of

national labour and economic policies. I suggest  the

Government look into the possibility of using the CPF

machinery to compile salient data on labour  for  use

in   economic  and  manpower  planning.   No   doubt,

expenditure beyond the requirement of CPF  will  have

to  be  incurred. Government should bear  this  extra

cost,  if  necessary, and not let this be the  reason

for preserving the status quo. A Minister's judgement

is  no  better than his information. In other  words,

wrong  economic policies through lack of  prompt  and

reliable data are more costly than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



the  expenditure incurred on the collection  of  such

nationally important statistics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to maritime and port services, I note

with surprise that the Ministry of Communications  is

developing   new   transportation  technologies   and

facilities  to  "regain Singapore's position  as  the

regional  warehousing  and  transhipment  centre".  I

thought  we have always remained pre-eminent  in  our

position as a regional transhipment centre.  I  never

realized we have lost our status! But let us be  even

bolder  and  more imaginative and not stop  short  at

being  just a regional transhipment centre.  We  can,

because   of   our  geographical  position,   be   an

international  shipping  interchange   or   a   world

transhipment  centre.  Shipping  systems  have   been

revolutionized  over  the last  few  years  with  the

advent of containerization. Ports can become obsolete

if  they  do  not  keep up with development  in  ship

designs.   Investment   in   containerships   exceeds

investment  in  port facilities. With such  expensive

investment  in ships, shipowners must maximize  usage

of  the  ships through fast turn-round and high  load

factors.   Singapore  can  help  shipping   companies

achieve this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall give an example of how we can become a

world  transhipment centre. The Far East/Europe trade

is  characterized  by imbalance - more  cargoes  move

from  East  to  West  than the other  way  round.  If

sufficient  shipping  space  is  provided   for   the

Westbound  traffic, there will naturally  be  surplus

space  Eastbound. For the Australia/Singapore  trade,

there  is  a deficiency of containerizable Southbound

cargoes  to Australia. If handling costs in Singapore

are  kept  low,  as they could because  of  efficient

operations,  Eastbound ships in the  Far  East/Europe

service could use their surplus space to carry Europe

to Australia containers for transhipment in Singapore

onto  Southbound  ships  in  the  Australia/Singapore

service.   Trade  between  Mediterranean  ports   and

Australia   could   similarly   be   transhipped   in

Singapore.   So   too  could  cargoes   moving   from

Australia/New  Zealand  to  West  Asia.  We   should,

therefore, strive to be a world transhipment  centre

and  not  just  rest  on our laurels  as  a  regional

warehousing and transhipment centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion of the Member

for  Ulu  Pandan  in  expressing our  thanks  to  the

President for his Address.



<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  since  taking part in democratic  elections  in

Singapore  the  People's  Action  Party  scored   the

highest  number  of votes in the last elections.  The

people  of  Singapore  have  not  only  endorsed  the

mandate  of the PAP but they have also given  us  the

highest  percentage of votes since the implementation

of  parliamentary  democratic system  in  1955.  This

shows  that our electorate are not only aware of  the

problems ahead but they also have great confidence in

the  PAP  in view of our achievements since  we  took

office  1 7 years ago. They have expressed confidence

in  the able and experienced leadership of our  Party

to  ably solve problems, particularly in the wake  of

slower economic growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the people have expressed such confidence in

our  Government, we must not let them down.  We  must

plan  and  tackle our national affairs carefully  and

look  after the livelihood of the people effectively.

In  the  last  17 years although our Government  have

good  performances, there have also  been  inevitable

shortcomings. Therefore, I hope that in the years  to

come  we will be able to carry out our policies  with

circumspection and care before implementation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, having read the policy speech

delivered  by  the President on 8th February  at  the

opening  of  the First Session of this Parliament,  I

would  say that this is a document that sums  up  the

Government's  policy over the next five  years.  Such

guidelines are based on the experience that  we  have

gained to deal with the current situation before  us.

They  form  a  comprehensive body of policy  for  the

Government. Of course, there are certain portions  or

points that call for our criticism. I am sure Members

will  actively  take  part  in  the  debate  on  such

matters.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For lack of time. I will be brief in my speech. I

wish to bring up only two matters now for the special

attention  of  the Government. I will  bring  up  the

other   matters  from  time  to  time  at  subsequent

sittings of this Parliament. The first matter I would

like  to focus attention on is the hope of our people

that  the Government will pay attention to the  civil

service  so  that  civil servants  will  be  able  to

discharge    their    duties   and   responsibilities

courteously  and  efficiently.  Civil  servants   are

expected  to  be  fair but firm in dealing  with  the

public. They should not try to pass the buck from one

section  to another, from one officer to another,  or

even  from  one Ministry to another, as  this  causes

great  inconvenience to the public. It  is  also  the

hope  of  the  people  that civil  servants  who  are

arrogant,  highhanded and corrupted will be  severely

punished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter I would like to bring up for

special  attention  is  the  desire  of  the  general

salaried class for a proper adjustment of the  income

tax  system, particularly an increase in  the  amount

for  personal reliefs. The current income tax law was

implemented as far back as 1947. It has been in force

some  30  years now, and is antiquated.  Practically,

there  has  been little or no change at all  to  this

law. Compared to the cost of living 30 years ago, the

present  cost  of living is a far cry from  the  time

when  this  income tax law was passed.  The  cost  of

living  today has risen many times over, so  much  so

that  salaried workers find it unbearable. Therefore,

it  is only proper that the tax system, in particular

the personal relief for the working class, should  be

adjusted accordingly as soon as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these matters, I would say that the

policy speech delivered by the President is a correct

one that augurs a bright future before us. Therefore,

on  behalf of my electorate. I would like to  express

my  thanks  to the President and also my support  for

the policy speech.



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lau Teik Soon (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,I rise to support most firmly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>



the  Motion  of  Thanks moved by the Member  for  Ulu

Pandan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President in his Address has rightly emphasised

that  the  Republic's economic and security prospects

are   dependent  upon,  among  other   factors,   the

developments   and   changes   occurring    in    the

international  environment.  Significant  events  are

taking  place in great power relationships and  their

policies  towards  various  states,  and  these  have

profound  implications on our national  security  and

economic development. For example, the withdrawal  of

the  United  States from the region and the  American

efforts  to establish official relations with Vietnam

will  have impact on our foreign and defence policies

and  on  our  economic relations  with  countries  in

Southeast  Asia. We have, therefore, to be constantly

aware  of  the political realities in the  world  and

accordingly  respond  to them so  that  our  national

security  and economic development can be maintained.

The  Government,  under able and dynamic  leadership,

has  pursued imaginative policies and tough  measures

which  have been tested and in the main proven to  be

the   most   appropriate  in  ensuring  our  national

security and economic growth. Such policies have been

explained in the Addenda on the various Ministries to

the President's Address. It is my contention that  it

is   upon  these  policies  that  the  Republic  will

progress and prosper in the years ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Addendum on the Ministry of

Foreign Affairs has clearly reiterated the sound  and

effective  policy of the Government in the Republic's

relations with other countries. In our contacts  with

the  major  powers,  our policy  is  to  remain  non-involved

in  their conflicts. At the same  time, we

seek  to  avoid  actions which can  bring  about  the

dominance  of the region by a single great power.  In

the  region,  we  seek to cooperate  with  our  ASEAN

neighbours  and  to  effectively  implement  economic

cooperation in accordance with the agreement  reached

at  the  Bali  Summit.  I firmly  support  all  these

policies. Moreover, what strikes me as a forward  and

bold  statement is the view expressed in the Addendum

that regional cooperation should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



not  merely  stop at ASEAN. Within the region,  there

are  other  states  which are not members  of  ASEAN.

Differing  political and social systems  can  coexist

and  cooperate for their mutual interests.  Presently

there  are  difficulties  between  countries  in  the

region, which must be prevented from escalating  into

open  warfare.  Some  ways  must  be  found  so  that

consultations can begin among the concerned  parties.

I   hope  that  the  Government  will  endeavour   to

encourage  the  other Southeast Asian governments  to

cooperate  in  social  and  economic  matters  on   a

bilateral basis, and possibly, hold joint discussions

on  issues  that  affect the peace  and  security  of

Southeast  Asia.  I  suggest  that  the  idea  of   a

Southeast  Asian  Forum be considered  and  hopefully

convened so that all Southeast Asian governments  can

not  only discuss matters of mutual interest but also

reaffirm   the   general   principles   of   peaceful

coexistence.  If mutual fears and suspicions  can  be

removed  through this exercise, then  it  would  have

been worthwhile indeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singaporeans must constantly be

aware  of  the  threat to our national security.  The

President's Address mentions that the specific threat

to  the  Republic  is the Communist Party  of  Malaya

(CPM).  The  ultimate objective of  the  CPM  is  the

overthrow of the constitutionally elected government,

and  their means of achieving this are through  armed

violence,  infiltration and subversion. The  struggle

against  the CPM and their front organizations  is  a

continuous  one because the CPM will  never  give  up

their  objective to overthrow the government.  Hence,

all  loyal citizens must do their part to prevent the

communists and their united front from seizing  power

or subverting the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent General Elections in December 1976 have

shown  that  there is overall acceptance of  national

service  and the need for everyone to be involved  in

the  defence of the country. And it is this sense  of

involvement  that should govern our national  service

policy. In this connection. I support whole-heartedly

the  suggestion  contained in  the  Addendum  on  the

Ministry of Defence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>



that  national service be extended to  women, for  a

start,  on  a  selective basis to fill up  non-combat

posts.  It  is  good that our women  have  a  greater

opportunity  to  play a role in the  defence  of  our

country.  However,  may  I  suggest  that  two  other

possibilities   be  considered  to  ensure   adequate

manpower   and   to  economise  defence  expenditure.

Firstly,  is  it not possible to fill the  non-combat

posts  by calling up those who have been exempted  or

deferred  on some minor medical or financial grounds?

From  their year of exemption or deferment,  many  of

them  in these categories should have improved  their

physical and financial conditions sufficiently enough

to   take   on   their  responsibility  which   their

colleagues  had shouldered earlier. Secondly,  is  it

not  possible to call up those in the volunteer force

to   perform  certain  security  duties  and  thereby

release the full-time national servicemen or regulars

for  other roles? On this point. I hope the  Ministry

of  Defence will review the training of volunteers in

the  People's Defence Force and to expand  this  unit

which is especially useful. For where else can adults

volunteer  for  military service in times  of  crises

except  in  the  People's  Defence  Force?  If  these

suggestions are taken, it will be a move towards near

total  involvement  of every man  and  woman  in  the

defence of our Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, bearing in mind the uncertainties

of the future, it is absolutely necessary to maintain

political stability and guard against the forces, of

violence and chaos. It saddens me to note that  there

are   some  among  us  who  are  susceptible  to  the

propaganda  and  persuasion of  the  communists.  For

example, they become members of the communist  united

front   and   support  the  strategy  of  the   Euro-communists.

They are naive to believe that the  Euro-communists

are different from Asian communists;  they

forget  that the latter had formed united  fronts  or

coalition governments with non-communist parties  but

subsequently  when they achieved power, they  exerted

totalitarian  rule and removed all opposition.  Those

Singaporeans who support



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>



the united front commit the highest form of treachery

against  the  nation. It is unforgiveable  that  they

should lend support to those who seek to destroy  the

very  society that has brought benefits to them. Such

disloyal  elements  deserve  the  severest  form   of

punishment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Addendum on the Ministry of Home Affairs

mentions that the Ministry will continue to seek  out

and  destroy communist underground organisations  and

it  will neutralize those whom the communists use  as

united  front leaders. The electorate in  the  recent

elections  have  voted  for  the  retention  of   the

Internal  Security Act which empowers the  Government

to  detain the subversive, anti-national and disloyal

elements  without  going through  the  process  of  a

public  trial. Our people recognize that  such  anti-national

elements are merely tools of the communists

and that they are a threat to the political stability

of  the country and their means of livelihood. Hence,

they  deserve to be detained. Further, I suggest that

these  anti-national elements be deprived of  certain

rights  and  privileges, such as housing and  medical

facilities  which  are  enjoyed  by  our  law-abiding

citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, policies in one Ministry cannot be

isolated   from   policies   in   another   Ministry,

especially  when they affect national  security.  The

Ministry  of  Foreign Affairs may implement  policies

designed  to  prevent interference  in  our  internal

affairs,  the  Ministry of Defence may  move  towards

total  involvement  of  all  men  and  women  in  our

defence, and the Ministry of Home Affairs may prevent

continuing  subversion of our youths.  Such  policies

will  achieve greater effectiveness if  our  men  and

women are convinced of the need for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the President's Address mentions

that  there are the small misguided groups  who  fall

prey  to  the Marxists, Trotskyites or the New  Left.

The  Addendum  on the Prime Minister's Office  states

that the young have only faint memories of the crises

and hardships of the last 20 years and this can be  a

source of weakness in terms of their ability to  meet

the challenges ahead.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Addendum on the Ministry of Education mentions

that  greater  emphasis will be placed  on  bilingual

education and on technical education. I think this is

very  necessary because we need to learn the  science

and  technology  of  the  West  and  to  broaden  our

industrial  base. However, in view  of  the  security

threat  and the susceptibility of our youths  to  the

pernicious values of the West and the persuasions  of

the  New Left, the Ministry of Education should focus

on  these aspects of education, namely, the education

of  youths  to maintain and develop their traditional

values  and, more important, to understand the crises

and  hardships  that Singapore went  through  and  to

recognise  the security threat that faces  Singapore.

Then  they  will  be better geared to counteract  the

massive and persuasive influences of the West and the

New Left.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Addendum on the Ministry of Education states

that the aim of the subject. Education for Living, is

to  inculcate social discipline and national identity

and  to  imbue  in pupils moral and civic  values.  I

think  this  is  a commendable effort,  but  I  would

suggest  two modifications. Firstly, it is my  belief

that  the  target  group that needs moral  and  civic

education   is   the  secondary  and   pre-University

students.  Presently. Education for Living  is  being

taught to children from six to eleven years, which is

the  age  group that needs it less because  they  are

young enough to listen to and follow the instructions

of  their parents and they have less opportunities to

socialise out of their school or family environments.

This  is  the  reverse in the case of the adolescents

who  are  beginning  to become independent  of  their

parents and, more important, who are beginning to  be

exposed to western values through the advertisements,

the  cinemas  and other information  media.  At  this

stage  too,  the  values  that  were  taught  in  the

Education  for  Living lessons in the primary  school

could  well have been forgotten. Secondly,  there  is

presently very little historical content in Education

for Living and children leave primary schools without

any understanding of national history, especially  of

the critical periods that Singapore experienced since



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>



World War II. Without such awareness, how are they to

understand  the  implications  of  certain  of  their

actions or the dangers of communist infiltration  and

subversion? I suggest therefore that the Ministry  of

Education  considers the extension of  Education  for

Living   to  the  secondary  schools  and  that   the

historical  development of Singapore, in  particular.

the  periods  of crises and hardships be included  in

the  curriculum.  Education for Living  with  History

should  be  taught  as a compulsory  subject  in  the

secondary schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very clear from the

President's  Address  and  in  the  Addendum  on  the

various  Ministries  that Singapore  faces  uncertain

economic  and  political  conditions  ahead.  It   is

evident that all Singaporeans must make the necessary

sacrifices  for  the  sake  of  the  country.  It  is

axiomatic,  therefore, that we are constantly  guided

by  this  precept,  which has been  stressed  by  the

President. `From each his best, to each his worth'.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, this Parliament is one in which the

Government has got the highest votes and the  biggest

number of seats ever since 1955. This has come  about

because of the heightened political consciousness  of

the  voters  and  their trust in the  PAP.  But  this

overwhelming  support does not mean  that  Government

departments  can  do  what they  like  and  implement

measures  unilaterally without a  close  scrutiny  by

Parliament.  Soon after the results  of  the  general

elections  were made known, the Minister  for  Health

while  commenting on the general elections said  that

the general elections had shown that from then on the

Government  would  slightly change  its  practice  to

allow  a  wider  debate  on  matters  in  the  House,

particularly  questions relating to finance  and  its

policy.  He  also  quoted  examples,  such   as   the

surcharge on PUB bills and the additional road tax on

vehicles,  which  were imposed without  a  debate  in

Parliament. At this juncture when there is increasing

political  awareness among the voters,  I  hope  this

kind  of  incident will not happen again.  Otherwise.

Backbenchers will be deprived of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>



opportunity to conscientiously air the opinion of the

people in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President, in his speech at the opening of this

Parliament, said that "No major policy or legislation

should be passed without the closest scrutiny".  This

would  be  the new direction for Government  practice

hereafter. I hope that all Government departments  in

the  administration  of policy  will  abide  by  this

direction  and give the Backbenchers sufficient  data

and  time  to study and discuss any major  policy  or

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government firmly believes in the maxim

"From   each  according  to  his  ability,  to   each

according to his performance." The Government  should

put this maxim into practice thoroughly in the fields

of   administration  and  education.  To  allow   the

phenomenon   of   over-rewarding   vis-a-vis   actual

performance   to   continue  in  some   semi-official

organisations, including  higher  institutions   of

learning,  is  not only a waste of public  funds  but

also,  if  not  checked  in  time, damaging  to  the

reputation  of the Government. Should the  Government

give  these high-salaried perfunctory people who have

made no contribution the chance to exist, it will  be

a mockery to the maxim of "From each according to his

ability, to each according to his performance."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Addendum on the Ministry of Defence, we

come  to learn that national service will very likely

be extended to women. I believe that in a one-man-one-vote

equal  society where both sexes are equal,  the

women  also  have a similar obligation to defend  the

country. At present, there is no lack of women in the

uniformed groups in the schools. I suggest  that  the

Ministry  of  Defence and the Ministry  of  Education

should  jointly  recruit these  women  cadets, after

leaving   school,  into  national  service   or   for

employment therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Education does not seem to

have  found the correct and effective way to  realise

the  fixed  objectives. This can  be  seen  from  the

unstable administration



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



manifested by the, constant changes in curricula  and

directives  issued every year. Educational directives

issued  in the morning are only to be changed in  the

evening,  so  that  teachers  become  confused,   not

knowing  what  to follow, and it is the students  who

suffer  eventually. According to a  recent  newspaper

report, there has been an increase in crime among the

students, including girls. If the teachers have  lost

their  heads or direction, how can we expect them  to

be  in  a  position or mood to look after  the  extra

curricular  well-being of the students?  I  hope  the

Ministry of Education will very soon be able to  come

out  with  ways  and  means  to  realise  educational

objectives that have been formulated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is air pollution which is

increasing. With urban renewal and an increase in the

number  of high-rise flats, factories everywhere  and

growing congestion in public transport more and  more

obnoxious  gases  are emitted which  are  harmful  to

health.  In  the  city in particular, the  high-rise

buildings  and flats that line the roads and  streets

prevent the dispersion of obnoxious gases emitted  by

buses and other transport vehicles. If this situation

persists  it  will undesirably affect the  health  of

flat  dwellers  in  the  city area.  In  other  major

metropolis such as Tokyo and Los Angeles, the  danger

to  human  health posed by this kind of air pollution

has  reached  disquieting proportions.  Just  as  the

Addendum  on  the Ministry of Environment  concludes,

"If  air pollution is not checked early, its effects,

may   be   irreversible."  So  I  hope  the  Ministry

concerned   will   take  early  measures   to   check

pollution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the much treasured traditional virtues is

that  one should on all accounts live by one's hands,

The Social Welfare Department and the units in charge

of  hawkers  should be reminded of this virtue.  This

virtue  should  not be damaged by their  restrictions

imposed  on the over-sixties. In Singapore where  the

standard of medical services is good, the opportunity

and  the  ability to make a living do not necessarily

stop  at  60.  Therefore, people of 60 years  of  age

should not necessarily be prohibited from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



hawking  and  encouraged to live on welfare  aid.  We

should  judge hawkers on their individual merits  and

support  those who are able enough to be hawkers.  It

has  been reported that the Social Welfare Department

is  planning to provide interest-free loans to assist

those who need help to operate small businesses. This

is a good start.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President pointed out in his speech that "we

should  not seek to model our lives on Western social

mores and their contemporary life-styles." This is  a

very   correct  and  clear  directive.  I  hope   the

Government in every field of its administration  will

try its best to keep and maintain those good but non-Western

lifestyles, and endeavour to preserve, within

the  spirit  and bounds of the law, oriental  colours

that would not obstruct our progress.

and I wish to associate myself also with their views.

The President's speech together with the addenda from

the Ministers have given all of us a succinct, frank,

and  a good statement of fundamentals, policies which

decide  all  other policies upon which our Government

will decide our life, will provide the things that we

think Singapore should be given and generally to  aim

for a better life for the whole of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Addenda, it is clear that nearly every

important  technological aspect  of  development  has

been covered adequately. There was also emphasis that

the  Government's  role is definitely  to  serve  the

people and in the interest of the Republic. I am glad

to  note that in the President's speech and also  the

speech  of  the  Prime Minister that there  was  very

strong recognition on yet another important aspect of

development,   that  is,  the  human  dimensions   of

development.   The   President   has   stressed   the

importance of strengthening the Asian precepts  which

have  given strength to our cultures, to make use  of

it and in importing other values or technologies from

overseas, we should be highly selective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Addendum on the Prime Minister's Office also

emphasised  the need for strengthening the  character

of  the  Government, the character of our  people.  I

note and I share the concern of the Member for Katong

when  he  averred  that it is not easy  to  say  what

really are the Asian values which we need, which  are

the  more  important ones. So with  this  feeling  of

similar doubt, I venture to cautiously suggest one or

two  things, not that I know what Asian values  are,

what the good ones are, but merely to bring out these

points  because  of  my  own  family  upbringing, my

experience  as a child, my experience as a schoolboy,

my experience as a youth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first I have learnt is to respect the elders.

Even when I was a child, I was taught what respect to

elders means. Well, Sir, you will see, it is not only

in  the Malay culture but also in the Chinese. Indian

and other great cultures of the orient - that respect

for the elders is one of the fundamental precepts  of

life. This has become the basis of the stability



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



of  the  family, of the community. And if we  are  to

extend  this very concept of respect to the realm  of

organisation,  we  can see how  very  applicable  the

concept  is. I have met colleagues who have  finished

their  university education and come back  with  very

good  degrees  and they have shown themselves  to  be

extremely  competent. They know the things that  they

are  supposed to handle. But somehow or  other  there

seems  to  be  a  very acute lack  of  this  idea  of

respect. I do not really expect our youth to  kow-tow

to  everybody. But it is extremely important  in  the

context  of  group  activity in an organisation  that

there  must  be  some  semblance  of  recognition  of

authority, the responsibility of somebody not only to

take   charge   of  individual  persons   under   the

organisation but the overall programmes which  cannot

be  done  merely by one person but together with  the

members of the organisation in a corporate activity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also feel the value of humility. Very often when

I  meet  friends  from  the West,  they  seem  to  be

skeptical when we talk about humility. They  seem  to

associate humility with weakness. On the contrary, my

experience  in  life, as I said, as a  member  in  my

family, in school and also in the civil service where

I  had the privilege of serving for 10 years, I found

that there is tremendous strength in humility because

it  is through this value that you are better able to

get  the  corporate action of the people who  are  in

your  organisation, people who are with you  and  who

are  to  work  with  you  for the  common  objective,

because  if  you do not show respect, if you  do  not

give  a  chance  to your colleagues to  render  their

best, then I see that all the acquired technology  of

each member of the organisation will go to waste.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with this, I also wish to touch upon

a  point which was mentioned by the Member for Marine

Parade concerning job-hopping. It is so very easy for

us  to  accuse or to blame the young for being  over-ambitious

or being impatient. There are indeed  cases

where the graduate expects so much from his first job

or expects so much to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



be promoted within three years to superscale grade or

to  the salary bracket of the $2,000 or $3,000 range.

But this phenomenon of job-hopping, as the Member for

Marine  Parade  rightly stated,  is  a  very  complex

matter.   While   there  are  instances   where   the

individual may be at fault we must never forget  that

a  person  leaves  a  job not merely  because  he  is

looking  for  greener pastures but he  would  have  a

reason to find that the place in which he worked  was

a  place which did not give any meaningful service to

him,  a  place  where there is no  proper  accord  or

proper respect for the views that he may hold,  or  a

place  which does not give opportunity to render  his

best  or  to  make use of his acquired expertise.  So

long  as  we ignore the deficiency in management  and

keep  on  blaming the youth for job-hopping,  then  I

feel  that  we are only looking at one  side  of  the

problem  of  job-hopping. I therefore would  like  to

stress  that the problem of job-hopping is  indeed  a

very  complex  one.  While we educate,  if  necessary

reprimand,  our  youth, we must also  look  into  the

deficiency  of  management, the  deficiency  in  the

attitude of supervisors in how they handle the  young

workers,   and  see  whether  they  have   adequately

prepared  and conditioned and helped the new  workers

to    gradually   develop   loyalties   and   abiding

commitments  to the organisation to which  they  have

been appointed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also a number of issues which were

mentioned in the Addendum to the President's  speech.

This  has also been mentioned by the previous speaker

and  this concerns the national service for women.  I

cannot  give any definite views because the  Addendum

from  the  Minister  of Defence has  not  given  very

adequate  arguments as to why it is now necessary  to

resort to extending national service to women.  I  am

sure  there must be reasons and I am sure the details

will  be discussed in the debates which will be  held

subsequently. For the moment I only wish to say  that

women have a special asset and the greatest asset  is

their feminity. So while we do have the daily parades

and weapon training, I really urge that the programme

of national service for women



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



should  be  done  to ensure that feminity  among  our

women is not destroyed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the community service, I have seen

and  read the Addendum from the Minister for  Culture

and  Science and Technology on the intention  of  the

People's   Association  to  undertake  more   dynamic

community  service through its various  institutions,

particularly  the community centres. I have  for  the

past  two  months been working very closely with  the

community centres in my constituency, and I find that

there is an inadequate service which will ensure that

participation  in  community  service  is  not   only

confined  to  the  poorer class.  From  the  way  the

community centres have been managed, I find  that  it

has not given sufficient consideration on the need to

attract,  to  call, to invite, to bring forward  more

professional  people to participate in the  community

centres.  There  is  a large number  of  professional

people  in our country, and if the community  centres

continue  to conduct themselves merely by relying  on

the  lower income group, or conducting its programmes

and  ignoring the potential of the professionals  and

the   middle  income  group,  then  I  think  we  are

deliberately  depriving ourselves of  the  tremendous

expertise  which exists amongst our professionals.  I

therefore  urge the Minister for Culture to seriously

consider  programmes of attracting  more  integration

and  greater  participation not only from  the  lower

income group but also from the professionals and  the

higher income group.



<br><br>4.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Dhanabalan (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

to  fully support the Motion moved by the Member  for

Ulu  Pandan to thank the President for his speech  in

which he outlined the policy of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has very aptly drawn attention to the

special  responsibility  of Members  in  a  one-party

Parliament  which we now have by the free  choice  of

the  people.  We have been reminded that  on  matters

presented  in this House we must be heard to  express

the doubts, problems and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



reservations that the ordinary citizen may have about

any  policy or legislation, so that during the course

of  the  debate  doubts may be cleared,  reservations

properly  answered,  and genuine problems  which  may

have been overlooked by the Executive, dealt with  by

suitable amendment to the policy or legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in some ways, it is easier to field the

questions  and criticisms of an opposition  than  for

Members,  who  belong  to  the  same  party  as   the

Government, to consider a subject before  this  House

very objectively and to identify and articulate those

aspects  which may be troubling the people. While  we

must  not  shirk  from  openly  supporting  unpopular

measures that are needed, we should not consider that

there  is any special virtue in a measure because  it

is  unpopular.  The Executive and the  Administration

may'  run  into  various problems in  the  course  of

implementing  a policy. It is a great  temptation  to

make things easier for themselves by proposing either

changes  in  the law or new laws when they  run  into

such  problems. We have to be alert to any move  that

would unwittingly legalise inequities or make genuine

problems  into legal non-problems. I am quite  aware,

Sir,  that  fixed ideas of democratic  processes  and

checks  and  balances can paralyse the implementation

of  policies which, though painful in the short  run,

are  nevertheless needed in the long term  and  wider

interests  of the nation. But there is a danger  that

we  may swing to the other extreme and consider  that

all  obstacles to swift and easy implementation of  a

policy as a nuisance to be got rid of by legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,I am not a lawyer but I can see an example of

this  in  the  proposal to deal with the  problem  of

inconsiderate  driving  by  drivers  of   buses   and

lorries.  Most, if not all of us, have  been  at  one

time  or other, subjected to the intimidatory driving

of  those  who handle buses and lorries  and  by  the

careless  attitude of such drivers to the  safety  of

other  road  users. We agree that it  must  be  dealt

with.  But we also know of the acrobatic attempts  of

the  drivers of what is probably the smallest vehicle

on the road, that is, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



motor-cycle and the scooter. I am not suggesting that

all  motor-cyclists  and  scooterists  are  daredevil

riders.  The  majority of them probably take  to  the

road  every  day  with  great  fear  and  trepidation

because  they know that they will come off  worse  in

any  accident.  But  there is  a  significant  enough

proportion  of  such riders who think that  they  are

playing a game to see who is chicken when they are on

the  road to make them quite a cause of quite  a  few

accidents. This whole problem should be tackled by  a

combination  of education, more thorough  enforcement

of traffic regulations, improvement of the methods of

investigating traffic accidents and severe punishment

for  those found guilty. To put the onus of proof  on

the  driver  of  the larger vehicle to prove  himself

innocent  in  any  accident  seems  to  me  to  be  a

legislative over-kill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has also reminded us that economic

prospects  in  the  next  few  years  are   full   of

uncertainties and that we cannot expect the same high

growth rate as in the past. We have to identify every

economic  activity that offers scope for  growth  and

implement  such  policies  that  will  promote   such

activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is encouraging to note that the Finance Ministry

is  considering changes in the tax system  that  will

promote   international   trade   relating   to   the

warehousing and sale of capital goods and  equipment.

We  have  used  tax  incentives very  effectively  to

channel   investment   into  Manufacturing   and   to

encourage the growth of Singapore as an international

financial  centre  and  as a flag-of-convenience  for

ships.  The  use of tax incentives to strengthen  and

diversify  the traditional entrepot trade should  now

receive   attention.   Taxation   is   an   important

determinant in the choice of a place as a  Centre  to

conduct  international trade. Such trade may  or  may

not  involve  the physical movement of goods  through

Singapore. In the former case the benefits  in  terms

of activity in Singapore will be greater. But even in

the  latter  type of activity where Singapore  merely

serves  as  a point to collate, execute and  maintain

records of trade that does not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



come through Singapore at all is still of substantial

benefit to us. We need therefore not only to maintain

and   improve  the  infrastructure  to  enable   such

international trade to be handled efficiently but  we

also need to re-examine our tax system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present income tax rates are certainly not

conducive    to    attracting   those   international

operations  that neither buy nor sell  in  Singapore.

The  establishment of a Fiscal Policy  Implementation

Committee to consider how best the tax system can  be

adjusted  to  encourage  these  activities  is   most

welcome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may be allowed, I would like to make a

suggestion  regarding the role in this  Committee  of

those who are directly in charge of collecting taxes.

I  do  not think I am saying anything new when I  say

that tax collectors are notoriously conservative when

it comes to tax incentives. Any lowering or exemption

of  tax is looked upon as an immediate tax loss.  The

tax  man  would rather maintain 40% tax in his  books

and collect 40% of zero than lower the tax to 10% and

collect 10% of something positive. This single-minded

approach is understandable and even admirable  if  we

are  merely  considering the narrow aim of collecting

the  maximum tax from existing activities. But in the

wider context of achieving economic growth, it  is  a

hindrance. I would therefore suggest that  those  who

are  directly  in  charge of tax collection  have  as

little  to  do with the formulation of tax incentives

whose  primary purpose is not to immediately maximise

tax  collections but to increase the tax base so that

even with lower tax rates on specific activities more

tax  can  be  collected as a whole to finance  public

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now turn, Sir, to the Addendum on the

Ministry of National Development. It is heartening to

note that efforts will continue to be made to provide

parks and open spaces. The many landscaped parks that

are  being  provided in the Housing  and  Development

Board  estates and elsewhere is testimony that  those

who plan our low cost housing are keenly aware of the

need  to provide green lungs to the people living  in

high-rise flats. Many children who live in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>



such  high-rise flats, especially the one-room flats,

need  space where they can run or kick a ball  about.

It   would  therefore  be  most  appreciated  if,  in

addition to landscaped gardens, more open fields  are

provided  within  easy access of  the  children.  The

small  patches  of  ground, often cemented  for  easy

maintenance that we find between blocks, do  serve  a

purpose  but they are not sufficient. There are  many

school  fields in the HDB estates that can  serve  as

playing fields for the children living in flats,  but

I  am afraid there are always vandals and anti-social

elements who cause problems when they gain access  to

school buildings and the properties within it.  If  a

method  of  fencing-off  the school  field  from  the

school  buildings can be implemented it will  provide

much  needed open space for children in flats to play

in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum on the Ministry of Labour, Sir, we

find  stated the paradoxical situation where we  have

citizens  registered with the Employment  Service  to

secure  employment,  while  at  the  same  time  work

permits have to be issued to large numbers of foreign

workers  to work in Singapore. It is true  that  many

Singaporeans, especially the young ones, are becoming

very  choosy  about the type of jobs  that  they  are

prepared  to  do.  The Ministry of Labour  should  be

fully   supported  in  its  attempts   to   encourage

Singaporeans to work in those industries  which  they

now  avoid. I find that a good number of job  seekers

are  those  who are past retirement age but  who  are

still  quite  healthy. They do not have any  savings,

and  either  they do not have children or  they  have

children  who  are  not able to  support  them.  Such

people   find   it   difficult  to  find   productive

employment.  This,  I  think,  is  going  to  be   an

increasing  problem  in  the  future  and  a  serious

attempt  must  be  made to find a  solution.  Perhaps

certain  light jobs in the public and private sectors

should be reserved for such people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of work permits, Sir, I can see the

absolute need to control the entry of foreign workers

through such a system. But I find it difficult to see

the  necessity to impose the requirement  of  a  work

permit  on permanent residents in Singapore. Many  of

these permanent residents are not citizens of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>



other  countries and they cannot go  off  to  another

country. They are a part of the local population whom

we cannot wish away. It would therefore seem to be in

our  interest to encourage and make it easy for  them

to  earn  a  livelihood instead of being a burden  to

their  relatives.  Although work  permits  are  quite

freely issued to permanent residents, it may take  up

to  a  month to obtain a work permit. Moreover, small

companies  are  just not prepared to go  through  the

process  of  applying  for  work  permits  for   such

permanent  residents.  The  administrative  time  and

effort  spent  by the Ministry of Labour  in  dealing

with  such applications can be better spent on  other

matters  if work permits for permanent residents  are

waived.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think it would be a good time to take

the  Suspension now. I suspend this Sitting and  will

take the Chair again at 5.00 p.m.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>

<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.00 p.m.</i></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in  his Address  at  the  opening  of

Parliament,  the President touched on the  course  of

events  likely to affect Singapore over the next  few

years. In response to such events he went on to state

that  the  Government of Singapore will  respect  the

renewed  mandates from the people of Singapore  as  a

vote  of confidence in the will and determination  of

the  Government to take action, if necessary, for the

common good. It is a correct and desirable policy  to

be  adopted by any self-respecting government. As the

President  states, we have to formulate  our  way  of

life, taking what is best and fitting  it  into  the

Singapore context.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in our concern to do what is best for Singapore

and  for the people of Singapore, there is always the

danger  that we may overlook the legitimate interest,

welfare  or  hope of a small section of  the  people.

Such  oversight may not be deliberately intended  but

the effect to the people concerned is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>



same,   regardless  of  whether  the   oversight   is

deliberate or unintended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum to the Presidential Address, it is

stated that the Ministry of National Development will

plan  and  work towards better housing with improved,

social    and    recreational   facilities,    better

infrastructure and public amenities in  pleasant  and

gracious  environment in the next five years.  It  is

also  stated that it is important to create new parks

and  open spaces for a large number of people  living

in high-rise flats. I have nothing but good to say of

the plans of the Ministry of National Development  to

improve and beautify the various housing estates  and

to   expand  and  enlarge  the  various  recreational

facilities for the enjoyment of all Singaporeans. The

Government  is  very  much to be  commended  for  its

awareness  of  the need to improve and  beautify  the

living  conditions of a large number of  Singaporeans

and  of  its  determination to proceed with  all  its

projects, despite the heavy costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am not sure whether the Government is fully

aware  of the dissatisfaction of those persons living

in  the  older housing estates, such as those in  the

Aljunied Constituency. Their dissatisfaction is  with

their  flats,  which are smaller and less  attractive

than  similar  types of flats in  the  newer  housing

estates.   They  are  also  dissatisfied   with   the

environment  of  their flats, because  in  the  older

housing  estates  there are hardly  any  recreational

facilities for the residents and, particularly, their

children. It is a fact that the children have  either

to  play  in  dark and dirty corridors, much  to  the

irritation of the residents, or they have to play  in

the car parks and on the streets, much to the anxiety

of  their  respective parents. I hope the  Government

will  look into the matter and allocate some  of  its

funds  to  improving  the living  conditions  of  the

residents in the older housing estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also note from the Addendum that the volume of

housing  and  public  projects  would  not  only   be

maintained  but increased during the next few  years.

These  projects are to be undertaken by  the  Housing

and Development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



Board.  Urban Redevelopment Authority and the  Public

Works Department. No one would question the necessity

or  the  usefulness  of  these  various  projects  to

Singapore.   But   I  am  concerned   that   in   the

implementation  of these various projects,  sometimes

unnecessary inconvenience or sufferings are caused to

those  persons whose homes have to make way for these

projects.  Whenever  a  new  housing  estate  or  new

roadway  is  planned, there are bound to  be  persons

living on the land on which the housing estate or the

new  roadway  is  to  be sited. This  is  so  because

Singapore  is a compact and densely populated  island

with  hardly any undeveloped or uninhabited area.  It

is the price of development and progress that must be

paid.  But  my  point is whether in  planning  a  new

housing  estate or new roadway, the Government  gives

due  consideration to the consequent  change  in  the

character  of the neighbourhood concerned. There  are

usual  grievances of projects being planned and  then

scrapped,  with the result that a number  of  persons

are unnecessarily evicted from their homes, sometimes

years  ahead  of  the  actual implementation  of  the

project. There is certainly cause for grievance among

those  persons  who  are chased out  of  their  homes

without  any apparent justification. But  I  am  more

concerned  with the destruction of old  buildings  to

make way for the so-called redevelopment projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand and appreciate that the Government has

previously  taken  steps  to  preserve  buildings  of

historical  importance or architectural significance.

But  such historic monuments are very few and, apart

from  that,  they by themselves do not influence  the

character  of  the  neighbourhood.  I  have  in  mind

certain  sections of Singapore where  shop-houses  or

older   residential  houses,  each   of   which   may

individually    have   not   much    historical    or

architectural  significance, but  which  collectively

have a unique and charming character. If Singapore is

to  retain  its separate identity it is important  to

preserve  the  distinctive  image  of  Singapore   in

relation to the other cities of the world. Huge slabs

of glass and concrete structures may be impressive to

behold  but they can be found in any other cities  of

the world. I hope



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



that  it  is  not  too  late for  the  Government  to

consider  seriously  preserving old  buildings  which

form  part  of  Singapore's past and  which  lend  to

Singapore a charming and distinctive image.  If  such

old,  stronger buildings can be preserved they should

be  preserved  not only for the sake of tourists  but

also for the sake of future Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in the Addendum relating to the Ministry of

Labour, it is stated that the Ministry will continue

to  work  with the unions and employers to contribute

to  economic  growth.  I have  no  doubts  about  the

determination  or desire of the Ministry  to  promote

tripartite  cooperation  on  the  basis  of  economic

prosperity  for  Singapore. The  initiative  and  the

leadership shown by the Ministry on industrial safety

and  health and in the promotion of productivity  are

ample  proof  of the good intention and sincerity  of

the  Ministry.  Similarly, I am  convinced  that  the

workers   under   the  disciplined  and   enlightened

leadership  of  the NTUC will do their  part  in  any

scheme  of  tripartite cooperation  promoted  by  the

Government  of Singapore. But I am not so  sure  that

the  employers  are  doing  their  part  to  make   a

tripartite  cooperation a meaningful  and  successful

effort.    No   doubt   the   employers   or    their

representatives at various tripartite bodies pay  lip

service to the concept of tripartite cooperation  and

are  free  with  their criticism  of  the  faults  of

others, particularly workers for allegedly not  doing

their  part in tripartite cooperation. But there  are

employers  while  not  openly criticising  tripartite

cooperation, are doing their best to make  tripartite

cooperation  a  farce  in  their  own  factories   or

offices. In the area of industrial health and  safety

we  read  in the papers often of accidents  happening

and  of workers being killed. Quite a number of these

accidents  and  deaths  could  be  avoided   if   the

employers    have   implemented   the   concept    of

consultation   with  workers  concerning   industrial

health  and  safety and take the necessary  steps  to

safeguard  the  life of workers and  to  prevent  the

occurrence  of accidents. I hope the Government  will

review   the   contributions  of  employers   towards

tripartite cooperation and, if necessary, take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>



some  action against employers who fail to  implement

any  scheme  of tripartite cooperation in  their  own

factories or offices.



<br><br>5.11 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion

of  Thanks to the President for his Address, as moved

by the hon. Member for Ulu Pandan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the very outset the President has warned us that

the  security and economic prospects are not as  good

as  those  in 1972. On the economic front, there  are

two external factors which affect the performance  of

our   economy:  first,  the  recovery  rate  of   the

American, Japanese and EEC economies and, second, the

magnitude and timing of the oil price increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistics show that the economic recovery of these

major  industrial  countries  are  not  as  rapid  as

originally expected. Furthermore, the recent increase

of  oil price by 5 to 10% would further slow down the

already sluggish economic recovery. As a result,  our

exports  to  these  countries will  decline  and  the

investment flow from these countries into our economy

will  also slow down. With the increase in oil price,

the    cost    of    providing   public    utilities,

transportation   services   and   manufacturing    of

commodities which use oil-related products as  inputs

will  also rise. These will no doubt adversely affect

the  competitive edge of our exports  and  raise  our

cost of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the midst of this grim

situation,   however,  there  are   certain   hopeful

developments in the international scene. Firstly, the

United  States President has announced  his  economic

plan;  he  has proposed to inject US$30 billion  into

the  American  economy so as to cut the  unemployment

rate  and  to stimulate economic recovery.  Secondly,

there are renewed efforts by the United Nations,  the

United  States.  West Germany and France  to  seek  a

peace  settlement in the Middle East. If  the  break-through

could be achieved this year, oil embargo  and

substantial  oil  price increase  could  be  avoided.

Thirdly, with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>



change  in  Japanese attitude, a  trade  war  between

Japan and the EEC countries probably will be averted,

at least temporarily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to our region, our Government's effort

in promoting greater economic cooperation among ASEAN

countries  has  made further progress. Following  the

visit of our Prime Minister, bilateral tariff accords

have  been reached with the Philippines and Thailand.

Admittedly,  given the present volume  and  commodity

composition  of  our trade with these two  countries,

the  economic  benefits will not be very substantial.

Nevertheless,  this  is another big  step  towards  a

greater  cooperation  in the region  of  ASEAN.  This

progress,  together with the result  of  our  general

elections,  would  enhance  the  confidence  of   the

potential investors on the economic prospect  of  our

Republic and this region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote industrial growth and to attract foreign

investment,   apart   from   maintaining    political

stability, we must also hold down cost of production.

It  is  reassuring to note from the Addendum  to  the

Presidential  Address that "we shall watch  carefully

against too high Government charges for industry such

as  for  port services and rates for electricity  and

water."  More important, we must be able  to  prevent

excessive  increase in labour costs  and  to  promote

productivity increase. Wage increase must be  orderly

and related to increase in productivity. Though trade

union  and management have endorsed the productivity-gearing

principle, nothing concrete  has  come  out.

There  are  many  practical problems of  implementing

such  a  scheme, particularly in the service  sector.

However,  this  is  the  best way  that  wages  could

increase without damaging our competitiveness in  the

international market. As a start, a practical way is,

wherever   possible  and  whenever   applicable,   to

encourage adoption of productivity incentive  schemes

at the plant level in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me now to turn to the

security problem. The communists will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>



continue   to  be  the  main  threat  to  Singapore's

internal  security. The Government must  continue  to

crack   down  on  communist  underground  and   front

organisations. In the struggle with communists, there

is  no  room for compromise. The hard-core communists

must  be  severely dealt with. However, students  and

youths  who  have  been  misled  and  misguided  into

supporting the communists should probably be  treated

more leniently. They should be given a chance to turn

over a new leaf. Their involvement should be regarded

as  one  aspect  of the youth problems in  Singapore.

Another  aspect  is drug addiction which  is  like  a

cancer  in  our  society undermining  the  will,  the

morale  and  the  working  capacity  of  the  younger

generation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, Sir, youths are less satisfied with the

status quo. They are rebellious and rather impatient.

In  a highly competitive society like ours, some  are

frustrated  in the process. This is quite inevitable.

Those  who  are  weak in will power and  who  try  to

escape, from reality would resort to drugs as an easy

way   out.  Those  who  are  more  strong-headed  and

idealistic  would  turn against  the  present  social

order  and  try  to change it. Youths of  the  latter

category are the prime target of recruitment for  the

communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum to the Presidential Address, it was

projected  that by 1980, there will be  some  810,000

persons  or 33.8% of our population in the age  group

of  15-29  years old. This is a serious  problem.  We

should   not  allow  drug  addiction  and   Communist

infiltration to spread, particularly in view  of  the

fact  that we are heading for difficult times. Severe

punishment  of  drug  pushers,  exposure  of   misled

student  leaders, and rehabilitation of drug  addicts

are  all  necessary  steps  to  contain  the  spread.

However,  these alone are not enough.  They  must  be

supplemented  by coordinated efforts on other  fronts

to educate the youths and their parents, to instil in

them  national values and to absorb their energy  and

free  time in some other positive fields. It  may  be

necessary, therefore to establish an organisation  to

coordinate these efforts and programmes to probe into

the youth



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



problems and to recommend proper solutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have also taken note of the

President's  Address that the vote of  confidence  of

our  people  places on all the Members of  Parliament

the duty to ensure that all shades of opinion out  in

the   constituencies   are   vigorously   voiced   in

Parliamentary questions and debates. Sir,  as  a  new

MP,  it will be presumptuous on my part to claim that

I know exactly the feelings and opinions of my people

in   Leng  Kee  Constituency.  However,  through   my

frequent contacts with them during the Elections  and

in  the  last  two months, I sense that  while  these

people  endorse  the  major  policies  ranging   from

national  defence to our foreign policies, and  have

full  confidence in our political leaders in charting

the  path for them into the future, many of them  are

unhappy  about  certain policies which  affect  their

daily  lives  and the manner in which these  policies

are  introduced and implemented. There are many  such

examples that could be raised in this Parliament. For

the  present.  I  just  want to  concentrate  on  one

example,  that  is, the PUB surcharge. Personally.  I

reject the notion of providing public utilities  free

or  with subsidies. However, Sir, may I submit to you

that although most of our people are more prepared to

accept  the increase in electricity rates due to  the

increase  in fuel price, it is difficult to  convince

them that a surcharge, which is not part of the cost,

should be introduced in the first place. I think this

Parliament   should  reconsider   whether   the   PUB

surcharge should be continued.



<br><br>5.22 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ngeow Pack Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ngeow Pack Hua (Boon Lay)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I wish to congratulate you for  having

been elected as Speaker of this House I also wish  to

support  the Member for Ulu Pandan in his  Motion  to

thank  the  President  for  his  speech  on  the  8th

February on behalf of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the People's Action Party once again swept all

the  seats in this House at the last elections. There

is no other country in this world which has been able

to win all the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>



seats  at  one single election. Since the  people  of

Singapore have made this great choice, it is  for  us

to  prove in the next few years that we will not  let

them  down. The confidence of the people in us  gives

us  an  additional burden. Therefore, I  support  the

statement from the President that no major policy  or

legislation should be passed without thorough  debate

in  this House. As Backbenchers, we must also rise to

speak  the minds and the views of the people.  In  my

view,   these   two   must   be   related.   Although

Backbenchers have their duty to air the views of  the

people, the Ministers must also accept such airing of

the views and such views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to add my views on the maxim

stated by the President: "From each his best; To each

his worth." In particular, I would like to relate  my

view  on the wage policy in the light of this  maxim.

The President said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`My government holds firm to this simple truth: that

to  get  from  each his best, rewards and recognition

must  go  to  those  who excel in  consistently  high

performance'



<br><br>I  want  to  tie  this up with the  addendum  to  the

Presidential Address on the Ministry of  Finance.  It

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We shall seek, through the National Wages Council,

single annual wage increases which reward workers who

produce more:



<br><br>This again is to be tied up with the addendum on  the

Ministry of Labour in similar light. It states:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... that future wage increases have to be orderly and

related  to  higher productivity and economic  growth

Fringe benefits which have escalated in recent  years

must  not be extended in range or quantum Those which

are  bizarre  or  not conducive to economic  progress

will  have  to  be discontinued. The  National  Wages

Council  will  examine  the  question  of  the   full

offsetting of its wage guidelines against  all  forms

of  increases of remuneration. It will also  consider

whether  employees who job-hop should be granted  the

full  wage  increase  recommended Rationalisation  of

fringe  benefits  will also be  looked  into  by  the

Council.  At  the  plant  level,  employers  will  be

encouraged   to   implement  productivity   incentive

schemes  to  ensure greater efforts on  the  workers'

part and reward for such additional performance."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although I am not from the unions,

I  have been an employee for more than 10 years and I

know  the problems of the workers. So we have similar

views. All the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>



time  we  hear the appeal to the workers  to  tighten

their belts and there is conflict in this regard.  On

the  one  hand, the workers are condemned  for  being

lazy. On the other hand, we hear people say that  our

achievements have been due to the hard  work  of  our

workers, So we do not have a consistent stand on this

matter and workers are quite at a loss. There  is  no

dispute  that  we  should  uphold  the  principle  of

productivity geared, with wage increase. But what  is

productivity? What are the norms of productivity? How

is  productivity  to be measured? The  NWC  made  its

recommendations  last  year without  any  categorical

definition  for "productivity". There is no  concrete

proposal  for  implementing this principle.  We  have

been  talking about productivity for years and  years

but  this has become a very abstract term. So  unless

we  can lay down some form of guidelines, there  will

be  abuse and the workers will suffer as a result  of

this  abuse. We therefore suggest that the NWC should

review  the  question of productivity very  carefully

and   make  concrete  proposals.  I  feel  that   the

determination  of  productivity  and  the   incentive

therefor  should not be determined by the  management

alone.  Parliament  should also  debate  on  what  is

productivity  and  what kinds of rewards  are  to  be

given to workers. It is only after a debate that  the

rationalisation can be effected through the NWC.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now I would like to touch on fringe benefits.

Again,  there  is  a  lack of definition  of  "fringe

benefit" or rationalisation. Before we rationalise or

define "fringe benefits", there is a possibility  for

abuse or dispute. So since we want to learn from  the

Japanese, we  must also emulate them  on  the  bonus

system  because  this is a system  that  acts  as  an

incentive  for the Japanese workers to  work  harder.

Before  we  have  a proper profit-sharing  system,  I

think the bonus system is a good system. It is a kind

of  an  incentive scheme, particularly in the Chinese

business  community where wages are low.  And  it  is

only  through bonus as an incentive that productivity

and performance can be improved.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, "From each his best; To each his

worth."  There is nothing wrong in this society.  The

principle is right but there may be some problems  in

its  implementation. I think the second part is  more

important  than  the first. In the first  part  "From

each  his  best",  it should be taken  to  mean  that

everybody is given an opportunity to do his best.  In

the  second  part  "To each his  worth", what  is  a

person's  worth?  There should be a proper  personnel

management  system  in  all our  factories  or  other

organisations. There should be emphasis on  incentive

rather  than punishment. The trouble with the Chinese

system which cannot be used in Singapore is that they

emphasise  more  on penalty than on  incentives.  The

system here is different. So we should encourage  our

workers to take their own initiative and reward  them

accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President stated in his speech that there

will  be  slower  economic growth and  so  we  should

adjust  our  spending  habits  accordingly.  In  this

regard  I  think the Government should take the  lead

because  over the past few years people have  changed

in  their attitude towards spending. This is  because

we  over-emphasise the materialistic aspects  of  our

living.   For   example,  many  discharged   national

servicemen  have become very choosy and  expect  more

from  their  employment or their jobs. So  we  should

inculcate   the   proper  values  in   our   national

servicemen while they are in the national service. We

must  correct  their attitudes.  It  is  through  the

process  of education through the mass media that  we

will  be able to correct this attitude. We must teach

our  young people that if they spend two hours  in  a

coffee  house  they are spending more  than  a  day's

wage.  So  we must teach our people to be frugal.  We

must  correct  their attitude. If we  switch  on  the

television, we can see lots of advertisements on  the

Big  Sweep and Toto. Everybody is urged to  get  rich

quick.  This  entirely runs counter to our  political

philosophy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another more serious problem. Sir, and

that  is the problem of communist threat in the years

to  come.  Such a threat, no matter whether it  comes

from the Malayan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>



Communist  Party  or the Euro-New Left, there  is  a

threat,  We  are  exposed and  susceptible  to  their

subversion.  People here know what is bad  about  the

communists  but  they may not realise  what  kind  of

threat  is coming from Europe, particularly the  non-English

educated. In other words, they may not  know

the true meaning of the threat from this source.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to implement the Internal Security

Act  on which the Government is supported in the last

election. But the ISA alone will not be able to  wipe

out  the communist threat. So we must expose the true

nature  of the communists by educating our people  in

understanding the kind of life the people are leading

in  a  communist society. It is only when  they  know

what  kind  of  life they will have  in  a  communist

society  that  they  will  be  able  to  combat   the

communist  philosophy or ideology. We  must  do  more

through  the  mass media by exposing  what  communism

really is so that our young people will know the real

threat of communism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum on the Ministry of Education we are

told  that the emphasis henceforth will be  on  moral

values and moral education. So we must do all we  can

to  ensure  that our students are imbued  with  Asian

moral  values so that they will not be influenced  by

contemporary Western life styles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum on the Ministry of Culture, it is

stated  that  we must make every effort  possible  to

ensure  that  there is no erosion of our  traditional

cultural values. There is no doubt that we should  do

these  things. We must also educate our young  people

not  to accept ideologies which are irrelevant to our

society.  We  must also inculcate  in  our  youth  an

idealism  that they will not allow themselves  to  be

used  or  manipulated  by the  communists.  Both  are

equally  important. We must have  the  proper  spirit

coupled  with  good moral values. We  must  give  our

young people a proper understanding of these values.

<br><br>5.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek Bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek Bin Saniff (Kolam Ayer)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I rise to support the Motion  thanking

the   President  for  his  speech  delivered  on  8th

February   1977.  In  the  midst  of  world  economic

uncertainty  and  anxiety  and  with  the   increased

responsibilities    of    Ministers    and    greater

expectations from Members of Parliament,  two  things

have  been  stressed for all of us  to  think  about.

First,  vigilance against undemocratic elements  like

the  CPM. Second, moral values and attitudes  towards

life  that  must  be  inculcated  in  the  people  of

Singapore. There are, I note, 41 lines in respect  of

the first and 66 lines in respect of the second. Both

topics  occupy  greater space when  compared  to  the

others,   and  this  in  itself  shows  their   great

importance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 23rd December 1976, the people of Singapore made a decision that can be taken to mean that

politics  is a serious business and that it  requires

people who are equally serious to manage it. Politics

is not a game, neither is it a gambling den. The most

a  gambler can lose is his money, property or honour.

But  gambling  with  politics  brings  about  a  more

terrible  consequence. Mistakes can cause destruction

to property, destruction to family and destruction to

democracy, self and nation. We do not have to go  far

for  an  example. Miscalculations whereby the "weapon

will  injure the master" as happened in Indonesia  to

the  PKI  and the victories in East of Thailand  have

brought  the  lesson  home:  that  infiltration   and

invasion or armed struggle are double edged.  We  can

draw  a lesson from this, Their victories have caused

an  increase in infiltration, and this means that  it

is  necessary for us to be vigilant. In this  respect

we welcome the steps taken by the Ministry of Defence

and the Ministry of Home Affairs to make Singapore  a

safe place to live in, something that is easy to come

by these days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people have given us their

mandate in 1976 with set programmes as found  in  the

Addenda  to  the  President's Address  which  include

problems and steps to be taken in health and economic

sectors,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>



social and medical services, education and defence. I

feel the same mandate will be given in 1981. The only

difference  is that in that time our voters  will  be

more  sophisticated. They will judge us on the  party

we join and also the candidate's credibility. This is

an indication that will be an important factor two or

three  years after 1981, or we can even  say  two  or

three  years before the 1 986 general elections.  Our

political  chessboard will be more  interesting.  And

the  CPM  and its allies will probably lay stress  on

these  two  matters - (1) the absence of the  present

leaders;  (2)  the  way we go about implementing  our

programme. With regard to the first, the knowledge of

the  absence  of  all  or some of  our  leaders  will

encourage them to prepare for 1984, a very busy  year

for   their   activities.  But  our  dedication   and

sincerity will frustrate them. We can also  have  the

situation  under  control if we can  look  after  our

second  programme well, i.e, our approach in carrying

out our tasks This will be a strengthening pillar for

our  people. It is not easy for someone in  power  to

avoid feeling arrogant and proud. We must avoid these

pitfalls, because  if  we  allow  this  to   happen

Singapore  as a whole will go down the  pit.  I  feel

this  is  an  important criterion for all  of  us  to

observe.  It is a time bomb of self-destruction  that

is  set to explode. A worthwhile programme should not

be  carried  Out in a way that would cause uneasiness

among  the  people.  If this happens  the  worthwhile

programme will no longer have any meaning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, 72.4% of the people of Singapore at

least  agree that nothing in this world is for  free.

including  air and water. Air and water  have  to  be

treated for use. Nobody now wants to drink free rain-water

that comes direct from the sky. Nobody wants to

keep  quiet when the air around him is polluted.  The

people are prepared to pay they appreciate this value

in  life. In this regard we must see that the  people

do  not feel that we are a profit-orientated society.

If  it  has  to  be, let the profit be very  minimal,

particularly  in sectors where we do  not  subsidise.

Let not the people feel that they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>



are  subsidising  the Government. I  agree  with  the

previous  speaker  who asked if it was  necessary  to

levy a PUB surcharge of 5%. We can be proud with  the

profits we get or make, but not profits we make  from

the  people.  There is nothing to be  proud  of,  and

profit in this regard is meaningless. The actual word

is neither proud nor profit. It is "support". We need

the  people's support and support must come with open

heart.  I  am  sure the people are prepared  to  give

their  support and if necessary, their  sacrifice  if

the  nation  requires it. Again, in this  matter  the

approach  in  carrying out our policies  through  the

Government  machinery must be looked  after  so  that

they  will  not only support us but are  prepared  to

sacrifice their life and property if necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in this respect, I feel that in order to

safeguard  our people from undesirable  elements,  it

would  be  better if the Ministry of Education  could

review the importance of kindergartens by placing  it

under  its wing. I feel that at one time kindergarten

classes  were  held in order to protect our  children

from  adverse influence. Now, after 17 years  I  feel

that we should look into their standards and quality.

If  we can bring these kindergarten classes under the

wing  of  the Ministry of Education, it will  improve

the   method  of  instruction, especially   we   can

inculcate  good  values, followed  by  Education  for

Living  in  the primary schools and Civics when  they

reach secondary schools. In this way I feel we have a

better  foundation, we can keep undesirable  elements

and  exploitation under check for  the  sake  of  the

welfare of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel there should be a total review of policy

on   citizenship.   We   should   consider   granting

citizenship  to  those  who have  been  holding  blue

identity cards for more than ten years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if infiltration can be controlled and

good  programmes and right approach can be  given  to

our  people. I see no reason why Singapore should not

progress further and achieve prosperity and order  at

all times.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Presidential Address is a sober review of past events

and future prospects of Singapore. In brief, there is

no  easy  short-cut  to  prosperity  at  least  where

Singapore is concerned. The message is clear  -  that

all  Singporeans  are  expected  to  do  their  share

towards  making  Singapore a viable, independent  and

sovereign  Republic.  But I am  afraid  that  such  a

message   is   likely   to   become   distorted    or

misinterpreted by persons because of their own  self-interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum on the Prime Minister's Office it

is  stated  that the average earnings  of  the  modal

group  of  workers have trebled since 1965  and  that

those  who  have achieved more and earned  more  have

done  so  because  they have worked harder  or  shown

greater enterprise. The statement I have just  quoted

is  correct  and  is  in itself a  testimony  to  the

excellent  performance and the creditable  leadership

of  our  Government. But such a statement is  a  bald

statement    of    fact   which,    without    proper

qualification, may lend itself to misquotation out of

context.  While  the average earnings  of  the  modal

group of workers have undoubtedly trebled since 1 965

the increase in earnings has to a considerable extent

been  offset by a corresponding increase in the  cost

of  living  since 1965. This is in no  way  meant  to

detract  from  the achievements of the Government  in

securing such a great increase in the earnings of the

workers  but  the danger is that some  employers  may

pounce  upon such statement with cynical delight  and

use  it  to irritate and provoke workers who are  too

aware of the increased cost of living since 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the character of our pragmatic society

is  reflected  in the statement that those  who  work

harder or who show greater enterprise are entitled to

a  greater slice of the cake than those who  are  not

prepared   to   work   hard  or  as   enterprisingly.

Nonetheless, any statement to this effect has  to  be

properly  qualified or else it is just likely  to  be

misquoted  out  of  context. It is generally  assumed

that employers and other decision



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>



makers,  because  of  the  greater  and  more  taxing

responsibility and duty, have to work for their perks

and other privileges that go with their positions. As

a result of this assumption it has become fashionable

in certain circles in Singapore to blame entirely the

workers  for  any  low productivity  in  industry  or

establishment. Unfortunately, it is easy to spotlight

or   pinpoint   the  incompetent  or   unsatisfactory

performance of workers. On the other hand, it is  not

easy to prove or show up the inefficiency or the lack

of  initiative  on  the  part of  management.  If  an

industry or establishment is not as productive as  it

should be, it may be due to the workers or it may  as

well be due to the failure of employers or management

to  provide  suitable machinery or  equipment  or  to

devise  an  effective system of  work  and  congenial

working conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject of productivity has many aspects and

ramifications  but  emphasis in Singapore  is  wholly

focussed on the alleged or proven failure of workers.

This, in my view, is a rather distorted perception of

the problem of productivity. In support of my view  I

call the attention of this House to a recent story in

the local press of certain articles of clothing being

manufactured in and exported from Singapore and  then

imported  back into Singapore and sold  at  three  or

four  times the factory price. It is less painful  to

ascribe  the  existence  of such  a  situation  to  a

preference of Singaporeans for foreign products.  But

I  think  this is an oversimplified explanation.  The

reason  why  Singaporeans, and for  that  matter  all

other  persons, buy jeans supposedly made in USA, is

not  because  they are made in USA but because  these

jeans   are  marketed  with  a  continuously  massive

advertisement campaign in all media. I do  not  think

the Singapore manufacturers of jeans are prepared  to

fork  out  a  big  outlay  in a  similar  advertising

campaign  to  create  a  brand  name  preference  and

following for their own products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rather strange that we are prepared to view

in   a   charitable  light  the  failure   of   local

manufacturing   employers  to  show   the   kind   of

enterprise and initiative shown by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



manufacturing employers in other parts of the  world,

like  for  instance, Japan. It was not too  long  ago

that  I read in a magazine an account of the reaction

of  British workers to the Japanese management  of  a

Japanese  industry in England. Now British  employers

have become synonymous with low productivity. Yet the

productivity of British workers in Japanese firms  in

Britain  is  of such a level as to even  satisfy  the

exacting requirements of the Japanese management.  It

appears  that  one of the reasons for  such  sterling

performance by British workers is that they have been

greatly  impressed  by the example  of  the  Japanese

management.  For  one  thing. Japanese  managers  and

executives do not indulge in lunch hours of  two-hour

duration  as their British counterparts are  wont  to

do.  Whatever  perks and privileges  enjoyed  by  the

Japanese managers and executives are enjoyed  outside

their  working  hours which are  not  less  than  the

working hours of the ordinary workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason, Mr Speaker, Sir, that I find

it  hard  to  understand the fashionable  posture  in

Singapore  to  ascribe to the workers  anything  that

goes  wrong  on  the industrial scene  in  Singapore.

Thus, in the Addendum on the Ministry of Labour it is

stated that the National Wages Council is to consider

whether  job-hopping employees should be granted  the

full  wage  increase recommended by the  NWC.  It  is

implicit  in such a statement that job-hopping  is  a

socially  undesirable practice and  that  job-hopping

employees  are wholly to be blamed. With due  respect

to  the  Ministry of Labour. I think it is unfair  to

blame employees for being wholly responsible for  the

practice  of job-hopping. Just as it takes two  hands

to clap, it also requires two parties to give rise to

the practice of job-hopping.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, there are workers who, as stated in

the  Addendum  on the Prime Minister's  Office,  have

high  expectations, the  desire  to  seek  jobs   in

comfortable surroundings or who are even impatient to

succeed  financially. On the other  hand,  there  are

employers  who have not the faintest idea  of  career

development for their employees



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



and  who  have no desire to accord to their employees

even  the  minimum statutory rights.  Such  employers

have  no scruples in dismissing their employees under

the pretext of reorganisation in order to prevent the

employees from being unionised. Similarly, it is  not

an  uncommon  practice for employers to  get  rid  of

their  employees  who are on top of their  respective

scales   under  the  pretext  of  reorganisation   or

redundancy.  To  my mind, it seems most  unfair  that

such  dismissed or retrenched workers who  have  been

deprived  of  the opportunity to forge a career  with

the  former employers are now to be deprived of their

NWC increments from the new employer simply by reason

of  a  change of employment, I hope that the Ministry

and the NWC will seriously and carefully consider all

the  various ramifications and aspects of the problem

of  job-hopping before implementing any  decision  on

the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Chong Tee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Teo, you have about four minutes to make

your speech.



<br><br>5.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Chong Tee (Changi):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I would like to join hon. Members of

this House in supporting the Motion moved by the

Member for Ulu Pandan to thank the President for

his speech delivered on behalf of the Government at

the Opening of the First Session of the Fourth

Tuesday, 8th February, 1977.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the overwhelming mandate given by the people

of   Singapore  for  the  People's  Action  Party  to

continue  to  govern is a clear-cut encouragement  to

all  hon. Members in this House, particularly the new

MPs  including  me, to strive harder  in  the  coming

years  in  order  to maintain political,  social  and

economic  stability  for  our  nation  which  has  to

further develop, industrialise and hopefully aim  for

an  annual  growth  rate  of 6-8%  whilst  there  are

uncertainties and anxieties amongst major  industrial

nations  of the West. The effects of the increase  in

oil  price  will undoubtedly slow down  our  economic

activities.  However, with the, confidence  entrusted

to the enlightened leadership of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



PAP  Government, I am positive that our economic  and

social  dislocation in the light of present recession

will  be  minimised. I applaud the statement  in  the

President's Address that the Government will exercise

its  authority  to  govern  with  circumspection  and

moderation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the vote of confidence does impose a heavy

responsibility  on the Ministers to  act  fairly  and

firmly. As a new Member in this House, together  with

my  ten  new colleagues, times ahead will be just  as

difficult   for  us  who  will  have  to   excel   in

consistently high performance in order to be  awarded

recognition. Likewise, the civil servants in all  the

ministries  should  enhance  the  quality  of   their

service. Hard work, honesty, courtesy and helpfulness

are   the   vital   ingredients  in  fulfilling   the

objectives  of efficiency in dedicating their  public

duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Addendum on the Ministry of Home Affairs,

the  President stated that drug abusers  and  addicts

must  be  flushed out and isolated for a sufficiently

long period to prevent them from infecting others. It

is  most  alarming  to know that the  habit  of  drug

consumption  by youths in Singapore will continue  to

grow  and infect many other innocent people. Sir,  in

spite  of  tough measures taken by the Government  to

control  and  wipe  out  drug  trafficking  and  drug

pushing,  the traffickers and pushers are not  taking

the  law  seriously.  They are  still  doing  a  very

profitable business. These



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>



unlawful  activities are causing a major  problem  to

our  effort  in  nation-building. The  situation  has

deteriorated   tremendously  that  the   evil   drug-traffickers

are even tarnishing the good name of  our

Republic   by  taking  advantage  of  our   strategic

geographical  position to distribute  drugs  to  many

other European countries. We must find ways and means

to  deal with this serious problem. Surveillance work

will  need to be undertaken to keep an ever  watchful

eye on suspect drug traffickers with the objective of

ultimately  arresting and prosecuting them.  I  fully

support  the Government in making use of the  Police.

Special  Constabulary and Vigilante Corps extensively

to   help   deal   with  the  growing  menace   which

undoubtedly  requires the public's full  support  and

information. The public must be effectively urged and

encouraged through the mass media and the cinemas  to

be  vigilant  and give their fullest  cooperation  in

this matter.
