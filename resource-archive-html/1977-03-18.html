<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for National

Development and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>



Communications,   in  order  to   encourage   cottage

industries, if he will consider granting approval  to

persons who have been using a portion or the whole of

dwelling-houses,  chicken-huts, pigsties,  etc.,  for

manufacturing to continue their industries.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang (Senior Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng Liang) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question

whether  or not planning approval will be granted  to

use  the  whole or part of dwelling-houses,  chicken-huts,  pigsties,  etc, for cottage  industries  will

depend on the merits of each case. In evaluating each

case   the   following   factors   are   taken   into

consideration:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The location of the premises;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The nature and scale of the industry;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The condition of the surrounding development;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The Master Plan zoning of the area;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) The current policy, if any, affecting the siting of such industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the above factors have to be carefully

considered before a decision is made on each case,

as once a decision is made to allow an industry in

a  particular area, a precedent is set for  future

industries to be so established in that area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage cottage industries, the Housing and

Development  Board and the Jurong Town Corporation

are  putting  up  small terrace  flatted  type  of

factories for sale or rental for such industries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will

the  Senior  Minister of State  consider  granting

approval  to persons to continue to use a  portion

or  the  whole of their dwelling-houses,  chicken-huts  and pigsties for manufacturing, if they have

been  engaged  in this business for more  than  20

years?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think a

distinction  will have to be made as to  whether  the

industry  is  on TOL or whether it is on a  permanent

basis.  Where  a  change of use is  involved,  it  is

normally given to an existing user. But I do not know

in what context the Member for Thomson is speaking. I

think  what he is implying is that certain  types  of

industries  are carried out in places  like  chicken-huts, pigsties and dwelling-houses, and whether  they

can   continue.  That  is  definitely  not  in  order

because, as I have mentioned, the most



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>



important factor is the zoning requirements.  I  have

mentioned  the  precedent that will be  created  and,

therefore,  it  would be impossible to control,  say,

other  types  of housing whose occupants  would  also

want,  for  one reason or another, a change  of  use.

Sir,  the  merits  of  each  case  will  have  to  be

seriously considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is just a minor requirement, approval may be

given. For example, previously we have discussed the

situation where if a woman uses her dwelling house to

make dresses and she owns two sewing machines, on

that basis if she has been told that there is a

change of use of the place then, of course,

discretion has got to be exercised. She can argue her

case out and say that it is probably not a change of

use. But where a person wants a permit for a change

of use to enable him to undertake certain cottage

industries, I think, on grounds of planning approval,

it is not in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

not sure whether the Senior Minister of State is

aware that the zoning criterion has been relied upon

rather inflexibly by his Department. I have a recent

case where a person was doing business frying kropok

in his house. This was considered by the Department

to be an industry, and he was given notice to stop

doing it,



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from the Planning

Department's  point  of view,  zoning  is  absolutely

necessary if we really want to prevent indiscriminate

types  of activities going on in any particular area.

As  I have stated in the example which the Member for

Jalan Kayu has mentioned, perhaps discretion could be

exercised  here. I share his sentiment  that  if  the

business  is  not  intensive the  Planning  Authority

could have exercised some flexibility here. But  from

the  general overall Master Planning point  of  view,

zoning is important. If we want to control the proper

development  of  activities, then  it  is  absolutely

clear  that there should be no compromise. But  I  do

concede that flexibility could be exercised in cases

of that nature.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder whether

the Senior Minister of State would consider providing

certain  flexibility in certain zones. For  instance,

in  an  Agricultural  zone, you  might  provide  that

certain clean industries may be permitted. The zoning

of areas was done quite a few years back and I do not

think it has been reviewed for some time.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to

the  overall  Master Plan, it is agreed that  it  was

done many years ago. But although we are supposed  to

upgrade  the  Master Plan every  five  years,  I  can

assure  the  Member that it is being  upgraded  on  a

periodical  basis, perhaps on an annual or  bi-ennial

basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his suggestion of an adjustment to a

particular zone, that is being done. For example,  in

the   Agricultural   zone,   we   have   specifically

introduced  what  is called a rural centre  zone,  in

areas  such  as Jalan Kayu and Punggol. The  idea  of

introducing  a  rural centre area is to  ensure  that

certain  activities, like shopping  or  perhaps  even

some  form  of light industries, could be undertaken.

We also do allow in between the zones what we call  a

"mixed zone". In fact, we do allow in the Mixed zone,

housing and light industries to be mixed together. We

also  allow specifically obnoxious industries  to  be

located in certain areas where such activities  could

be  carried  out. In other words, I  am  saying  that

although the overall zoning policy is being followed,

wherever  necessary, modifications are  made  to  the

Master Plan to incorporate ideas of that nature.

<div align="center"><b>LOADING AND UNLOADING OF GOODS FROM VEHICLES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Relaxation of restriction)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for National

Development and Communications, in view of the ease

of traffic on the roads within the Central Business

District between the hours of 7.30 a.m. and 10.15 a.m.,

whether he will consider allowing the loading and

unloading of goods to be carried out in places where



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>



these  have  been  prohibited,  for  instance,  North

Bridge Road and Victoria Street.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Senior Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Communications (Mr Ong Teng Cheong) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

prohibition  of loading and unloading of  goods  from

vehicles  parked  at  the side of  certain  roads  is

necessary  because  of  a  number  of  factors,   for

example, traffic conditions, physical terrain and the

capacity  of the road and the need to facilitate  the

flow of public transport vehicles. Presently the  "No

Stopping"  restriction, which also restricts  loading

and  unloading, is in operation along some busy roads

within the Central Business District. The purpose  of

creating such clear ways is to avoid sterilisation of

traffic  lanes  and  obstruction of  roads  by  goods

vehicles during peak hours. This restriction is  only

operative from 7.30 a.m. to 9.30 a.m. and 4.30 p.m. to 7.00  p.m. from Mondays to Fridays and from  7.30  a.m. to  9.30 a.m. and 11.30 a.m. to 2.30 p.m. on Saturdays.

There   is  no  restriction  on  Sundays  and  public

holidays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Registry of Vehicles, the Traffic Police and the

Public  Works  Department  (Roads  Branch)  are   now

looking   into   the  possibility  of   lifting   the

restriction  along certain roads within  the  Central

Business District between the hours of 7.30  a.m. and 10.15 a.m.

In this review priority will continue to be

given  to facilitating the movement of buses. Loading

and unloading will be allowed only if traffic flow is

not impeded as a result.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

ask  the  Senior Minister of State, when he  received

this  question, why did the Department concerned  not

take  the trouble to do a survey of North Bridge Road

and Victoria Street?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, I am sure that when the

scheme of clear ways was introduced as early as 1974,

surveys had been conducted. With the introduction  of

the  Area  Licensing  Scheme in  1975  the  situation

perhaps has changed slightly for the better, and that

is why a review is going on at this stage.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Culture

and  Science and Technology whether it is planned

to  build a community centre near the Housing and

Development Board flats at Sin Ming Road.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture and Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Science and Technology (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Thomson  must be referring to the Sin Ming Industrial

Estate  which, according to the information  provided

by the Housing and Development Board, has about 1,170

units  of  residential flats. In view  of  the  small

population  size  and  the  availability   of   three

existing  centres  in the Thomson constituency  which

are  within 1.6 km from the Estate, a new centre  has

not been planned for this area.

<div align="center"><b>DAILY-RATED EMPLOYEES IN SCHOOLS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Emplacement on monthly-rated terms)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  and  Education (a) how many  daily-rated

employees  there  are  in  the  various  schools,

giving   breakdown  figures  according   to   the

different  categories of posts; and  (b)  if  his

Ministry  will consider taking steps  to  convert

such employees to monthly-rated employees.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Chai Chong Yii) (for the Minister for Home Affairs and Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are altogether 14 daily-rated

employees  currently  deployed  to  the  schools.  Of

these, eight are unskilled workmen: seven deployed in

primary  schools and one in a secondary  school.  The

other six daily-rated employees are watchmen, of whom

three  are  in primary schools and three in secondary

schools.  Unskilled workmen are normally employed  on

daily-rated  terms  not  only  in  the  Ministry   of

Education but also in other Government Ministries and

departments.  The  question  of  emplacing  them   on

monthly-rated terms is one that would therefore  have

to  be  considered  in  relation  to  the  Government

service as a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>



whole  and  not  only in relation  to  the  Education

Ministry.   In  the  case  of  the  six   daily-rated

watchmen,  however, they have been employed  on  such

terms   temporarily   and  may  be   considered   for

emplacement on monthly-rated terms subsequently.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I agree with the Minister  of  State's

answer that in other Government departments there are

also  daily-rated workers. But in the case of  daily-rated workers in schools it is different because they

have longer holidays. Being daily-rated workers, they

are  not paid during the long holidays. I would  like

to  ask  the  Minister  of  State  whether  he  would

consider  giving the daily-rated workers  some  other

work to do during the school vacation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is true that

the daily-rated workers sometimes have nothing to  do

during  the  school vacation. But we do try  to  give

them  whatever jobs there are, possibly  in  schools.

But   unfortunately,  it  is  not  always   possible,

especially during the long vacation. Their number  in

schools is fairly small.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head U - (cont.)



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead CBA 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to reflect a problem which has

repeatedly  been  brought  to  my  attention  by   my

constituents.   The   drainage   in    the    Tanjong

Katong/Mountbatten  Road  as  well  as  Poole   Road,

Parkstone Road, Goodman Road area is poor. This  area

is a well developed area with schools and residential



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>



dwellings  and  yet it is not uncommon  to  find  the

roadside   drains  full  of  stagnant   water.   This

situation  is  worse when there is  heavy  rain.  The

roadside drains overflow and flood the adjacent roads

and houses. Is it not possible for the experts in the

Ministry  to  improve  drainage  and  alleviate   the

flooding in this area?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member is well aware

that  the  area referred to is a low-lying  area.  In

fact.  Mountbatten Road was formerly known  as  Grove

Road. Grove Road and the area referred to formed part

of  the  Grove Estate. I do not know where  the  word

"Grove"  came  from,  probably from  "mangrove".  The

Member should also be well aware that one-quarter  of

Singapore   island   is  swampy.   Hence   the   many

reclamations which have taken place; the  outstanding

one  being Jurong which was previously one big  large

swamp.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member has pointed out, the area he referred

to  is  very well developed. In fact, the floods  are

controlled  by tidal gates at the Geylang River.  But

that  is all we can do. My experts tell me that  they

can  suggest nothing except that the land be  raised.

If  the land is raised the buildings must go up  too.

So  I am afraid it must be just one big "NO". But the

Member  is  not alone in his complaint because  there

are other parts of Singapore, like parts of Chinatown

for  instance,  which are below high tide  level  and

without  any rain parts of Chinatown can  come  under

water.  So  that is all I can say to the  Member.  My

sympathies, but that is it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I suppose I shall have to do with

the  Minister's sympathy. With that I  beg  leave  to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Ng Kah Ting -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Home Affairs is entrusted with the

responsibility  of  internal  security  and  law  and

order.  The Internal Security Department comes  under

his  Ministry  and  therefore it  has  the  duty  and

responsibility to check on any dangerous elements  in

our  midst.  During the last few months the  ISD  has

been doing an excellent job in actively tracking down

and   exposing   many  communists  and  anti-national

elements  in  our  midst. Its performance  is  indeed

commendable.  It  appears  there  are  a  number   of

dangerous  people living in our midst, whom  the  ISD

has  already  detected and exposed. I would  like  to

suggest that the ISD be expanded so that there  could

be  a  thorough check of all Government  departments,

schools  and  tertiary institutions, because  at  the

moment we do not seem to know who is who.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, turning to the subject of drugs. Many Members

have  already  spoken  about  the  drug  problem  the

trafficking  and  consumption of drugs  in  Singapore

during  the last decade. Yesterday a man died because

of  drug  addiction.  Even our  laws  too  have  been

revised and the death penalty has been introduced for

drug  offences.  Though the death  penalty  has  been

introduced, yet we do not see any appreciable decline

in  the  trafficking of drugs. We have already  heard

that  about 10 persons have been sentenced  to  death

and  about  30  others are still  awaiting  trial.  I

wonder  what  the  authorities are doing  to  further

stamp this menace of drug trafficking.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to solve the prevalent drug problem is to

stringently  control  the  entry  and  departure   of

foreigners.  At present, foreigners can  easily  stay

behind   after   the  stipulated  time   and   escape

detection.  Why  not  introduce entry  control  cards

which could be used to detect anyone overstaying  his

visit?  Perhaps  peddlers and drug dealers  could  be

dealt  a  severe blow if the entry of foreigners  was

controlled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as for drug abusers, what action is being taken

against  them and what rehabilitation is being  given

to  them? I understand that many young boys and girls

who   indulge   in  drugs  are  not  being   properly

rehabilitated in the detention camps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite often, after their release they commit the

same   offence  and  have  to  go  back   again   for

rehabilitation.   There  seems  to   be   no   proper

rehabilitation of these young drug addicts to give up

the habit of taking drugs. Why is this so?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister comment on this matter?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong is not speaking. Mr Chua.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs and Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Education (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to the Member

for Anson, let me first take his comments on the ISD.

First,  the  Member has commended the ISD for  having

done  a  good job in the last few months in  tracking

down   and   exposing  communists  and  anti-national

elements.  I  wish  to  thank him  for  his  word  of

appreciation.  I  am sure the ISD officers  concerned

who   had  worked  very  hard  would  be  very   much

encouraged,  particularly when it is not  very  often

that  the Member for Anson gives bouquets in a debate

in the Committee of Supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, to his suggestion that the

ISD  should  be  expanded  to  thoroughly  check  all

Government   departments,   schools   and    tertiary

institutions because "at the moment we  do  not  know

who is who", I would like to point out the difference

between just identifying a person



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>



and  identifying a communist or anti-national element

in  our  midst.  The  Police or the  ISD  has  little

difficulty  in  identifying persons through  identity

cards,   passports,  finger  prints, etc.   However,

identifying a person who is a communist or  an  anti-national   element  is  quite  a  different   matter.

Firstly, these elements do not operate openly but  in

a  clandestine manner. They go about their subversive

activities  by  hiding  their  real  intentions   and

objectives.   When   confronted,   they   will    not

voluntarily own up their involvement unless  the  ISD

knows  of  their involvement and is able to  confront

them with evidence. Secondly, the ISD would require a

very  large pool of manpower to keep a watch on  each

and  everyone in Government departments,  schools  or

tertiary  institutions in order to identify  who  are

communists  and anti-national elements  and  who  are

not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will not be cost-effective and in most cases

the checking will be a waste of effort and might even

result  in  undue  inconvenience  and  embarrassment.

This,  of course, is not desirable. The ISD has  been

able   to   identify  communists  and   anti-national

elements   in   these   organisations   through   its

intelligence  work.  Intelligence  is  also  gathered

largely    from    painstaking   investigation    and

interrogation  of detainees. For this  work  I  agree

that the ISD need more staff. In fact, the department

is  still  in  the midst of correspondence  with  the

Ministry of Finance to get more staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the other points on drug

consumption and rehabilitation, I shall reply to them

when  the various subheads pertaining to the  Central

Narcotics Bureau are raised for discussion.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the reason why I praised

the  ISD  is  because I hope the officers  will  work

hard. A drop of ink in a bucket of milk can spoil the

whole milk. Therefore, the ISD should check each  and

every department. I repeat: a drop of ink can spoil a

whole bucket of milk.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Govindaswamy, is that a Tamil

saying?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> No, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw

my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Phey Yew Kok -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head V be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 1101.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Phey, amendment (2).



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok (Boon Teck):</b> I am not moving, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (3), Mr Conceicao.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead BAA 1101*. (* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Teong Eng Siong and P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am speaking on this subhead, Sir, because the

activity I am going to talk about was started on  the

basis  of a proposal from Police Headquarters and  is

being monitored by Police Headquarters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to refer to a joint Police NS/Special

Constabulary  project named Libra  Project  which  is

being  conducted  in  a number  of  housing  estates,

including Kampong Arang /Jalan Batu which  is  in  my

constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that this Libra Project has two principal

aims: youth work and counselling as well as formation

of   neighbourhood  committees,  to  foster   greater

neighbourliness.  Sir,  I  think  this   project   is

experimenting with a praiseworthy attempt  at  giving

NS  Police and S.C. members a chance of participating

in  national service directed towards creative, good,

praiseworthy   social  ends.  I  have  followed   the

experiment with some interest, noticing the change of

direction  of  emphasis caused by experience  of  the

real situation on the ground led by those working  in

this  Libra  Project.  I think the  project  deserves

encouragement  and help to make this  police  aim  of

service  to  youth achievable, hence contributing  to

good police/public relations. The project is still



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>



relatively  embryonic in relation to  what  it  could

achieve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make one suggestion, however, which

I  hope  will  help the project avoid an  unnecessary

pitfall.  This  is in connection with  the  project's

efforts  at forming neighbourhood committees.  May  I

suggest  that such committees be formed  through  the

CCC  as  sub-committees  of the  CCC  and  that  good

liaison  be  maintained with the Member of Parliament

of the constituency concerned. This could well result

in  a  pooling of resources and in such collaboration

that would help further in the project's aim, because

the  proliferation of committees in housing  estates,

constituencies,  may  well add to  the  confusion  of

aims.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

in  recent years after a restructuring of the  Police

Force,   there  has  been  an  improvement   in   the

administration  of  the Police  Force,  resulting  in

greater  peace  and  order in our  society.  However,

there  are  still some shortcomings with  the  Police

Force. According to complaints I have received,  some

people  had  occasion to make a report  at  a  police

station, but the policemen were not prepared to  take

their report saying that the Inspector in charge  was

not  in. So they had to wait until his return.  After

about  four hours of waiting, the Inspector in charge

of  the  station did not return. So the  complainants

had  wasted their time. I then enquired of the Police

Department whether it was necessary to report only to

an  Inspector or a station head. The reply was,  "No.

Any  ordinary police officer on duty can take down  a

complaint."  This shows the policemen at  the  police

station  quoted  above had not performed  their  duty

properly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also received complaints that certain traffic

policemen have abused their power by booking  drivers

at  random.  There is a mobile squad in  the  Traffic

Police  that specially deals with this. Sir, if  they

take measures to deal with speeding motorcyclists  it

is  all  right, but it is not right to flag down  any

driver who has not been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>



speeding. Also, there have been complaints that  some

mobile  squad personnel themselves have been speeding

on   the  road,  recklessly  and  dangerously.  Their

performance  could well beat any racing motorcyclist.

This  is  what  they should not do because  they  are

endangering  other  road users.  So  the  authorities

concerned  should  look  into  this  matter.   Police

officers  are  people who enforce the  law.  So  they

themselves should not infringe any law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, the Police Force in our Republic

has  performed well with a high degree of efficiency.

Their  duty is to protect lives and property  of  our

people.  In order to increase the efficiency  of  our

police and to promote better cooperation between  the

police  and  members of the public,  I  have  several

suggestions to make.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years the police has been organising

Police Weeks every year. The response has been  good.

It  improves the relationship between the police  and

the public. Since it is good and useful, I would like

to   ask  the  Minister  whether  Police  Weeks  will

continue  to  be organised. Personally,  I  think  it

should   be  held  so  as  to  build  up   a   better

relationship  between  the  police  and  the  people.

Besides  achieving  better  cooperation  between  the

police  and  the  people, I would  like  to  ask  the

Minister  whether the Police could organise an  "Open

House  Day" for members of the public to visit police

establishments.  This  can  be  done   also   through

community  centres and other public  centres  because

during  "Open House Day" members of the  public  will

learn how to liaise with the police in the event of a

crime  or  accident.  In  this  way  the  people  can

understand the work of the police better and  on  the

other  hand  it will promote cooperation between  the

people  and the police. This is a good objective.  In

order  to  achieve it concrete steps must  be  taken.

Senior  police officers themselves should set a  good

example  in promoting this cooperation. I  feel  that

every  policeman of the rank of Inspector  and  above

should  frequently take part in social and  community

activities.  For instance, they should take  part  in

activities  conducted  by community  centres  in  the

various



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>



constituencies. The police officer in charge  of  the

constituency should be present. This will  promote  a

better understanding of the relationship between  the

police and the public, thereby removing any bias that

exists  between  them. There is a  feeling  that  the

police  are  "unapproachable ones".  Therefore,  with

greater  cooperation  and understanding  between  the

police  and  the people, members of the public  would

dare  to  make  reports  to the  police  if  anything

happens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to ask the Minister whether

he  would  set up in every police district  a  public

complaints bureau at a convenient place to facilitate

complaints  from the public, because ordinary  people

are not used to complain or to report any case to the

police,  particularly when there are police  officers

who  are haughty and arrogant. So the people dare not

go  and  report to a police station. The  officer  in

charge  in  the complaints bureau should be bilingual

or  even  multi-lingual  in order  to  facilitate  an

understanding of the complaint.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to ask the Minister whether he

will  consider increasing the number of police patrol

cars in order to increase efficiency. At the moment I

feel   that  the  number  of  patrol  cars   is   not

sufficient.  Not  so  long ago at my  meet-the-people

session a voter complained to me that somebody  threw

stones at his house. I telephoned for a police patrol

car but it turned up only half an hour later. I asked

him why he took such a long time to come. He said. "I

am  sorry,  but we are short of patrol  cars."  So  I

appeal  to  the  Minister to increase the  number  of

patrol  cars, as it will not only meet  the  need  to

maintain   law  and  order  but  also  increase   the

efficiency of the police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point is the white cross-lines drawn by

the  side of many roads. Recently somebody complained

to  me  that  because he was not  familiar  with  the

meaning of the white cross-lines on the road, he  ran

into  them and was fined $50. According to the Police

authority's  explanation to him,  such  white  cross-lines on the road mean that they represent stones. If

one runs over the white cross-lines it means that one

is knocking



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>



against the stone. So it is a traffic offence and the

driver will be fined. This is really funny. I do  not

quite  understand the use of this road sign  at  all.

Some  people commented that perhaps this  is  because

the traffic police want more revenue that they induce

drivers to run over such lines drawn on narrow roads.

During  peak hours when traffic is very heavy  people

would  inevitably run over the white cross-lines.  So

the traffic policemen standing by the road side would

take  down the car numbers and fine the motorists.  I

would like the Minister to look into the matter. What

are these white lines drawn on the road for? They had

better be abolished as they serve no useful purpose.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the resiting of

police  stations in modern structural buildings  near

housing estates is a wise move. I wonder whether  any

consideration  has  been given to  locating  the  new

sites.  Most of the old police stations were  located

at  street junctions, and there must be a reason  for

this. It could be for a greater public awareness of a

police  station  and also for easy  access.  But  the

present  new  sites do not appear to  be  located  at

street  junctions, and when the old  police  stations

are removed there seems to be a vacuum in that area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kandang Kerbau Police Station is a hundred years

old  but  recently it has been removed to Toa  Payoh.

Why not use the old station as a sub-station, because

the  nearest  police station at the  moment  for  the

people living around there seems to be far away?  The

vacuum  is already felt by the people living in  that

locality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand the CID is also going to be

rehoused. I am sure that this resiting will  leave  a

vacuum in that area. The CID building has been in the

Central  Business  District where  much  activity  is

going  on,  and  the people are also aware  that  its

presence  provides  some sort  of  police  protection

around,  especially by the various offices  in  town.

But now, when the CID moves out, the vacuum would  be

greatly felt. Instead of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>



rehousing  it,  why  not renovate  the  building  and

continue with its operations from there?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the introduction of the Police national service

is   remarkable.   About  9,000  part-time   national

servicemen  are now serving in the Force.  With  this

increased  manpower  in  the  Force,  does  it   have

sufficient  equipment and vehicles to  support  their

operation?  I understand the Force is short  of  such

facilities.  What is the Ministry going to  do  about

this?



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, do the police offices in the stations have

enough telephones? At times in cases of emergency  it

is extremely difficult to contact certain officers in

the  stations  simply because there are  insufficient

telephones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last few years the rate of armed robbery

has  gone  down considerably. In 1971 the figure  was

1,124  and  at the end of last year it was less  than

500.  This  is  because  of the  performance  of  the

section  which  deals  with  the  combating  of  such

crimes.  The  section concerned must be congratulated

for  the  good work and I hope that it will  continue

with the good performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lately commercial crime has become one of the

commonest   forms  of  crime  in  Singapore.   Though

Singapore  is  a  commercial centre  there  are  many

criminal opportunists lurking around and they are all

waiting to make a fast buck. In fact, some foreigners

have even joined in the game. The Slater Walker trial

is  a  good example of this. Is it because they  feel

that commercial crime does pay here, or is it because

the  punishment is not severe enough?  I  think  most

probably  the  Minister for Home Affairs  knows  that

there  is a big gang operating in the bank. The  bank

is  a big one. Or is it because the Commercial Branch

does  not  have enough suitably qualified persons  to

help  in the detection of this form of crime? If  so,

what is being done to remedy the situation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An increasing number of countries in the West use

computers  to aid them in police work. Do the  police

here also have these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>



facilities to help them detect criminals quickly?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past we have been talking so much about

people  sporting  long and unkempt hair.  It  appears

that  many  people nowadays are still  sporting  long

hair  and  yet  no  action has been taken.  I  wonder

whether  this policy is still in existence or  is  it

being  relaxed. I think most probably it  is  relaxed

because everybody is sporting long hair now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, are the traffic lights synchronised at

street  junctions? Although some traffic  lights  are

very  close together, they operate independently  and

sometimes  cause  more confusion  than  help  in  the

traffic  flow.  The traffic lights  at  Keppel  Road,

Cantonment  Road, Tanjong Pagar Road and  Anson  Road

junction are typical examples.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me answer

the  last speaker first, the Member for Anson. He has

given  another  bouquet to a certain section  of  the

Police Force about combating crime. I hope he is  not

throwing  a  drop of ink into a bucket  of  milk!  He

asked whether when rebuilding old police stations and

relocating  them  in Housing Board  estates  we  have

given  consideration to the various factors and  what

are they.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain, first of all, that for policing

purposes   Singapore  is  divided  into  eight   land

divisions.  Each Division is served by a headquarters

station  and when necessary supported by sub-stations

and  police  posts. The siting of  these  old  police

stations that were built during the colonial era  was

done  in  the  then  centres  or  concentrations   of

population,  that is, along arterial highways.  Since

then,  Sir,  there has been tremendous  redevelopment

and  urban  renewal  in  the Republic,  resulting  in

massive  shifts of population. Thus, the majority  of

the existing Divisional headquarters stations are not

only  old  and  need to be rebuilt but  are  also  no

longer   strategically  situated  to   be   maximally

effective operationally. As revealed in the  Addendum

to  the  Presidential Address, these will be  resited

within the next five years. The divisional boundaries

of  the  police divisions will also be re-demarcated.

The recent' relocation of the Kandang Kerbau Police



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>



Station  to Toa Payoh Town and the proposed  resiting

of  the  other  Divisional headquarters stations  are

done to achieve the following objectives:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to provide at the doorstep of large Housing

Board  estates  police service  and  other  amenities

within the wider meaning of community service;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to provide speedy response to public calls and

prompt investigation;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) to prevent criminal activities through police

presence;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) to provide a psychological boost to residents

that   police   assistance/protection   are   readily

available;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) to provide a base for strengthening police and

public cooperation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the specific question as to whether we have plans

to  establish a police post or substation at the  old

Kandang  Kerbau  Police Station site,  we  have  none

because  the  present  site  is  required  for  urban

renewal.  Police coverage of the Kandang Kerbau  area

is being adequately undertaken by radio cars and team

policing patrol cars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the removal of the CID building from

the  present site, I do not know where the Member for

Anson got his news because as far as -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> ISD has already moved out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> That is ISD, and not CID. As far

as  CID  is concerned, there is no immediate plan  to

rehouse it elsewhere. In fact, plans have been  drawn

up  to  renovate  the  building and  to  improve  the

accommodation  so  that the part which  the  ISD  has

vacated  will be occupied by the CID. I do  not  know

whether  it  is in the Anson constituency but  anyway

the  Member  can rest assured that the  CID  will  be

there for quite some time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Police national servicemen - the

part-time  SCs  and VCs -we have at the  moment  over

7,000 SCs and over 7,500 VCs attached to the various



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>



police  divisions. They are doing good work in  doing

patrols to prevent crime in the various divisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to equipment - walkie-talkies and patrol

cars  - these 7,000 SCs and 7,500 VCs are using about

772  walkie-talkie sets. However, I agree that  owing

to  this increased number of foot patrols there is at

the  moment a shortage of these sets and as a  result

funds  are  now  being sought from  the  Ministry  of

Finance to buy additional sets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the police telephone exchange, the

Police Force have got a PABX Exchange. At the moment,

it  has  40  exchange lines which service  the  whole

Police  Force. Each of the eight land divisions  have

three  exchange lines and three direct lines.  During

peak  periods  these lines are insufficient  to  cope

with  demands  and, therefore, it would be  extremely

difficult  at such times to contact certain  officers

in  police  stations. However, when the Home  Affairs

Ministry headquarters shifts to Phoenix Park  in  the

latter  part of this year, its existing PABX will  be

taken  over  by the police. As a result,  the  police

exchange will then have 53 exchange lines which would

help  ease  the  congestion  during  peak  hours  and

emergencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has spoken about unscrupulous

financial operators manipulating in banks. I  do  not

know whether he has any direct evidence. If he has, I

would  like to have any details from him and we would

investigate.  But  as far as we are concerned,  these

unscrupulous persons are found in every country where

they   feel  there  is  a  fast  buck  to  be   made.

Particularly  in Singapore when it is  growing  as  a

financial   centre,  it  is  inevitable  that   these

unscrupulous  operators will attempt  to  make  quick

profit  at the expense of Singaporeans. We are  aware

of  this  and plans are being made to strengthen  the

Commercial Branch of the Police. It is now a division

of  the  CID  headed by a Superintendent and  staffed

with  professionals,  such as lawyers  and  qualified

accountants. There are plans to strengthen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>



this further to meet the threat posed by white-collar

criminals, and this has been set out in the  Addendum

on   the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs.  However,  the

situation  is  continuously being monitored  and  the

Government  will  not hesitate to  enhance  penalties

should this become necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to computers, at the moment the police

criminal  records  are  already  on  computer.  These

computerised  records  are  useful  aids  to   police

investigation and men on the ground are now  able  to

screen suspects in a matter of minutes without having

to take the suspects to the Criminal Records Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Government's policy against males

sporting  long  hair, it still stands.  We  have  not

forgotten about it. This policy is strictly  enforced

in all Government departments and disciplinary action

is  taken  against Government officers sporting  long

hair. In keeping with Government's policy, members of

the  public  sporting long hair having business  with

Government departments are dealt with last.  Suspects

and accused persons in police custody are advised not

to sport long hair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to traffic lights, of all the 235

traffic  lights  in Singapore, 60  are  in  the  City

district  and they are synchronised to give a  simple

green wave system. For example, the traffic lights at

Bras  Basah  Road,  Orchard Road, Stamford  Road  and

Robinson Road are synchronised and the traffic lights

at  Cantonment Road, Keppel Road junction and Tanjong

Pagar  junction are also synchronised.  However,  the

traffic  lights  at Keppel Road/Anson  Road  junction

will be synchronised this year with the completion of

the  extension  of Shenton Way from  Palmer  Road  to

Anson  Road. I hope that will satisfy the Member  for

Anson.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the Member for Sembawang. The Member

spoke  about police/public relationship and the  good

response  the  public had given to  the  Police  Week

programmes  and he asked whether they will  continue.

For his information, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>



Police  Week programmes will continue and,  in  fact,

this  year we will have another Police Week in  June.

In  fact, the Police Week programme and the fostering

of  good  relationship between  the  police  and  the

public  have resulted in some success. There are  now

more  civic-conscious members of the  public  ringing

999   to  give  information  to  the  police  on  the

incidence of crime, and some have even gone so far as

to  aid victims of crime. We are also receiving  more

information from the public to help the police in the

detection and arrest of criminals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the programme for this year's Police Week,

there  is an arrangement for a harbour tour and party

for  the  under-privileged children,  inter-community

and inter-school sports, and band displays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> And dinner.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> There is no dinner. I do not

think it is necessary to have dinners. The Member for

Sembawang has suggested that the Police Inspectors in

the various divisions should socialise with community

leaders  and  MPs  in the various constituencies.  In

fact,  there  has  been a standing order  to  all  OC

Divisions   that   whenever   police   officers   are

transferred to a certain division they should contact

the MP and get to know him and the community leaders.

Sometimes  they  also attend certain  functions.  For

instance,  when  there  is a campaign  against  crime

police  officers are invited by the community leaders

to  go to the community centres to give talks and  so

on.  That is the way they socialise and get  to  know

community   leaders  and  MPs  better.   Of   course,

sometimes they are invited to dinners, but I  do  not

think  they  should be encouraged to  go  to  dinners

otherwise  they  will  not  be  able  to  keep  their

waistline trim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like  the police officers to attend  to  their

work and not to take part in dinners.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand

that,  but  maybe I have been thinking that  with  so

many community centres in Sembawang I often see on TV

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>



his community centres hold quite a lot of dinners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has brought up the point

about difficulty in contacting a Police Inspector  in

a  police  station. He said that the person concerned

was  asked to wait for the Police Inspector, and that

later on he was told that he could file his complaint

to  any police officer other than a Police Inspector.

May I say that Police Inspectors are not supposed  to

stay  in  the police station all the time.  A  Police

Inspector has got work to do and much of his work  is

done outside the police station. If any member of the

public  were to go and make a complaint,  it  is  not

necessary  for  him to see the Inspector.  There  are

other  senior officers like the sergeant to  whom  he

can  make a complaint. In fact, members of the public

are  welcome  to  go to the police station  and  make

complaints. Therefore, I do not think it is necessary

to  set  up  a  complaints  bureau  in  every  police

division.  We have already got the Central Complaints

Bureau.  I think quite a number of complaints against

police officers are sometimes channelled through  the

Central  Complaints  Bureau. It  is,  therefore,  not

necessary  for  the Ministry of Home Affairs  or  the

Police  Department to set up a complaints  bureau  in

the  various police divisions because it will be just

a   waste  of  manpower  and  a  duplication  of  the

facilities which already exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has said that there are not

sufficient patrol cars on the road. He mentioned  the

case  where  it  took more than half an  hour  for  a

patrol  car to arrive at the scene when he telephoned

for  one.  The  answer  to  that  is  that  with  the

implementation of the team policing scheme in  1976

each  Land Division has four to five cars on the road

at  any  one  time. Prior to this, each Division  had

only  two  to three cars on the road per  shift.  The

Land  Division  patrol  network  is  supplemented  by

patrol  cars from the Radio Division which patrol  25

centres  over  the  Republic and  augmented  by  foot

patrols  comprising the Police National  Service  and

the CSF. Patrol cars take action on service calls  as

well   as  perform  crime  prevention  and  detection

duties.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average response time to patrol cars from the

Radio  Division is between 10 to 15 minutes. However,

occasionally    too   many   calls    are    received

simultaneously  and  at close intervals.  Under  such

circumstances  cases  are attended  to  in  order  of

priority.  Therefore, cases of lesser importance  and

urgency will have to wait until patrol cars could  be

spared from more urgent duties. Delays in arrival  at

the  scene are at times attributable to traffic  jams

owing  to the vast increase in vehicular traffic  and

the  difficulty  in  locating  the  site  because  of

incorrect  information given by the person requesting

for assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the present patrol strength is considered

adequate to meet the public needs. However, the fleet

and  response time to calls are closely monitored and

changes will be made in accordance with demands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member was complaining about the Traffic Police

booking  drivers at random. Let me say that  they  do

book  drivers  at  random. This is called  "selective

enforcement".  Let  me  explain  what  is  meant   by

selective  enforcement. Selective  enforcement  means

that  they watch the motorists or drivers and if they

see  that  they have committed an offence, they  will

book the person. So it may appear to be at random. On

the  other hand, we see the public urging that  there

should  be  more stricter enforcement of drivers  who

are  erring. But it is rather odd that the Member for

Sembawang has taken the opposite stand. It is  rather

odd  because  there  has been too many  accidents  in

Singapore  and a lot of deaths, killing  and  maiming

going on, on the roads.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

on  a  point of clarification. I did not say that  we

should not book drivers who speed. However, we should

not book those who do not speed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> There are many types of traffic

offences. Speeding is only one of them. These drivers

may not be speeding but they may be committing one of

a  host  of  traffic offences. They  should  also  be

booked, for instance, for recklessly overtaking, road



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>



hogging, not giving way to traffic, and so on and  so

forth. I believe the Member for Katong who sits  near

the  Member  for  Sembawang knows  more  about  these

things.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Hear, hear.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Perhaps he can inform the Member

for  Sembawang  all  about the intricacies  of  these

things.  The  Member said that he was a bit  confused

about the white lines. It is a bit strange that  some

of  these  white  lines  should  puzzle  him  because

somebody  has told him that they symbolise stones.  I

myself  am  a bit surprised and puzzled  by  what  he

means. So I am not in a position to comment or  reply

to  him. Perhaps he could ask the person who told him

about it to clarify, so that he can write me a letter

and  if it is intelligible, then I will certainly  do

my  best to explain what these white lines, which are

supposed to represent stones, mean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to police and public relationship. Mr

Speaker, Sir, the development or promotion of  police

and  public relationship is not only confined to  the

Police Week. It is a continuous and sustained matter.

a  continuous matter which must be sustained all  the

year round. As far as the Ministry of Home Affairs is

concerned,   the  police  headquarters   has   issued

specific  directives  and  instructions  that  police

officers  must show a good example. They have  to  be

courteous  and  considerate  when  dealing  with  the

public   at  all  times.  I  believe  there   is   an

improvement to-date although there may be some  cases

where these strict directives have not been followed.

But  if  there  are  cases  of  abuse  of  power  and

discourtesy,  any MP or member of the  public  is  at

liberty  to  write in and action will  be  taken.  In

fact, they should be encouraged to do so. It is  only

when  they  write in that we get the  feed-back, and

action can be taken and the position improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to the Member for Katong about Project

Libra. I am glad that he has highlighted this and  he

has,  in  fact, made an ardent appeal for support  to

this  worthwhile  project of social  service  to  our

youths.  The Project Libra has been launched  in  the

Joo Chiat Police Division with the cooperation of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>



the  Member  for Katong and other MPs. If  it  proves

successful, it will be launched in other divisions as

well.  The  comments of the Member for Katong  should

certainly give an encouragement to those officers who

are now engaged in this Project Libra.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to his suggestion that if we are to

establish  neighbourhood committees  in  the  various

districts we should consult the MPs and the Citizens'

Consultative Committee, I assure him that  that  will

be  done, because it is only by consulting the MP and

the  CCC  in the area can any project in the  various

constituencies get going.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Alexandra):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with

your kind permission can I just ask the Hon. Minister

one question?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems to me

that  lately people who call 999 to make  reports  of

crime  have been asked to identify themselves.  I  am

aware that previously instructions have been given to

the telephone operators at HQ not to insist on asking

the  identity  of  the caller. But  it  appears  that

nowadays they do ask for the caller's identity.  Many

members  of  the public have been put  off  by  this.

Could not the Hon. Minister therefore insist that the

identity of the caller be not asked?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, there is a rationale why the

caller  should identify himself or herself. First  of

all,  as  the  Member for Sembawang has  brought  up,

sometimes  when he calls for police  help  or  for  a

police patrol car there is a delay, it is because  at

the  time when he called there were so many calls for

patrol cars and police help. And so he has to wait  a

longer  time. One of the reasons why a caller  should

identify  himself is that we have to know whether  it

is  a  genuine call and not somebody just ringing  up

for fun.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that the caller not only has to

identify  himself but also to tell where  he  can  be

located,  so  that  it is easier for  the  police  to

locate the scene of the crime or incident.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I have two

more  questions to ask the Minister. Firstly, he  did

not  answer  my  question relating to  the  complaint

against  speeding  of  Mobile  Squad  members.   They

perform speeding stunts on the road. Who is there  to

complain against such behaviour? If there is no  such

complaint, how is the Police Department going to take

action  to  stop or to prevent members of the  Mobile

Squad from speeding and performing stunts before  the

public? That is the first point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that the Minister does not seem

to be sure about the white lines drawn on the side of

the  road. This is rather strange. Since the Minister

does  not seem to know the traffic signs made by  his

own Ministry, then it is very difficult for people to

know  what they mean. Can the Minister explain to  us

what is the meaning of this particular road sign?  In

the  Alexandra  area, we can see  these  white  lines

drawn at the side of the road.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, it is not that I do not know

or  cannot  identify traffic signs. What I meant  was

that I could not identify the traffic sign the Member

for Sembawang was trying to tell me about because  he

himself said that he is a bit confused and that it is

very  funny.  That is the reason why I cannot  answer

him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, it is not a

traffic sign. I can draw on a piece of paper to  show

the Minister what kind of lines I am referring to.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is a waste of time actually. Mr

Phey.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are happy to

hear from the Minister for Home Affairs that there is

a  standing  instruction to the effect that  any  new

officer-in-charge   of  any  police   station,   when

transferred to a new constituency, should have closer

relations  with  the  CCC and the community  leaders.

Perhaps  he may be interested to know that as regards

the  previous OC of Kandang Kerbau Police Station,  I

do  not think he has ever visited my constituency  to

introduce himself. But I must compliment the new OC.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>



Mr  Ng Leng Hua, who came to our community centre and

met  the  community leaders and had a good discussion

and understood each other.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, in response to the Member

for  Boon  Teck, there is such a standing instruction

that all OCs have to contact the MPs and CCCs because

it  will  be foolish if they do not do so as it  will

help them to discharge one of their duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the white lines, we do not want to waste

the  time  of  the  whole House. After  this  debate,

perhaps the Member for Sembawang can show me the sign

and I will give him a satisfactory explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to speeding by traffic cops and

performing  stunts,  the Member  asked,  "Who  is  to

report them?" The Member for Sembawang or any of  his

constituents  can  report  them.  [Interruption]  The

Member  does not know because he has not seen it.  So

he  is  spreading rumours, is he not? He  should  not

spread rumours. If someone told him about it, then he

should get the facts and make a report. On the  other

hand,  some of these traffic cops on motorcycles  may

be  speeding  in pursuit of offending  motorists.  If

they do so, then they are doing their duty.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just one small

point  of  clarification. It is a  follow-up  on  the

point  made by the Member for Boon Teck.  I  do  know

there  is  a standing instruction for the new  OC  to

contact MPs and CCCs as soon as he gets appointed  to

an  area. But from my own experience, beyond that the

OC never makes any effort to try to follow-up once in

a while to see whether there is anything that need to

be  discussed. The contact just stops  there  at  the

point of his assignment to that post. That is all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I say that these

contacts should be reciprocal. So it depends  on  the

particular  constituency and particular personalities

involved.  The  OC is under standing  instruction  to

contact the MP. It is also for the MP and the CCC  to

receive him and reciprocate. So it is a two-way



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>



communication.  I do not know of the particular  case

which the Member for Jalan Kayu has mentioned. To  me

it will be foolish on the part of the OC not to do so

because  it will make his job much easier.  In  fact,

police   work  is  not  just  enforcement.  Even   on

enforcement, he needs the cooperation of  the  public

to  get  the  information  to  detect  and  apprehend

criminals.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I do agree that it ought to

be  a two-way communication. As it is, it is not two-way  and  I  am quite sure that there is no  lack  of

attempt  or effort on the part of the MPs to  try  to

establish this two-way communication. Time and  again

I  have written to the OC, but time and again I  have

never received any replies from him. So we never know

whether  the  matter  has been  attended  to  or  not

attended to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, if the Member were to write

to  me  on  a  specific case. I will  deal  with  the

matter.  But I am sure that as far as Katong and  Joo

Chiat  are concerned, they are doing fine.  They  are

cooperating on the Project Libra.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Other projects also.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Phey, are you going to repeat what you have said?



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> No, Sir, just to substantiate what

I said just now.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Repeating, is it not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Not repeating, Sir,I just want to

substantiate.  There  is contact.  All  MPs  normally

invite  the  OC  of every station to attend  the  CCC

meetings. On our part, I think it is not fair to  say

that  the MP has not tried to contact the OC to  have

this rapport.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your

indulgence I like to follow up a bit further. On  the

odd  occasion, I did write to the Minister  concerned

and  what  I  got was a little yellow card  from  his

Permanent Secretary acknowledging receipt.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, can the Member tell me when

was that? I cannot remember. Was it years ago?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I think I will collect a few

cards and send them over to the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think

it  is true. I meet the Member here in Parliament. He

has not raised the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> After all that, Sir, I beg leave to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead BOA 1101*. (*The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs

Yeo Choo Kok and Ahmad Haleem ).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Minister announced recently the

proposed  new and more vigorous measures to cut  down

what  he called the carnage that is going on  on  our

roads.  I  applauded. I felt at  last  we  are  going

somewhere   in   instilling  greater   courtesy   and

consideration  among  road users.  Better  late  than

never.  I  do not know whether it is because  of  the

tardiness of such action or because the Minister  has

promised a comprehensive and systematic treatment  of

the  problem of introducing more care and  discipline

on  the roads that it will take the next three  years

to  achieve  all  this. But since  the  Minister  has

spoken about a series of measures and has in his mind

a  programme, he may be in a position at the  present

moment  to  give  us  some more  details  of  such  a

programme starting perhaps with a rundown (forgive me

for  using  this  term, Sir) on  the  result  whether

successful  or  otherwise, of  the  series  of  mini

campaigns  that  the traffic police  commenced  since

October last year. It would seem that what is crucial

to  the  success  of  the  Minister's  plans  is  the

capacity  of  the  police in terms  of  manpower  and

equipment  to take adequate enforcement measures.  In

all the times that I have almost ritually brought  up

this subject in the House up to the present moment, I

have not noticed that there has been such adequacy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Yeo Choo Kok is not here. Mr Ahmad

Haleem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, foreign

visitors have asked me whether our traffic rules  are

such that we ask our drivers to keep to the centre of

the  road. Obviously I have to tell them that traffic

should  not keep to the centre of the road  but  they

have  to keep left. At the moment, all we have to  do

is to take a short drive and we can locate perhaps 10

to  20 offending drivers keeping to the centre of the

road.  Let me take Members on a hypothetical  journey

of   a   person  leaving  his  office  to   keep   an

appointment. He goes on the road and the first  thing

he  comes across is the slow driver who is keeping to

the  centre of the road, on the off-side lane. If  he

overtakes on the left he is committing an offence and

it is dangerous.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> No offence.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Carry on with what you want to say, Mr

Ahmad Haleem. Do not argue with other Members.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, if he overtakes on the left,

it is dangerous. He could knock down a cyclist. So he

must overtake on the right because our law is to keep

left.  So  he  must  overtake on the  right.  But  he

cannot. He is getting angry, so he overtakes  on  the

left. He goes along the road and he comes across  two

cars driving abreast and blocking the road. Both were

driving  below the speed limit. Again he  horned  and

flashed his lights. Neither of the drivers gives way.

He  gets very angry. Finally one decided to move off.

So  he  overtakes. This goes on and he is  confronted

with four or five more different offences. It reaches

a  stage  when  he gets frustrated. He  comes  across

another offence. This time he just overtakes  on  the

left  and there is a motorcyclist. There is a  "bang"

and he has met with an accident. The poor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>



motorcyclist  is  killed. He might lose  his  driving

licence  or  even go to jail. The offenders  are  the

slow  drivers who drive in the right-hand lane. Right

now  we  have campaigns such as, "Don't Road Hog"  or

"Keep in lane", etc. The number of offenders does not

seem to decrease,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Senior Minister of State for

Communications  said that the Points  Demerit  System

might  be  extended to road hoggers or the number  of

points  might  be increased. I welcome this  move.  I

think it is a good idea. For those who have lived  in

Singapore  all their lives and go overseas  for  only

short  periods, cannot see this. But  for  those  who

have  lived  overseas for some  time  and  have  been

driving there, the moment they come back to Singapore

they  will know that the road condition is  good  and

the  traffic condition is much better than any of the

major  cities  around us. This particular  offence  - drivers  not  keeping to the left -  makes  our  road

condition really bad. If we can get them to  keep  to

the  left, there  will be no offence.  There  is  no

problem if they drive in the centre lane or the  off-side  lane of the road if there is no traffic  behind

them.  But  if there is a car coming up, they  should

keep  to  the  left  and let that car  overtake  them

because  after overtaking the car can get on its  way

and  its  travelling time is lessened. If  travelling

time is lessened, there will be less congestion,  and

with less congestion there is less frustration, and I

am  sure  there will be less accidents.  So  can  the

Minister   for  Home  Affairs  conduct   a   vigorous

campaign, hopefully within the next couple  of  years

so  that  we  can  rid  ourselves  of  motorists  who

insisted  on driving on the right hand lane  or  off-side lane.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter is the horn. I was in a taxi the

other  day. There was no traffic to the left  and  to

the  right, and no traffic either in front  or  back.

But about every nine seconds (after a while I started

timing it) the driver just pipped his horn. A lot  of

these  "neurotic horn pushers", I call them,  for  no

apparent reason keep on pipping the horn. The horn is

supposed to be used in an emergency. Right



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>



now  there  is  no  meaning to the use  of  the  horn

because  some  motorists just use it. If  both  these

problems  can  be  looked into and  perhaps  stronger

action  taken, I am sure we will have less congestion

on the road and we will have safer roads.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, in reply to the Member for

Katong, I am particularly gratified to note the  keen

interest  and  support  he  has  manifested  for  the

programme of introducing more care and discipline  on

our  roads. This is because the battle to bring about

more  care,  courtesy and discipline  and  to  reduce

carnage on our roads is a long and arduous one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has brought up a point

about  keeping to the left, saying that there  should

be no road hogging, and so on and so forth. All these

faults are noted. In fact, these are the faults  that

have  prompted  the  Traffic Police  to  launch  this

campaign  that will start off in June. Let me  say  a

few  things  about  this campaign.  The  road  safety

campaign  is  to  be called "A Road Safety  for  You"

campaign.  During  the campaign the  motoring  public

will  be advised on the proper mode of driving, after

which   enforcement  action  will  be  taken  against

violators. The most successful formula in  the  anti-litter  campaign is that we start off  educating  the

public  with  total  community  involvement  in   the

campaign, and  after we have given due  warnings  we

follow  up with strict enforcement. I hope that  this

will   have  the  same  effect.  When  I  say  "total

community  involvement",  it  will  not  only   cover

motorists but also pedestrians. School children  will

be largely involved in this campaign since instilling

of  good habit on anything, whether it be road safety

or otherwise, must start with the young. As you know,

Mr Speaker, Sir, the school going population consists

of one-quarter of our population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a prelude to this nation-wide safety campaign,

the   Traffic  Police  launched  a  series  of   mini

campaigns  on  the common motoring faults.  This  has

already  started since November last year,  and  they

are "Keep in lane", "Don't road hog" and "Give



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>



way".  The current campaign now going on is "Overtake

safely".  This  will be followed  by  a  campaign  on

turning  traffic.  The underlying  rationale  of  all

these  campaigns is that there should be more  safety

and courtesy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about pedestrians? At the moment a good number

of   pedestrian  crossings  have  been  provided  for

pedestrians  but  many fail to use them.  Because  of

this,  the Pedestrian Crossing Rules, 1977,  will  be

introduced  to require pedestrians to use  them.  The

number  of  pedestrian crossing  facilities  will  be

increased, particularly along arterial highways.  Two

main features of this proposed law are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Any pedestrian who is within 50 metres on either

side of a pedestrian crossing is required to make use

of  such  pedestrian  crossing  for  the  purpose  of

crossing the road;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Every motorist is required to give way to

pedestrians at established pedestrian crossings.  (In

other  words, we  have to be fair not  only  to  the

motorists  but  also to the pedestrians.)  Under  the

proposed law, offences by pedestrians include:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) crossing the road other than at an established

crossing  when the pedestrian is within 50 metres  of

such a crossing;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) crossing other than to the parallel flow of

vehicular traffic when using established crossings at

signalised intersections;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) crossing when the red man in the signalised

traffic sign is illuminated; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) stand, sit, squat, loiter or walk on the roadway

in  such  a  manner  or  in such  a  position  as  to

interfere with the lawful movement of traffic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to offences by motorists, they include:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) failure to give way to pedestrians at any

crossing   when  turning  his  vehicle  at   a   road

intersection;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) failing to proceed at such speed as will enable

him to stop his vehicle when approaching a pedestrian

crossing;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) failure to give way to pedestrians at pedestrian

crossings where the traffic is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>



controlled  by a police officer or by light  signals,

for example, at zebra crossings;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) failure to give way to pedestrians crossing at

road  intersections where traffic  is  controlled  by

light signal or police officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pedestrian Crossing Rules, 1977, will come into

force  after the nation-wide road safety campaign  in

June.  The penalties for any contravention  of  these

rules  are  prescribed under section 82 of  the  Road

Traffic  Act (Chapter 92); in the case of  the  first

offence,  to  a  fine  not  exceeding  $1,000  or  to

imprisonment  for a term not exceeding three  months;

and  in  the case of a second and subsequent offence,

to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for

a  term not exceeding six months. These are penalties

against   motorists,   Sir,  not   pedestrians.   For

pedestrians the fines will be very much lower.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah mentioned about a taxi

driver  who was horning all the way. May I  tell  him

that  it is an offence to horn unnecessarily. If only

he  had  taken  down the number of the  taxi  and  is

prepared  to  give a statement and bear witness,  the

driver will be prosecuted. Unfortunately, he has  not

done so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter about keeping to the left is

covered by lane discipline.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, in the Minister's reference to

"total  involvement", I hope he will also be able  to

secure the cooperation of Government departments  and

statutory  boards  including, of course,  the  Police

which have lots of vehicles on the road and see  that

their drivers obey the Highway Code.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I can assure the Member for

Katong that that will be done. In fact, this campaign

is  not  only  a police campaign, but it  will  be  a

nation-wide one, involving many other departments and

Ministries as well. We will not hesitate to book  any

driver  of  a  Government vehicle  if  he  commits  a

traffic offence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin (Bedok):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead CIA 1101*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr

Ahmad Haleem).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I appreciate the good work that is being

done  by the Drug Rehabilitation Centre in trying  to

rehabilitate  our  drug  addicts,  I  would  like  to

examine  the quality of our rehabilitation programmes

for  drug addicts more closely. It is well known that

the  best rehabilitation programmes for drug  addicts

in  Western countries fall between 5 and 10%  of  all

those who enter such programmes. In Singapore we have

introduced the compulsory aftercare programmes  since

August  of last year to make aftercare mandatory  for

two  years  upon release from the Drug Rehabilitation

Centre.  This is a praiseworthy move to increase  the

efficacy  and efficiency of rehabilitation programmes

in our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many people believe that the failure rate of

all  this effort has been very high. What I  want  to

know  is, has the cold turkey treatment been all that

effective?  It  would remove physical  dependence  on

drugs,  yes,  but  could it remove the  psychological

dependence?   Relapse  rates  appear  to   be   high,

indicating  the poor success of whatever effort  that

has been put in so far. Would the Minister state what

programmes,  if  any, are being put  into  action  or

planned to reduce the high relapse rate?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Home Affairs is spending large sums

of  money on rehabilitating drug addicts at the  Drug

Rehabilitation Centre and I understand  the  Ministry

of  Defence  has  its  own  rehabilitation  programme

while,  at  the level of school assemblies, volunteer

speakers  are eloquently persuading youths  to  avoid

the  dangerous  path of drug abuse.  Sir,  we  should

encourage  groups  like the Singapore  Anti-Narcotics

Association (SANA) to embark on education  programmes

for  the young before they are exposed to drug abuse.

In this respect. Sir, the Ministries of Home Affairs,

Social   Affairs,  Education  and  Defence  and   the

People's Association through its various youth groups

have a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>



responsibility  in  leading  and  guiding   voluntary

effort in this war against drug abuse.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the pressing need to contain and conquer

drug  abuse,  the  battle has to be fought  from  all

fronts.  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Minister   the

following questions:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Sometime last year, Sir, several inmates of the

Drug Rehabilitation Centre managed to do all kinds of

things at the Centre and culminated their misdeed  by

escaping  from  the  Centre.  What  is  the  security

position now? Has any post-mortem study been made  on

why  these  inmates  had tried  to  escape  and  then

voluntarily  returned to the Centre? The House  would

be interested to know if any steps have been taken to

improve   the  conditions  and  treatment  of   these

inmates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) In terms of consultation, exchange of

professional  expertise  and  the  use  of  voluntary

workers,  what is the Centre actually doing in  these

areas?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) What are the main problems faced by addicts

when they are released from the Centre?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) What follow-up action is taken to guide such

persons after their release?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) What is the actual extent of the Centre's

contribution towards the solution of the drug problem

in the Republic?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) Are there plans to shift the present Centre

somewhere   else  in  a  better  and  more  conducive

environment  for  such  rehabilitation  work  to   be

carried out?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) There was a nation-wide and anti-drug abuse

campaign  last year organised by the NADAC  76.  What

was  the  follow-up programme carried out immediately

after the successful campaign or has the effort  been

left to die a natural death?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(viii) To what extent have the recommendations put

up by the NADAC 76 been implemented?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ix) Would the Minister enlighten the House on the

progress  of  the work of the Special Committee  that

was set up to look into the problems of drug abuse in

the Republic?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the answers to all these questions would be of

great interest and concern to all of us in this House

as well as those outside -    like parents, teachers,

social workers, everyone for that matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, most of what need to be said

has  been  said.  I  only want  to  ask  one  further

question.  Could  the Hon. Minister give  the  racial

composition, by percentage and in absolute terms,  of

drug  addicts  in Singapore? The reason  I  ask  this

question is that I have spoken to several parents and

they seem to pass the buck. They either say that drug

addicts  are not from their community or  from  their

racial  group. If this can be broken down  by  racial

composition.  I  think it might help  to  avoid  this

"passing the buck".



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I seek your indulgence.

The  Member  for  Bedok  has moved  an  amendment  to

subhead  CIA 1101. May I ask if he is going to  speak

again  on  subhead  FAA  1101, Amendment  (7)*  which

stands in his name?



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendment standing in the names of Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin and Dr Ong Leong Boon reads as follows:

<br>(7) That the sum to be allocated for Head V be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead FAA 1101.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in that case can

the Member be permitted to speak on his amendment (7)

now, as subhead FAA 1101 deals with the same subject?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes. Haji Sha'ari.



<br><br><!-- Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin:</b> Sir, once again I would like

to  battle  against drug abuse. This is  because  the

problem  has  assumed such proportions  that  it  has

become  a national concern. The Deputy Prime Minister

only  two days ago in replying to a query by a Member

informed the House that there were about 700 cases of

drug  abuse  amongst the national servicemen  in  the

SAF, which is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>



about  1%. Let it remain a national concern, and  let

it  not  become a matter of national proportion.  The

latter  would  be  a calamity if  it  is  allowed  to

materialise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the latest arrest figures issued by the Central

Narcotics  Bureau, two trends stand out boldly:  One,

that  more and more of those between the ages  of  15

and  35 are abusing drugs and, two, more of those  in

this  age group are abusing heroin. The total  number

of  persons arrested has also gone up: from 2,858  in

1971  to  6,556 in 1976, a rise of more than two-fold

in numbers alone. What about the unknown addicts? How

many are there?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: what other efforts and approaches

are being made by the CNB, besides making arrests  of

addicts  and  abusers and sending them  to  the  Drug

Rehabilitation  Centre  at  Telok  Paku?  While  this

points   to   the   increased   efficiency   of   law

enforcement, I have certain observations to  make  in

regard to the policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the `cure', although there are real doubts

about this too. But what about the `prevention'? Sir,

I  am  a  firm believer in adages, and certainly  the

most  famous  of these is "Prevention is better  than

Cure".  Is  the island-wide anti-drug abuse  campaign

reportedly   planned   for  next   month   code-named

Operation   Ferret  designed  to  be  `curative'   or

`preventive'   in  function?  From  what   has   been

published,  it  appears to be more  attempted  `cure'

than  `prevention'. It should lay equal  emphasis  on

both aspects, at least.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, drug abuse is spreading. For the sake of

the  majority of our youths who are struggling to  do

the  right  things  in life and who  come  under  the

influence of drug-prone youths, we must have a strong

and  vigorous on-going anti-drug prevention  campaign

or  programme, not only at the level of  schools  and

youth organizations, but at the community centre  and

neighbourhood levels, in order to educate parents and

community



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>



leaders who are in charge of guiding our youth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is disturbing is the feeling in some quarters

that  the  efforts  mounted by  the  Singapore  Anti-Narcotics Association to take anti-drug education  in

schools  are  being  nullified by  the  inconceivable

attitudes  and thinking of some Ministry of Education

officials. If there is any truth in this,  it  is  my

hope  that the Minister who is also the Minister  for

Education would take immediate steps to look into the

matter, It is in the schools that we can prevent  the

beginnings of drug abuse. It is with the schools that

we  can  inculcate in the young the sense of personal

well-being  by  avoiding drugs. It is in  the  school

that will find most ready reception. It would be most

unfortunate  if  it  was  true  that  some   Ministry

officials are trying to rock the boat that prevents a

"prevention" campaign being carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the dangers of drug abuse are very real. There

are  no doubts about this. Every ounce of effort must

be  geared  towards eradication of  this  scourge  in

society. What we do today in this respect will have a

profound effect on the quality of a society that  our

children will have tomorrow. In fact, Sir, if I could

suggest  to  the  Minister whether he could  consider

"Prevention through education" to be the  panacea  of

the drug-abuse field. Where law enforcement fails  to

stamp the supply of illegal drugs, and rehabilitation

efforts  have  so far failed to reclaim many  abusers

why  not  pour  the  money that we collect  from  the

seizure  of smuggling heroin and other drugs  by  the

Customs into education to stop the problem before  it

begins. Perhaps we could make drug education as  part

of  the  school curriculum in the teaching of Civics.

Of  course, this will require a very careful in-depth

study  and  planning  before  it  is  introduced  and

implemented.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong is not here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I first deal with drug

rehabilitation? Since the beginning of 1976 a tougher

programme of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>



rehabilitation was introduced. Cold turkey  treatment

was introduced and addicts at the Drug Rehabilitation

Centre  must  undergo  this  treatment  after   being

certified  fit  by a medical doctor.  No  replacement

therapy  is allowed. It is hoped that the rigours  of

cold  turkey  treatment will give them an  experience

which  they  will not forget quickly. However,  after

the cold turkey treatment, which normally takes about

two  weeks or so, addicts are given regular  physical

drills and exercises to instil personal discipline in

them.  This is necessary because most of the  addicts

are  weak  in character and lack personal discipline,

or  even if they had personal discipline before  they

would  have  lost it. Therefore, work as  a  form  of

rehabilitation  has been introduced with  a  view  to

inculcating  skill  and work discipline  among  them.

They  now have to do eight hours of work a day.  This

will  help  them after they have come  out  from  the

Rehabilitation Centre to lead a normal life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The addicts are being counselled by probation and

aftercare  officers  while  they  are  in  the   Drug

Rehabilitation  Centre. This is to establish  rapport

between the officers and these inmates early so  that

compulsory  after-care after their release  from  the

Centre   will  have  the  best  chance  of   success.

Recidivism among drug addicts before the introduction

of  compulsory  after-care in August 1976  was  high,

about 70%. With the introduction of compulsory after-care,  this  level of recidivism should  be  reduced.

However, Sir, it is too early to assess the impact of

compulsory after-care. The situation is being closely

monitored.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The application of cold turkey treatment, a stricter

code  of  discipline, work therapy,  counselling  and

after-care, should motivate addicts to give up  drugs

after  their  release  from the  Drug  Rehabilitation

Centre. Those who do not change will have to be  sent

back  to  the  Centre and put through a  tougher  and

longer  rehabilitation programme.  The  treatment  of

rehabilitation  at  the Centre was  instituted  after

consultation with experts from the Ministry of Health

and  the  Probation  and After-Care  Service  of  the

Ministry of Social Affairs. A committee has also been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>



formed   comprising  representatives   from   various

departments and disciplines to look into the  matter.

Although  no  foreign experts were sought,  treatment

programmes in Japan, Hong Kong and the United  States

and  a number of Western countries were studied,  but

they have to be modified to suit our needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bedok asked about the escape of 13

male  inmates from the Rehabilitation Centre at Telok

Paku  in  August  1976. Since then  security  at  the

Centre has been strengthened. Three watch towers have

been  built to enhance surveillance, a dog and mobile

patrol  has  been  introduced to  deter  attempts  to

escape.  But, Mr Speaker, Sir, what I would  like  to

stress,  which has not been recognised, is that  when

the  13  inmates  escaped from the Centre  they  were

undergoing  cold turkey treatment at  that  time.  In

other words, they had just been admitted and, as  you

know, Mr Speaker, Sir, when they are undergoing  cold

turkey  treatment that is the very  time  when  their

craving  for drugs is at its height. For cold  turkey

treatment,  we  now have specially constructed  rooms

with  padded  walls and, of course, the security  has

been enhanced.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the National Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign

organised by the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association

(SANA), what is called NADAC 1976 as referred  to  by

the Member for Bedok, we regard it as very useful  in

creating    public   awareness   and    disseminating

information on the dangers of drug taking. After  the

campaign  SANA submitted a report to my Ministry  and

made  certain  recommendations on how to  tackle  the

drug  problem.  Most of the measures  recommended  by

SANA  were, in fact, already implemented. Others have

been  sent  to  the  relevant  Ministries  for  their

consideration. Now, the Member for Bedok has referred

to  the  special committee on drug abuse among youths

which  was  appointed in April 1974.  This  committee

submitted  its  report in November 1976.  The  report

provides useful information on the characteristics of

drug abuse, young drug



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>



abusers   and   the   cause  of   drug   abuse.   The

recommendations  of  this  committee  are  now  being

studied and will be implemented if found practical.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Bedok has said that

he  believes  that "prevention through education"  is

the  panacea  to our problem of drug addiction.  Sir,

"prevention  through education" can  be  one  of  the

aspects  in  solving  the  drug  problem  but  it  is

certainly no panacea because the drug problem  is  so

complex  that there is no single panacea to the  drug

problem. In fact, it must be tackled from all  angles

and all fronts - prevention, cure and so on. That  is

being  done  and we are doing everything  within  our

power to do so. There cannot be any single panacea in

answer to the drug problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I now turn to the issue of drug

trafficking and how to contain addiction. This is  in

reply  to  the  Member for Bedok as well  as  to  the

Member  for  Anson  who have made certain  statements

earlier  on. Only heroin addiction, especially  among

the  young, has escalated during the last few  years.

The  pattern  of  increase in  drug  addiction  among

youths, as reported by the United Nations Commission

on  Narcotic  Drugs,  is  universal.  The  Government

realises the seriousness of the problem and  is  very

concerned  and, as I have said, it will do everything

in  its  power to combat it. The battle  against  the

drug  problem  will be fought on all fronts  and,  in

particular, on two fronts; first, the elimination  of

supply  and,  secondly,  the curbing  of  demand  for

drugs.  To do this, there must be maximum cooperation

or  coordination amongst all the agencies involved so

that  there  will  not  be serious  bottlenecks,  and

manpower  will  be  used to the best  advantage.  Our

strategy, therefore,  is for the  Central  Narcotics

Bureau  to  concentrate on the  supply  side  of  the

problem.  That  is,  to  seek  out  and  arrest  drug

traffickers and pushers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the demand side, that is, the rounding up of

drug  addicts and rehabilitating them, the large pool

of  manpower  in the Special Constabulary,  Vigilante

Corps,  Drug Squad and the Divisional Police will  be

used.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>



As  I have announced earlier, this massive roundup of

drug  addicts,  code named "Operation  Ferret",  will

commence  in  April  of this year  when  a  new  drug

rehabilitation  centre will be ready  to  accommodate

another  800  addicts at a time.  "Operation  Ferret"

will  be  closely  monitored. After the  first  three

months  of  the  operation, we will be  in  a  better

position   to  estimate  the  population  of   heroin

addicts, the rate it is growing and the rate at which

addicts who have gone through the drug rehabilitation

centre relapse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A committee on the treatment and rehabilitation of

drug  addicts has been recently appointed to evaluate

and   make  recommendations  on  the  treatment   and

rehabilitation of addicts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all these measures we are hopeful that drug

addiction,  especially  among  the  young,  will   be

checked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to clarify the

misconception  on the part of the Member  for  Bedok,

"Operation Ferret" is also a prevention operation. It

is  not  only a cure because, as everybody knows, if

you  have a drug addict at large and he is not caught

and  put  in a rehabilitation centre, he is bound  to

infect  his other innocent friends. There will  be  a

multiplier  effect and you get more drug addicts.  In

that respect it is a prevention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Anson has suggested that exit

control   may   help  to  prevent   foreigners   from

trafficking   drugs  in  Singapore  in   that   their

overstaying  could be easily detected. I  agree  with

him that exit control may help but only to the extent

that  foreigners  seeking entry  into  Singapore  are

known  to be drug traffickers. In fact, even  without

exit control foreigners who have been involved in, or

who  are  suspected of, trafficking in drugs are  now

prohibited   from   entering  into  Singapore.   Even

foreigners  who  are  known  drug  addicts  are  also

prohibited  from  entering Singapore.  However,  exit

control  would not be of help if foreign  traffickers

are  not  known  to  our enforcement  agencies.  Drug

traffickers now operate in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>



small  groups of three to five persons, the  majority

of  whom  have  no  previous drug records  either  in

Singapore  or  elsewhere. Therefore, stringent  entry

control  could  not  affect  these  persons  who  are

unlikely  to  overstay their visits  once  they  have

completed their nefarious activities. In these  cases

careful  investigation and intelligent  gathering  by

the  enforcement  authorities are more  important  in

detecting  the  traffickers and  dealers.  These,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, are being set up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has asked me about the

racial composition of the number of addicts. That  is

a specific question. I have no figures of it here. If

he will write in, I will give him the exact figures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head V - (cont.)



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead DAA 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Immigration Department is one Government

office  that constantly meets people both  local  and

from   abroad.  Last  year  there  were  1.5  million

tourists passing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>



through  Singapore. Of course, many of  our  citizens

have  also  gone  abroad.  So  it  is  important  for

officers  in this department to be courteous  to  the

public. There has been a general improvement  in  the

work  of  the Immigration Department. However,  there

are  certain  shortcomings.  So  let  me  inform  the

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I have received many complaints from

members  of  the  public that  the  officers  at  the

counters  in  the  Immigration Department  are  quite

discourteous to members of the public.  They  do  not

properly  help  them  in  their  dealings  with   the

department.  Many  of them who have  business  to  go

there  are  dissatisfied and they  have  a  very  bad

impression  of  the  department.  Even  though   that

impression  is  created only by some members  of  the

staff,  it  will give a poor image to the  department

thus  reflecting on the Government of Singapore.  The

Minister concerned should look into it and take steps

to rectify this situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, at Woodlands checkpoint the officers in

charge  are not doing their duty properly. They  just

sit  inside  and  would  not  care  about  the  crowd

thronging outside. At peak hours they would  open  up

only  two  checkpoint  entrances  leaving  the  other

entrances  closed. There is usually a long  queue  of

vehicles waiting to go through, particularly at  this

checkpoint because many people who pass through  that

checkpoint  everyday are either coming  to  Singapore

from  Malaysia or going from Singapore  to  Malaysia.

The  Minister should get the officers there to  speed

up  their  work  and  to open more  traffic  channels

during  peak  hours at this checkpoint to  facilitate

traffic flow.



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would also like to ask the Minister

whether  he would be liberal in his consideration  of

applications  for  permanent  residence.  One  of  my

constituents  who  is  a  Singapore  citizen  has   a

Malaysian wife. They have been married for  over  ten

years and have two children born in Singapore. One of

them,  namely  the  husband,  is  a  store  assistant

earning about $600 per month, and he has been  paying

income tax every year in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>



Singapore. His monthly income is sufficient  for  him

to maintain his family. He has many times applied for

citizenship for his wife but has been rejected  every

time. His case deserves sympathetic consideration and

approval.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Are you on the right amendment, Mr

Teong? You are talking about citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> Not citizenship but permanent

residence, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to the

Member  for  Sembawang, may I take  his  first  point

about  providing courteous and efficient  service  to

members  of  the  public  by  Immigration  Department

officers? The Immigration Department is aware of  the

need  to provide such courteous and efficient service

to  members of the public at all times. Towards  this

end,  painstaking efforts have been made to inculcate

members of the staff, especially those serving at the

counters,   to   be   courteous  and   helpful.   All

Immigration staff upon recruitment undergo  a  period

of  full-time orientation with emphasis  on  courtesy

and  the correct attitude towards serving the public.

Subsequently,   refresher  courses   and   discussion

sessions  are  also organised for the  same  purpose.

Further, Mr Speaker, Sir, departmental circulars  are

regularly issued to staff to remind them of this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any complaint of discourtesy or rudeness from any

member of the public will be immediately investigated

and  if  established appropriate disciplinary  action

will  be  taken. In 1975, only three complaints  were

received  against  counter staff in  the  Immigration

Department. Two were found to be not true and in  the

third  case  the  officer was  warned.  In  1976, no

written complaint was received against counter staff.

However,  statistics are not kept on oral  complaints

as  these  are settled on the spot. Where  there  was

truth  in  the  verbal complaint,  action  was  taken

against the officer concerned. Perhaps the Member for

Sembawang should bring to my attention if he is aware

of any specific case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member's second question. He said, when

he passed through the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>



Woodlands  checkpoint, he saw that only two  channels

were  opened, and as a result there were long  queues

of cars needed to be checked. During the greater part

of the day, Sir, six or eight car lanes are opened to

handle  traffic  through  the  Woodlands  checkpoint.

Eight  car  lanes are maintained during  peak  hours.

However, between midnight and the early hours of  the

morning two car lanes are opened, i.e, after midnight

and  the  early hours of the morning. Sir, I  do  not

know  at  what  time  the Member  for  Sembawang  was

returning from Johore Bahru.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, allow me to

clarify?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Two channels were opened. Perhaps

the  Member  was  returning from Johore  Bahru  after

midnight.  I can quite understand his predicament  if

he was in a hurry to go back to his wife and family!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, statistics however show that during these hours

an average of 20 cars pass through the lane per hour.

Experience  shows that there is no  queuing  of  cars

during  this period. The hon. Member is assured  that

the  senior officers at the Woodlands checkpoint keep

a   constant  watch  of  the  traffic  situation  and

sufficient  car lanes are always provided for  speedy

clearance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's third question on applications by

Singapore  citizens  for  permanent  residence   (not

citizenship)  for their foreign wives are  considered

on  the  merits  of each case. Under the  Immigration

law,  the  foreign  wife of a  Singapore  citizen  is

eligible for consideration only if she has not at any

time  after the marriage been living separately  from

her husband for a continuous period of more than five

years.  Besides  income level there  are  also  other

guiding  factors such as the family size,  the  roots

and  whether the couple has a genuine desire to  make

Singapore their permanent home. I should stress  that

the  grant  of the status of permanent residence,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, is a very important matter and  cannot

be taken too lightly because it is the first step to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>



application for citizenship. I can assure the  Member

for  Sembawang that each application by  a  Singapore

citizen for permanent residence for his foreign  wife

will receive careful consideration by the Immigration

Department and the deserving cases will be approved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, for the

information  of the Minister, I was at the  Woodlands

checkpoint  at  6  o'clock in  the  evening,  not  at

midnight. It was at 6 p.m. during the peak hours when

there  was  heavy traffic and only two channels  were

opened,   not  eight  channels,  If  the   Minister's

information  is  eight channels, then  he  has  been

deceived.  Between  6  p.m. and  7  p.m., only  two

channels were opened. It is usually the case. Who  is

the  person  in charge of the checkpoint?  He  should

inform  the  Minister correctly of the truth  of  the

situation.  He should not give the Minister  a  wrong

picture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning permanent residence, the Minister has

said that to qualify for consideration, the wife of a

Singapore  citizen should have the minimum length  of

stay  after the marriage and also the monthly  income

should be sufficient to support the family and  other

factors.  Very soon I will be writing to the Minister

to inform him of this application so that he can take

the necessary action for a serious consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, on the last point, the

Member said that he will be writing to me about  this

case.  If he had written to me earlier, then he would

not  have wasted the time of the House. I would  have

given   him  a  satisfactory  explanation  for   that

particular case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that the Member has now clarified

that  he was passing through the Woodlands checkpoint

not after midnight but at 6 p.m. I do not know why he

appeared  so keen to clarify about the time.  In  any

case, if the Member for Sembawang were to give me the

particulars  of  this  specific  case  because  I  am

hearing  it for the first time, then I will cause  an

investigation to be made and I am sure I  shall  give

him a satisfactory answer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, before I

withdraw the amendment. I would like the Minister  to

listen to me further. I hope that he will notify  the

officers  concerned in the Immigration Department  of

what he has said here, that is, from now on they have

to  open  eight car lanes. Otherwise I will be  going

there  to  make an on-the-spot check to  see  whether

they have done so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn,



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead GAA 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Hon. Minister for Home Affairs has a

lot of time for me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder how the National Registration Office deals

with  the  issue  of  Singapore  identity  cards  for

persons  who have been granted Singapore citizenship.

Does  the  Registration Office co-ordinate  its  work

with  the Citizenship Office in the issue of identity

cards promptly?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a case where a Malaysian woman married to a

Singapore  citizen  successfully  acquired  Singapore

citizenship  last November. She was then  advised  by

the  Citizenship  Office to surrender  her  Malaysian

documents to the Malaysian High Commission  and  then

to  collect  the  Singapore Citizenship  Certificate.

Immediately   after  she  received  her   Citizenship

Certificate,   she   went  over   to   the   National

Registration Office to apply for a Singapore identity

card.  She was then given a temporary receipt at  the

National  Registration Office. And,  only  yesterday,

after  five  months have passed, did she receive  her

identity card. Why was there such a long delay?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, she was issued with a restricted

passport  granted  provisionally  for  three  months,

pending the issue of her Singapore identity card. The

three  months period has already expired and she  was

given a second extension of her restricted passport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, normally, the granting of citizenship takes a

long time. But it seems our National



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>



Registration Office makes it more difficult to get an

identity card.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister explain the reason for the delay in

the  issue  of  this identity card and  what  is  the

procedure?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, in reply to the Member for

Anson, before the National Registration Office issues

a  Singapore identity card to a person who  has  been

granted Singapore citizenship, the particulars in his

or  her  documents  have  to  be  verified  with  the

respective  foreign  mission in Singapore  to  ensure

that  there  was  no falsification. The  verification

requires   reference  to  the  issuing   authorities.

Therefore,  some delay in the issue of the  Singapore

identity card to her was unavoidable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the Member

that  it  is not a good practice to verify  documents

after  the  grant of citizenship. Since the beginning

of  this  month,  therefore, this practice  has  been

stopped.  A  person's particulars  are  now  verified

before he or she is granted citizenship. On obtaining

citizenship,  he  or she can now  be  issued  with  a

Singapore identity card immediately.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I have a

question  to  ask the Minister. In 1962 or  1963,  an

exercise  was  carried out to change  the  old  paper

identity cards to plastic laminated identity cards. I

think  the  exercise was carried out in 1966.  If  an

identity  card  was issued before  1948  and  if  the

holder  was  born  in Singapore as recorded  in  that

identity  card, then he was issued with  a  citizen's

pink  identity  card.  But I  have  received  certain

complaints   from   my   constituents   that    birth

certificate  numbers  are not recorded  on  the  pink

identity  cards. So when the children go  to  school,

the  teachers normally ask their parents  to  produce

their  birth certificates. But the certificates  were

lost  and could not be produced. Since 1948 the issue

of  identity cards recognise the proof of citizenship

as  recorded  in the old cards and we have  pink  new

plastic  laminated  identity  cards  as  evidence  of

citizenship  as  recorded.  So  why  do  our  schools

require the children to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>



produce    their   birth   certificates   or    birth

registration  numbers. I would like the  Minister  to

clarify whether pink identity cards are indicative of

citizens' identity cards.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the answer is quite simple.

It  is to double check. If the person was really born

in Singapore, the only way to check is from the birth

certificate.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Why should there

be the need to double check? It was already announced

in  Parliament that all those who hold laminated pink

identity  cards  are Singapore citizens.  Why  should

there be the need to double check?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sometime last week I think I have

answered  in  Parliament that when we carried  out  a

recheck  we found that certain card holders were  not

actually born in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> I beg leave to withdraw my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead HAA 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the granting of citizenship is not a

right  but  only a privilege. It is granted depending

on  the situation of the State, and the person who is

granted  will not be a national liability. Sir,  some

years  back citizenship was so easy to get  that  one

just had to go through a "turnstile" system to get  a

certificate.  In  1968 when the British  pullout  was

announced   we   were   very   strict   in   granting

citizenship.  Now I wonder what is the policy?  Could

the Minister explain? Is there any relaxation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many old people who have been living

here  for  many  decades. These  people  have  strong

family background and with children supporting  them.

They have applied for Singapore citizenship but their

applications have been pending for many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>



years.  I  have the case of an old lady who has  been

living  here since 1948. She owns properties and  her

children   were  all  born  in  Singapore   and   are

financially   strong.  This  lady  has  applied   for

citizenship  but her application has been  "dangling"

for  many  years. Why is there such a delay for  this

type  of a case? After all these people are not going

to  seek  employment. Their financial  background  is

also  sound.  So  why cannot early  consideration  be

given?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister use his good offices to deal with

such  cases favourably and expeditiously as they will

not be a national liability in the future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the Member for Anson has

again  brought  up  this point  - that  the  grant  of

citizenship is a privilege and not a right  and  that

the  main  basis of granting citizenship is that  the

applicant  will  be  a  national  asset  and  not   a

liability.  Sir, I agree with him entirely.  However,

the  Government policy on citizenship  as  enunciated

from   time   to  time  is  that  the  criteria   for

citizenship  are  always kept under constant  review,

but  there  is no basic change in the policy  itself.

Some  modifications have been made over the years  to

give  favourable consideration, for example,  to  the

only  non-citizen in the family and to  former  minor

citizens  who  have  failed  to  take  the  oath   of

allegiance. In addition the processing of citizenship

applications  has  been speeded up.  All  these  have

cumulatively  resulted in more persons being  granted

citizenship  last year. A total of 7,806 applications

were approved last year compared to 6,347 in 1975 and

only 3,989 in 1974.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to applications from people who have

been  living  in  Singapore for many years,  most  of

these    people   could   have   acquired   Singapore

citizenship years ago without any difficulty  because

in  those  days  granting  of  citizenship  was  much

easier.  But  these  people would rather  keep  their

option  open then, and as such elected to take  their

chances.  Sir, most of them are therefore responsible

for their own plight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson quoted the case of an old lady

with property and sound financial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>



support.  I cannot specifically comment on this  case

from  the  scanty facts he has given me,  However,  I

would  like  to  clear  the air again  regarding  the

question   why  some  old  people  are  not   granted

citizenship  even  when their children  are  in  good

financial position to support them. My answer is that

each  case  should be considered on  its  own  merit.

However, in  all cases where the children  say  that

they  are  in  a good financial position  to  support

their old parents, it is necessary to ascertain  that

the  children are not only able to support their aged

parents  but will continue to support them, and  that

the  applicant will not become a burden to the  State

in  future. For example, we must make sure  that  the

children  are not, in fact, making use of this  grant

of citizenship as a device to dump the old parents in

an  old  folks'  home, which usually  takes  in  only

citizens.  As  a matter of policy, applications  from

retired  persons  who  had made  economic  or  social

contributions  to  the economy are given  sympathetic

consideration provided they have strong family  roots

in  Singapore and are unlikely to become a  liability

to the State.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the old lady told me that

she  wanted  to  die in Singapore and  therefore  she

wanted to become a Singapore citizen. Anyway,  I  beg

leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lau Teik Soon (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head V be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead LAA 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in March 1974 this House passed the Martial

Arts Instruction Bill, 1974, and under section 32 of

the  Act  the Controller of the Martial Arts  Control

Unit (MACU) is empowered to investigate any report of

malpractices or irregular activities on the  part  of

martial  art  clubs. Sad to say.  Sir.  MACU  to-date

seems  to  be  a  dormant  department  because  their

officials   seem  to  be  unable  or   unwilling   to

investigate  and take necessary action  against  such

illegal martial art clubs. Let me elaborate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Act, only the controlling or national

organizations  of the various martial arts  have  the

authority  to  grade  students,  and  therefore,  any

grading  exercise conducted by any martial  art  club

would be illegal. However, Sir, there was the case of

an  illegal  grading exercise reported by a  national

organization  but  MACU did nothing  about  it.  This

happened  when  the  Singapore  Taekwondo  Federation

brought  to the attention of the MACU that a  martial

art  club,  viz, the American School Taekwondo  Club,

had   graded  their  students  without  MACU  or  the

Federation's   approval.  Sir,   MACU   ignored   the

complaint  on  the  ground that the  American  School

Taekwondo  Club  was  not  a  registered  club   and,

therefore,  nothing could be done. This is  just  one

example but there are other cases which received  the

same treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my view this is simply ridiculous. In the

first  place, under section 5 of the Act, any martial

art  club  which is not registered with  MACU  is  an

unlawful  association,  and  yet  MACU  which  is   a

department  in  the Ministry of Home  Affairs  states

that  it  can do nothing about it! Secondly, such  a

nonchalant  attitude by MACU will only encourage  the

existence of more illegal martial art clubs. Thirdly,

MACU  should be the department of final authority  as

far  as the control of martial arts is concerned, but

the officials are simply evading that responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Sir, in view of the Government's sports-for-all policy, I would think that MACU should assist in

facilitating the teaching of martial arts  as  widely

as  possible. Thus, I am surprised that MACU has  not

acted  against  those  martial art  clubs  which  are

registered  with  the Registrar  of  Business  Names.

Sports  should  not be a profit-making  venture  and,

therefore, business-oriented martial art clubs should

be registered with the Registrar of Societies and not

with the Registrar of Business Names.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy to note that for FY 77, for the

first time, there is provision for the employment  of

permanent staff to man the Martial Arts Control Unit.

This I hope will establish MACU as an effective unit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>



However,  may I suggest that to assist the Controller

of  MACU, particularly on aspects pertaining  to  the

martial  arts, that an advisory Committee of  Martial

Arts     Organizations    be    formed,    comprising

representatives from MACU, Singapore  Sports  Council

and  the national organizations. Such a committee can

work  immediately  on  defining  more  precisely  the

nature  of  various martial arts and  expediting  the

approval of applications from trainees and coaches.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I explain the position

to  the  Member  for Serangoon Gardens.  The  primary

purpose  of the Martial Arts Instruction  Act  is  to

provide   a   system  of  control  of   martial   art

associations, their instructors and trainees  and  to

ensure that those who learn the art are not likely to

abuse it. The control of martial art associations is.

therefore, achieved mainly through two measures:  (a)

licensing  of  martial  art  instructors   and,   (b)

screening  of  those who wish to learn martial  arts.

Within this broad framework, the Martial Arts Control

Unit  (MACU)  exercises  the  supervision  over   all

martial art bodies in the Republic with, I would like

to  emphasise, the active support and cooperation  of

the  Singapore  Sports Council. The Singapore  Sports

Council   is  consulted  on  every  application   for

registration   of  a  martial  art   association   or

instructor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since July 1976, field officers of MACU have been

visiting  martial art associations to  check  whether

the  provisions  of the Martial Arts Instruction  Act

and  the  regulations made thereunder  are  observed.

During  their visits the field officers  also  ensure

that   the   conditions   of  registration   of   the

instructors and trainees are complied with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens referred to

gradings  of  trainees. May I explain  that  MACU  is

concerned mainly with the background and character of

martial  art instructors and trainees and the purpose

for  which  the  trainees in  the  art  is  given  or

acquired. MACU itself does not have the expertise  to

evaluate the professional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>



competence  of  the  various  types  of  martial  art

instructors.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to prevent martial art instructors from

conducting  gradings at will and to  protect  martial

art  trainees from being exploited, no instructor  is

allowed  to  conduct any grading  without  the  prior

permission  of the Controller of Martial  Arts.  This

condition.  Mr Speaker, Sir, is stipulated  in  every

instructor's  certificate issued. Failure  to  comply

with  this condition is an offence punishable by fine

and/or imprisonment. Permission to conduct grading is

given  only  if the application is supported  by  the

Singapore Sports Council which in turn consults  with

the  Federation of Controlling Bodies of the  various

forms   of   martial  arts  and  they   review   such

applications. This practice, in actual  fact,  places

the  control  of  grading of trainees by  instructors

within the powers of the Singapore Sports Council  in

consultation  with  the  Federation  of   Controlling

Bodies.  MACU therefore merely acts as a  vehicle  in

the exercise of this control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the suggestion by the Member for

Serangoon Gardens about the formation of an  advisory

committee,  we  have already got  this  machinery  of

consultation with the Singapore Sports Council  which

in   turn  consults  the  Federation  of  Controlling

Bodies.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Sir, there have been cases of

martial art instructors who have been registered with

MACU  without  the  approval  of  the  Federation  of

Controlling Bodies in consultation with the Singapore

Sports Council. I shall personally bring these  cases

to his attention, and I hope he will consider them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of his explanation. I beg to withdraw my

amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head W -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head W be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AAA 1004*. (*The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs

P. Govindaswamy, Ho Kah Leong and Ch'ng Jit Koon).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision for this head of expenditure,

Ministry  of  Education, is a  very  substantial  sum

totalling   more  than  $470  million   for   various

educational objectives, as education is an  important

component of nation building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore education system places emphasis on

bilingual  education to meet the needs of the  multi-lingual  society and the needs of our  technical  and

industrial development. This emphasis and the  policy

are all very correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years the education system has attracted a

lot of attention and debate in this House. The debate

on  the  education system is aimed at  improving  the

system.   Now   in  order  to  promote  the   healthy

development of education, I would like to air  a  few

points  in  this  House for the  Minister  concerned.

Firstly,  will  he consider the introduction  of  the

full-day school system by stages? As far as  I  know,

there are many schools in Singapore, particularly the

aided  schools,  which  have empty  classrooms.  Such

schools  can well be converted into full-day  schools

which have many advantages. The full-day school  will

provide  more  time  for the students  to  learn  the

various subjects and to produce a better generation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to ask the Minister whether

he will consider setting up one or more commercial

schools for those who have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>



Secondary IV qualifications but are not qualified to enter Pre-U

classes. This year there are many Secondary IV

students and because of the 20-point limit for entry

into Pre-U classes, those with an aggregate of more

than 20 points will not be admitted. Every year a few

thousand students do not have the opportunity to gain

admission into the Pre-U classes. These students are

too young to enter the labour market. They are at

this stage about 16 years or so, and they have to

wait for two years before they can be drafted into

national service. So I would urge the Minister to

consider setting up more commercial schools to absorb

such students. At the present moment. Sir, the Adult

Education Board is running classes to absorb these

students. But the number of classes is too small for

the purpose. Furthermore, the Adult Education Board

is borrowing empty classrooms in certain schools

only. The number of classes is not enough to meet the

requirements of Secondary IV students. Commercial

schools run by private individuals are charging very

high fees. Poor families cannot afford the fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to ask the Minister whether he

is  prepared to relax the restriction on the entry of

students  from  other  countries, particularly  from

ASEAN  countries.  At the present  moment,  we  allow

children  of work permit holders to come to Singapore

to  study  in our schools. Other applicants  are  not

allowed,  Since  we have a surplus of classrooms  and

school  accommodation and since students from foreign

countries have contributed to our education fund,  we

should relax the conditions for their entry. This  is

good  for them and good for us, because our education

system will be shown to its advantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, I would like to ask the Minister whether

he  will consider constructing a secondary school  in

the  Sembawang part of Marsiling district because  at

the  present moment the secondary schools are too far

away from Woodlands, being in Bukit Panjang. Chua Chu

Kang and Jurong. For students living in Woodlands New

Town, it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1273</b></font><br><br>



very  inconvenient for them to travel a long distance

to  Jurong  and other neighbouring areas. So  I  feel

that  there  is a need for a secondary school  to  be

built in the Woodlands New Town.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, quite often criticisms

against  the  Ministry of Education have been  heavy.

But  then we must accept some of the changes  in  the

policies which have been introduced now and again  as

they  are  justified because of our country's  needs.

Otherwise, we shall be carrying on with the  colonial

style  and  methods of teaching, in  which  case  the

Ministry of Education will be in the good books.  But

then   what  would  happen  to  the  other   sectors,

especially  when  the students have  completed  their

studies from schools and are looking for jobs?  Well,

this  is  the main reason why the educational  system

has  been revised every now and then so as to improve

its  effectiveness to suit the country's  needs.  The

present  aim in education is to strengthen moral  and

civic  education in order to raise the  effectiveness

of  the education system. So, there should be a limit

to  the  questioning of our education policies,  like

the  learning  of  languages  and  the  teaching   of

technical  education, the revision of the  system  of

primary   education,  the  abolition   of   automatic

promotion  and the introduction of the basic  courses

to teach pupils to read and write in one language and

who cannot cope with the standard course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst we speak about the second language, I

wonder whether the Ministry is aware of a new kind of

problem  we  face  Some schools  are  making  use  of

language  as  an  excuse to put the Malay  and  Tamil

students into one class while the Chinese are put  in

the  other  classes.  Thus, throughout  their  school

life,  some  students  may  not  have  a  chance   to

integrate   with  the  other  students.  The   little

integration  that  we  find in schools  now  is  very

superficial.  This is in a way against  our  cultural

policy   of   integrating  all  the  races   into   a

Singaporean   group.   Furthermore,   many   schools,

particularly  the  popular  ones  and   the   mission

schools, are not teaching Tamil as a second language.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>



These  schools play a smart game. By not  engaging  a

Tamil  teacher, they  claim  that  Tamil  cannot  be

offered in their schools and thus cunningly keep  the

Tamil students out of these schools. The Minister may

reply  that  the  response of Tamil students  in  the

schools is very poor and that is why there is no  pro

vision for Tamil education. But I would like to  tell

the  Minister  that many Tamil students were  refused

registration because of the lame excuse by the school

authorities that the response in the school for Tamil

teaching is poor. In fact, the students were told  of

this  one  or two at a time. Just imagine,  if  there

were 100 students and they were given one or two at a

time, the lame excuse of poor response, then how  are

we  going  to  promote Tamil language in schools?  In

this  way.  Tamil students would be deprived  of  the

learning of this language in the schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know the Minister's views

regarding the posting of teachers to Chinese  schools

from  English medium schools? I have been  told  that

some  teachers who were supposed to be loaned to  the

Chinese  schools  have literally been  "dumped"  into

rural  schools  and  they have become  the  forgotten

ones.  Since  these  teachers are  not  happy  to  be

"dumped"  to the rural schools, why not alternatively

post  teachers to Chinese schools by rotation so that

the teachers do not rot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why is it that some schools, especially in the

rural  areas,  still do not have  telephones?  Is  it

because  the principals purposely do not request  the

installation  of  a  telephone  although  lines   are

available?  If there is a telephone, it may  be  that

they will have to every now and then answer telephone

calls  from  parents.  That is the  reason  why  they

refuse to instal a telephone. I understand that  some

principals of the rural schools do not want to instal

a  telephone  simply because they  do  not  want  the

Ministry  officials  to contact them  every  now  and

then.   In  this  way,  there  will  be  very  little

communication  between the Ministry  and  the  school

administration. I wonder how often the Inspectors  of

Schools  go round to these schools to spot  check  on

what is  exactly happening there. I also gather  that

some of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>



the  Inspectors do not visit these schools frequently

because of the distance from the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to know how often does the

Ministry  of  Education issue syllabuses  to  schools

because  many  schools  are  still  using  the   1976

syllabus, and  not  the current one.  Is  there  any

standardisation of the syllabus in schools?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder how the secondary schools, especially

the  Secondary IV level, are functioning. We do agree

that  there  is a shortage of teachers and  therefore

relief teachers are employed every now and then.  But

then  some sort of control must be maintained in  the

teaching  of  subjects  in  the  Secondary  IV  level

because it is more or less a crucial year to decide a

student's  future career. I understand  that  due  to

many  problems  in  the school, like  resignation  of

teachers  and secondment to work on certain  projects

and  assignments,  the performance  of  the  students

seems to fall under the different teachers.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of a case last year in a secondary school

where just to teach a science subject there were five

different  teachers teaching the subject.  One  after

another came to teach the subject at the Secondary IV

level. There were four teachers teaching one subject.

How  can they cope up with the students? This is like

changing shirts. However, I gathered that in the  end

the  result  of that class in that subject  was  very

poor.  This is because of the complication  resulting

from  the changing of teachers. This anomaly must  be

checked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been complaining that there is a

shortage  of teachers in schools. Sometime ago  there

was  some  publicity for the recruitment of  teachers

from  Britain for our Singapore schools. You  do  not

get  them  from the commonwealth countries  but  from

Britain.  How  far  have we been  successful  in  the

recruitment?  Have  we managed  to  get  the  foreign

teachers  to  increase the strength of  the  teaching

staff.  Why  are we recruiting teachers from  Britain

only? Britain is not the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>



only English-speaking country in the world. There are

other countries too which are closer to Singapore and

they could also be considered. It may also be cheaper

to  employ teachers from these countries in the  long

run. Could the Minister comment on this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when is the next promotion exercise due for the

teachers?  A  few  years  ago  the  former  Education

Minister said that it would be an annual affair. But.

actually, the exercise took place only twice  in  the

last  four  years or so. It was due  last  year.  But

nothing  has  happened. Is this going to  be  another

heartbreaking waiting exercise? As it is, the  morale

and  standard in the teaching profession seem  to  be

low. Is it necessary to make it worse? If you do  not

give  them promotion, what interest do they  have  in

teaching? They would not have the interest to  teach.

You  must  give  them  promotion  because  they  have

already  suffered  a lot. If you do  not,  they  will

resign. They would not want to teach. They would just

ask the students to learn themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At times the Ministry tends to be slow in dealing

with  finance.  I  will just quote an  example.  Some

teachers  who  invigilated the main  examinations  in

November  have  not yet been paid. Four  months  have

already  passed  and  even  the  results  have   been

released. Yet no payment has been made. Why is  there

a  delay? Is it because the Minister for Finance  has

not given the money? That is the excuse. The Minister

for  Finance  has not given the money  and  therefore

they cannot pay them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what has happened to the `Use your Hands'

Campaign launched in our schools? There was a lot  of

publicity  but little activity. Is this going  to  be

another  "Much  ado  about  Nothing  Campaign"?  Many

schools have taken this campaign seriously. All  they

seem  to  care  for is some publicity in  the  school

magazines, the press and the TV. What have we  really

achieved?  What  measures are being taken  to  ensure

that  there  is  continuity in the "Use  Your  Hands"

campaign? But I would suggest to the Minister not  to

take  only  the boy scouts to clean the schools.  All

boys  must help to clean the schools. They say,  "You

are a scout; you are not going



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>



around  to collect money. Now, you come to the school

to  clean." They have to clean the schools every  now

and  then. How many days in a week do they  call  the

boy  scouts to clean the schools. It is very  unfair.

You can call them for one day or two days to come and

clean  the schools. But if you ask them to  come  and

clean  the schools throughout the week, they  do  not

have the time to study?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Victimisation.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> That is very bad. The parents

are having a headache.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Free labour service.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Yes, free labour service.

Whenever you can save money, you save. When you  have

to give money, you cannot give.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Complain to the Ministry

of Education.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Although the

teachers  have invigilated in the examinations, they

have  not been paid. Yet they ask the school boys  to

clean  the  schools for free. What is this?  Is  this

reasonable? We have so many workers. Why  cannot  the

cleaning  service  be  paid by the  Government?  Each

school has its own fund. Why cannot it be used to pay

the  labourers to clean the schools? No doubt at  one

time  there  was the "Use your hands"  campaign.  The

children must know how to work. I agree. But they can

work for one day. You can make them clean the schools

for one day. But they should be free for the rest  of

the week. They should rest at home.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> They must rest.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> They do not have a rest. The

Minister is writing something on a paper. It is  just

theoretical, not practical. Everything is theory. You

are   putting  it  in  writing.  When  the  head   of

department says something, you say yes. Because  they

give  you an explanation, it is OK, and you sign  the

memorandum. The Minister's work is finished.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Very simple!



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Yes, very simple.

This campaign, if followed properly, would lead to  a

self-servicing system of maintaining the schools.  In

this  way  schools can help a great deal  in  cutting

down  the  costs of maintenance and get  rid  of  the

"tidak  apa" attitude. You know what is "tidak  apa"?

What does it mean? "Couldn't care less".



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> What about in Tamil?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Paravaillai. It is high time

educationists took this campaign to heart and realise

its great importance to the future of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to safeguard the public interest in private

schools,  correspondence schools, special educational

schools and kindergartens, what steps are being taken

to  ensure  that  they are licensed? What  steps  are

being  taken  to ensure that they do  not  cheat  our

students? Of late there seems to be a mushrooming  of

commercial schools in Singapore. It seems  to  be  an

easy way of making a `quick buck'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have spoken about Tamil

language and even the Prime Minister has referred  to

it  in  his  reply to the Presidential Address  -  no

students,  no teachers. But in this case there  is  a

teacher  and  there are students, why were  they  not

allowed to open a Tamil class? When a Tamil boy  goes

to  that school, they say. "No Tamil class". You must

check  every school. I have been repeating it.  I  am

very  fed up about it. You want everybody to  know  a

second  language in a multi-racial society, a  multi

lingual society. So you must give the second language

a chance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> What is the name of that school?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> I do not want to mention the

school.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, first

let me touch on the Government's bilingual policy  of

the education system in Singapore. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>



formulation,  implementation and  promotion  of  this

bilingual  policy has generally received the  support

of    parents,    educationists    and    educational

organisations  concerned.  Not  very  long  ago   the

Government  promulgated its  decision  to  raise  the

language standard of pre-university classes. This  is

an  indication  of the Government's determination  in

implementing the teaching of second languages. To  my

knowledge, all the schools are trying their  best  to

promote the teaching of second language, particularly

the Chinese schools, in order to reach the prescribed

standard set by the Ministry of Education, I remember

in 1972 when the bilingual policy was implemented, it

was   stipulated  that  the  teaching  of  the  first

language  in  all the schools should be  75%  of  the

total   number  of  hours  and  the  second  language

exposure  time  should  be 25%.  And  thereafter  the

second  language exposure time would be increased  to

33%, 40% and 50% in three years' time. This is all in

keeping with the principles of learning. But up  till

now  I  have found that the number of teaching  hours

for  second  language  in  certain  schools  has  not

reached  30%.  This  matter is worth  our  attention.

Since  bilingualism is our policy we must  thoroughly

implement   this  policy.  We  should   not   do   it

perfunctorily. We should not allow the  issue  to  be

circumvented.   The  substance   and   principle   of

bilingualism  should be understood not  only  by  the

principals and teachers but also by all the  officers

in  the  Ministry of Education in order to facilitate

the  promotion  of this policy without aberration.  I

have  discovered that in some new Government  schools

the   school  signboards  are  written  in  only  one

language.  Perhaps  this is due to  the  officers  in

charge  not  being able to understand  the  bilingual

policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in order to promote the

teaching  of second language effectively there  is  a

need  for  good  teachers, good  teaching  materials,

adequate language laboratories and related equipment.

According  to  my  knowledge, in the Chinese  schools

particularly  the rural schools in far  away  places,

there  is  a serious shortage of good second language

teachers. I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>



know  whether  the  Ministry  concerned  intends   to

rectify  this situation. As regards teachers teaching

in  rural schools in distant rural areas, would  the

Ministry   consider   giving  them   some   transport

allowance?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this year's slogan for the House is "From each

his best; to each his worth." This is in keeping with

the  fundamental principles of democratic  socialism,

and  this slogan is applicable to all professions and

trades alike, including the teaching profession.  The

original  intention of the Ministry of  Education  in

the last two promotion exercises for teachers was  to

promote  some educationists who were meritorious  and

deserving. But, because of certain aberrations in the

process, they resulted in dissatisfaction to many and

satisfaction only to some. Some meritorious  teachers

who  have  contributed their best whether  inside  or

outside the school have not been called even  for  an

interview. So how do you prevent people from  feeling

that "from each his best" is useless or it will be in

vain in their case. So. I hope the Ministry concerned

will be more careful in the promotion exercise so  as

to  be  able to actually carry out the principle  and

objective  of  "from each his best and  to  each  his

worth".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our school system, there are the principal,

senior  teachers and subject directors. They shoulder

more  onerous duties and they have to do their duties

over  a  longer  period  of  time,  particularly  the

principal  who will have to be involved in all  kinds

of  work big or small, even out of school activities.

Whether  or  not they have anything to  do  with  the

school, the principals will have to be present and be

responsible. This is both time-consuming and a  waste

of  money. The principal cannot even enjoy the school

vacation  that is enjoyed by the school servants.  In

the  past  there was the post allowance  given  to  a

principal  according to the size of the  school.  The

post  allowance was a kind of award to the  principal

which could serve as an entertainment allowance.  But

since  the  1971 restructure of salary  scales,  this

post  allowance was abolished, This time  last  year.

according to the Minister of State, his Ministry  was

considering



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>



reviving  this post allowance, but it has  been  more

than one year now. I wonder whether any decision  has

been arrived on this.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Ministry of Education has issued

certain  syllabuses and notices to schools for  their

reference,  and  sometimes  the  Ministry  has   also

conducted courses for school management personnel  to

participate.  This is a good phenomenon.  The  school

management personnel shoulder onerous tasks.  If  the

Ministry  want  them  to take part  in  meetings  and

attend  courses, then they must make sure that  these

are  useful  to them and have some bearing  on  them.

Otherwise  it  is a waste of time and effort  if  the

school  personnel  do not benefit from  it,  and  the

officer  in  charge  in  the Ministry  will  also  be

blamed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of notices by the Ministry of

Education to schools is a common thing. However,  one

should not abuse this and also it must be ascertained

that  the notices are useful before they are  issued.

Moreover, the notices should be signed by the officer

in  charge  and not by somebody else on  his  behalf.

because that will be an indication that nobody  would

dare  to  be responsible for the notices. If that  is

the  case,  the Ministry might as well not issue  any

notices at all. For, otherwise how do they expect the

schools to comply with the notices? I hope the Senior

Minister  of  State  will urge his  Ministry  to  pay

attention to this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon:</b> I am not speaking, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Sir, on 27th December

1976, just a few days before the current school  year

commenced on 3rd January, 1977, the Education Ministry

announced   that   Technical   Drawing   and    Basic

Electricity  would be dropped from  the  Secondary  I

curriculum. The number of periods per week  would  be

reduced from 44 to 40 periods per week as a result of

that. This, according to the Ministry, would take off

some of the learning load from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>



Secondary I students. No one, least of all me, would

disagree  with  the  Education Ministry  that,  where

possible, we should lighten the learning load of  our

students  provided, in so doing, we  are  in  no  way

sacrificing  some of our short as well as  long  term

educational objectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For several years, Secondary I and Secondary II

students were required to do these subjects.  At  the

time  when these subjects were introduced, there must

have  been good reasons why this was done, or are  we

to  be  told now that this was not so. If there  were

good  reasons then, are these reasons no  more  valid

today? Who are these men in the Shelley Committee who

have  come to the conclusion that it is in  the  best

interests of the children that these subjects  should

be  dropped?  What  is their background?  Apart  from

their  technical  qualifications and  expertise,  are

they conversant with our overall educational policies

and objectives? What is the essence of their findings

that made the Education Ministry drop these subjects?

Why did the Ministry not release their report so that

the  validity  of their arguments and  the  basis  of

their  findings could be confirmed as sound by  other

experts  of  equal standing? Why is all  the  secrecy

surrounding the Shelley Report?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the move is popular with the parents as

it will mean less periods for their children to study

and  worry  about passing the examinations  of  these

subjects.  Would the Education Ministry  like  to  be

more  popular  with  the  parents  by  setting  up  a

committee  like  the  Shelley  Committee  to   review

whether  it  should also drop woodwork and  metalwork

from  the  Secondary I curriculum? Would the Ministry

consider setting up a committee to review whether  we

should  reduce the load of extracurricular activities

in  schools? And lastly, would the Education Ministry

also  consider  setting  up  a  committee  to  review

whether the education system can be less examination-orientated? The Minister may think that  I  am  being

frivolous, but I can assure him I am not. The  issues

that  I have just raised are issues of great interest

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>



importance  to  parents  as  they  can  affect  their

children's welfare and well-being in schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, may I ask the Minister how much

money  the various secondary schools had to spend  on

buying  the  technical drawing instruments  from  the

Secondary  I students, because the announcement  came

after  they had bought the instruments? What  do  the

schools intend to do with these instruments?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to

support  what  the Member for Jurong has  said  about

post  allowances for school principals. I think  this

issue has been debated in the past in this House. But

until today we have only heard the sound of footsteps

coming down from the staircase without seeing anybody

coming  down. In view of the maxim "to each according

to  his  worth", I feel there should be some solution

so  as  to  carry  this out well and  not  shove  the

responsibility  to the Ministry of Finance.  That  is

not right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another issue. I have found that in the

implementation of education policies, it seems  there

has   been  an  over-reaction  by  officials  of  the

Ministry  of Education. For instance, last year  when

we  were  discussing matters relating to the Ministry

of  Education, everybody was saying that the Ministry

had  no liaison with the schools. Not long after  the

Ministry  began  to ring up all the schools  everyday

asking the teachers to take part in meetings, to take

part in discussions and so on, all kinds of meetings.

Even  in the rural schools, in one day alone all  the

four  or  five teachers in the school were called  up

for meetings, leaving no one to run the classes. This

is too much. The reaction from the officials has been

much  too  great. This will have to be rectified.  If

officials  of the Ministry of Education could  accept

the  opinions aired here by MPs, of course, it  would

be  most  welcome. But over-reaction is  not  a  good

symptom. So I hope the Minister will pay attention to

this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another problem, and that is a personal

one.  In  some schools, there are teachers who  think

that pupils must get some private tuition at home  to

catch up. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>



could  not  help  it. I have to  look  after  my  own

children.  In  my  own  experience  of  teaching   my

children.  I found that there is no certain  standard

set for the simplified version of Chinese characters.

For instance, in Primary I they used the character wu (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) (noon) to

indicate the wu (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) in tiao wu ( )

which   means  dancing.  When  my  children  attended

Primary II the teacher told them that they could  not

use  the  same character to mean "dancing",  tiao  wu

which has the same sound as the wu we use in xia wu (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) for "afternoon". So one is not sure what

simplified Chinese characters can or cannot  be  used

now.  So  in the dictation tests the children  cannot

get  100 marks. When they get home, the parents  will

blame  the  children for not being able  to  get  100

marks.  And if the parents were to ask the  teachers,

they would say that it is the parents who have taught

their  children the wrong words. So there must  be  a

certain  standard. Which simplified  version  is  the

correct  one? Should it be our version, or should  it

be  the  version from mainland China? Or from Taiwan?

(I  am told there is no simplified writing in Taiwan,

but  I  am  not aware of it.) Perhaps this simplified

form now in use here has come from Nantah. This is an

important matter. This has been bothering the parents

for   quite   a  long  time  and  has  eroded   their

confidence.  No wonder the enrolment figures  in  the

Chinese  primary  schools have been  decreasing  year

after  year, because every school is using  different

textbooks.  I  am  wondering, since Singapore  is  so

small,  why the schools are using different textbooks

everyday. The books are being changed. This is a very

important matter to look into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity to

speak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Chai Chong Yii)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Member for

Sembawang  has  brought  up  several  questions.   He

touched  on  full-day schooling, the  setting  up  of

commercial schools, and so on. He has even asked  for

a  relaxation  of  rules for  the  entry  of  foreign

students   into  Singapore  schools.  He   has   also

requested  for new secondary schools to be  built  at

Woodlands



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>



in  his constituency. So I have to answer his queries

one after the other briefly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full-day school system is good, I agree. But the

question is whether we have enough schools to run the

system.  If  he thinks of asking those schools  which

have  accommodation  or vacancies  and  within  their

manpower  resources to run full-day session  then  he

will have a lot of problems. For example, for a full-day

school it will start from 9 a.m. and end about  2

or  3 p.m. That means the students have to have lunch

in  the  school and this will present  a  problem  to

anxious  parents. The teachers and the students  will

also  come  across  unexpected  problems.  Our  basic

policy  is that if a school can cope with a  full-day

session   with   its   available  accommodation   and

resources, well, it can go-ahead if it wants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards commercial schools, the Adult Education

Board has four centres running commercial classes  in

the   day   time.  They  are  at  Kim  Keat   Centre.

Mountbatten  Centre,  Hai Sing Dewasa  Institute  and

Stamford  Girls' School. This year we  are  going  to

have  another  school. We now have  more  than  2,000

students attending such classes in the day time.  And

if  we  include students in the evening  classes,  it

will  come  to  about  9,000. Of those  Secondary  IV

students  who  are  not able to  join  Pre-University

classes,  some are attending the evening classes  run

by   the  Adult  Education  Board.  Others  join  the

technical classes in the Vocational Institutes  under

the  Industrial Training Board. They go for the  ITC,

i.e.  Industrial Technician Certificates. So we  have

quite many outlets for such students. But, of course,

we  shall continue to pay attention to these students

because we do not want these people to idle. They are

not idling as alleged by the Member for Sembawang. At

the moment, we are also studying the secondary school

system. We have said so a few days ago when answering

a  question by the Member for Punggol. We are looking

into  this  matter to see whether every  student  can

continue to study until the age of 18 years. This  is

a    long-term   matter   which   requires    careful

consideration. Of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>



course,  we  have  to  tailor our  needs  within  our

limited financial resources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the relaxation of entry qualifications

for  foreign students into Singapore schools. I  will

say  that the present requirements do provide for the

easy  entrance  of students from ASEAN countries.  Of

course,  students from non-ASEAN countries will  have

to  comply with stricter requirements. Those students

who  comply  with the requirements and can  catch  up

with  the standards in our schools, we do accommodate

them.  Further  relaxation will not  be  of  help  to

anybody because some of the students may not be  able

to  cope with our syllabus requirements here. We have

also  limited vacancies in our schools. Some kind  of

balance  has  to  be struck. At present,  we  do  not

propose to relax further the entry qualifications for

foreign students.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, dealing with the question of a new secondary

school  in the Marsiling area. I would like  to  tell

the  Member for Sembawang that we propose to build  a

new secondary school in Woodlands New Town but it  is

not  in  his  constituency. It is in  Bukit  Panjang.

Although  it is not in his constituency, the students

in  his constituency can go to the new school that is

to be built there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has numerous sources of

information and so he has a lot of matters  to  bring

up  in this House. It is good of him to speak for his

constituents, and we pay him all the respect due. But

sometimes  he raises so many questions that  if  they

are  not answered will give rise to misunderstanding.

The  Member for Anson has raised 11 points. His first

point  was  in relation to the learning of the  Tamil

language. This is an annual affair, but I can  assure

the Member that this is not to be taken as a joke. We

have given this matter our serious consideration.  We

give  equal treatment to the learning of all the four

official   languages.  There  is  no   discrimination

against  any  particular language. It is  up  to  the

parents  to choose the language. The second  language

or the first language is entirely the free choice of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>



parents,   and  we  give  them  all  the   assistance

available  and  possible. But  sometimes  because  of

certain  limitations,  we  have  problems.  We   have

instructed  schools  to  accept  enrolment  of  Tamil

students, but whether we have enough students to  run

a  Tamil class is a different matter. If we have only

two  or  three students, we cannot run  a  class  for

them.  This is the main crux of the matter. He cannot

say   that  the  principal  does  not  accept   Tamil

students.  Probably  it is because  of  the  language

problem   that  there  is  a  misunderstanding.   The

principal  may  say  that if  there  are  not  enough

students to justify a class he may not have  a  Tamil

class  for the learning of Tamil language.  This  may

lead  to some kind of unintentional misunderstanding.

After  some clarification I hope the Member will  not

raise  the  matter again next year. I can assure  him

that there is no discrimination against any language.

Tamil  is  a  long  standing  language  with  a  long

historical  and cultural background. Although  I  may

not know Tamil, which is the only official language I

do  not  know.  I  can assure him that  there  is  no

discrimination of any sort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point the Member raised is in relation to

our  transferring of teachers from English stream  to

rural schools, and forgetting about them entirely. We

have  no  intention  to forget such  teachers.  Every

teacher   gets  paid.  So  we  cannot  forget   them,

otherwise  they  get  no pay at all.  But  there  are

problems in regard to transfers. Most of the teachers

live  in Housing and Development Board flats  and  in

the  urban areas. Many of them do not like to  go  to

schools in the rural areas. But students in the rural

areas are also entitled to go to schools. That is the

problem.  So  we  have to send some teachers  to  the

rural  areas  and  we hope that these  teachers  will

accept  their  transfer  as a challenge  to  shoulder

their  responsibility  as a teacher  to  educate  the

children in the rural areas. Of course, facilities in

the  rural schools may not be as good as those in the

urban  areas. But rural people are more friendly  and

they respect the teachers more. I was a teacher in  a

rural  school some 20 years ago and I know  that  the

rural people are more friendly and understanding  and

there has been no change



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>



in  this  attitude. Teachers sent to the rural  areas

may  lose  materially  but spiritually  they  may  be

compensated for, I hope.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has also spoken on the

question  of  teachers  in rural  schools.  He  asked

whether  we could give them transport allowance.  No.

we  cannot give them transport allowance. This matter

was  raised  and debated before, and the Ministry  of

Finance  had  opposed it strongly.  If  we  give  the

teachers  transport allowance, then  what  about  the

others?  Moreover, it is already stated in the  terms

and conditions of service that teachers are liable to

be  transferred anywhere in Singapore. Of course,  we

try to be fair but sometimes fairness is very hard to

gauge. It depends on the stand taken. If he considers

himself  weightier than others, then he wants  to  be

treated more fairly. It is a difficult problem. So we

are  trying to find a better solution. The Member for

Anson says that they can go by rotation. This is  one

point  that we have considered. But we have not  come

to any decision so far. We can only hope for the time

being that those teachers who have been posted to the

rural  areas  will  be conscientious  and  forbearing

enough  to consider the educational needs of children

in the rural areas and continue to teach happily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next we come to the telephone in the rural schools.

Some   schools  in  the  rural  areas   are   without

telephones.  But  they form only a small  number.  To

generalize  is  to create misunderstanding.  We  have

altogether some 500 schools in Singapore but only  26

schools are without telephone facilities. Of  the  26

schools,  9  are  in  surrounding  islands, and  the

remaining  17 are all in very remote areas.  Some  of

these  schools could have telephones installed.  They

are  small  aided  schools.  Perhaps  some  of  these

schools  feel that there is no need for  a  telephone

and they do not apply for a telephone. I do not think

that  it  is  because they do not want  communication

with the Ministry's officials. Telephones are not for

communication with the Ministry alone but  there  are

other uses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About visits by school inspectors. Of course, the

Education  Development Officers  and  the  Specialist

Advisers do visit all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>



schools in Singapore. They have a certain schedule to

keep; those schools with more problems will have more

visits, while the rural schools which do not have  so

many  problems will have less visits,  But  they  are

visited at least once or twice a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson quoted one example of changing

teachers in Secondary IV classes. I do not know which

particular school or class he was referring to. I can

say that, in principle, we advise principals to avoid

changing  teachers in the Secondary  IV  classes.  We

appreciate  that  it is not good to change  teachers,

especially  during the crucial time  when  it  is  so

close  to  the  Secondary IV final examinations.  But

sometimes  changes  are inevitable.  For  example, a

teacher  may be successful in his application  for  a

scholarship. And we cannot stop him from going  on  a

scholarship.  As  far as possible we  avoid  changing

teachers  at  the Secondary IV class  level.  If  the

changes  are too frequent, perhaps there is something

wrong  with the principal. If there was such a  case,

it  should be reported to me and I will look into the

matter  to  see  if I could be of  any  help  to  the

principal  to  put  it right. There  are  merits  and

demerits  of  the  individual. It may  be  that  some

principals   have  a  special  reason  for   changing

teachers; we do not know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next comes the question of recruitment of teachers

from  England.  England is the  native  land  of  the

English  language.  Of course, we  do  not  deny  the

existence of other English-speaking countries. We  do

recruit  teachers  from  New Zealand.  Australia  and

other  English-speaking countries. But this is  on  a

short  term basis, not a long term one. We are giving

them contracts of two to three years after which time

we  hope  to  be  able to solve our  teacher-shortage

problem.  Most of the teachers recruited are teachers

of  English from these countries. According to  their

performance  in  the schools, we can say  that  their

response  has  been fair. Since they are expatriates,

we will pay special attention to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About promotion exercises, we have only had two

promotion exercises in the past



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>



four  years. We should have one last year but we  are

now  in  the  course  of preparing another  promotion

exercise. This matter, as mentioned by the Member for

Jurong and supported by the Member for Jalan Kayu, is

tied up with the consideration for the post allowance

for  principals and other related matters.  Promotion

will  give rise to the question of fairness  as  also

mentioned  by  the  Member for  Jurong.  It  is  very

difficult to satisfy everyone, and that is the reason

why  there  is  some  delay  in  the  next  promotion

exercise  which I believe will come up sometime  this

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On fees payable to invigilators, the complaint is

that  fees have not been paid up to this day. If this

is  true, then something is wrong. As far as I  know.

fees  for invigilators are paid within two months  of

the  examination. I have made some enquiry  into  the

delay and have found that some 85% have already  been

paid.  We have about 13,000 sets of claims to  check,

All this checking contributes to the delay. There  is

no good justification for the delay in the payment of

fees  for  as  long as four months or more.  Normally

fees  should be paid within two months, which is long

enough. Something must be wrong somewhere, and I will

take note of this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also referred to the "Use your

hands"  campaign. I can assure him that the  Ministry

has   no  intention  to  get  free  labour  from  the

students.  We never have this intention. The  schools

do  not  have the intention to retrench  any  of  the

workers either. This campaign is only one link in the

educational   process  where  we  get   students   to

experience the use of their hands. The poor  children

never  grumble about using their hands  because  they

are  used to it at home. Those who are well-to-do and

do  not do any manual work at home, however, are  the

true target of this campaign. This is the category of

students  that we want to educate. I hope  they  will

start  to  learn something. Let us take Japan  as  an

example.  Even  the  children of owners  of  business

establishments  have to start from  the  most  junior

position  before  they  can be  promoted.  We  should

emulate this spirit. In our schools, we also have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>



children from millionaire families who do not have to

lift  a  finger  to  do any household  work.  In  the

schools, however, they have to be educated on the use

of  their hands. I hope they will appreciate this  as

part  of  their education and not treat it  as  being

used  for free labour, otherwise the significance  of

the campaign will be totally lost.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June last year we conducted the first "Use your

hands"  campaign,  and we intend to  carry  out  this

campaign  in the middle of every year in the schools.

It  may not be on a national basis but we may ask the

MPs of the respective areas to help in the "Use your

hands"  campaign  to be carried out in  the  schools.

When  that  time comes, we might ask the  Member  for

Anson  to  go  to the schools in his constituency  to

help run the campaign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On private schools, kindergartens and correspondence

schools,  they  have  to  be  registered  under   the

Education Act and they have to seek approval  of  the

fees payable by the students. We are paying attention

to this. The Member mentioned the numerous commercial

schools that are being run on a profit-making  basis.

It  is  because they are in great demand at  present.

The  Adult Education Board is running more  and  more

commercial classes and will provide better facilities

and  other courses for the public. If members of  the

public   still  want  to  go  to  private  commercial

schools,  it is up to them. It is entirely their  own

choice. But I believe the Adult Education Board  will

greatly expand its facilities in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bilingual policy referred to by the Member

for  Jurong, I would say that bilingual education  is

one  of  the basic policies of our education  system.

There will be no change. But because of a shortage of

teachers and other problems, some schools may not  be

able  to  meet  the required percentage  of  exposure

time.  This is a practical problem. Ideally, we would

like  to see a balance at 50% exposure time for  each

of  the  two  languages without  a  lowering  of  the

standard  of either language, but it is not  possible

`to achieve uniform performance in educational



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>



pursuits because different people have different make-ups and linguistic aptitudes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other point raised by the Member for

Anson  which  I  overlooked  just  now.  This  is  on

syllabus.  He  asked whether there is a  standard  or

unified syllabus. I would say yes. If he is aware  of

any   schools  still  using  the  old  syllabus   and

textbooks, he should let me know, then I will make  a

check.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong mentioned the question of post-allowance and salaries for principals. The Member for

Jalan   Kayu  has  also  raised  a  similar   matter.

Consideration  of  this matter is now  in  its  final

stages, and the Public Service Commission, the  Prime

Minister's Office and the Ministry of Finance are now

looking   into   the   final   details   before   the

implementation. So the complaint of false alarm  will

soon be proved wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the language of school names mentioned by

the  Member for Jurong, our present policy  is  this.

The  signboards may be in one language or with  other

languages.  In  newly-built Government  schools,  the

languages  for the signboard will be as many  as  the

languages  used in the school concerned.  There  will

always  be  a  Chinese  name for  every  new  school,

because  Chinese  language is not  romanized,  though

sometimes its Chinese name may not be painted on  the

wall.  Names of schools are permissible in  different

languages. It is up to the principal to decide. There

is  no compulsion. For initial painting we have given

instruction  to  the PWD that if it  is  a  bilingual

integrated  school, then the name of the school  will

be  in  English  and  Chinese or  English  and  Malay

according  to  the language streams adopted  in  that

school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong also raised the point that

notices are not signed by senior officials. I have to

clarify that we have two types of notices to schools;

one  is  notification  and  the  other  is  circular.

Notification will carry the name of the issuing  unit

and  the  officer-in-charge, sometimes even telephone

numbers   are  stated  for  easy  contact.  Circulars

definitely will be signed and the name of the issuing

officer  is  also  stated therein. This  is  also  to

facilitate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>



contact.  Whether  it  is really  necessary  for  the

senior  officer  himself to sign all  the  circulars,

depends on the nature of the communication. If it  is

so  important or such that it requires the  signature

of  the  senior officer, then he will sign the letter

himself. But if it is a very routine matter, then  it

will be a waste of time to make it compulsory for the

senior  officer to sign it. Of course, no  disrespect

is meant to the principals concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein mentioned that recently the

Ministry   of  Education  announced  the  change   in

Secondary  I  syllabus  by  leaving  out  courses  on

technical   drawing   and  basic   electricity.   The

department concerned had made a careful study  before

taking such action. It was not cancelled just for the

sake  of cancelling it. As regards technical drawing.

this   is   still  taught  in  the  subject  Workshop

Practice,  but not as a separate subject  as  before.

From our study we found that although it is useful to

learn  this subject, the time factor does not  permit

it  and  the  students could learn them  at  a  later

stage. This is the main reason why we are doing  away

with the subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards basic electricity, we feel that it is not

necessary  for  them to study it at this  stage.  The

Shelley   Committee  had  considered   this   subject

together   with  other  courses  such  as  metalwork,

carpentry and woodworking, and had decided  to  leave

out  basic  electricity  as a separate  subject.  The

Member  also  asked  about the  composition  of  this

committee and the publication of its report. This  is

an  internal working committee, and therefore we feel

that  it is not necessary to publish its report.  The

Chairman of this Committee is Mr Shelley and he is  a

private engineer. Another member on the Committee  is

also  a private engineer. There is one representative

each  from the University of Singapore, the Singapore

Polytechnic  and  the Industrial Training  Board.  In

addition, there are three representatives  from  our

own Ministry: one is in charge of curriculum, one  is

in  charge of technical education and the other  acts

as the secretary. These are the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>



people  who are conversant with the situation in  the

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked two more questions: one is whether we

should  have  another  committee  to  look  into  the

question of extra-curricular activities. I feel  that

for  the, time being it is not necessary  to  do  so

because  we  have already paid attention  to  matters

relating thereto and how to relieve the burden of the

students. The other question is whether we are paying

too  much attention on examinations for students.  It

seems  that  every student is studying only  for  the

examination,  and  he asked if we  could  reduce  the

burden  of  the  students in this respect,  at  least

psychologically.  I feel that this  matter  is  worth

studying. The series of actions taken by the Ministry

of Education lately is part and parcel of a policy in

this   direction,   such  as, not   publishing   the

examination    results   and    candidates'    names.

Consideration will be given on whether to set  up  an

internal committee to study psychological pressure on

students  regarding examinations, and how to  relieve

the  pressure. But it is not possible to do away with

examinations entirely. At present, there is no  other

alternative.  I  do  not think  anybody  will  really

request  the abolition of examinations for  students.

What  we  can do is to reduce as far as possible  the

psychological pressure of examinations on students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked about the recent announcement

regarding   the  schools'  intention  to   buy   back

technical   drawing  sets  bought  by   Secondary   I

students.  I do not have the exact figures  with  me.

According to my knowledge, the number bought back  by

the  schools did not amount to more than  500  pieces

totalling some $2,000 altogether. But these materials

can still be used by students of higher classes later

and they are not a waste.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu also mentioned several

points. Of course, I have already touched on the post

allowance for principals which is in the final stages

of  consideration before any action will be taken. As

regards over-reaction by the officials in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>



the Ministry of Education. I think it is quite common

with the civil service. Of course, I agree that it is

not  reasonable to call up all four or five  teachers

in  one  day from a small rural school for a meeting.

If there is such an incident. I hope the MP concerned

will  inform me so that I can take steps  to  rectify

it.  But  he cannot just pick up one or two instances

and  generalise it on the whole body of  officers  in

the  Ministry  of Education. As we all cherish  self-respect,  so  in  cases  like  this, we  need   some

discussion  among us in order to better  resolve  the

problem or rectify the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked whether the Chinese simplified form wu

()  of the characters xia wu () (afternoon) could

be  used for the wu () in tiao wu () (dancing).  We

simplified about 500 characters at the first stage of

simplification.  The  second stage  has  expanded  to

cover more characters. When implemented in full, some

confusion   is   inevitable.  On  the  whole,   these

simplified versions are borrowed from China as we are

too  small a nation to produce on our own. But  there

are  a  few  simplified forms  which  are  only  used

locally and not in other places. It is difficult  for

us  to  abolish such local simplified forms developed

through usage, because language is a matter of  usage

peculiar  to  a  habitat. When the new textbooks  are

out. I hope they will use only the unified version so

that  the  simplified forms will be standardised  and

then  there  will be less confusion.  Old  texts,  if

used,  will of course lead to such problems which  we

are trying to avoid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of different varieties of textbooks

used  by  different schools, it is again  a  delicate

problem.  They all have been approved by my Ministry.

If  we  try  to reduce the variety of textbooks  into

just  two  or three, this will also lead to problems.

After  some  study, my Ministry found  that  at  the

moment  we  could not standardise the textbooks.  For

the  time  being we are not taking further action  on

the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having spoken thus far. I think I have covered all

the points raised.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, the  Minister  of  State  for  Education   has

expressed  certain  views and I understand  them.  In

English schools they say that there are no places for

Tamil  because there are not enough children  wanting

to  study Tamil. This has been said before and  again

today.  I  think  this  is  not  true  because   this

Government  has  given  equal  status  to  the   four

languages,  and  the policy is that  students  should

study  two  languages. So to say that there  are  not

enough teachers and not enough students is not right.

A  circular should be issued to all schools  to  find

out  how many Tamil students there are and the  Tamil

students  should be told that they should take  Tamil

as  a  second  language.  The Ministry  of  Education

should take a census to find out the position.  I  do

not  say  that all schools should teach  Tamil  as  a

second  language. But where there are many  students,

Tamil  should be taught. If you do not give  a  place

for  Tamil language, then there is no meaning to  the

equal  status  of  the four languages.  The  Ministry

should  adopt this method. It is not the duty of  the

parents but the duty of the Ministry, because parents

think that it is enough if they study any language so

long  as they can earn a living. The Ministry  should

insist  that Tamil children should study Tamil.  Only

then will Tamil get a proper place. I am insisting on

this  point. I have a duty to tell this. The Ministry

should  not  repeat the same tune and say that  there

are not enough teachers and not enough students. They

have to do something and insist on the Tamil children

learning Tamil. I make this request humbly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Minister of State has said something about

telephones. He has said that 26 schools do  not  have

telephones.  I  do  not know about  this.  But  there

should be a telephone in every school because if  all

of  a sudden there is a fire, what are they going  to

do?  How  are they going to inform the fire  brigade?

They  can  do  it only when there is a telephone.  So

they  should see that there is a telephone  in  every

school. Suppose there is an accident and a student is

injured.  If  there  is no telephone  in  that  rural

school, how are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>



they  going  to  send  the  child  to  the  hospital?

Everybody  knows that a telephone is  important.  For

emergency there should be a telephone, especially  in

schools, because there may be some dangerous incident

or  there may be some risk of danger. There could  be

fights and there could be injuries as a result. So if

there  is  a telephone they could use it to call  the

police  immediately  or the ambulance.  The  Ministry

will have to look into this matter urgently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another question regarding promotions. The

Minister of State is repeating the same story.  Every

year  he tells the same thing. He is not implementing

it in the correct way. I do not know when he is going

to  implement  it. Only God knows.  The  Minister  of

State does not know it. Only God knows. I do not know

how  they  are going to get their promotions.  If  he

insists that teachers should teach properly he should

pay  them  well. Only then will they  do  their  duty

well. If a teacher were to do his duty properly,  the

first thing is that he should have courage. But where

can   he  get  the  courage  from!  Only  if  he   is

financially satisfied, can he teach properly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the question of allowance. There are cases

where  a teacher has taught for a few months  and  he

has not got his allowance. He has given his best.  He

has sweated it out and he has taught the students. He

expects  to be paid but he has not got his  pay.  But

the  Minister  of  State says, "We  will  investigate

this." There are 10,000 teachers. How is he going  to

investigate? This is the answer given by  him.  I  am

not  joking. These are facts. The teachers should  be

paid.  A  teacher living in Katong is transferred  to

Pasir Panjang, and another who lives in Pasir Panjang

is  transferred  to Katong. As far as  possible,  the

teachers should be posted to the schools in the  area

in which they live. He has to think about this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to satisfy the teachers. Only then will they

work  hard.  For example, in 1941. Bevan, the  Labour

Minister, was a teacher. He said that "you should  do

everything for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>



the  workers". So he went to the industrial areas and

made all arrangements to help the people. That is why

he  won  after the Second World War. He  is  a  trade

unionist  and  he  has  got the  experience.  So  the

Minister  of  State  has  to think  about  all  these

things.  Why am I telling him this? Unless  he  gives

all  the help to the teachers, the students will  not

learn  properly. Who looks after the children in  the

schools?  The  teachers. They are looking  after  the

future  nation  builders. So  he  has  to  give  them

salaries that satisfy them. Only then will they bring

up   the  children  properly.  They  will  mould  the

children into good citizens. I hope the Minister will

take the necessary action.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, today I speak

in  Mandarin in this Chamber not because I  purposely

do  not  want  him to understand me.  Earlier  I  had

already told him that I would be speaking in Mandarin

because  basically as I am educated in Chinese  I  am

more  conversant with the language.  If  I  speak  in

English  I might unconsciously mislead him. Since  he

is  much  older than many of us naturally we  have  a

respect  for him. Whatever he has said in this  House

is  quite  reasonable and not without  merit,  and  I

respect  its  wisdom.  But  not  everything  can   be

realized or practical. I just respect everything that

he  has  said for its worth. I have already  given  a

reply  to him and, if he has no objection, I  do  not

want to repeat what I have said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of language and education,

it  will  always  occupy everybody's body  and  mind.

Psychologically,  it will even go  deeper,  and  even

affect  one's  soul  and spirit.  So  I  respect  his

opinion.  I  can just say that, wherever possible.  I

will take note of what he has said. Of course. I  may

not  be  able to satisfy him in all respects. Perhaps

he will agree with me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Ong Soo Chuan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, two

days ago when we were debating on the allocation  for

the Ministry of Culture, the Member for Boon Lay said

something which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>



might  mislead  some  people who are  concerned  with

education  or interested in matters of education.  My

colleague, the Senior Minister of State, may want  to

clarify  in  order to put the matter  right.  Let  me

quote  what  he  had  said as  reported  in  his  own newspaper, Nanyang Siang

Pau of 17th March, 1977, at page  24. It is reported there that he had said  that

the  Ministry  of  Education had decided  to  abolish

automatic  promotion and because of this  action  the

Ministry  of  Education  was  quite  embarrassed   or

ashamed  of  what it had done and would not  dare  to

face  people  so that it had to resort  to  "stealthy

measures".  To  borrow  the  favourite  phrase   just

uttered  as  coming  from my  colleague,  the  Senior

Minister  of  State, such statement if  not  answered

"will  be rather misleading". If it is not clarified.

readers  might have the impression that the  Ministry

of   Education  had  decided  to  abolish   automatic

promotion because the Ministry itself was not sure of

the  matter.  As a result, the losers would  only  be

those  who  are interested in education.  I  hope  my

colleague here can clarify this point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ngeow Pack Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ngeow Pack Hua (Boon Lay)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I feel that perhaps it is better for

the  Member for Nee Soon to quote the whole paragraph

and  not to quote it out of context. He should  quote

it at full length.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Soo Chuan</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): This is printed in

the  Nan  yang Slang Pau where the Member is working.

Does he want me to quote from the beginning? In order

to save time. I will just read out this. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Let me, quote one example. Not long ago, the

Ministry   of   Education  decided  to  abolish   the

automatic  promotion system. This is a very important

decision.   However, the  Ministry   was   extremely

embarrassed  in  having to make such a  decision.  So

much so that it tried to do it stealthily.'



<br><br>Does he want me to quote further? The paragraphs that

follow refer to the Ministry of Culture. Anybody  who

is  interested  in it can read it.  But  now  we  are

talking  about  education. So I just  quote  what  is

relevant. I hope my colleague can explain and clarify

further   so  that  people  who  are  interested   in

education will not be misled.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, we are rather

confused  as  to  who is in the Ministry  of  Foreign

Affairs and who is in the Ministry of Education. From

what  has  just  been said, I had  taken  the  Senior

Minister  of State for Education to be in  charge  of

Foreign    Affairs.   Likewise,   from    what    the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister  for  Foreign

Affairs has spoken on education, I almost took him to

be  in  the  Ministry of Education! It is  all  quite

puzzling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State for

Education a question on textbooks which I raised just

now,  as  he did not give me a direct reply. He  just

said  that  it was not practical but did not  explain

further.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in fact when

the  Member  for  Boon Lay touched  upon  educational

matters  while  speaking on  Culture.  I  thought  of

giving  him  a reply. But thinking that  one  of  the

Eastern  virtues  which  we  are  promoting  as   our

education  policy, is to be patient and  tolerant.  I

stopped   there.  Talking  about  the   Ministry   of

Education fighting shy of its own decision.  I  would

say  that  all our policy decisions have always  been

taken only after careful consideration. So it is  not

a  matter of fighting shy or engaging in double-talk.

What  happens is that while a certain policy decision

is  still  not  ripe  for  publicity,  the  newspaper

reporters  for their own reason had formed their  own

picture. So something reported in one newspaper could

be  different  from  what is reported  in  the  other

newspapers. That is quite common, and it does  happen

quite  frequently, though not intentional.  For  this

reason.  I  would not like to touch  on  it  further.

Otherwise there will be a lot to argue about  without

reaching  any conclusion. When I first  went  to  the

Ministry.  I  told my officers that the  first  thing

they  must  learn is how to take blame  or  reprimand

calmly and in good spirit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of textbooks, why we could not carry

the  policy  further,  is  because  everybody  has  a

different   view.   No  two  principals   can   agree

completely which textbook is better, and we would not

like to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>



take  away  from  the principals  this  privilege  to

decide.  At  the  moment,  we  are  encouraging   the

principals  to be more independent and to  be  better

able to guide their schools. However, these textbooks

are generally written out of the same syllabuses.  So

they  cannot vary too great an extent, except in  the

style of writing perhaps. It rests with the principal

to decide what textbooks to use. We would not like to

revoke this power.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank the

Senior  Minister  of  State  for  Education  for  his

patience  in answering so many questions today.  Just

now  the  Member for Jalan Kayu sent  a  note  to  me

suggesting that, with such a diplomatic attitude  the

Member  for  Nee  Soon  could  be  appointed  as   an

Ambassador.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State to

reply  to  this  question. He says that  he  is  very

agreeable to the suggestion of a full-day school, but

he  did not say how to promote it. This shows that he

is  dubious about it, not giving any definite  answer

as  to  whether or not he wants to do something about

it.  I  would  like to ask whether  the  Ministry  of

Education itself would initiate the programme of full-day schooling. I understand that there is one Chinese

high  school  which  has  started  its  own  full-day

schooling.  Has the school consulted the Ministry  of

Education or has it done it on its own volition?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,I feel that

the Member for Sembawang is not quite conversant with

the meaning of full-day schooling. At the moment, the

Anglican High School and a few other schools  may  be

said  to have full-day schooling because they do  not

have afternoon sessions. But this is not really full-day schooling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of The Chinese High School, it is not

exactly a complete full-day school because the school

session  is  only  in the morning; in  the  afternoon

there  are  no  official classes.  The  teachers  and

students  are  allowed to continue to remain  in  the

school



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>



for  unofficial classes. It is just that. I say  that

if  anything  is good to the school, we allow  it  to

carry on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we are going to have full-day schooling,

then we will have to double the number of schools  to

accommodate the student population and we may not  be

able  to find enough land. People from various  parts

of   the  world  have  enquired  of  our  two-session

education system wanting to learn from us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, can I ask the

Senior   Minister  of  State  to  tell  us   how   to

differentiate  between  what  is  official   full-day

schooling and what is unofficial or abnormal type  of

full-day   schooling,  and  whether   the   Education

Ministry  has  any long term policy of  changing  the

system to official full-day schooling.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in Singapore.

since  land  is limited. I do not see the possibility

of  full-day  schooling being implemented officially,

because  it  involves schooling time up  to  3  or  4

o'clock  in  the afternoon and the students  have  to

stay  for  lunch in school. As regards unofficial  or

modified type of full-day schooling the students  and

some   teachers  are  just  staying  back   to   give

additional  guidance to the students. So it  is  just

random  pick.  In so far as the long term  policy  is

concerned, Singapore as a whole cannot carry out  the

system of full-day schooling.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I have waited so

long  for  an opportunity to stand up and say  a  few

words. The Senior Minister of State for Education has

given  quite  satisfactory  replies  to  the  various

points raised by Members. At least he has brought  us

a  piece  of good news, that is that remuneration  of

principals would be adjusted for their good and  also

in  the  middle of this year there will  be  a  third

promotion exercise for the teachers. I would like  to

ask  whether  he  can tell us more  details  in  this

regard  because there are still a few  months  before

the middle of this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of full-day schooling. I

would like to air some of my own



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>



views here. Many people think that running a full-day

school  will help to better the quality of education.

It  is  not  really so, I think. As it  is,  we  have

morning  sessions and afternoon sessions.  I  do  not

think  there  is anything seriously wrong  with  this

system.  At  the moment, the students can  use  their

other session for extra-curricular activities.  I  am

not trying to argue for the Ministry of Education but

according  to my own personal experience and  contact

with educationists abroad, I can say that they rather

admire our system of education, with two sessions  in

the  schools.  They have been praising Singapore  for

the success of its two-session schooling, thus making

full use of the school's resources. And they want  to

learn  this from us. I am saying that it is something

true.  So  full-day  schooling is only  practical  in

places  where the population is small but  they  have

large  stretches of land where they can have spacious

accommodation  for that system. In these  places,  if

two-session  schooling were to  be  implemented,  the

students  will  have  to get up  very  early  in  the

morning,  say  at 5.30 a.m. or so, or else  they  will

miss the time for the first session to start, say  at 7.30 a.m. In these places, there is a long travelling

time between the school and the home, so the students

have  to stay back in school for lunch and reach home

quite  late after school. But in Singapore, it is  so

small  that  full-day schooling may  not  necessarily

bring  any good to our education system. This  is  my

personal view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other questions which I think I will avail

myself  of the opportunity to ask the Senior Minister

of  State  to clarify. The Member for Anson has  said

that  it is necessary for schools to have telephones.

I support his view and I would like to ask the Senior

Minister  of  State whether he has any  intention  of

installing  telephones in schools which do  not  have

them  now,  particularly the schools in  the  islands

around  Singapore. Today when I read the newspaper  I

learn that TAS could also install radio telephones in

cars, which have a range of 500 miles. So I feel that

we  can use this sort of radio telephone to reach the

islands where telephone wires are not suitable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards recruitment of teachers from Britain, I

do  not  know  whether the Ministry of  Education  is

aware  of  the  advantages or  disadvantages  of  the

teaching methods of these teachers. Perhaps we cannot

say  that  their teaching method is no good  but,  as

regards accent. I think it is greatly different  from

the  accent of Singaporeans. I have heard the  report

that   even   our  principals  and  teachers   cannot

understand  the  English as spoken by  them.  Perhaps

some  of  these  teachers have  been  recruited  from

Scotland  or  Ireland where the accent is  so  strong

that it cannot be understood easily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other issue of official communications. I

feel  that  letters or notices to schools  should  be

signed  by  the officer-in-charge and  not  just  any

subordinate  officer signing on his  behalf.  If  the

senior  officer-in-charge signs it  personally,  this

will    indicate    that   he   is   accepting    the

responsibility. He cannot consider it a waste of time

to sign an official communication. It is his personal

duty  to do so. The matter of too many correspondence

is another matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards school names, since we are promoting bilingualism, it is best that school names on

signboards  should  be  in two  languages  at  least,

particularly Government schools. Of course, we cannot

expect  the  older generation to understand  English.

But  there  are pupils who go to a Government  school

who  do  not  even  know the name of  the  school  in

another  language.  So Government schools  should  at

least  have  two  languages  written  on  the  school

signboard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards simplified Chinese characters, the Senior

Minister  of  State  has told us that  we  have  gone

through  two  stages  in  simplifying  characters  in

Chinese.  So  if there is any doubt on  the  part  of

Members,  they  can buy the revised  edition  of  the

compendium of simplified Chinese characters from  the

Educational Publications Bureau, because most of  the

new  simplified characters used can be found in  this

booklet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Member for

Jurong asked me when we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1305</b></font><br><br>



going to implement post allowances for principals.  I

think we cannot fix a date. Since the Government is a

large  organisation, I cannot predict a  date  before

the  issue  is decided. But I can say there  will  be

news about it sometime in the middle of the year.  Is

the Member satisfied?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member touched on accent. This is not something

which I can solve. It is a complicated matter. What I

want  to  stress is that before these  teachers  were

placed  in  the  schools, they  had  gone  through  a

special consultation session with the principals  and

education  officers  from  the  Ministry, concerning

local   problems, our  education  system   and   its

particular  requirements,  so  that  they  will   not

transmit  their own idiosyncracies into our  schools.

They  have to fit into our local situation.  What  we

want of them is to fill our present need for teachers

of English language, as we are short of such teachers

at the moment. There is really nothing much we can do

about the accent of any of these teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards telephones, of course, we can install

telephones  in  Government schools.  But  to  install

telephones  in  schools  in the  islands  is  a  very

expensive undertaking. Gradually most of the  schools

on  the  Outlying  islands will  over  the  years  be

transferred to the main island. In respect  of  those

schools that will stay there for a long time. I  will

look  into  the  possibility of providing  them  with

telephones or radio-phones.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards aided schools, the power is in the hands

of the school management committee concerned. In some

cases   where   the   installation   involves   large

expenditure, it will be difficult to persuade them to

install.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, I must say that I am

impressed  by  the Senior Minister of State's  reply,

not  so much for his answers to the questions but his

delivery, which was so impressive yet evading some of

the  answers,  and getting away with  it.  Take,  for

example, the several questions that I have raised.  I

will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>



just refer to one of them. I asked how much money did

the  various secondary schools spend on buying  those

technical drawing instruments. His answer was.  "less

than  500  sets." 500 sets gives one  the  impression

that it was not very much, but if you do a little bit

of multiplication, each set costing more than

$30 --



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> $5 for your information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> In his favourable reply to the

point  raised by the Member for Jurong and the Member

for  Jalan  Kayu  in  regard to the  post  allowance,

together  with  my  two  colleagues  I  welcome  this

positive  response. As a trade unionist, naturally  I

always  welcome any increase of salary  for  anybody,

but  I would like to seek some clarification and also

to  make certain comments. His reply is quite  vague.

Do  I  take  it  to  mean that  this  will  give  the

principals  a  post  allowance  additional  to  their

present  salaries?  Let  me  explain.  In  1972   the

Education   Service  went  through  a   restructuring

exercise.  Many  of  the principals  then  had  their

salaries plus their post allowances incorporated into

their present salaries. Do I take it (I mean, this is

too  good  to be true) that in addition to  the  post

allowances that they had before and which had already

been incorporated into their present salaries, a post

allowance is being considered? If that is so, it  is

very good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is, if that is so, what about the

senior  assistants? Let me explain, and this is  very

important for morale purposes. Before 1972  when  the

principals were drawing post .allowances, the  senior

assistants were also fighting for post allowances  of

a  smaller quantum. These senior assistants  are  not

just  ordinary  teachers. They are, in  actual  fact,

manning a school. Because of a shortage of schools in

Singapore, we had to put two schools into one  school

and call them two-session schools. Actually speaking,

each school is composed of two schools of one session

each.  So there has to be a person who is the  senior

assistant to run the afternoon school. Prior to 1972

the senior assistants could not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>



even  get  any kind of recognition for an  allowance.

They  were  not  asking  for the  same  quantum.  But

subsequently  all these allowances were  incorporated

into the salaries for principals. Now that the Senior

Minister  of  State  is  considering  giving  a  post

allowance  for  the principals, that  is  very  fine.

Would  not  the Minister of State also consider  some

kind  of  post allowance of a lesser quantum for  the

senior  assistants,  because they  have  to  run  the

afternoon schools themselves?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Sports secretaries, who would want to

do  the  onerous  duties of a Sports secretary  in  a

school?  I think it is only fair that they should  be

considered also. The Member for Jurong has  mentioned

about   senior  subject-teachers.  These   were   the

teachers  who  had a post allowance  before  but  was

subsequently abolished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make it clear that this is the best news

that  the Senior Minister of State has given us  with

regard  to the post allowance for principals  because

they  hold certain responsibilities. But for purposes

of  morale for the whole teaching service, there  are

other  categories that he should not  forget.  It  is

just  like  the  Government  deciding  to  give   the

Permanent Secretaries a wage increase and leaving out

the   Deputy  Secretaries  and  Principal   Assistant

Secretaries, and so on. This is not good for  morale.

Could  the  Minister for Education go just one  small

step   forward,   since  he  has   already   made   a

breakthrough  in  this  very  difficult  matter,  and

include a few more other deserving cases? After  all,

he  has mentioned that there must be fairness. On the

basis  of  equity and fairness, we should  not  leave

other  categories that merit consideration. I am  not

saying that they should all be paid the same quantum,

but of a varied quantum. Some form of recognition  is

important.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I can only

reply in this manner. This question of post allowance

for  principals has not yet been finally decided.  It

is  still  in  a  stage  of final  consultation,  and

therefore  this  is not the proper  time  for  me  to

announce  it. But I sympathise with what  the  Member

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>



Moulmein says, and I shall direct my attention to the

points  that he raised. Since he is the President  of

the  Singapore Teachers' Union, he has  the  duty  to

raise them. But we must not forget that to traverse a

hundred  steps  we  can only do  it  one  step  after

another.  There is always a step that lies ahead.  So

it is endless. Therefore, the question is, when do we

stop?  Once you decide to stop, there may  be  people

who  are unhappy. I am not saying "Yes" or "No".  But

whether  we  stop or take a step further, there  will

always  be another step ahead. So there are bound  to

be   people   who   are  unhappy  in   the   process.

Nevertheless  we  have  to  make  a  start   sometime

somewhere.  Of course, by that we wish we could  make

everybody  happy  but we cannot. If most  people  are

happy, that will be good enough.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Do not get excited

yet,   Mr   Deputy  Speaker,  Sir.  Originally,   the

spearhead  of  my  attack this year is  not  directed

against  the  Ministry of Education. When  I  made  a

deeper  study of the achievements of the Ministry  of

Education  over the last one year. I found  that  the

performance  is really not bad. But I am particularly

impressed  by the performance of the Senior  Minister

of  State  in  his  manner  and  style  in  answering

questions,  which could be said to be  wonderful.  He

has  been very adept in avoiding certain major issues

but  picking on the lighter ones. He has got the  air

of magnanimity of a Confucian scholar. That really is

"admirable".   The   debate   went   over   to    the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister  for  Foreign

Affairs, then  to the Member for Boon Lay  regarding

the  remarks  made by him, and now  the  Ministry  of

Labour  is also involved in the fray. The Member  for

Boon Lay said that the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister for Foreign Affairs was quoting him  out  of

context.  It  is very strange, but the  crux  of  the

matter  boils  down to the question of education.  If

you  look at the Sin Chew Jit Poh and Nan yang  Siang

Pau  newspapers  you  will notice  that  they  report

differently, even on the same debate in  this  House.

This is really a question of education. So you cannot

say that the Ministry of Education was doing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>



things stealthily and trying to change some system. I

think  the  main point is the standard of Chinese  in

Singapore. When the standard of English is  poor, we

have  gone  out of our way and taken the  trouble  to

recruit  teachers from Great Britain with the  native

accent of English - well and good. My spoken Mandarin

is  also  not on par with good norm. But the question

is,  when  you  have a lower standard of  Chinese  in

Singapore, who is complaining? Where are  we  to  get

the teachers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Nanyang University.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): We have many

graduates from Nanyang University in this House. I do

not wish to offend them. The question is, if we go to

the   Government  departments,  like  the   important

Ministry  of National Development which is a gorgeous

building,  we will see this Chinese inscription  over

the lift door:() (Dian ti zai bao yang) (The lift  is

recuperating.)  This  is  not  Chinese.  This  notice

translated into Chinese does not sound Chinese. After

some  investigation I found that the  characters  are

Japanese,  yet they are used as Chinese and  hung  up

there. Every year in the National Day celebrations we

see  all  kinds of PA, and other banners and buntings

with slogans, written in very poor Chinese, hung  all

over Singapore. Who is there to complain? How to  get

teachers  to  rectify it? It would  appear  that  the

Minister  for Education has to look into the question

of  poor standard of Chinese in Singapore. The  Prime

Minister  has  said ours is bilingual  education.  We

have  to  find  a balance in bilingual education,  we

cannot  and  must  not implement bilingual  education

with emphasis on one language only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of allowances, from the Ministry of

Labour's  point  of view, I am a little  apprehensive

because we are trying to rationalise wages and not to

raise salaries indiscriminately. That is the duty  of

the Ministry of Labour. If, as the Senior Minister of

State  has  said, this post allowance is still  in  a

stage of consultation and therefore not convenient to

deal with it in this House, so to both of them I  can

only quote the words of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>



the  Member for Anson in this House on the 14th March

about  how to spend money. May I quote from col.  841

of  the verbatim report dated 14th March so that both

the  Senior Minister of State for Education  and  the

Member  for Moulmein can adopt as a guiding principle

in   their  bargaining.  If  that  is  observed,  the

Ministry of Labour shall be more at ease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson was referring to an Indian

poem.  I do not know Tamil but I will try to read  it

in Tamil. The Member for Anson read this in Tamil and

I quote:



<pre>

 'Iyarralum eattalum kathalum

 Katha vakuthalum vallathu arasu'

</pre>



For  the  benefit of the other language interpreters,

as  some  of them are scratching their heads.  I  now

read  out  the  translation by the Member  for  Anson

himself  given  there, so that the other  Members  in

this  House  can also understand, and I hope  my  two

colleagues, the  Senior  Minister  of   State   for

Education and the Member for Moulmein will follow  me

and heed this advice:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In English):

<pre>

    "To explore better ways for revenue,

    To save and safeguard the same,

    And to spend it wisely,

    Is the duty of the Government."

</pre>



<br><br>I  hope  that  they  will bargain according  to  this

principle, so that the Ministry of Labour  will  have

no  cause to intervene in the negotiation. It will be

very unpleasant otherwise. Thank you.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head W be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead BAA 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after that marvellous debate, it is with some

fear  and trepidation that I touch upon this subject.

I  would like to bring up the Ministry of Education's

plans  and  the  manner in which it  administers  the

education of handicapped children. I shall quote  the

example  of children who are born deaf or who  become

deaf  at  an early age, but I would like to  make  it

clear  that  this is intended only as an illustration

and I do not intend that any action that the Ministry

could  take  should be confined only to education  of

deaf children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude of the Ministry seems to be that the

primary  responsibility for  the  education  of  deaf

children should be left in the hands of the Singapore

Association  for  the  Deaf  which  is  a   voluntary

organisation supported by donations from  the  public

and  that  the  Ministry should only  complement  the

service  of  such a voluntary organisation.  I  agree

that  there  is a place, and an important place, for

voluntary organisations in this field but the efforts

of  such  organisations should be directed  to  those

areas where the Government is not providing a service

to  the population at large. For example, we have not

reached   a   stage  in  Singapore  where   preschool

education is provided by the Government. It  is  well

known that the first few years of a child's life  are

the  most crucial years in the learning process of  a

child  and  that what is done in these initial  years

can  determine the child's whole future in  terms  of

capacity  to learn in later life. This is  even  more

important for deaf children who need to be exposed to

specialised teaching at an early age so that they can

learn  some  form  of  communication.  Deaf  children

cannot  learn  to speak, as not being able  to  hear.

they cannot imitate sounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of the word "dumb" with its implication of

stupidity to describe a mute is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>



a  tragedy.  Deaf children have often  just  as  much

innate  intelligence as other children. Deaf children

need to be enrolled into preschool classes at the age

of  two  or  three years so that they have  a  proper

foundation to cope reasonably with primary education.

Parents of deaf children need to be educated also  so

that   they  can  be  effective  partners  with   the

specialists  in  educating  and  bringing  up   their

children.  There is also a need for special equipment

to  help deaf children to learn both academic as well

as   vocational  subjects.  The  public   at   large,

including employers, also need to be educated on  how

to  deal with and employ such deaf people. All  these

are  areas  which  are the proper  responsibility  of

voluntary    organisations   like    the    Singapore

Association for the Deaf, but the provision of  basic

primary education, and for those who make the  grade,

secondary  education should be the responsibility  of

the Ministry of Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a School for the Deaf built with gifts from

the  public. It has 20 classrooms capable of handling

40   classes,  putting  the  morning  and   afternoon

sessions  together. At present, only 33  classes  are

conducted and classrooms are empty although there  is

a  waiting  list  of  77 children  for  admission  to

primary  school. These children on the  waiting  list

are  more than seven years old and some are even  ten

years old. They cannot be admitted because there  are

not  enough  teachers. These 33 classes conducted  at

present  are  handled by 20 teachers,  including  the

principal, provided by the Ministry of Education, six

teachers  by the Social Welfare Department  and  nine

teachers  employed by the Association for  the  Deaf.

The   Association  does  not  dare  to  recruit  more

teachers  to  cater  for those on  the  waiting  list

because  it is not confident that it will be able  to

raise sufficient funds to keep these classes going on

a  continuous  basis. In spite of the fact  that  the

Ministry   of   Education  and  the  Social   Welfare

Department  provide three-quarters of the  staff  for

the  school,  the  major part  of  the  Association's

annual budget goes towards the employment of teachers

in the school. The Association also runs a vocational

institute and I have not even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>



touched on the problems connected with this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore find that, instead of the Association

concentrating on those areas which require attention,

such  as  the  provision  of  very  early  pre-school

education,  the education of parents,  etc, which  I

have already mentioned, the Association has to expend

its  resources  on  the provision  of  basic  primary

education.  It has, for example, 70 children  on  the

waiting  list for pre-school, in addition to  the  77

that  I  have already mentioned, for whom it  is  not

able to provide a place. What I would like to know is

when  is  the Ministry going to take over and provide

basic primary education to such children. The parents

of  such  children are also taxpayers and  I  see  no

reason  why their children's primary education should

not  be  funded out of general taxes as the education

of other children are funded. It seems a crying shame

for children who are already of schooling age to wait

past  the  normal  age  for commencement  of  primary

education because of the shortage of teachers. If the

Ministry claims that funds are not available for such

teachers.   I   think   this  would   be   stretching

credibility too far as I do not think it can be  said

with  any  justification that the  Government  cannot

afford to take on the complete responsibility for the

primary education of such children. The cost will not

cripple   the  Government.  The  children   who   are

handicapped ask no more of the Government than normal

children and they deserve, Sir, no less.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Chong Tee (Changi):</b> Sir,I have two points to

make. The first concerns the drop in the standard  of

English  in  our  schools  and  the  recruitment   of

expatriate  teachers. The second point  concerns  the

great number of relief teachers which the Ministry of

Education has recruited in our schools. Although  the

Hon.  Minister had already briefly explained my first

point, I would like here to elaborate further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is unfortunate but true that the standard of

English in our schools has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>



dropped  steeply  in recent years. According  to  the

Ministry  of  Education, this is due largely  to  the

poor  standard of English of the teachers themselves.

An  increasing number of expatriate teachers has been

recruited  from Britain to remedy this situation.  In

the  past  year  alone. 13 expatriate teachers  were

employed.  Whether  or not these expatriate  teachers

will  improve the standard of English in our  schools

has yet to be seen. However. I would like to draw the

attention  of the House to a number of dangers  which

we  may encounter if we employ more and more of these

teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, an expatriate teacher may have an ulterior

motive  in  coming here. A typical example  is  Brian

Maurice,  former History teacher at the United  World

College, who was involved in the Euro-communist  plot

against  the  popularly  elected  PAP  Government.  I

wonder  how  much  distorted  information  about  the

Government  and the PAP leadership had  already  been

fed to his counterparts in Europe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the social values and life-styles of these

European teachers may have an adverse effect  on  our

youth.  Our  youths in primary and secondary  schools

are still too young to know what is good and what  is

not  so  good  for them. If they are exposed  to  the

influence  of  these  expatriate teachers,  they  may

adopt  the social values and life-styles of the West.

In  other words, we are indirectly importing  Western

social  values  and  lifestyles, and  although  these

teachers  are  engaged  on a short-term  we  may  not

realise the harm that it can do to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the employment of expatriate teachers may

cause  discontent among our citizens  as  it  somehow

denies  our  citizens  opportunities  of  employment.

Apart  from the dangers which I have highlighted,  we

should  also  consider the cost  of  employing  these

expatriate teachers. Not only do we pay them handsome

salaries  to  attract  them to our  clean  and  green

Singapore,  we  are  also  paying  them  a  host   of

allowances,  including return air trips, possibly  in

our  well-known  airline. With this recruitment,  the

expenditure on expatriate teachers is expected to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>



increase  by almost 300% this year. Thus, it  is  far

more expensive to employ an expatriate teacher than a

local  teacher.  I  wonder whether  the  Ministry  of

Education has weighed carefully the cost and  benefit

of   employing  expatriate  teachers.   A   continued

employment  of  such  teachers  should  be  carefully

considered,  and only when the benefits outweigh  the

cost. We must spend our money wisely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we can think of the benefits of employing

expatriate  teachers,  we must  first  find  out  the

principal cause of the declining standard of  English

in our schools. Has the Ministry of Education made  a

detailed  study of the problem to determine  what  is

the  real cause of this decline? We must bear in mind

that  besides the lack of qualified English  teachers

in our schools, there may be some shortcomings in our

present  educational system which may be  responsible

for  the poor standard of English. Perhaps, the rapid

changes  in  the educational policy in  recent  years

have  caused  confusion among teachers and  students.

Furthermore, our youths in schools may not be able to

adapt  themselves to such rapid changes.  Hence, the

decline  in the standard of education in general  and

English in particular.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our method of examination may also be a cause for

the  declining standard of English. In schools,  both

teachers  and students are examination-oriented.  The

student's  main concern is to pass the  examinations.

Little  thought is given to improving both  oral  and

written  English. Presently, more emphasis is  placed

on technical education to satisfy the requirements of

our  industries. Possibly, this is another cause  for

our declining standard of English. More resources are

channelled   into   the  development   of   technical

education,  which over-rides the object of  improving

the standard of English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having given the number of possible causes for

the present state of affairs, I hope the Ministry  of

Education  would  look into them more  deeply  before

making any justification for the recruitment of  more

and more expatriate teachers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the employment of expatriate

teachers  is  the  only  solution  to  this  critical

problem.  I  am all for the employment of  expatriate

teachers  to help us improve the standard of  English

in  Singapore  if  this is the only solution  to  our

problem  and  if  the commitment of these  expatriate

teachers in our Republic are not prejudicial  to  the

welfare  of our people and the security of Singapore.

Alternatively, has the Government thought of  sending

our teachers to Britain for training? If our teachers

can  be trained to do the work as efficiently as  the

expatriate  teachers, then I see  no  reason  why  we

should  employ them from overseas, particularly  from

Britain  which  the Member for Anson  has  mentioned.

This will be cost-saving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point I would like to raise is the

shortage  of teachers, which warrants the  employment

of  many  relief  teachers. If  relief  teachers  are

required to cover teachers who go on maternity leave,

national  service, and on annual study leave, is  it

not possible for the Ministry of Education to form  a

pool   of  relief  teachers?  The  number  of  relief

teachers  is  quite substantial, so  they  should  be

given  proper training at the Institute of Education.

Since the future of our children lies in their hands,

it is absolutely essential that these relief teachers

are  offered proper training so that they can perform

their  duties  more  effectively. I  understand  that

there  are  some  teachers who have  completed  their

training in the Institute of Education but are  still

employed  as  relief teachers. Some of them  have  to

work  for  a period of two to three years  as  relief

teachers before they are offered permanent posts. Why

is  this  so?  In  spite  of the  acute  shortage  of

teaching  staff  in schools, why are these  qualified

teachers  not  considered  for  permanent  employment

immediately  after graduating from the  Institute  of

Education?
