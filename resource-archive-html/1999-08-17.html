<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>COMPANIES ACT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Review)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Sin Boon Ann</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether

the  Government is planning to undertake in the  near  future  a

comprehensive  review  of  the Companies  Act  and  its  related

legislation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1993</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the last round of amendments to the Companies  Act

was  passed  in  November  last year. The  amendments  involved,

amongst  other  issues,  the  introduction  of  share  buybacks,

updating  the law on the concept of "deemed interest"; extending

the  lifespan  of employee stock options to 10 years;  excluding

trade  franchises  from  the ambit of  the  Companies  Act;  and

extending the life of unit trust prospectuses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is presently working with other agencies such

as  the  Monetary  Authority of Singapore (MAS),  the  Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC), the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES),

the  academic community and private sector practitioners on  the

recommendations of the Corporate Finance Committee (CFC). A  CFC

Working  Group  has  been formed which meets regularly  to  work

through  the  CFC recommendations.  There will be  consequential

changes to the Companies Act as a result.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned in my reply to Mr Sin during the Budget

debate  earlier  this  year, I believe it is  more  prudent  and

practical  to  progress  in stages to improve  the  Act  and  to

introduce changes which are needed urgently, rather than try  to

do a comprehensive review all at once as this will take quite  a

long  time.   Otherwise, the total overhaul of the Act  at  this

time will hold back other changes unnecessarily.

<div align="center"><b>BANKS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Imposition of service charges on small savers)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister (a)

whether  the  imposition of service charges by  banks  on  small

savers will erode the value of savings and cause difficulty  for

lower  income families to operate bank accounts; and (b) whether

the  new  policy  of the banks runs counter  to  the  aim  of  a

cashless society.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  banks  are commercial entities.  Any services or  products

that they provide have to make

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1994</b></font><br><br>

business  sense.   The fees they charge for these  services  and

products are commercial decisions.  MAS does not interfere,  but

it  expects all financial institutions to conduct their business

activities,  including dealings with customers, in a transparent

and  professional manner, and in keeping with the guidelines set

by their respective industry associations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks, whether local or foreign, incur costs in servicing

customers.  They need to impose appropriate charges  to  recover

these costs.  Some foreign banks in Singapore have already  been

imposing  charges  on saving accounts for  a  number  of  years.

These  charges  cover the costs of generating and  mailing  bank

statements,  operating teller counters, providing  ATM  services

and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until recently, local banks have been absorbing the costs

of providing saving accounts to customers.  These costs had been

partially offset by cross-subsidies from larger accounts and non-interest   bearing  current  deposits.   But  the   increasingly

competitive banking environment is making it difficult for  them

to cross-subsidize certain groups of customers with others while

maintaining  overall  competitiveness.   Banks  are  also  under

pressure from customers to pay interest on current accounts  and

improve their level of services, all of which involve additional

costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some local banks have therefore decided to impose charges

on  these accounts.   MAS has to allow them to do so, to compete

on  a  level  playing  field  with foreign  banks.   Banks  will

undoubtedly  phase  in  the  introduction  of  new  charges,  to

maintain customer relationship and goodwill and allow them  time

to adapt.  Banks will also have to actively find ways to service

customers  efficiently  at the lowest cost  possible  to  remain

competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is considerable competition among banks in Singapore.

This  competition  will ensure that charges are  reasonable  and

affordable,  although  not free.  Customers  can  choose  freely

which bank to use. A bank that imposes

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1995</b></font><br><br>

excessive charges or offers poor services will lose customers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customers also have a role in minimizing bank charges they

incur.   For example, customers who operate several small saving

accounts  concurrently may find it makes  sense  to  consolidate

these  accounts into one.  This will minimize the costs to banks

of  providing  these  accounts, and in  turn  the  charges  they

impose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks service charges do not run counter to our push

towards a cashless society.  A cashless society will hinge on  a

reliable,  secure,  efficient and extensive  electronic  payment

system.   This involves some costs. The challenge is to build  a

system  that will be more efficient, convenient, and  economical

to use than cash.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, is the Government in

support  of  the  banks'  imposition of such  charges  on  small

savers,  and whether the Government will consider the impact  on

lower income families who need to operate a bank account to  pay

in their salary or whatever by allowing the banks to impose such

charges by the MAS?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> There is an impact whenever there is a

charge which is levied, but it is not a matter for MAS to decide

or  not to decide, because MAS has never had any rule to require

banks  to  provide  free services.   There  are  many  banks  in

Singapore.   Some  are  focused on the smaller  savers  and  the

smaller customer segment of the market.  Some go for the  middle

or  higher  segment of the market.  And they have to charge  for

their  services.   It is a facility which many wage-earners  use

because  they  receive their salaries, they have  to  pay  their

bills and so on.  But, overall,  our philosophy in Singapore has

been  that  when  there  are costs, it is  best  that  they  are

reflected.   So, whether it is medical services, whether  it  is

your  utilities   -   electricity  and  water,  whether  it   is

telephones,  they  are all not for free, and  yet  everybody  in

Singapore   has   water,  electricity,  medical   services   and

telephones.  So there is really no argument

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1996</b></font><br><br>

to be made that banking services should be different.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would like to ask

the Deputy Prime Minister whether the provision of more manpower

intensive   services  such  as  teller  services   at   branches

constitutes  a significant proportion of the cost  of  providing

services to retail customers in general, and whether banks  will

move towards not only providing more cost efficient alternatives

but also educating their customers.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> These are costs which the banks will

increasingly  have to estimate, recognise and  minimise  as  the

environment  becomes more competitive.  When it is  a  protected

environment  and  you are just operating in  the  old  way,  and

everybody puts his money into the same few banks, big and  small

deposits,  then the banks are not under pressure  and  they  can

provide  services apparently free, which really cost  a  lot  of

money.   Every  ATM transaction costs maybe $1.50 to  the  bank,

because  you  have  to provide the software, the  hardware,  the

telecommunications,  the  services, reconciliation  and  so  on.

Every  counter transaction costs several dollars.   Some  people

tell me that it may be even more than $10, because there are  so

many branches and some branches have very few customers per day,

and  you  have to pay the rent, utilities, salaries and  so  on.

And the bank manager meets only 10-20 customers per day.  So the

costs are very high.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In America, there are teller charges. If you go to a

counter  in  order to do some transaction, you have to  pay  for

that  service.  If you use an ATM, you also have to pay for that

ATM.   One  way or the other, the cost will finally have  to  be

reflected.  Banks do not have infinitely deep pockets with which

to  generate largesse all round.  These are adjustments which we

can take a little bit of time but which, eventually, we have  to

make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, I am convinced that the banking services will

remain  affordable.  Singaporeans are not poor,  and  the  banks

have a great incentive to reduce their costs and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1997</b></font><br><br>

find  more  efficient ways of providing these services  so  that

they  can  break even and collect all the little deposits  which

are available outside there, because there is benefit to them if

they can reach out that way.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, may I ask the Deputy

Prime Minister that if DBS were to do the same thing, would  the

Government, as the largest shareholder, use its influence?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The Government, as the largest

shareholder, cannot act against the commercial judgment  of  the

banks.  DBS has only 40% Government ownership.  So they have  to

act in their commercial interest.  They have taken over POSBank.

There  is a certain understanding that POSBank has come  with  a

social mission and DBS inherits this social mission.  It is  not

something which they can wash their hands off.  There are  parts

of  it  which need to be gradually rationalised, eg,  the  lower

interest mortgage loans which POSBank used to provide and  which

DBS  has  said, over a period of a few years, it  will  have  to

adjust  those  to market rates.  Also, on deposits  and  savings

deposits,  some adjustments will be necessary.  But  I  am  sure

that they will take their time and do it in a moderate way.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constitueny Member):</b> Sir, is the

Deputy  Prime Minister saying, as I understand him, that because

banks are commercial institutions, they should be free to charge

whatever  they  like for whatever service they provide?   Is  he

saying  that any customer who has any complaint about any charge

that is made has no recourse anywhere, but has to accept it?  Is

it  not  time,  as  I  have asked before,  that  the  Government

considered  appointing  a  banking  ombudsman  to  receive   any

complaints  from any customers about any charge imposed  by  any

bank?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are five major

Singapore banks and 22 foreign banks with full licences which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1998</b></font><br><br>

provide  a  full  range of services.  There are 3  million  plus

Singaporeans  and  if  they do not like  the  way  any  bank  is

treating  them,  take their custom to another  bank.   And  many

banks,  including foreign ones, will be very happy to make  sure

that  you are properly treated and will not be unfairly charged,

because  it is foolish for them to do that.  They lose business.

If  you  feel  that the bank is not being fair to you,  you  are

fully at liberty to make a public row of it, and the matter will

be   debated.   And  you  can  make  a  representation  to   the

Association of Banks.  They will discuss it.  But this is a free

market, and that is the way the market works.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I have three

supplementary questions.  First, how many small account  holders

are  we  talking about?  Does the Deputy Prime Minister  have  a

sense  of  how many are, say,  below $500?  Secondly, would  the

Deputy  Prime  Minister consider the need for  transparency  and

clarity  in  banking charges, especially to give  small  account

holders  simple  terms which they can understand?   Thirdly,  he

mentioned  that the social mission of POSBank has been  changed.

Would he like to indicate how DBS and the Government, as a major

shareholder  in  DBS, see the change in the  social  mission  of

POSBank?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Firstly, on numbers, I do not have the

figures.  It depends on where you draw the line.  If you file  a

Question, I will try and look them up for you.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on clarity and transparency, I fully agree. That

is  one of the problems with the present arrangement.  There  is

no clarity and transparency.  You make a current account deposit

and  you  can  have $10,000 there and you are paid no  interest,

neither  do  they  tell  you  that you  should  really  be  paid

interest.  In other  countries, you would.  But in Singapore, we

just quietly do not talk about it.  Now that has changed.  It is

incumbent  not just on banks but on other financial institutions

-   brokers, stockbrokers, insurers, fund managers, unit  trusts

-  that when they provide a service, they should state quite

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1999</b></font><br><br>

clearly  what  is  their fee and what is your  investment.   For

example,  in  unit trusts, one of the factors which an  investor

must consider is how much of their payment is fee.  When you put

in  your contribution, it may be a significant amount that  goes

straightaway  to  fees.   Or when you buy  insurance  from  your

broker,  a  significant  amount  of  your  premium  may  go   to

commissions  to the broker or, if not, payments  in  some  other

form.   So  those should be made transparent, and similarly  for

banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for POSBank's social mission, as I have explained, we

have  not  abandoned this social mission, but this is  something

which has to be evolved and adjusted over time.  Where it has to

do with the POSBank's mortgage loans where the social mission is

really  the  weakest case, we are going to take  some  years  to

adjust  them  to  market levels.  In other  cases,  like  taking

deposits and encouraging savings, that is a mission which  needs

to  continue.   But  what form DBS should  choose  in  order  to

implement  this  mission is something which I  am  sure  DBS  is

considering now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Has the Government the responsibility

to  balance  commercial interests against social interests?   If

so,  what  approach would the Government take in  terms  of  the

current issue of bank charges on the small savers?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I have explained to the Member that

there  is  DBS  Bank with POSBank and they have to consider  how

this role will be implemented for their POSBank account holders.

For  the  others, it is a free market and they have  to  compete

against each other.  Whether it is PUB with utilities or Telecom

with  telephone  charges,  or  any other  essential  service  in

Singapore,  food, medical care, there has to be really  a  price

which  reflects the cost of providing that service.  Because  we

have followed that philosophy, therefore, we have prospered  and

nearly  everybody  can  enjoy  in  Singapore  a  full  range  of

essential  services  to the families.  95% have  telephones  and

television  sets.  So it is not a question of depriving  people.

It is a question of having the right system

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2000</b></font><br><br>

so that we can prosper and everybody will be able to enjoy these

services.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, on the issue of

transparency,  would it not be good for the banks,  firstly,  to

make  it  very prominent by displaying perhaps on their premises

the  rules  that they have in relation to not just small  savers

but  all  savers?  Secondly, there is a code of banking practice

which governs the relationship of banks with the customers  but,

to  my  knowledge, it is not even displayed or made  transparent

and  available to the consumer.  Would it not be timely  to  ask

the banks to do that, Sir?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> We can consider that. I am sure CASE

will add their voice to this.  It is really not just a matter of

what you paste on your doors, but the whole approach towards the

way you do business.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware that in

other  countries,  the  office  of  the  banking  ombudsman   is

maintained  by the banks themselves?  They see it  as  something

which  is  very good for their own business.  Has the Government

ever  thought of suggesting to the banks in Singapore that  they

should perhaps also move towards having a banking ombudsman?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, if the banks feel that it is

necessary,  I think they will work it out themselves.   In  this

case,  we  have an Association of Banks and they have a  certain

moral  suasion.  They have issued guidelines and I do not  think

there  is  any difficulty with banks not taking advice from  the

Association of Banks.  But there is no complaint before us today

that  the  banks have acted in a manner contrary  to  what  they

should do.  That they have to charge cannot be disputed.   There

is   no  allegation  that  these  are  unreasonable  charges  or

flagrantly exploitative.  I understand that the Non-Constituency

Member, as a matter of principle, thinks ombudsmen are good  and

they  work  in some countries.  As I have explained  before,  in

answer to him, we do not feel that we need one in Singapore.

<div align="center"><b>SUZHOU PROJECT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Financial statement)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether   the  Government  will  present  a  full  comprehensive

financial  statement on the Suzhou project  for  debate  in  the

House,  showing clearly where the monies for investment  by  the

Government and the Government-linked companies were taken from.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in my replies to Mr

Jeyaretnam on 3rd August 1999 and earlier on 14th January  1998,

I provided full details of the investments made by our statutory

boards and GLCs in the Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP) project.  To

date  these  investments amount to US$147 million.   The  amount

invested  by each statutory board and GLC is small, compared  to

the size of its operations.  They financed these investments  in

the  normal commercial manner, from reserves accumulated in  the

course of operations and from bank borrowing. They did so  based

on  commercial  considerations, after critically evaluating  the

project's viability.  Ten Singapore companies that are not GLCs,

and   four  non-Singaporean  multi-national  corporations,  also

similarly invested in the project.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam also suggested that the full financial

statement of the project be presented for debate in this  House.

This  is  not appropriate.  It is for the companies  which  have

invested  in the project to examine the project's finances,  not

for  Parliament.  These are mostly listed companies,  answerable

to  their shareholders for their own financial performance.  For

this  House  to  debate  the project's budget  is  to  change  a

commercial   undertaking  into  a  government  one.    This   is

unjustified and unwise.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> But does the Government not owe a duty to

the people whose money the Government itself, either directly or

through GLCs, has invested in the project?  Does this House  not

need to have a full audited statement of accounts?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2002</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, statutory boards and GLCs are set

up  specifically  to have greater operational  flexibility  than

Government  departments and to be able to  make  commercial  and

business decisions like other companies.  The responsibility  of

ensuring  that they are competently and honestly run rests  with

the supervising Ministries of statutory boards.  In the case  of

GLCs,  it  rests  with their board of directors  and  ultimately

their  shareholders, including the Minister for Finance  who  is

answerable to Parliament.  If any MP has reason to believe  that

a  statutory  board or GLC is not being competently or  honestly

run, he should raise the matter directly in the House either  by

filing a Question or moving a motion, and he will receive a full

answer,  as  the  Member has received very full answers  on  the

question  of  Suzhou Industrial Park.   However, it is  counter-productive   for  Parliament  to  second-guess  commercial   and

business decisions which are properly the responsibility of  the

management and boards of the statutory boards and GLCs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Does the Deputy Prime Minister accept or not

that he is playing with the people's moneys and he has a duty to

account to them for every cent?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, the game is not over. I have

explained  several  times in this House why we  went  into  this

project,  what the difficulties have been, how we have tried  to

turn  the  project around and what solution we have now  arrived

at.   The  solution will take several years to  work  out.   The

final  accounting is not done and the project  has  to  run  its

course.   There  is  no  suggestion that the  officials  or  the

companies  involved have been derelict in their duty, that  they

have  done this without due diligence and without making  proper

commercial  considerations.  They  have  gone  in  on  a  proper

commercial  basis.  These are statutory boards  and  GLCs  which

have to be assessed as statutory boards and GLCs, and not on the

basis  of  individual projects.  It is not Parliament's business

to become a deputy

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2003</b></font><br><br>

auditor  of  these companies.  They have auditors to  make  sure

they  have done things honestly.  They have boards to make  sure

they have acted commercially in a wise way.  I think if he looks

at  the track record of the statutory boards and the GLCs  which

have  invested in Suzhou,  he will find that overall  they  have

done well.  These are not bankrupt, broken-back companies.  So I

think we should leave them to do their business.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask why was Parliament not informed

and  its sanction sought before the Government entered into this

memorandum  of understanding and gave up a substantial  part  of

its equities?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, I do not understand. We have not

given up any equities.

<div align="center"><b>EM3 LANGUAGE STREAM STUDENTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Educational and vocational development)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Education  (a)  what was the trend regarding the number  of  EM3

language  stream students for the years 1994 to 1998;  (b)  what

schools these students were channelled to; (c) how many of these

students  enrolled  into polytechnics; and (d)  what  steps  his

Ministry  will take to enhance their educational and  vocational

development.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Peter Chen)</b>

<b>(for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I

provide  the  information asked for by Mdm Chiang,  I  think  we

should  remind  ourselves, first of all, why  we  have  the  EM3

stream.   Different pupils have different talents and abilities.

We  have  to recognise this in order to help each child progress

at  a pace he is comfortable with, so that he may develop to his

fullest  potential.  The EM3 stream is designed for  pupils  who

are  less academically-inclined.  They are just different.   For

these  pupils,  we tailor a curriculum which is  different  from

that  of  the  EM1  and EM2 streams, so that  they  acquire  the

language  and  numeracy  skills  to  prepare  them  for  further

technical  or  other training.  By customising  the  educational

programmes we deliver, we have helped more children complete  10

years  of  general  education.  Since Primary  4  Streaming  was

introduced  in 1991, the percentage of dropouts at  the  primary

level  has decreased from 1.9% of a Primary 1 cohort in 1990  to

0.4%  in  1998.   There is flexibility in the streaming  system.

For  those  who may develop a little slower, there are  "bridges

and  ladders" in place.  For example, Normal (Technical)  pupils

who  demonstrate  the  aptitude for academic  studies  have  the

opportunity  to  cross over to the Normal (Academic)  course  or

even  the  Express  course.   Each  year,  about  5%  of  Normal

(Technical)  pupils  cross  over to  Normal  (Academic)  stream.

Outstanding  graduates  from ITE also have  the  opportunity  to

pursue  a polytechnic education, and aspire for more challenging

and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2005</b></font><br><br>

rewarding technical careers.  In 1998, about 550 students gained

admission to the Polytechnics for full-time education, based  on

their ITE qualifications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1994 and 1998, the percentage of pupils streamed

into EM3 was fairly stable, averaging about 9% of all Primary  4

pupils.   In absolute terms, the number of pupils streamed  into

EM3  increased from 3,648 in 1994 to 4,587 in 1998,  due  to  an

increase  in the Primary 4 enrolment.  Pupils streamed into  EM3

at  Primary 5 continue their studies in their own schools;  they

are not channelled to other schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EM3 pupils are well-prepared for vocational development at

each stage of the education system.  From the first batch of EM3

students,  about  100  completed their `O'  levels  through  the

Normal  (Academic)  course and were admitted directly  into  the

Polytechnics earlier this year.  Most would, however,  typically

proceed  on  to  do the Normal (Technical) course  in  secondary

schools,  which  builds  upon their  EM3  curriculum  through  a

technically-inclined  and  practice-oriented  curriculum.    For

example,  Normal  (Technical)  course  students  study  Computer

Applications, a course which is not available to other secondary

school  pupils.   The Normal (Technical) course was  started  in

1994 largely to cater to these students who otherwise would  not

have attended secondary school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students who do complete the Normal (Technical) course can

proceed  on to post-secondary technical skills training  at  the

Institute  of  Technical Education (ITE). The  ITE  Centres  and

courses  underwent a major revamp which was completed  in  1992.

About  74% of all Normal (Technical) course students proceed  to

ITE.   As  I  mentioned  earlier,  many  more  move  on  to  the

polytechnics.   Upon graduation from ITE and  the  polytechnics,

they  can  take  up  highly rewarding careers in  technical  and

business fields, and help meet Singapore's needs for technically-skilled manpower.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Thank you,

Minister, for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2006</b></font><br><br>

the thorough reply.  Could I ask two supplementary questions?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, could the Senior Minister of State tell me what are

the  critical  familial  and  school  factors  that  affect  the

learning  abilities of these EM3 students?  What  can  community

agencies,  like FSCs, do to reinforce the effort of  MOE?   And,

second, does the Minister worry that the EM3 students may become

a  source  of  youth crimes and can we do more to keep  them  in

schools longer?

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> We will welcome any help anybody can give.

But  from  our  experience  of the first  batch  of  the  Normal

(Technical) stream students who have moved on to ITE, , we  have

seen  very  encouraging results.  96% of them passed  the  first

semester   examination  and  93%  passed  the  second   semester

examination.   Moreover, these students also  participated  very

actively  in  the  campus activities,  and  some  even  took  on

leadership roles in student councils.  We believe that everybody

should be given a chance, and that not everybody develops at the

same  pace.   And  I think our Normal (Technical)  stream  which

started in 1994 has proven us right.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Two supplementary

questions, Sir.  First, would the Senior Minister of State agree

that  while  the  objectives  of  EM3  are  laudable,  there  is

unfortunately a social stigma attached to some who  attend  EM3?

And  second, if he agrees to that, what can be done in order  to

reduce this social stigma attached to being an EM3 student?

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> I think the social stigma is the result of

a perception problem and a number of other things.  First, there

is  need for a process of education even for the public and  the

parents.  Perhaps the most important thing that has happened  in

the last two or three years has been the very positive publicity

that the media has given to this group of students.  I think  we

all  recognise - and that is the type of publicity that has been

given  -  that  they are not useless, they are  just  different,

which  is  what we try to emphasise.  Moreover, there have  been

many success

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2007</b></font><br><br>

stories  publicised by the media as well as by ITE and also  the

polytechnics which have shown many examples of people from  this

particular group who have successfully come through life.   They

are  just different, and we are all built differently, and  that

is a message which we have to get through to everyone.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Senior Minister of State in

his  reply  said that 5% of students from the Normal (Technical)

stream  were  transferred to the Normal (Academic)  stream  each

year.  I would like to know what is the number in the cohort  of

students  each  year  who  are  being  transferred  from  Normal

(Technical)  to  Normal  (Academic)  stream.   Secondly,  is  he

satisfied   that  this  number  of  students  being  transferred

represents   the  optimum  possibility  for  the  students   who

academically  have a higher ability at EM3 and are  able  to  be

transferred?   Thirdly, is he satisfied  that  the  Ministry  of

Education  and  the  schools have put in  enough  resources  and

effort  to  educate  EM3 students as well as Normal  (Technical)

stream  students in the secondary schools, given the  fact  that

they might have some problems in learning?  Is there any special

effort  or special training for the teachers to cope with  these

students?

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> The 5% represents about 180 or 200 students

who have gone over to the Normal (Academic) stream.  With regard

to whether that is the optimum number or not, there is really no

quota  or anything of that sort, and it is simply based  on  the

judgement  of the teachers and schools of what the students  are

capable of and the pace at which they are capable of.  There  is

no  point in pushing students beyond the pace that they can cope

with.   We do not want to push students to the level where  they

either give up completely or fail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to whether there are sufficient facilities and

help  given  to this group of students, the answer is definitely

yes.  There are special facilities and courses provided in these

schools, and some among these students are singled out and given

additional help.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> The Senior Minister of State mentioned

about the importance

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2008</b></font><br><br>

of  the  process  of education in helping to reduce  the  social

stigma  attached to some of the EM3 students.  Would the  Senior

Minister  of State then commit to intensifying this  process  of

education in order to further reduce the social stigma  attached

to  some of these students and help them build up their sense of

self-confidence?

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> The quick and short answer, definitely, is

certainly.   But I think there is only so much you can  do;  you

can  over-publicise as well.  I think the pace at which  we  are

going  is  very  satisfactory.   But  if  there  are  any  other

suggestions, we will be very glad to hear them.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, if you say that the

children  are  different, could we not remove  the  word  "EM3",

because  EM1, EM2, EM3 by labels do suggest a status difference?

So instead of calling it EM3, why not call it something else?

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> Short of asking Mdm Chiang to suggest what

the  label should be, I can tell her one thing.  Whatever  label

we  come  up with, everybody will soon find out.  It is  not  so

much  a  matter of a label.  It is a frame of mind and we really

need to constantly try to educate the whole population.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may

I  ask  the Minister a supplementary question?  There are Indian

students  who  are  offering Hindi,  Punjabi  and  other  Indian

languages.  Their marks are not weighted at Primary Four.  Would

the Minister consider reviewing the position in the near future?

<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> I have been advised that is a separate

question.  If the Member would be kind enough to file a Question

another time, we will answer it.

<div align="center"><b>CHILDREN NOT REGISTERING FOR PRIMARY SCHOOL</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Education  (a)  what  is  the educational  policy  for  overaged

children who are not admitted to normal school; and (b)  if  his

Ministry will create a separate school to help such students who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2009</b></font><br><br>

have  failed or dropped out and who now wish to make a comeback,

or  give  the  mandate to a community agency  to  start  such  a

school.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, any Singaporean child

aged  6 to 17 who wants an education in a mainstream primary  or

secondary  school will be able to have it, so long as  they  are

not  more  than  two  years  above  the  correct  age  for  that

particular  level.   This  rule is put in  place  for  practical

reasons   because  children  who  are  much  older  than   their

classmates  often  have great difficulty  fitting  in  socially.

Nevertheless, applications for admission of pupils who are  more

than  two  years above the correct age for the particular  level

are considered on a case-by-case basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, at each stage of education, there are

different  streams available.  The Member may  wish  to  suggest

different  names  for  them,  but there  are  different  streams

available  to  cater  to students with different  abilities  and

aptitudes so that they can study at a pace suited to them.   For

example, those students who are more able to do their `0' levels

in four years do it for four years; those who need five years do

it   in   five  years.   So  that  also  ameliorates   the   age

consideration and the overage issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put matters into perspective, the drop-out rate in our

schools  is  low  - 0.4% of a Primary 1 cohort  at  the  primary

level,  and  3.5%  at  the  secondary  level.   But  then  their

education  does not end there.  There continue to be educational

opportunities  beyond that if they choose to  do  so.   Overaged

children can have a second chance for education.  They can avail

themselves  of the different continuing education courses,  like

BEST  (which  take them up to PSLE level) and WISE  (which  take

them up to secondary level).  Those who have completed Primary 6

can  also  take up training at the vocational training  centres,

after  which  they  can progress to the Institute  of  Technical

Education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community or private organisations which wish to start a

school to cater to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2010</b></font><br><br>

overaged  children can do so.  They need to be  registered  with

the  Ministry  of  Education, to ensure that they  meet  certain

standards.   In  fact, there are already 3  private  schools  in

Singapore,  which  offer  a  curriculum  similar  to  mainstream

primary and secondary schools, and these are Our Lady of Lourdes

School, St Francis Methodist School and San Yu Adventist School.

These schools do take in pupils who are overaged.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> I would like to know from the

<div align="center"><b>MILITARY REGIME IN MYANMAR</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Assistance)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affairs  whether  the  Government  has  provided  or  given  any

assistance  to  the  military  regime  in  Myanmar,  apart  from

encouraging trade between Singapore and Myanmar.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, as a fellow member of ASEAN and a close neighbour,

Singapore  shares with Myanmar our experience  in  a  number  of

areas  through our bilateral technical co-operation  programmes.

Such programmes are primarily focused on helping Myanmar upgrade

its manpower and human resources and are funded by the Singapore

Co-operation  Programme  and  the Myanmar  Technical  Assistance

Fund.   Since  1993, some 1,850 Myanmar officials have  received

training  in  Singapore  in areas ranging from  agro-technology,

communications, and trade and tourism promotion.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2011</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister whether Singapore

provides  special  training for the intelligence  officers,  the

Special   Branch,  in  Myanmar  to  cope  with  the  dissidents,

supporters of the NLD?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as I know, no

such assistance is given.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I know whether Singapore exports any

arms to Myanmar?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it has been

stated  in  this  House before that as far  as  arms  sales  are

concerned,  it is a general policy of the Government neither  to

confirm nor deny arms sales to any country.  And I do not intend

to depart from that position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure this House, however, that Singapore pursues a

responsible  arms  sales  policy.  We honour  all  international

obligations   and   have  always  enforced  international   arms

embargoes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister to tell us what is

the  rationale for not disclosing to this House?  We know  that,

in Myanmar, it is not a lawful government which is in place.  We

have a military which has usurped the rights of the people.   Do

Singaporeans not have a right to know whether we are  supporting

this military government with our arms?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thought my position is

very  clear.   If  there  is a United Nations  Security  Council

embargo which enjoins its members from exporting any arms to any

country,  we  will, as a member of the United  Nations,  observe

that  embargo  and any other sanctions which  are  part  of  our

international  commitments.  As for the general policy  which  I

indicated  has  been consistently observed by Singapore  of  not

disclosing  arms  sales,  this  is  a  policy  adopted  by  many

countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second part of his question, the drift of his

question  shows  that  the Member has a strange  notion  of  how

modern  day diplomacy and international relations are conducted.

There are some 180 or more countries who are members

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2012</b></font><br><br>

of  the  United  Nations,  different  sizes,  shapes,  forms  of

government,  constitutional systems, degrees  of  representative

governments,  and most of them have international relations  and

interactions   with  each  other.   Countries   do   not   place

preconditions on the internal systems of government and policies

when   they  establish  diplomatic  relations  and  have  normal

international  interactions.  This is a  fact  of  international

life.   If  this were not so and if countries placed conditions,

then  very  few  countries  would be  able  to  have  diplomatic

relations  with  others.   This is not to  mean  that  countries

approve  and endorse everything that another country  does  when

they  have  diplomatic  relations.   Similarly,  for  Singapore,

Myanmar  is  a member of ASEAN, it is a member of the South-East

Asian  community,  and  we  have  international  relations   and

interactions with them just as the majority of the international

community do so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister saying that the Singapore

Government recognises the military regime, the usurpers, as  the

lawful  government of Myanmar?  And, secondly, will the Minister

tell us whether this constructive engagement policy of ASEAN has

borne  any  fruit, or has it only strengthened the will  of  the

military to further suppress the people?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have touched on the

constructive engagement policy of ASEAN on several occasions  in

this  House before and I will not repeat in detail what  I  have

said.   The  constructive  engagement policy  of  ASEAN  is  not

intended to dictate to the Myanmar government what it should  or

should  not  do.  It is referred to as a constructive engagement

policy  in  comparison with approaches taken by other  countries

and  regions,  which is to either isolate Myanmar or  to  impose

sanctions  on  them.   ASEAN  decided  that  it  would  adopt  a

different approach of integrating Myanmar within the ASEAN  fold

and,  in  that  process, encourage Myanmar  to  see  what  other

countries  in  ASEAN  are doing and, hopefully,  they  will,  in

course of time, achieve normalcy.  Within the ASEAN constructive

engagement policy, different members of ASEAN have engaged in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2013</b></font><br><br>

dialogue  with Myanmar to convey suggestions on various  matters

of  common interest.  This is the ASEAN way.  Whether it is  the

perfect  method, whether it will bear fruit and whether it  will

be successful requires judgement after some years have passed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister whether it has been

successful so far?  And, secondly, is he not aware that at least

two  other member states in ASEAN are having second thoughts  of

the wisdom of this constructive engagement?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> As to the latter part of his question, I

will  be interested to know if he can cite the chapter and verse

because, as far as I am aware - I chaired an ASEAN meeting, both

formal meetings and informal discussions as well as a retreat  - I  do  not know of any ASEAN member which has said that it would

abandon the policy of constructive engagement.  In fact, on  the

contrary, in the retreat and informal discussions, we  had  very

frank and candid discussions with each other, including Myanmar.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE CIVIL DEFENCE FORCE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Competence of paramedic and ambulance attendants)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

how his Ministry ensures that paramedic and ambulance attendants

of  the Singapore Civil Defence Force are competent and exercise

due  diligence  in  deciding whether a  person  is  in  need  of

emergency help.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho</b>

<b>Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, the

Emergency Ambulance Service of the Singapore Civil Defence Force

(SCDF)  is  currently  operated by SCDF paramedics  as  well  as

Ambulance  Officers (AOs) seconded from the Ministry  of  Health

(MOH).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to ensure that they are competent, SCDF paramedics

and AOs undergo

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2014</b></font><br><br>

rigorous training before becoming fully operational.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCDF paramedics are trained at SAF's School of Military

Medicine.  The paramedic training syllabus is recognised by  the

Paramedic   Academy  of  Justice  Institute,  British   Columbia

(Canada),  and endorsed by MOH.   The training lasts  18  months

and  includes  attachments to hospital Accidents  and  Emergency

(A&E)  departments and fire stations.   After  completing  their

training,  the paramedics undergo a programme of assessment  and

testing  by  senior  doctors  from MOH  before  being  certified

operational.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the AOs are registered nurses seconded from MOH. In

addition to their nursing training, they undergo pre-operational

training and the protocol conversion course similar to  that  of

the  paramedics.   The AOs undergo stringent assessment  by  the

Singapore  General  Hospital before  being  allowed  to  operate

independently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the paramedics and AOs are regularly re-certified to

ensure  that  their knowledge and skills are up to standard  and

updated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, do they exercise due diligence? The paramedics and

AOs are guided by a set of protocols and procedures drawn up  by

SCDF's  Medical Advisory Committee which comprises  a  group  of

specialists from various medical institutions.   Ambulance  crew

use  essentially  the same emergency/non-emergency  verification

system  adopted by the hospital A&E departments.   Nevertheless,

the  guiding principle for the paramedics and AOs is that,  when

in doubt, the patients are to be conveyed to the hospitals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides rigorous training and operational guidelines,

the SCDF also has an internal audit system to review cases where

death  occurs (eg, death on arrival).   There are also  frequent

and regular spot checks on the professional care provided by the

ambulance  officers and paramedics.   SCDF also  monitors  their

performance through feedback from the hospitals.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2015</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to assure the House that our ambulance

crew  are  competent and do exercise due diligence  in  deciding

whether a person is in need of emergency help.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I would like to ask whether the

Minister of State is aware of the recent case in which a student

was  attended to by a paramedic and who was certified to be  all

right but died later in hospital.  If so, would he like to  tell

this House what had happened to the case?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, certainly all of us are

aware of the case.  It is an unfortunate case.  But as there may

be  a  coroner's  inquiry, I cannot say very much  now  in  this

House.  But what I can say is that when the ambulance was called

the  Ambulance  Officer who attended to  the  boy  had  properly

carried  out  the assessment on him, according  to  the  set  of

medical   procedures   approved  by  SCDF's   Medical   Advisory

Committee.   Her  assessment was that  it  was  a  non-emergency

situation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> After this case, does the Minister of

State  see  the  need to revise the guidelines  because  it  may

apparently  be a wrong assessment resulting in the  death  of  a

person?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I think the question is

premature.   Like I said, there may be a coroner's inquiry.   He

is  assuming  that it is a wrong assessment.  What I  have  said

before   is  that  the  procedures  are  very  clear   and   the

instructions are that if in doubt, the patient will be  conveyed

to hospital.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, are there any

like  most  of  the CAs come from Government agencies  or  GLCs.

agencies or GLCs and not commercial entities?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, we have received enquiries from

various  organisations.  But so far, only  CISCO  and  Singapore

Post  have  publicly announced their decisions.  I suppose  once

the  other companies have made up their minds and decided to  go

forward,  they  will  then proceed to make their  announcements.

Secondly, in terms of the users, many of the users are  in  fact

Government   agencies  but  there  are  also   many   commercial

operations,  eg,  the  banks.  Many of the  banks  are  actually

active users of the system as well.

<div align="center"><b>ISSUES RAISED BY PRESIDENT ONG TENG CHEONG</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>AT HIS PRESS CONFERENCE ON 16TH JULY 1999</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statements by the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, on 16th July 1999, President Ong Teng Cheong  held

a  press  conference announcing that he would not stand for  re-election  as President. At this press conference, the  President

spoke  of what he described as a "long list" of problems he  had

encountered  in trying to protect past reserves. In  particular,

the President raised four issues:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) It would take the Accountant-General "52 man-years" to

produce the list of physical assets of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) One "unpleasant" encounter where he had to withhold

approval  of  a  statutory board budget because  it  would  have

caused a draw on its past reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Whether Net Investment Income (NII) should be treated

as current reserves or past reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) His "disappointment" that the Government did not need

him  to unlock the past reserves to finance its package of  cost

cutting measures, because it had changed its treatment of NII.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These issues concern the working of the Presidential

safeguards to protect past reserves. The Constitution  had  been

amended in 1991 to provide for a directly elected President  who

would have discretionary powers to veto the use of past reserves

and the appointment of key officials in the public service. Such

a  move  was  without precedent in any country. It was  a  novel

experience for both President Ong Teng Cheong, the first  person

directly elected by the electorate to this new office,  and  the

Government.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2019</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past six years have therefore been a mutual learning

experience  for the Government and the President. Many  problems

were  encountered and resolved. Both sides have worked  together

to  interpret  the  constitutional provisions,  and  to  develop

working   procedures   for  carrying  them   out.   The   agreed

understanding  is  contained  in  the  set  of  Principles   for

determining and safeguarding the accumulated reserves, which was

published as a White Paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now give the House a full account of the four issues

raised   by   President  Ong,  to  clarify  what  had   actually

transpired.  In  the  Government's  view,  these  problems  were

neither  fundamental nor intractable. They arose mainly  because

of  differences  of  opinion on the accounting  of  Government's

physical  assets, and difficulties that arose in  operating  the

new  system.  They were inevitable consequences of  the  two-way

learning process.

<br><br><i>Obtaining an Inventory of Government's Assets</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President had said it had taken the Accountant-General

"more than two, three years" to inform him what the Government's

reserves  consisted  of.  He said that  when  he  asked  for  an

inventory  of  the  physical assets, the Accountant-General  had

responded that it would take "52 man-years" to produce.  He  had

replied,  "Never  mind. Go ahead", and finally he  received  the

list plus diskettes a few months before the 1997 elections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House must wonder why it would take "52 man-years" to produce a listing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's office had requested a listing of physical

assets  from the Accountant-General, Mr Goh Khee Kuan,  on  18th

June  1996. At a meeting with the President on 14th August 1996,

less  than  two months later, the Accountant-General provided  a

listing  of  State  buildings, while the Commissioner  of  Lands

provided  a  listing of State lands. Updates  were  subsequently

sent to the President's office.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2020</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this meeting, the President remarked that to protect

past  reserves,  the reserves should ideally be  denominated  in

dollar value. In response, the Accountant-General conceded  that

following  accounting principles, one should take the  value  of

what  was protected at that point in time, but it would take  56

man-years  (not  52) just to value the existing  properties.  He

added  that  for the purposes of protection of the reserves,  it

did  not  matter when the valuation was actually  made,  and  it

could be at the point of sale. This was recorded in the minutes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"56 man-years" does not mean it takes 56 years to complete

the  task. A man-year is a measure of the amount of work  to  be

done,  and not of the time it will take to do it. It means  that

it  takes 56 men working for one year, or 28 men working for two

years,  or  one man working for 56 years. It is not unreasonable

for  a team of 56 men to take one year to value the entire stock

of  land and buildings owned by the Government. The land was  in

some 50,000 parcels, including miscellaneous parcels like roads,

drains  and even some reservoirs.  Such land parcels had  to  be

verified through actual surveys.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the President's recollection of what the Accountant-General had said was mistaken. The Accountant-General did not

say  that  52  man-years were needed to  produce  a  listing  of

physical  assets. He actually said that it would  take  56  man-years  to  conduct a complete valuation of the physical  assets.

Furthermore,  at the time he said this, he had already  produced

the listing that the President had requested. He did not produce

it  only  after two or three years, or only after the  President

insisted upon it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore clear that the Accountant-General and the

Government departments have cooperated fully with the President,

and  have not in any way sought to hinder the President  in  his

job of protecting the reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question whether to revalue all State properties at

each  changeover of Government had arisen earlier. On 15th  July

1996, the Auditor General had written

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2021</b></font><br><br>

to  inform the Ministry of Finance and the key statutory  boards

and  Government companies (Those listed in the 5th  Schedule  of

the Constitution.) that he would require all state properties to

be  revalued at market value as at the date of changeover of the

Government.  He  cited the Constitution, the  impending  general

election, and the Audit Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance sought the Attorney General's

advice  on  the  Auditor General's directive. On 30th  September

1996, the Attorney General's Chambers advised that, in so far as

the  directive  concerned land, such a complete revaluation  was

unnecessary  as  a  matter of law. It  did  not  result  from  a

Constitutional  need to protect the reserves,  as  the  question

whether past reserves were being drawn down did not arise unless

a  piece  of land is actually about to be sold off or alienated.

Furthermore, the proposed revaluation was a waste of  resources,

as  firstly the reality was that much of state land would remain

as  state  land, and secondly the value of each  piece  of  land

depended   on  planning  and  zoning  restrictions,  which   the

Government could change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry forwarded this opinion to the Auditor General.

The  Auditor  General then revoked his directive to revalue  all

properties  at changeover, stating that there was now  no  legal

basis to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to protect State lands and buildings in the reserves is

a  complex  issue  which the Government and  President's  office

subsequently   studied  in  much  greater   depth.   The   final

arrangements  agreed upon make up an entire  two-page  paragraph

(Paragraph 10 in Part A.)of the White Paper on Principles.

<br><br><i>Withholding Approval of a Statutory Board Budget</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Ong said that public officers should change their

mindset, and report to the President any improper transaction

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2022</b></font><br><br>

which may draw down the reserves. He said that he suspected that

some public officers in the Executive, including some ministers,

considered the President a nuisance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President cited as an example one "unpleasant"

encounter  when he had to withhold approval of the budget  of  a

statutory board. Its expenditure of $27 million had exceeded its

income surplus of $23 million, which would have caused a draw on

its  past  reserves.  He  said he was prepared  to  approve  the

drawdown,  but  there were problems because  of  its  accounting

system. He brought the matter to the Government's attention, and

the matter was resolved and he approved the budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statutory board in question is the Central Provident

Fund Board. The chronology of events is as follows.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 8th November 1996, the CPF Board put up its budget for

1997 to the President for routine approval. The budget showed an

operating surplus of $23 million. The submission was accompanied

by a declaration signed by the Chairman, Dr Andrew Chew, and the

General  Manager, Mr Lim Han Soon, that the budget was  unlikely

to  draw  on  the  Board's reserves which were  not  accumulated

during the current term of office of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 6th December 1996, the Principal Private Secretary to

the  President  informed  the CPF  Board  that  the  Council  of

Presidential  Advisors  (CPA)  had  noted  that  the  Board  had

budgeted  a  capital expenditure of $27 million, which  exceeded

the  budget surplus of the year by $4 million. The excess  would

have to be funded by the Board's accumulated surpluses. But with

a  changeover of government scheduled to take place soon, all of

the  Board's  accumulated surpluses would become past  reserves.

Therefore,  the CPA wanted the Chairman and the General  Manager

of the CPF Board to clarify the basis on which they made their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2023</b></font><br><br>

declarations, "knowing full well that there will  be  a  General

Election soon".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Manager replied on 7th December 1996 to explain

that the CPF Board accounts were on an accrual basis. In accrual

accounting, capital expenditure is depreciated over  the  useful

life  of  the asset, rather than in one lump sum in the year  of

expenditure.  The operating surplus of $23 million projected  by

the  CPF  Board had already charged annual depreciation  of  $11

million  against  the  year's income. Therefore,  there  was  no

drawdown  on past reserves, whether the elections were  held  or

not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Manager further explained that even on a cash

basis, the CPF Board would still project a budget surplus of  $7

million.   On  a  cash  basis, we would indeed  deduct  the  $27

million capital expenditure from the projected operating surplus

of  $23  million,  but  we  would also  have  to  add  back  the

depreciation  of $11 million. Otherwise we would  in  effect  be

deducting  the capital expenditure more than once,  erroneously.

The CPF Board's budget and accounts were thus in order and there

would not be any drawdown on the CPF Board's past reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the President did not accept the CPF Board's

explanation.  He  wrote to the Prime Minister on  16th  December

1996,  stating  that  he would approve the  budget  because  the

expenditure  was  not wasteful and was in the  public  interest.

However,  following the Constitution, he would be gazetting  his

opinion  that the budget was likely to draw on the past reserves

of the CPF Board after the changeover of Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government did not agree with the President's approach.

The   Prime   Minister  replied  the  next  day  repeating   the

explanation given by the CPF Board, and requested the  President

to  hold  back  gazetting his opinion. He suggested  that  since

there seemed to be a difference in interpretation of the budget,

we  should get the Accountant-General or the Auditor-General  to

state  whether  or  not  there would be a drawdown  on  reserves

following the changeover of Government.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2024</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President replied on 20th December 1996. He agreed to

hold  back gazetting his opinion, and stated that he would  also

hold  back  his  approval  of the budget  until  the  issue  was

resolved. In response to the Prime Minister's proposal  to  seek

the views of the Accountant-General and the Auditor-General, the

President wrote as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My duty does not include clarifying with the professional

bodies  the principles and interpretation. That duty  lies  with

the Government."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President also explained his reservations over accrual

accounting as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My concern here is that this approach (i.e. accrual

accounting)  will  allow  a profligate Government  to  hide  its

lavish spending under the guise of capital expenditures.  In the

final  analysis,  it  is  the Government  which  would  have  to

recommend  whether  this is a principle  that  should  guide  my

actions.   And in the absence of clearly enunciated and mutually

agreed  principles and procedures for dealing with such matters,

I would rather err on the side of stringency.  If the principles

had  been settled earlier, this uncertainty about what is or  is

not a draw would not have arisen."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accrual accounting is a standard practice not only in

statutory   boards   in  Singapore,  but  in  commercial   firms

worldwide.   Companies and statutory boards have auditors  whose

duty is to ensure that what are declared as capital expenditures

have in fact been properly spent on capital items.  Furthermore,

under the Constitution, the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman

must  declare  whether  the budget is likely  to  draw  on  past

reserves,  and board members and CEOs have a duty to inform  the

President of any proposed transaction which is likely to draw on

past reserves.  As an additional safeguard, the appointments  of

the  Chairman,  Board  and CEO of the key statutory  boards  and

Government companies are subject to the President's veto.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the President's stand, the Government took an

explicit   decision  reaffirming  that  statutory   boards   and

Government  companies should continue to prepare their  accounts

and   budgets  on  an  accrual  basis.  This  has   since   been

incorporated in the White Paper on Principles.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2025</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 27th January 1997, the Prime Minister wrote to the

President  seeking  his  agreement to  accrual  accounting,  and

explaining the safeguards in place.  On 30th January  1997,  the

President  replied stating that he had approved the CPF  Board's

budget and agreeing to the principle of accrual accounting.  But

he  still  said  that "the concern that a profligate  government

could  hide  its  lavish spending under  the  guise  of  capital

expenditure was not fully addressed."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This account of events makes clear that no public officer

failed in his duty to report a possible drawdown on reserves  to

the   President  in  this  instance.  The  Government  does  not

understand why the President regarded this genuine difference of

opinion as "unpleasant".

<br><br><i>Net Investment Income - Is it Current or Past Reserves?</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President raised the question of whether Net Investment

Income  (NII)  should  be treated as current  reserves  or  past

reserves.  He said that he had been told that according  to  the

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), NII constituted

current  reserves,  but  he was not  sure,  as  he  was  not  an

accountant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proper treatment of NII is not a question of opinion.

It  depends  on  the  constitutional  definition,  and  on  what

constitutes standard accounting practice.  On these matters, the

Government  does not act arbitrarily on its own. It takes  legal

advice  from  the Attorney General's Chambers, and  professional

advice  from  the  Accountant-General and  the  Auditor-General.

Similarly,  the  President  and the CPA  can  obtain  legal  and

professional advice, should they wish to. The Constitution  does

not  envisage either the Ministers or the President and the  CPA

having to be their own lawyers or accountants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain what exactly NII is. NII is the interest

and dividend income earned from investing Government's reserves,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2026</b></font><br><br>

net  of expenses on investment and debt servicing.  NII does not

include  any capital gains or losses that may be made  from  the

disposal  of  investments,  which are classified  as  Investment

Adjustments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Constitution, the President has custodial powers

over  "reserves  which were not accumulated during  the  current

term of office of the Government". The Attorney General's advice

is  that  this  definition does not cover NII,  because  NII  is

accumulated during the current term of office of the Government.

This  is  so  even when this NII is derived from investing  past

reserves   that   are  themselves  locked  up.  Therefore,   the

President's  second key does not extend to NII.   The  President

has not challenged this legal opinion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treating NII as current income is also the standard

approach under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President also said that the Government had locked up

NII  as  part of past reserves since 1992, but last year decided

that  "the NII should now belong to the current account".   This

is not accurate.  The actual situation is as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Constitution, NII is and has always been current

income.  The Government has not changed this treatment. However,

it  has  carefully studied whether it should do so, and lock  up

part  of NII as protected reserves, especially that part of  NII

earned from investing past reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a complex issue. We have to project the likely

state  of  the economy and the budget position of the Government

over  the  long term, to assess how much revenues the Government

will  have  and what it will need to spend.  This involves  many

uncertainties.  We must also weigh carefully the proper  balance

between restraining a profligate government on the one hand, and

allowing a responsible government enough flexibility to  operate

on  the  other.  The matter is not pressing, and  if  we  decide

hastily  and  make  a mistake, it will be difficult  to  reverse

later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the Government, not the President, who first raised

the issue of NII

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2027</b></font><br><br>

in January 1992, well before President Ong took office.  Against

a  backdrop of comfortable surpluses, the Government decided  to

take  the  more conservative stance of locking up  all  the  NII

earned  from  past  reserves, and to amend the Constitution  for

this  purpose,  not  immediately, but  after  about  a  year  of

implementation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, subsequently the Government did not follow up to

amend  the  Constitution.  Revised projections  of  revenue  and

expenditure showed that earlier expectations of continuing large

surpluses  had  been  too optimistic  The  Government  therefore

looked for more flexible alternative ways to protect the NII.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter has been discussed at length between the

Ministry of Finance, the Cabinet and the President's office. The

Government   seriously  studied  including  a   more   stringent

definition of NII in the White Paper on Principles.  It  finally

decided against doing so, because the present uncertain economic

outlook  made long-term budget projections difficult.  A  second

reason was that doing so would cause the Principles to go beyond

the  Constitutional provisions.  The Principles cannot  override

the  Constitution; they can only give effect to them.  A  future

government  would not be bound by the definition of NII  in  the

Principles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President and CPA have given their opinions, including

the  suggestion to lock away half of the NII from past reserves.

The  Government  has  carefully  considered  their  views.   The

suggestion to lock away part of the NII has merit.  But we  have

to  find the right basis for determining how much to lock  away,

as  a fixed proportion like 50/50 may not be appropriate for all

circumstances.   The Government therefore has  not  yet  made  a

final decision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 1999, the Government informed the President's

office that while it had earlier been inclined not to change the

status quo treatment of NII, it had relooked at the calculations

and concluded that there could be a case for protecting NII or a

significant part of it.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2028</b></font><br><br>

This  would  require a Constitutional amendment, rather  than  a

provision  in  the Principles which would have no  legal  force.

The  Government  needed time to study how best to  protect  NII.

This  study could lead to an amendment of the Constitution  next

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, while NII continues to be current reserves, the

Government  is  aware  of the problem which  the  President  has

highlighted, and has been working with him and the CPA to find a

solution.

<br><br><i>No Need to Draw on Past Reserves Because of NII?</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President also expressed his "disappointment" that the

Government declined his offer to unlock past reserves to finance

its  package  of  cost  cutting  measures,  and  said  that  the

Government  was  able  to  do  so because  it  had  changed  its

treatment of NII to count as current reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the Constitutional and financial position. As

I  have  just  explained, NII has always been  current  reserves

under  the  Constitution. In any case, the  Government  has  not

needed to fall back on NII at all, whether these constitute past

or current reserves, to fund its special packages and the budget

deficit.  Through careful financial stewardship, the  Government

has  accumulated sufficient budget surpluses within its  current

term  of  office for this purpose.  The budget surplus does  not

include any NII, because NII has always been an item "below  the

line" in the Government budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I informed this House during my FY99 Budget Debate round-up

speech on 9th March 1999, that between 25th January 1997,  which

is  the  day the present Government took office, and 31st  March

1998,  the Government had generated an operating budget  surplus

of  $6.3  billion.   After  taking  into  account  the  expected

deficits  in  FY98  and FY99, we would still have  a  cumulative

surplus of $368 million as at 31st March 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it has turned out, in FY98, instead of the budget

deficit of $466 million

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2029</b></font><br><br>

originally  estimated,  we achieved a  budget  surplus  of  $925

million.  Hence,  by the end of FY99, we now expect  to  have  a

cumulative budget surplus, since this Government took office, of

$1.8 billion, excluding NII.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Government has had no reason to ask the

President  to unlock past reserves, regardless of the  treatment

of NII.  This is a positive outcome of our prudent policies, and

not a cause for "disappointment".

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained that while there were difficulties between

the President and Government, they arose from honest differences

in  views.  The Government has extended full cooperation to  the

President and the CPA, and made no attempt to obstruct  or  show

disrespect  to the President.  Despite the problems encountered,

the Government remains committed to protecting past reserves and

making the institution of the President with custodial powers  a

success.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as

Members know, I had originally wanted to make this statement  on

3rd  August,  but decided to postpone it because the President's

wife  had  just passed away.  Ideally, this statement should  be

made  later  because  President Ong  Teng  Cheong  is  still  in

bereavement.   But  the  President's term  will  expire  on  1st

September and it would not be proper to make the statement after

he has left office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Richard Hu has addressed the specific items raised by

the  President at his press conference on 16th July.  But having

listened  to him, some Members of the House and the  public  may

still  wonder  why the President should choose  his  end-of-term

press  conference to criticise the Government in this  way.   It

could  not just be the initial difficulties experienced  by  the

President.  After all, the problems happened three or four years

ago.  The public will continue to speculate that there

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2030</b></font><br><br>

must  be  more  problems  with  the  relationship  between   the

Government and the President which it does not know about.

<br><br><i>Public reactions to President's statements</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The media have already reported some of these comments and

conjectures.  For example, Mr Viswa Sadasivan, Chairman  of  the

Feedback Unit's Political Matters Group, told the Straits Times:

"If  a  President who is a former Deputy Prime Minister  can  be

given  the  push around in that way, I shudder to think  what  a

newcomer to the scene would face."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Kevin Tan of NUS told the Straits Times [30th July]:

"The  trouble  is: either the President should be  a  figurehead

President,  or  an executive President.  To do a little  bit  of

both is terribly confusing."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay told Asiaweek [30th July]: "There are two

implications here - bad and good - that shock people.   The  bad

one  is  that even though Ong was an insider, it was still  hard

[for him] to get straight answers.  The good one is that Ong did

not see himself as a rubber stamp".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay also published an article in the Straits Times

[6th  August] together with Mr Zulkifli Baharuddin, stating that

"the elected presidency remains an institution whose powers  are

not yet fully worked out and accepted by all."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asian Wall Street Journal [9th August] reported that

the  President  had talked of a "long list of problems"  at  his

press  conference,  and linked this to the President's  decision

not to stand, stating: "Many political analysts believe that  Mr

Ong wanted a second term but was discouraged by senior political

figures."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PERC, the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy based in

Hong  Kong, has marked down its rating of Singapore, in a recent

report   [Asian  Intelligence,  28th  July]  comparing  national

institutions  in  different Asian countries.  PERC  stated  that

while  Singapore's  institutions were still professionally  run,

there were controversies suggesting that they may face

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2031</b></font><br><br>

some   challenges   in  future.   PERC  cited  the   President's

revelations  of  "behind-the-scenes struggles he  had  with  the

government   and   bureaucracy  during  his  term   of   office.

Apparently,  the former deputy prime minister took  his  job  of

protecting  the  nation's reserves . rather more seriously  than

many had expected when he was chosen for the post back in 1993."

<br><br><i>Need for Government to respond</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not regard it as unusual for the President to

publicly acknowledge differences between him and the Government.

It  shows the independence of the Presidency in the two areas in

which  he  is vested with custodial powers, and this  will  help

future  Presidents.  Unfortunately, President Ong's  criticisms,

both direct and implied, went beyond these differences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has to guard its honour and integrity

jealously.  If there are doubts over its probity, the Government

cannot  command  respect and would lose its moral  authority  to

govern.   So  the  Government has consistently  defended  itself

whenever its reputation has been unjustly called into question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am duty bound to respond to the points raised publicly by

the President at his press conference.  I am pained and saddened

to  have  to  do  this now, at such a difficult moment  for  the

President   personally.   Indeed  at  the  time  of  the   press

conference,  his  wife was already gravely ill.   But  it  is  a

responsibility I have to discharge.

<br><br><i>Implications of President's Statements</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's statements have left the following thoughts

in the public mind:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Government had been unhelpful and uncooperative

with the President in the discharge of his duties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Public officers, including possibly some Ministers,

regarded the President's checks as a nuisance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Government might have withheld information from the

President.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2032</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Government had disregarded the independent views of

the President; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The President's difficulties with the Government may

have  caused him not to seek another term, since his health  was

"fine".

<br><br><i>Teething problems</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone of the President's comments puzzled me. I thought

the  Government and the President had developed a  good  working

relationship.  Mr Ong Teng Cheong had done a good job in his six

years  as  President.  We had worked together to  make  the  new

institution of the President with custodial powers  succeed.   I

did not expect him to cast doubts on the Government, that it was

unwilling  or  reluctant  to  give  him  full  access   to   all

information   and   documents   for   him   to   discharge   his

constitutional duties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were indeed difficulties in working the new system of

Presidential safeguards in the initial two or three years.  This

was  due  to  the  complexities of  the  issues  involved.   The

Government  had set up a new system.  The President was  new  to

the job;  indeed the job itself was new.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These initial difficulties were not unexpected. In our

speeches  at  the swearing in ceremony of the President  on  1st

September  1993,  both  the President  and  I  referred  to  the

challenges and likely problems ahead.  I said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Government has not the slightest intention of using the

financial   reserves   .   to  finance  wasteful,   unproductive

programmes.   We will not squander the financial reserves  which

we  have  so  painstakingly accumulated.  . I do not  intend  to

bring  about  a situation which will give you cause to  exercise

your  veto powers.  I have no doubt, however, Mr President, that

if you are ever in disagreement with what my Government proposes

to  do in the areas spelt out in the Constitution, you will  not

hesitate to exercise your constitutional authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr President, you and my Government will have to work

together  to  give effect to the letter and spirit of  this  new

system  of checks and balances.  I pledge you my fullest support

and cooperation and that of my Government."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2033</b></font><br><br>

The President replied in his speech:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The legislation creating the institution of the Elected

President  is  still new.  While its philosophy and  intent  are

clear, the detailed Constitutional provisions have not yet  been

fully tested out.  Nor is there established precedent on how the

Elected  President  actually exercises  his  powers.   Both  the

President  and  the  Government will  have  to  feel  their  way

forward.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to developing a sound working relationship

with  the  Prime Minister and his Government.   As we accumulate

experience  with the new system, we can refine the arrangements,

and  define  through  practice and  precedent  how  the  Elected

President will function."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed this is what the Government, and I believe President

Ong,  have sought to achieve over the past six years.   Most  of

the  difficulties that arose were resolved after discussion  and

explanation.  I regarded them all as teething problems.   As  we

solved  them, we refined and elaborated on the arrangements  and

workings  of the Presidential safeguard.  Many of the  items  in

the  White  Paper on principles for determining and safeguarding

reserves first arose from careful deliberations by both  parties

to deal with such practical problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of our experience working the new system, we

amended  the Constitution several times to refine the provisions

- in 1994, 1996, 1997 and 1998.  The President supported all the

changes,  except for one - the amendment to Article  22H.   This

concerned  the  President's power to veto  proposed  legislation

which circumvented or curtailed his discretionary powers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President took the view that he could veto the proposed

amendment  to Article 22H.  However, in the interest of  testing

out  the system, he requested that the matter be referred to the

courts  for  a  ruling, and indicated that  he  would  abide  by

whatever ruling that was made.  The Constitution was amended  to

set up a constitutional tribunal.  The matter was referred to  a

tribunal  of three judges, which ruled that the President  could

not veto the proposed amendment to Article 22H.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding these successive refinements to the scheme,

we still cannot

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2034</b></font><br><br>

consider  the system of a custodial President fully  tested  out

and  in  its final form.  It is still running in, and  may  well

need  further fine-tuning to make it workable.  That is why  the

Government  has  not  yet  entrenched  the  provisions  in   the

Constitution,  to  give  the  President  a  veto  over  proposed

amendments to his discretionary powers.

<br><br><i>Differences healthy - Full cooperation rendered</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government does not expect the President to agree with

it  on  every  issue where he exercises custodial powers.   That

from  time  to  time the two should hold different  opinions  on

these  issues is healthy, and to be expected.  The President  is

assisted  in  his  duties by a Council of Presidential  Advisers

(CPA)  of  six  members.  These are men of  substance  who  have

distinguished  themselves  by  their  balanced  judgment.    The

President  and  Prime Minister each appoint  two  members.   The

Chief  Justice and the Chairman of the Public Service Commission

appoint  one each.  The President then appoints the Chairman  of

the Council from among the six members.  Under the Constitution,

the  President  has  to consult the Council  before  making  his

decisions concerning reserves and key appointments.  Differences

between  the  Government  and the President  are  therefore  not

personal,  but reflect the independent judgment of the President

and the Council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministers and I treated all queries and requests of the

President  and CPA seriously.  Whether the Government agreed  or

disagreed with the President, his queries and requests had to be

answered.   And  they  were  answered.   At  no  time  did   the

Government  withhold  information  or  co-operation   from   the

President or show him any disrespect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to what Mr Simon Tay and Mr Zulkifli Baharudin

wrote  in the Straits Times of 6th August, the Government  fully

accepts  the  custodial  powers of the President.   It  was  the

Government  which created this new institution  to  oversee  two

areas: reserves and key appointments.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2035</b></font><br><br>

The  Government worked out its powers and enacted the provisions

in  the  Constitution.   So  it wants  the  new  institution  to

succeed.  It has absolutely no reason to obstruct the President.

<br><br><i>Information Withheld?  Procedures Exist</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Ong urged public officers to change their mindset

and  see  it as their constitutional duty to help the  President

protect past reserves.  He said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not possible for the President's office with a very

small  staff  to know what's going on.  The civil servants  know

what  is  happening in the ministries and departments.  We  have

discovered in the past that, if they don't tell us, most of  the

time we would not know.  And by the time we know, it may be  too

late."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This implied criticism of the Government is not justified.

I agree that if a civil servant knows that his political masters

are drawing down reserves behind the President's back, he should

inform the President.  But I do not think that every transaction

of the Government, or every land sale, should be reported to the

President.  This would go beyond what is required of  all  civil

servants,  and  also  beyond the scope  of  the  duties  of  the

President as laid out in the Constitution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are established procedures for drawing up Government

budgets, approving expenditures, and acquiring and disposing  of

assets.   The accounting officer of a ministry is the  Permanent

Secretary,   not  the  Minister.   The  accounting  officer   is

responsible  for  the ministry's budget and its expenditure,  as

well as the proper accounting and management of public money and

assets.   The  Government budget is prepared by the Ministry  of

Finance.   When it is presented to Parliament, the Minister  for

Finance  is  required by the Constitution to certify whether  or

not  there  has  been  a  drawdown on past  reserves.   That  is

provided for in Article 147.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Article 148G of the Constitution imposes on

the  Auditor-General and the Accountant-General a duty to inform

the  President  of  any  proposed  transaction  which  to  their

knowledge  is likely to draw on past reserves.  Members  of  key

statutory boards, the boards of key

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2036</b></font><br><br>

Government  companies, and their CEOs have a  similar  duty,  as

required under Articles 22B and 22D.  All these appointments are

subject to the President's veto.  It is up to these officials to

devise  their  own  systems,  staff  support  and  channels   of

information  in  order to discharge their constitutional  duties

effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore there is adequate mechanism for keeping the

President  informed  of  what  is happening  in  Ministries  and

Departments   in  time,  rather  than  after  the   fact.    The

Presidential safeguard is designed to work through officials  in

the  Government whom he has vetted and can rely  upon,  and  not

through a large parallel staff in the office of the President.

<br><br><i>Using NII In Regional Crisis?</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President said that his greatest disappointment was his

inability to use the second key during the economic crisis.   He

said  this  was  because the Government  had  decided  that  Net

Investment Income (NII) should go into current reserves  instead

of  past reserves.  The implication was that the Government  had

changed  the  rules  in  order  to  circumvent  the  second  key

mechanism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President did tell me that he would agree to draw down

the  reserves, should the Government need to use them  to  fight

the  regional  crisis  and  prevent Singapore  from  going  into

recession.   I  thanked him, but told him  that  the  Government

would try its best not to draw on past reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Richard Hu has explained, the Government had

accumulated   substantial  budget  surpluses  since   the   1997

elections,  before  the  crisis struck.   The  budget  surpluses

exclude net investment income, which are "below the line"  items

in  the Government accounts.  But the accumulated surpluses were

enough to pay for the budget deficits we expected last year  (FY

98)  and  this  year  (FY 99), beyond the current  term  of  the

President.   Thus we have not needed to use the  net  investment

income  at  all.  Whether the net investment income  was  earned

from  current  reserves or past reserves made no  difference  to

this.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2037</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President was thus mistaken in thinking that it was

because the Government had redefined net investment income to be

current income that it did not need him to use the second key.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people may think that had the President used the

second  key,  we would not have needed to cut CPF contributions.

Let  me  explain  that drawing on past reserves would  not  have

solved our economic challenges.  It would only generate a  false

sense  of well-being, when our real problems are to ensure  that

companies survive and Singaporeans have jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business costs had become too high. We had to bring

them down to restore our competitiveness.  We reduced Government

taxes  and  charges.   But we also had  to  cut  wages  and  CPF

contributions,  which form a major part of business  costs.   We

could not avoid tightening our belts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proof of a policy is in its outcome. Our rational

response  to  the economic crisis is working.   Our  economy  is

recovering  strongly,  and  we  have  earned  the  respect   and

confidence of investors and economic analysts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President meant well in offering to unlock past

reserves  for the Government to use to counter the crisis.   But

it  is for the Government to decide whether reserves need to  be

used under any given circumstances.

<br><br><i>A Custodial, Not An Executive President</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the comments and reactions after the President's

press  conference have shown misunderstanding or confusion  over

the  President's role under the Constitution.  For  example,  Dr

Kevin  Tan,  in Straits Times of 30th July, maintained  that  we

should  either  have  a  figurehead President  or  an  executive

President,  and that to do a bit of both is terribly  confusing.

Allow  me with the authority of the Attorney General to  correct

this ill-informed view.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2038</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be no confusion. The true Constitutional

position is very clear.  The President exercises custodial,  not

executive  powers.   Only  the  Government  exercises  executive

powers.   Under  the Constitution, the Cabinet  shall  have  the

general  direction and control of the Government.  In  contrast,

the  President's  custodial  powers are  reactive  and  blocking

powers.  The President does not have any executive power.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made this clear when I moved the Constitutional

amendments  in this House on 4th October 1990 to provide  for  a

President with custodial powers.  I then said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me stress here, however, that the Bill does not

transfer  the power of government to the Elected President,  nor

vest  in  him  absolute veto power.  Firstly,  even  though  the

President  is  elected by the people, he  is  not  the  Head  of

Government.   He  is the Head of State.  He  is  not  the  Chief

Executive  of  the  country.   The  Prime  Minister   is.    The

initiative and responsibility of governing Singapore stays  with

the Prime Minister."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in the Hansard of 4th October 1990 [Cols 464, 465].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the Constitution retained the principle, which

existed  before  we  created the custodial President,  that  the

President  always  acts on the advice of the Government,  except

where  the Constitution explicitly provides otherwise.   Article

21 of the Constitution states:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"21.-(1) Except as provided by this Constitution, the

President  shall,  in the exercise of his functions  under  this

Constitution  or  any other written law, act in accordance  with

the  advice  of  the Cabinet or of a Minister acting  under  the

general authority of the Cabinet."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's new custodial powers are to veto certain

actions  proposed  by the Government:  to block  the  Government

from  spending  past  reserves or to stop  the  Government  from

making  appointments to key positions.  If the majority  of  the

six  members of the Council of Presidential Advisers agree  with

the President, his veto is final.  Otherwise, the Government can

overturn  the  President's  veto  with  a  two-thirds  vote   in

Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No article of the Constitution gives the President any

power  to initiate any action, or to appoint, promote, transfer,

remove

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2039</b></font><br><br>

or dismiss any officer, or to spend money, or recommend that the

reserves  be spent.  That right is with the Government  and  the

Public  Service Commission.  It is not the President's  task  to

set policy or run the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reiterate. The Prime Minister is the Chief

Executive  of  the  Government.  All  Ministries  and  Statutory

Boards  answer to him.  The civil service reports to  him.   The

Prime  Minister,  not the President, chairs the Defence  Council

and  has  the overall responsibility for the SAF and the defence

and security of the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle this distinction between custodial and

executive  powers is sharp, but in practice it may be  less  so.

For  example,  the  Prime  Minister may  consult  the  President

informally  before putting up a name for a key  appointment,  or

the  President  may  inform the Prime  Minister  that  unless  a

statutory  board's budget is revised, he will have to rule  that

it draws upon past reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such two-way informal communication is essential to the

smooth working of a custodial President system.  But it must not

blur or obscure the Constitutional position:  that the executive

power remains with the elected Government.  Singapore has always

had  a  Parliamentary system of government, not  a  presidential

one.  The Constitution provides for a directly elected President

with  custodial, not executive, power.  Singapore does not  have

an executive President, because Parliament did not create one.

<br><br><i>Did The Government Oppose President Ong's Re-Election?</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most serious doubt which the Government must clear up

is  whether President Ong's problems with the Government are the

reason  he  is  not  seeking re-election.  Indeed,  whether  the

Government,  or some Ministers, opposed his re-election  because

of these problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President opened his press conference saying

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2040</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because precisely you asked about my health, we've waited

until  my latest health examinations to tell you about my latest

health condition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My current health condition is good; I'm physically fine.

Notwithstanding  that,  I decided not to  stand  again  for  the

coming  Presidential Election.  I find no compelling reasons  to

do so."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Straits Times, the next day, reported it this way:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Ong made it a point to begin the press conference by

stating  that  his health was "fine" and, by inference,  not  an

impediment to another six-year tenure if he had so desired.  His

doctors had declared his cancer to be in complete remission."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state clearly that the Government did not object to

the   President   standing  for  re-election  because   of   any

difficulties in its working relationship with the President.  It

had no reason to do so.  The Cabinet found no fault with the way

the President had performed his duties, and the way he exercised

his  custodial powers.  He discharged his duties faithfully  and

independently.   It  did  not see the  differences  between  the

President  and the Government that arose from time  to  time  as

irreconcilable or unhealthy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Cabinet would have been happier if Mr Ong Teng

Cheong  had  been  able  to  continue  for  another  full  term.

Singapore  would  have had the benefit of a  well-respected  and

experienced President, who had been involved over the  last  six

years in establishing the processes by which the President would

exercise his newly created powers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government did have one reason to be concerned

should President Ong seek re-election, namely, his health.   The

health  of  the  person holding the office of President  is  not

merely  a  personal matter.  It is a matter of state as  it  can

affect  the  proper  functioning of a  key  institution  in  our

political system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cabinet knew that President Ong had lymphoma and the

disease was progressing.  It was concerned that his health might

not permit him to discharge the duties of President normally and

fully  for  another  6-year term.  The  public  also  knew  that

President  Ong  had lymphoma.  If he stood for re-election,  the

state of his

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2041</b></font><br><br>

health  would  be  a  natural  and  proper  question  that   the

electorate would ask.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President discussed his intention to seek re-election

with  me  on  several occasions.  He first told me that  he  was

thinking of standing for re-election in February this year.  The

President made it clear that he was not asking for my permission

or  the Government's permission to do so.  He was just informing

me as a matter of courtesy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcomed the President's intention to stand for re-election. But I also advised the President that he should

obtain medical reports on his condition from his doctors, to  be

published if he decided to stand for re-election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President went to the United States in March, to see Dr

Saul  Rosenberg  of  Stanford University  Medical  Centre.    In

April,  the Cabinet met to discuss what position to take on  the

President's re-election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I circulated two medical reports on the President to

Cabinet - one by Dr Rosenberg, and another by Dr John Wong,  who

is  the  President's principal physician.  It is normal practice

for  the Prime Minister to receive such reports.  I have  to  be

informed  whenever the President or a Minister  is  hospitalised

for a serious ailment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked Dr John Wong to be present at the April Cabinet

meeting, to explain the medical terms and the prognosis for  the

President, in simple laymen's terms.  Minutes were recorded, and

I gave a copy to the President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of the medical reports and Dr John Wong's

explanations,  the  Cabinet concluded that there  was  a  strong

likelihood   that  the  President's  health  would  affect   the

discharge  of  his official duties in the next few  years.   For

this reason alone, the Cabinet unanimously decided it could  not

support  the re-election of President Ong, should he  decide  to

stand again.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2042</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I conveyed the Cabinet's view to the President. I knew his

interpretation of his medical prognosis was more optimistic than

the  Cabinet's.  The President said that he would decide whether

or  not  to stand in June.  It was for him to decide,  he  said.

The  Cabinet  could only offer its view.  I agreed with  him  on

this  point.  It was for the President to decide what he  wanted

to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 9th July, the President told me that he had decided not

to  seek re-election, and that he would announce his decision at

a press conference on 16th July, which he did.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President and I enjoy a good working and personal

relationship.  We have been friends and colleagues in Government

since  1977,  ie,  over  20 years.  Our discussion  on  his  re-election was open and cordial.  It was his decision to make, but

I felt that it was only right that he knew the Cabinet's view.

<br><br><i>President Ong Teng Cheong's Contributions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to place on record before this House President

Ong Teng Cheong's significant contributions as Singapore's first

elected President.  He took his job seriously.  He has helped us

to test the powers and workings of the new institution, and iron

out  ambiguities  in the powers of the President  vis-a-vis  the

Government.   He set the pace to get the Government to  complete

and  publish  the White Paper on "The Principles for Determining

and  Safeguarding the Accumulated Reserves of the Government and

the Fifth Schedule Statutory Boards and Government Companies".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most important of all, he has demonstrated that the two-key

system  to safeguard Singapore's reserves and key public  sector

appointments can be made to work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When President Ong stood for election to be President, some

doubted whether a former senior Cabinet Minister and PAP  leader

could  exercise  independent judgment or make decisions  against

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2043</b></font><br><br>

Government   in  his  new  role.   But  friendships   and   past

associations  have not affected President Ong's independence  of

judgment  in  the  two  areas where  he  has  custodial  powers.

President Ong has shown what the Government expected all  along:

that   when   an  honourable  man  assumes  this  constitutional

position,  he  has  to exercise the powers of  that  institution

without fear or favour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together with the Council of Presidential Advisers,

President Ong has established an effective institution for those

powers  vested in the Presidency.  That is a major  contribution

to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will be holding a farewell reception for

President Ong on 30th August.  At that function, I shall  pay  a

formal  tribute  to  him  for  his significant  achievements  as

President.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Prime Minister a question or

two?   I understood him to say that the Cabinet would have  been

happier  if the President had decided to seek re-election.   But

the Cabinet was concerned whether he was medically capable.  But

the  President  had said in his statement that his  doctors  had

given  him  a  clean  bill,  that his  cancer  was  in  complete

remission  and the President clearly indicated that  his  health

would not stand in the way of his becoming President.  May I ask

the  Prime  Minister to explain to this House on what  basis  or

information  did  the  Cabinet conclude that  he  would  not  be

capable of discharging his duties?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, the President had

told  the  public at his press conference regarding his  present

health situation.  But the Cabinet had two medical reports,  one

from  the  President's  doctor in the  United  States,  Dr  Saul

Rosenberg,  and the other from his physician in  Singapore.   We

studied the reports and it was quite clear from the reports that

if  you should focus or project the President's health condition

into  the  future,  there was a very strong likelihood  that  he

would  not be able to perform his duties normally.  In a  sense,

it is like looking at a glass of water, whether it is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2044</b></font><br><br>

one-third full or two-thirds empty.  The Cabinet had to take the

advice  of the doctor and take a very careful view of  what  the

President's future condition would be like.  And it  is  on  the

basis  of  our  understanding of the President's future  medical

condition,  as  given in the medical reports, that  the  Cabinet

decided  that  it  could  not support  the  re-election  of  the

President.  But it is a matter for the President to decide.   He

could  still have decided to stand for re-election and it  would

be his right if he wanted to stand for re-election.  But we have

given  our  views  on the basis of what we think  would  be  his

future  medical condition, as advised by the doctors,  and  that

Cabinet could not support his re-election.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to ask the Prime Minister whether the Government has  been

inconsistent  when  they supported President Ong  Teng  Cheong's

attempt at the Presidential office six years ago knowing that he

already had a similar medical condition and now, given that  the

condition  has not changed, it is not supporting his bid  for  a

second term.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have not been

inconsistent.  We knew of the President's condition in 1992 when

he  was  first struck with low-grade lymphoma.  And again,  from

medical  advice,  we  knew the likely progression  of  low-grade

lymphoma  that,  in the first six years of this  disease,  there

would  have  been no great problem for the President to  perform

the  functions.  But the next six years would not be  quite  the

same.  If you ask his doctors, they would tell you that, in  the

nature  of things, the next six years would not be the  same  as

the  last  six  years.  And it is on the basis of the  next  six

years  that  we are concerned with.  The doctors were  right  in

their assessment, as shown in the last six years.  The President

had performed his duties quite normally.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> I would like to thank the Minister for

Finance  and  the  Prime Minister for their  clarifications.   I

would like to ask the Minister for Finance - unfortunately I  do

not have the Budget book here to refer to - what is the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2045</b></font><br><br>

approximate size of the Net Investment Income and is it found in

the  Budget  book.  More importantly, I would like  to  ask  the

Prime  Minister  how  come the President,  who  is  supposed  to

safeguard the reserves, was mistaken regarding the definition of

Net  Investment  Income.  And how come he did not  realise  that

there was no need to draw down reserves as a result of the cost-cutting  measures because there was actually, as Dr  Richard  Hu

pointed  out, a budget surplus?  It would seem to me  that  that

kind  of information would be readily available to the President

whose  official  and constitutional function is to  protect  the

reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am rather puzzled by this state of affairs and more

importantly, the Prime Minister has mentioned that  he  and  the

President have been friends and colleagues for a very long time,

but  it seems to me that there has actually been a breakdown  of

trust  between  the Government and the President where  this  is

concerned  so that matters of definition, matters of information

as  it  were,  do  not  seem to be readily conveyed  across  the

various  offices.  Could the Prime Minister please  explain?   I

think  it  is  more  than  just  a question  of  differences  of

definition or opinion.  I am rather puzzled that there is a very

significant  difference,  not so  much  of  opinion,  but  of  a

breakdown of trust.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am equally puzzled

and  I  am  still  puzzled  as  to why  the  President  did  not

understand  fully  the meaning of the NII  as  explained  by  Dr

Richard Hu.  The President did not deal with me directly on most

of  the  issues.   He  dealt with the civil  servants,  normally

through his Principal Private Secretary.  I would normally  come

into  the  picture when they could not resolve  certain  issues.

And of course when it came to my attention, I would then look at

the  matter  and involve other Ministers who were  concerned  to

resolve  the issue.  I do not think there was this breakdown  in

trust.   It  may be differences in the approach to the problems.

And  as far as the Government was concerned, there was never any

reluctance in our case to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2046</b></font><br><br>

cooperate.   Where  we disagreed we explained our  disagreement.

We finally sorted out whatever issues that we had.  I do not get

a  sense  that there was this breakdown in trust.   It  is  just

different approaches to the problems.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The NII is in the first page of the

Budget  book, below the line.  You can just add up  the  figures

year by year.  It averages between $3 and $5 million a year.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> May I ask the Prime Minister

whether  the Government has in any way put pressure on President

Ong not to stand again?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that would be very

unfair  to  the  President, and unfair  to  the  Government  too

because whatever pressure we put on the President, he is a not a

man  who  succumbs  to  pressure.   And  as  shown,  he  has  an

independent viewpoint on many issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the medical condition of the President, I did not want

to  be too explicit since the President is not standing for  re-election.   I think it would be unfair to him.  But  being  less

explicit,  Members here may not understand what exactly  is  the

position  and  why there is this difference.  I would  say  that

there was a difference in interpretation of the medical reports.

We have to be advised by the doctors and we had to ask questions

that  we were not sure as to what certain words meant.  We  were

also  advised  by his doctor that for the next six years,  there

would  be  a  strong likelihood of certain events taking  place.

The President, from his point of view, can quite rightly look at

the  other  aspect that these are all statistics. And  from  his

point of view, he is the best judge of his own health.  He  said

he  felt  "fine" and I have no reason to doubt him that he  felt

"fine".   It  is  a  question of how we  interpret  the  medical

reports.  But in our case, we were guided by professional advice

and not just how we felt over the medical reports.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to ask the Prime Minister whether this issue of staff

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2047</b></font><br><br>

support  for the President would be helpful because in the  past

when  there was no elected President and there was no  need   to

safeguard  the  reserves, the President only had  one  Principal

Private Secretary.  I am not saying that we should have  a  full

presidential staff, but perhaps some more senior support for him

would  be  helpful  in  his interaction  with  the  other  civil

servants who are on a senior level.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past, the

President had just a personal secretary.  There was no Principal

Private  Secretary.  The  difference  is  that  the  PPS  is  an

Administrative Officer.  Your private secretary looks after your

office  management and so on.  We felt that it is not  necessary

for  the President's office to have a large staff because if you

begin  to man the President's office in order to check the civil

servants, we must have a super Auditor-General to check  on  the

Accountant General.  You need to have your own lawyer  to  check

on  the  AG's office and you begin to build a White House staff,

as  you call it, which would then have its centre of power,  and

it  is  totally  unnecessary because the  key  appointments  are

subject  to the veto powers of the President.  Under the  system

that  we  have  devised, the President should work  through  the

people in Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I too only have a Principal Private Secretary. I have a

Press  Secretary but I felt that he would be underworked, and  I

have  given  my  Press Secretary three jobs.   He  is  my  Press

Secretary.  He is also holding a position as Deputy Secretary in

the  Ministry of Information and the Arts so that  he  can  know

what is going on and keep me informed of news.  And I still find

that  he  is  underworked.  So I thought he should also  be  the

Chief  Executive  Director  of the  People's  Association.   And

because  he  is  from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  he  also

attends  briefings regularly in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

This  is  how we use staff.  We do not just have people who  sit

around  looking for little faults here and there.  It is totally

unnecessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has the right to use staff in the Government

to get whatever

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2048</b></font><br><br>

information  which he wants.  He does not require a  big  staff.

Likewise,  I  have  a  right to go to any  Ministry  and  demand

information to be given to me and circumventing the Minister, if

necessary.  I do not require a big staff to run the Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the

only  concern of the President's re-election is health  and  the

only  reason cited by the Prime Minister for the Cabinet not  to

support  the  President's re-election  is  health,  may  I  know

whether the Government intends to publish the medical reports to

clear the public misperception.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> On the same note, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, may I ask the Government whether it is setting  a

precedent  that  good  health is a  key  criterion  for  persons

seeking high office in Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has no

intention to publish the medical reports of President  Ong  Teng

Cheong.  He is not seeking re-election.  It is irrelevant now to

publish the medical details of the President's health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other question whether we are setting a new

precedent,  I  think  health  is  important  but  it  is  not  a

constitutional  requirement.  We have not put this  in.   It  is

very  difficult for us to devise a way where we have  to  define

health  before  a person can stand for election.   But  I  would

suggest  that  any potential candidate who wants  to  stand  for

election as President should be asked the question by the press.

What  is  your  health  condition? Do  you  have  an  underlying

condition  which  you know, over time, will  lead  to  problems?

Nobody  can forecast how a heart will tick over time, or whether

or  not  you may get cancer.  Nobody can forecast. But  at  that

point  of  time, do you have an underlying condition  which  you

know  must progressively lead to bigger and bigger problems  for

you.  I think it is a fair question for the press to ask.  I  do

not  think  at  this  stage it is wise  for  us  to  change  the

Constitution  or the Presidential Elections Act  to  make  it  a

requirement for health to be declared publicly.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2049</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> I would like the Prime

Minister  to  clarify, since the projected health condition  was

the  reason  for  the  Government withholding  its  support  for

President  Ong  seeking a second term, what has  the  Government

done to satisfy itself of similar consideration before extending

its support to a candidate in the forthcoming elections.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has no

authority whatsoever to demand Mr S R Nathan, as a candidate, to

tell  us  what his health is.  But of course privately,  I  have

asked  him  when  I  saw  him.  I said,  "What  is  your  health

condition?"   He  told  me  that he is  able  to  discharge  his

responsibility.  I asked, "Any underlying condition?"  He  said,

"No."   He had a heart bypass operation some years ago,  but  he

has  been  to the National Heart Centre and has been cleared  by

the  doctors.   At this point in time, there is no  legal  basis

that I can compel him to tell me what it is, but he has told  me

what  his  health condition was.  So, personally, I believe  his

health  is  good and the press can ask him.  If he goes  to  the

nomination  centre tomorrow, whether he is returned  opposed  or

unopposed, the press can ask him about his health condition.  It

is a relevant question for the press to ask.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Prime Minister again on the

question  of  the President's health.   The Prime Minister  said

that  the  Government  had two reports.  Were  they  conflicting

reports  from  the report given by the President's  own  doctor?

And  who did the interpretation? Was it the Attorney General  or

did  the  Government  seek  an opinion from  someone  qualified,

eminent  in this field outside Singapore, to decide between  the

two reports?  Did the Government report say that the President's

powers  would  be  affected and there was a likelihood  that  he

would  not  be  able  to  discharge  the  powers  as  President?

Finally, may I ask the Prime Minister - he has been very  candid

-  whether  the  Cabinet decided on Mr S R Nathan  because  they

would find it less of a problem having him as President?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there were two medical

reports which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2050</b></font><br><br>

I  saw  and one of them was from Dr Saul Rosenberg.  He  is  the

foremost  authority in the world on lymphoma cancer.  The  other

report is by the President's personal physician in Singapore, Dr

John Wong, and he of course is also an authority in Singapore on

oncology.   The  two  reports  were  similar.  They   were   not

conflicting  reports.   We  had  Dr  John  Wong  in  Cabinet  to

interpret his report and the report of Dr Saul Rosenberg for us,

and  we  were advised by an oncologist, not an Attorney-General.

We  were  not qualified and, personally, there were  many  terms

which  were beyond me, and we had to satisfy ourselves by asking

questions  and  getting the doctor to explain in layman's  terms

what the likely condition of the President would be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have I missed out any point?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> S R Nathan?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> What about S R Nathan?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I just say a little bit more?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> No, please sit down. I will explain so

that you do not have to say a bit more!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have looked at S R Nathan very carefully and we chose

him,  because  of the man's maturity and his balanced  judgment.

And we know that if he had to exercise his constitutional duties

where  he  disagrees with us, he would exercise it in accordance

with the authority which he has.  I have no doubt about it.   If

we  had  any doubts,  we would not have appointed such a person.

We  are  not looking for yes man, as Members of the House  would

know.  We are looking for people with independent views who  can

add  to  the system, not sycophants.  We want people  with  that

ability to perform the role of that particular institution,  and

S  R  Nathan,  in  our view, and in my personal view,  qualifies

eminently.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta-Ayer Tanglin):</b> Sir, may I ask the Prime

Minister to define to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2051</b></font><br><br>

this  House  the  status  vested on  the  wife  of  the  elected

President?  What is the status of the First Lady?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am unable to find this

definition  in the Constitution.  As far as I am concerned,  she

is the wife of the President.  And as a matter of courtesy, many

of us refer to her as the First Lady.  But, in effect, the First

Lady  has  no  status in the Constitution, unlike the  Minister,

Prime Minister or the President.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  first,  in  view  of the uniqueness  and  infancy  of  the

Presidency and the likelihood of differences of opinion  between

the President and the Government, does the Prime Minister see  a

need  now  to  review the CPA, so that they are better  able  to

handle the differences between the Government and the President?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, because the senior civil servants report directly

to  the  Prime Minister, whether he could call upon the  CPA  to

have  senior civil servants report to them to answer  issues  of

difficulties that the President may face.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, up to now, I do not

think  there is a need for us to review the composition  of  the

CPA.   It has worked fine.  The President has sought advice from

the  CPA,  and  whenever Budgets were submitted,  the  CPA  went

through them quite carefully and gave their advice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether we need to change this later on, I would not know.

It  depends  on our experience in running the system.   The  CPA

can,  through the President's Office, call up any civil  servant

to  answer  any  questions, if it wants to.   There  is  nothing

against  that.  I think the Accountant-General and the  Auditor-General  periodically  might have  been  called  up  to  explain

certain  statements or figures.  It has the  right  to  call  up

civil servants.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am puzzled over the

puzzle of the Prime Minister.  The Prime Minister is puzzled

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2052</b></font><br><br>

why  the  President, who was the Deputy Prime Minister, did  not

understand clearly that the Government does not need to draw  on

past reserves, and thereby made such statements.  And he is also

puzzled  as to why the President decided to cast doubts  on  the

Government.  Based on the sequence of events the Prime  Minister

has  given,  in  terms of whether to support the re-election,  I

wonder whether the Prime Minster is implying that the reason why

the  President  has cast doubts and raised so  many  issues  and

decided  not  to stand for re-election was because  the  Cabinet

failed to support his re-election,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like the Prime Minister's opinion on whether

or  not the routine function of the elected President should  be

made more transparent, so that Singaporeans would know what  the

elected President is doing, rather than at the end of the  term,

the elected President comes out with something which has already

passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third concern is that although the Prime Minister says

that  the  elected  President can work  through  the  Government

system, the civil servants and all that, I wonder how would  the

elected  President know if the Government or a  statutory  board

decides that it has to sell land or dispose of assets within the

budgeting period.  Would the Prime Minister clarify?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on his first question,

it  is one that can only  be answered by the President.  I would

not  know why he did not understand the NII and I would not know

why exactly he chose to criticise the Government.  But I thought

it  is necessary for the Government to state its position  on  a

very  basic area where we had disagreement, and that is  whether

we  supported his re-election or not.  The rest is for people to

draw their own conclusions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of leaving matters to the last and at the

end  of the term of the President before we discuss them openly,

I  think  when  there are disagreements, if it  justifies  being

aired  publicly, they will be aired publicly.  It is up  to  the

President to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2053</b></font><br><br>

decide.  In the case of Article 22H, it was discussed openly  in

Parliament.  So it depends on the issues concerned, and we  have

always come here each time we have certain problems over certain

definitions  or conventions, and we have come here to  keep  the

public informed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be no misunderstanding whatsoever if the

public were to go back to the statements made earlier to see how

the   system  should  be  worked.   And  because  of  the  press

conference, certain doubts have begun to creep in.  It therefore

gave us the opportunity to explain once again to the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On transactions during the Budget period, the civil

servants have a constitutional duty to inform the President  if,

in their view, a particular transaction will draw down reserves.

If  a transaction like selling land at below cost will draw down

the  reserves,  that  civil servant has a  duty  to  inform  the

President's Office or the President.  In this case, it  will  be

the  Accountant-General or whoever is in charge of the statutory

board that owns the land involved.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> What if he fails to report?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> If he fails to report, then I think he

has committed an offence under the Constitution.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in my view,

the  most  crucial point in this whole issue is the standing  of

the   Government   and  our  institutions  among   international

investors.   There was a suggestion by the Prime  Minister  that

PERC has already indicated that the standing of our institutions

and  our  Government has been affected.  My question is  whether

the Prime Minister is planning to take any concrete measures  or

moves to strengthen and improve our institutions, if damage  has

already been done by this debate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the moment, there is

no need for us to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2054</b></font><br><br>

think  of   ways to strengthen the institution.  It is  how  the

institution is being implemented which is important.   The  fact

that we are debating this institution is part of the process  of

working the system.  The President has taken certain issues into

the  open.  He has let his views be known.  We react  in  a  way

that  we should.  We come to Parliament.  We explain why and  we

explain away the mistaken perception of the President.  So it is

more on how this system will be implemented.  And when we have a

new President, I have no doubt that he would have a new style of

managing  certain things in the two areas that he  has  got  the

powers.   And  we  will still work the process through  and,  if

necessary,  we  will come to Parliament and  explain.   At  this

stage,  I do not think we need to change any particular  Article

in the Constitution to strengthen the institution.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not an occasion for

me  to clarify my own views, but I hope the Prime Minister could

clarify some of the points that he has brought up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I think it is very important that the Prime Minister

has  emphasised that this is a new and unique institution.   The

principles  have just been published in a White  Paper  and  the

points he clarified after the President's comments are new to me

and  the whole House.  I think if I have to make comments again,

it  would  be  different in the light of the clarifications  the

Prime Minister has made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that point, let me ask three questions. First, I hope

the  Prime Minister, as CEO, stands by the duties under  Article

146 that the civil servants must report.  A few minutes ago,  he

said that he thinks it is an offence.  But can I ask him, as the

CEO,  to  state very clearly to the civil service that  this  is

taken  as  a  clear  offence and a breach of the  constitutional

duty.  That point has to be made just as importantly, as he  has

said  that  the  President must have the  moral  courage  to  be

independent when necessary within his limited powers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I hope the Prime Minister will consider that

there is a need at times to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2055</b></font><br><br>

air  both agreements and disagreements.  I recollect that in the

last ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tay, can you ask your questions, please?

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker. I hope the Prime Minister

will  take  occasion  to  share  points  on  which  the  elected

President  agrees  with the Government that his  action  is  not

necessary, just as disagreements may surface later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would ask the Prime Minister whether in the next

six   years,  the  next  term  of  the  elected  President,  the

Government  will entrench the Presidency within the Constitution

and  therefore  strongly establish an accepted  office  for  the

elected President.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my statement just now

had  made  it  very  clear  that civil  servants,  ie,  CEOs  of

particular  Ministries or statutory boards have a constitutional

duty  to  perform and, as CEO, I have made it very clear,  as  I

have  done  in  my statement, that if they have  any  reason  to

suspect  that  reserves  are  being  drawn  down,  wittingly  or

unwittingly, they must indeed tell the President.  In  fact,  it

is a constitutional duty.  If a civil servant who is required to

do so does not do so, he is derelict in his duty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion by Mr Simon Tay that we should, from time to

time,  raise  in  this House points which have  been  agreed  to

between  the  President and the Prime Minister, I think  we  can

consider that.  If it involves a matter of principle, I think we

should  let  it  be aired over here.  But if it is  just  merely

agreements on routine matters, I do not think we need to come to

the  House  or we need even to go public on that.  But  where  a

principle is involved, a new principle in particular,  where  we

have  settled between the President and the Government, I  think

it is useful to keep the House informed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, whether we would entrench the Presidency in the

Constitution,  in terms of our inability to change  the  Article

without  his  permission in the next term, I would not  want  to

commit myself at this stage.  I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2056</b></font><br><br>

think  it  is  better  for us to work the  system  and  be  very

satisfied  that  we have a good system before we entrench  those

powers in the Constitution.  Otherwise, it is very difficult for

us  when we find that we should in fact do things in a different

way to try to change the Constitution, because the President can

block  it.   So  I would rather err on the side of  caution.   I

would  say that we should try to entrench that within  the  next

six years, but I would not want to commit myself at this moment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, this is a follow

up question on the functions of the CPA.  Can the Prime Minister

say  to  what  extent  the views or opinions  expressed  by  the

President at his press conference were those of his own or  they

actually reflected the collective view of the CPA?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir, I would not know the answer. But

if  I  have  to guess the answer, I think it was the President's

own view.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I would like to ask a question

about  the NII.  The Minister for Finance, Dr Richard  Hu,  said

that  the  Government  has got enough  surpluses  to  tide  over

1998/99  and the NII was held to be past investments  from  1992

onwards.   But  suddenly  it has now  been  changed  to  present

reserves.  What is the rationale behind this?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> No, it is not the rationale. You

have  just  turned  the question around.  NII  has  always  been

current  reserves.  That is according to the  Constitution.   So

there is no dispute over that.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> I would like to come back to this issue

of  the unpleasant encounters that the President had.  The Prime

Minister  mentioned  that civil servants have  a  constitutional

duty  to  report to the President in the event of a drawdown  of

reserves.   But  has  the President the right  to  query  public

servants  directly  regarding the areas  of  his  constitutional

duty?     Secondly,  would  the  Prime  Minister  undertake   to

investigate what were these unpleasant encounters

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2057</b></font><br><br>

that the President had or, maybe his Principal Private Secretary

had, and also to ensure they would not occur again?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when we talk about

civil  servants having the responsibility under the Constitution

to  report  to  the President, it is not all civil servants  but

only  those who are designated with the responsibility to do  so

under the Constitution.  The President has the right to call  up

anyone  for  information  which he wants.   It  is  for  him  to

exercise  that  right if he needs to get further explanation  of

certain issues or figures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the unpleasant encounters, I would not know unless

the  President raises them with me, privately or publicly, which

he  has  done through the press conference.  I thought he  would

probably have identified the major unpleasant encounters in  his

long  list  of  problems at the press conference,  and  we  have

addressed those episodes in Parliament earlier.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to go back

to  the question of the President's health.  If the condition of

the  President's  health  is crucial  to  the  consideration  of

support  given by the Cabinet to a candidate, why  was  not  the

present candidate, who is 75 years old and is known to have  had

a bypass, required to submit a medical report, even if he is not

required by the Constitution to do so?  Instead, we require  the

same of President Ong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no legal basis

for us to get the candidate to submit a medical report.  We have

asked  him,  and he has satisfied himself that he is  physically

and medically fit to stand for election.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, while I accept all the

explanations  that the Minister for Finance  has  given  on  the

technical issues that were raised by the President, I think  one

issue  that still remains to be answered is that of the  mindset

changes that the President talked about, ie, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2058</b></font><br><br>

attitudes  of the civil servants and some of the Ministers  that

he  had  encountered during his term in office.  Does the  Prime

Minister  intend to address these issues of attitude  among  the

civil servants?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir, it is a matter of conjecture that

some  civil servants and Ministers found his attitude  to  be  a

nuisance.   Unless  I  go around asking the civil  servants  and

Ministers whether they indeed found the President's checking  on

them a nuisance, I would not know whether it is true or not.  So

it is not necessary for me to send out a general circular to the

civil service and the Ministers to change their mindset.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> As health was the

main  reason why the Cabinet rejected, and also at the point  in

time,  like  what the Prime Minister said, we had supported  the

President  even  though he had lymphoma, as a  doctor,  we  have

always been taught that low grade lymphoma would be difficult to

cure,  but  it  generally runs a fairly long  course.   In  this

instance,  what  I want to know, and I think it is  also  public

interest,  unless the course of the disease has taken a  drastic

change to become a high grade disease, or the disease cannot  go

into  total remission, there would be little reason for  Cabinet

not  to  support him, if the lymphoma remains as it was  in  the

past.  Perhaps the Prime Minister would like to clarify this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the President's low

grade  lymphoma has indeed transformed into high grade  lymphoma

more than a year ago.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Prime Minister said just now

that  unless he sends a circular to civil servants to  find  out

whether  anyone  finds the President a nuisance,  he  would  not

know.   I  would like to ask him if he would tell  us,  in  this

House,  whether  he  has  asked  any  Minister  here  who  finds

President Ong troublesome and a nuisance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> I do not think it is necessary. If he

wants  to  ask  this  question in the House he  should  get  the

Speaker to go around asking each one of us whether

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2059</b></font><br><br>

we  do  so or not.  I think it is totally irrelevant.  The point

is,   no  Minister  has  withdrawn  any  cooperation  from   the

President,  and  when most Ministers see him, we  call  him  "Mr

President".   There  is  no disrespect shown  to  the  President

whatsoever.  So it is totally irrelevant for us to try and guess

whether Ministers regard the President's performance of his duty

as  rather  vexing to them.  I think we have always  cooperated,

and  we should cooperate, and we will continue to cooperate with

the new President.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure the people of

Singapore  would have been very glad to hear the Prime  Minister

say  in  this  House  that the Government was  not  looking  for

sycophants  to run for the post of President.  If  that  is  the

case,  what  was  the need for the Cabinet to shortlist  certain

people  and  then  finally decide on Mr  S.  R.  Nathan  as  the

Cabinet's choice?  Is it not better to leave the judgment to the

electorate  to  decide who should be their  President?   Is  the

Prime  Minister aware that there is a feeling among  great  many

Singaporeans  that they have been completely left out,  cheated,

of their chance to choose the President?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the President has two

roles.   One  is  ceremonial, serving as a symbol of  Singapore.

The  other  are  the custodial functions that he has  under  the

Constitution.  The two roles are now merged into one person  and

any  Government  would want to ensure that whoever  becomes  the

President is somebody who can do Singapore proud, and can do the

job competently.  So we, as a Government, would therefore always

have  a vested interest to ensure that the right man emerges  to

become  the  President.   But  there  is  nothing  to  stop   Mr

Jeyaretnam from finding someone who qualifies under the rules to

stand   for   election  against  somebody  whom  the  Government

supports,  and  the  people can decide.  In  this  instance,  Mr

Jeyaretnam  has  failed  to  find  somebody  who  can  become  a

contestant  in the arena against Mr S. R. Nathan.  There  is  no

rule against it.  It is within our right to try and get the best

candidate  for  Singapore.  Singaporeans are  not  cheated.   In

fact, our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2060</b></font><br><br>

lament  is  not  enough people are coming  forward  who  can  do

Singapore proud in performing the role of the Presidency.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I suggest to the Prime Minister that if

he  is sincere in what he said, the Government should now remove

the  restrictions on who should stand as President.   The  basic

qualifications are laid down in the Constitution as for  Members

of  Parliament.  Let the public decide - not the Prime Minister,

not  the Senior Minister, nor the Cabinet - as to who should  be

the President.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have gone through

these  arguments  when we debated the criteria for  the  Elected

Presidency.   I  do not think we need to repeat  them.   We  are

looking  for  honourable  men  and  women  who  can  perform   a

particular function.  You do not just want to have somebody  who

has  bought and sold some shares, some private tutors or  failed

politicians, to demean the post of the Presidency, and  let  the

people  decide.  We regard the Head of State as a very important

institution  and  it is best that we have the right  person  who

fulfils  certain  criteria  to  stand  for  election  for   that

particular  post,  and the matter has been  decided  over  here.

Parliament has decided.  The people have elected the PAP.   This

was  an  issue  way  back in the 1988  election.   We  won.   We

defeated  the  argument by Mr Jeyaretnam.  So  the  people  have

spoken on this issue.  We have got this through in Parliament.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Prime Minister saying that this

Government  is  not  prepared to trust the intelligence  of  our

people?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> We do not trust the opinions of certain

politicians.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

Singaporeans  heard of the President's problem through  a  press

conference  and  today  we  are  hearing  the  Prime  Minister's

clarification.   I  certainly think there is a  better  way  for

Singaporeans  to know about the problems faced by the  President

and the Government.  Is there a way we can find

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2061</b></font><br><br>

where  we could discuss these problems, know about them, without

having  risk agencies downgrading us and without causing concern

among the population?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir, that is the choice for the

President.   He  has  chosen  to  go  public  with   the   press

conference.  I have chosen to come over here to explain and face

MPs  in  answering any questions that they may have.  I  do  not

choose  a  press conference to rebut the points  raised  by  the

President.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> One last question. Mr Tay.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> One of the details in the President's press

conference  which  caught the attention of the  people  was  the

reference to the reply of the civil servant saying that it would

take 52 man-years.  We have heard clarifications that it was  56

man-years.   May  I  ask  the  Prime Minister,  given  that  the

President  has  a right to access the information under  Article

22F  of the Constitution, is it, in his opinion, the right thing

for  a civil servant to tell the President roughly how much time

it  would  take to answer his question?  Is that fulfilling  the

duty under Article 22F?  Secondly, whether in his own experience

as  Prime  Minister,  civil servants  come  to  him  and  before

answering his questions, tell him roughly how many man-hours  it

would take?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir, I have seen a copy of the minutes

of  the meeting where the President asked for the information to

be  given.   I have read the minutes and there was no indication

whatsoever  that the Accountant-General was being  disrespectful

or  rude.   The President wanted certain information and  it  is

quite  right  for  the Accountant-General to explain  that,  "Mr

President, Sir, if you would like to have all the lands owned by

the  Government valued, it would require 56 man-years."   I  saw

the  minutes.   The minutes were approved by the President.   It

was  entirely  obvious  to  me  that  this  was  a  very  normal

discussion between a respectful civil servant and the President.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2062</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Senior Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

exchanges  this  afternoon establish two  important  principles.

First,  this  new  institution which  we  have  established  can

function.   In a way, it was perhaps as well that the  President

chose in his farewell press conference to vent his frustrations.

He  left  the Government with the unpleasant task of  having  to

rebut him in public.  I have heard the exchanges this afternoon,

and I would like to add these few points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The integrity of the Government is of crucial importance to

Singapore.   Many  people  do  not  like  what  they  call   the

authoritarian, dictatorial attitude of the PAP, which I have led

since  1959.  That was 40 years ago.  We started with a  reserve

of  about $50 or $60 million in the kitty.  We are now  able  to

guard  for the future of Singapore, and the troubles we may  run

into from time to time, over S$150 billion.  It's not as big  as

the Saudi oil reserves, but it is not peanuts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So before my colleagues and I became unable to function, we

discussed  amongst  ourselves whether we could  trust  a  future

generation  to exercise the same prudence, the same  care,  over

what  we have accumulated and may need in the future.  It is  an

open  secret  that  some  of  my  colleagues  think  that  I  am

attempting  something which is futile.  Because if a  generation

is determined to spend its way through its patrimony, it will go

back  from rags to riches to rags.  But at least we should  have

some mechanism to get the people to pause.  Let me explain how a

government works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had been in charge of the CPIB from 1959 to 1990. It has

not  got a huge, enormous apparatus ferreting out what is  going

on  in immigration and the customs, and in tenders.  But it  has

experienced  investigators who can detect  signs,  and  you  can

always  be  sure that when something wrong is taking place,  and

somebody is being shortchanged, that matter will come out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Tsao Yuan worries about whether the President is

given the right information.  Let us suppose for one

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2063</b></font><br><br>

moment  that  what my colleagues and I feared did take  place  - that  we  have a spendthrift, reckless, adventurous, opportunist

government  that is willing to spend its way to prosperity,  and

is  stripping  off the family heirlooms.  Does anybody  in  this

House  believe, in the culture that we have created, that public

servants  will  quietly see their pensions go  down  the  drain?

Because  as  these reserves are drained away, the value  of  our

currency  will drop, as the rupiah dropped.  They are  going  to

take  every step to protect their future, and will do  so.   And

that  is  how the CPIB works.  Have no doubts, I have no doubts,

people will go and see the Auditor-General, lower officials,  if

the  Permanent Secretary or the CEO of a statutory board is  not

on  the job, and say, "Look, this is something dreadfully wrong.

And this will lead to all of us being left with nothing."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as Mr Lim Kim San and Dr Goh have argued with me

before  we  brought  these  provisions  to  the  House,  a  good

mobiliser  can  play  ducks and drakes with the  electorate  and

swing  it  around  against  the President  and  his  Council  of

Advisors, and can get it through a referendum, then all is lost.

But  if  you  have  these  checks,  you  have  certain  hurdles,

obstacles, then I hope that there will be people in this  House,

in  spite of a large majority for the Government, who will  say,

pause,  think  about  it  before you  take  this  step.   Unlike

Indonesia, Malaysia or Thailand, you have nothing to  pledge  to

the  World Bank.  You have not got hidden reserves of oil,  gas,

uranium,  copper  or  gold.   It is  that  kind  of  climate  of

integrity, high standards that is our best protection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we put up with a lot of frivolous, irrelevant attitudes

from some opposition members.  What we have embarked on is for a

very  serious purpose.  Why should I, before I stepped down from

office, put impediments in the way of my successor, if I did not

believe  that this obstruction, this inconvenience, could  prove

to be a very valuable break, a circuit breaker, if the need were

to  arise?   Today's exchange, as a result of what the President

said  on 16th July, was useful as part of the education  of  our

people.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2064</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Senior Minister - I am glad

he  is in the House - in his interview to the press he has  said

then  that the President is not a check on the Government,  that

it  must  be  the  Opposition who  will  be  the  check  on  the

Government.   Is  he  then saying that the President  was  never

intended to be a check on the Government?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I think there is something obtuse about

the Non-Constituency Member.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of the Q&A, I pointed out that those who

were  hoping that the President could act as a counter-force  to

the  Government, they were wrong, because all he can  do  is  to

protect  the reserves and protect the integrity of appointments.

If  you  want  a counter to the Government, a check against  the

Government,  you  must  have them in  the  Opposition,  and  the

Opposition  to  be  an effective counter must offer  a  credible

alternative, which unfortunately Mr Jeyaretnam, since 1972  when

he  first  stood  for elections, has lamentably  failed  to  do.

Therefore,  however  I answer him, it does  not  really  matter,

because  at  the end of the day, does he present an alternative?

This is really at the heart of our problem, that until there  is

a  viable alternative to the present Government, to the PAP,  it

is  imperative that the PAP must have checks and balances within

itself, or all would have gone down in the last 40 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 16 years from 1965 to 1981, when Mr Jeyaretnam was

first  elected, there was no Opposition in this Parliament,  but

we  had  the system, of everybody being informed, the wheels  of

the  system  were kept going.  When he came in, the  system  was

functioning.  I did not believe that the one-party  system  that

many  African countries had constitutionally legislated for  was

good  for the country.  It is bad for the PAP MPs if every  time

they  went  for election, only PAP candidates can stand  against

them.   The very fact that they can be contested, and  that  the

people  want some opposition, keeps them on their toes.  So  the

system  works.  It behoves us to remember that the system  works

only if there are men and women of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2065</b></font><br><br>

integrity  to  man  it.   And that is easy  to  lose.   Look  at

Vietnam,  look at the People's Republic of China, they were  led

by  men  who were prepared to sacrifice everything for a  cause.

In power, with the cultural revolution, standards went down.  In

power,  after  they opened up in Vietnam, the whole  country  is

awash  with corruption and they have had to hang their  bankers,

their customs officers.  I think we can take pride that we  have

been  able  in  40  years of PAP government and  maintained  the

integrity of the institutions of the state.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> May I seek clarification from the

Senior Minister?  Is the Senior Minister implying that even with

the PAP, the dominant party, continuing as Government, he has no

confidence  and  that the PAP may one day produce  a  government

that will squander the reserves, thereby you need the checks and

the circuit breakers?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I fully concede that. I cannot tell Mr

Low  Thia Khiang what his grandson will be.  I know what he  is.

I  do not know what his son will be, never mind his grandson.  A

society  goes  through  many  phases.   Those  who  missed   the

hardships  of  the  Japanese Occupation will not  understand  my

generation.   Those  who  were born after  the  PAP  formed  the

Government  may  believe that better roads, schools,  hospitals,

facilities come as the natural order of things.  I do not  blame

them.   Therefore, this setback which we had, which could become

much  more  serious,  was  a reminder of  how  things  could  go

dreadfully  wrong.  One day President Suharto  was  supreme;  in

1997  he mismanaged a crisis.  In May 1998 the country began  to

unravel.   It  is  a  natural sequence of  the  passing  of  the

generations.  He had to face a generation of Indonesians that no

longer shared with him - the fight against the Japanese, against

the  Dutch  -  but a generation that had increasing frustrations

and anger at what they saw was mismanagement of their resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I say that my successors will be as fortunate in

passing on the baton to their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2066</b></font><br><br>

successors?   Can  Mao Zedong predict that Deng  Xiaoping  would

inherit his mantle because he castigated him and rusticated  him

three  times?  Can Deng Xiaoping predict that Zhao Ziyang  would

fail  him?   Or  that Jiang Zemin would stay for so  long?   Can

Jiang  Zemin be certain that his next president will be as  wise

and astute?  Nobody could foresee what happened.  Therefore,  we

try  our  best  to  have institutions in place.   They  are  not

perfect.   In  the  end, they may all fail.  Then  your  and  my

grandsons will be the worse for it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Senior Minister, I am

glad,  has finally conceded a place for the Opposition.  But  he

says  there  is  no  viable  alternative.   May  I  ask  who  is

responsible for this?  Is it not his Government which  has  gone

out of its way to prevent a viable alternative coming up in this

country?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I would have thought by his persistent

questioning he has given the answer to the public.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Point of clarification, Mr Speaker. I

would  just  like  to  clarify the  point  whether  the  Elected

President is a check and balance against the Government or  not.

I  fully  understand the point that the powers of the  President

are  custodial.  But I would like to quote from Hansard  of  4th

October  1990  from  the then First Deputy Prime  Minister,  now

Prime Minister [Hansard Vol. 56, No. 7, col. 461].  I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Cabinet colleagues and I believe that a good system of

government  must have checks and balances.  There are inadequate

checks in our present parliamentary system of government.  [This

is in argument of the Elected President.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear in mind that in introducing this Bill, the present

Government  is  in  fact  clipping  its  own  wings.   Once  the

Constitutional amendment is effected, this Government will  have

some of its powers checked.  The new Prime Minister will need to

seek  the  concurrence of the President in certain key areas  of

government.  I will be the first Prime Minister to be subject to

these new checks and safeguards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this same desire of wanting to check the potential

abuse  of power which prompts us to introduce additional  checks

on the government in three new areas, not mentioned in the first

White  Paper  [referring  to the ISA,  proposed  Maintenance  of

Religious Harmony Bill and CPIB investigations]."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2067</b></font><br><br>

So,  pardon me if I am obtuse, Senior Minister, but I thought  I

would like to ask for clarification on this point.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> This is a technical point which Members

should know.  The Prime Minister, when he was First Deputy Prime

Minister,  made this statement when he moved the Second  Reading

of  the  Bill.   He is not a lawyer by training.  Therefore,  he

uses  words in a non-legal way.  If I had delivered that speech,

I would not have used those words because "clipping one's wings"

would  evoke  in  my mind the swans we have at Botanic  Gardens.

They  are  there because they cannot fly away.  And I would  not

have  used  that  metaphor because I  would  not  want  a  Prime

Minister who cannot get up on his feet and do what he wants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers are enshrined in the Constitution. Never mind

what  the Ministers or Prime Minister say when they move a Bill.

The  Bill  goes  through  the process.   It  goes  to  a  Select

Committee.  It comes back.  Finally, it goes through  the  Third

reading.  It is usually a perfunctory ritual.  But it underlines

the  fact  that you have read this for the Third time and  these

are  the  words  that  define  the  powers.   Therefore,  I  was

surprised  to see this academic constitutional lawyer  from  our

university  -  and I was alarmed when I read he is teaching  our

students  constitutional law - that he  had  not  read  our  own

Constitution  and  that  he  believed  that  the  President  was

partially  ceremonial and partially executive.  If he  had  read

the  provisions, he would know that in no Article or sub-Article

of  the Constitution is the President given executive power.  He

has a certain veto, a certain blocking power.  Partly because  I

was,  by training, a lawyer, so as the principal provisions were

enacted, I took some care to make quite sure that this mechanism

we  were putting into place would not obstruct a government from

doing  what  it  legitimately should be able to  do.   Take  the

Constitution, read it, quote the Constitution to me  and  if  we

disagree  on the meaning, there is the court.  You cannot  quote

the  Prime Minister and say, "On that basis, I ask the President

to clip

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2068</b></font><br><br>

his wings."  I strenuously recommend against that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Senior Minister, when he says

that  the  President has no executive power, is his decision  to

say "no" to the Government's proposal to use the reserves not an

exercise of executive power?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am not here, Mr Speaker, to show that I

am  a better lawyer than the Non-Constituency Member.  The Prime

Minister has quoted the Attorney-General's authority to read out

certain passages, and the Attorney-General is prepared to go  to

court  and argue that the President has no executive  power.   I

was  a  lawyer.   I have ceased to practise the  law.   I  still

understand  certain basic principles but I always  take  advice,

especially before I sue for defamation.  I always consult people

who  are specialised in that practical branch of the law and who

assure me that I have a foolproof case.  Then I proceed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Senior Minister why has he

not proceeded with his case?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I leave that to my lawyer, Senior Counsel

Davinder Singh, who has great competence and is acknowledged  as

one  who  is extremely circumspect, knows exactly how to  put  a

defendant in his place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year when moving the Copyright (Amendment) Bill,

I  said that it was not the last word on the subject and that we

will  have to evolve our copyright legislation in the  light  of

changes  in  on-going technology.  Since then,  an  inter-agency

Committee  led  by  the  Registrar of Trade  Marks  and  Patents

studied  international trends and developments.   They  proposed

the changes in the Bill to meet the new challenges presented  by

the  development of new technology and the increasing popularity

of electronic commerce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments address the more urgent needs of

copyright owners and users of copyright materials in the on-line

environment.    It   will  improve  copyright   protection   and

enforcement measures for copyright owners in cyberspace, thereby

promoting  the use of the Internet by businesses.  It will  also

promote  greater legal certainty for both copyright  owners  and

users  of  copyright  works, as well as intermediaries  such  as

network   service  providers,  concerning  the  application   of

copyright protection in the digital environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In formulating these proposals, the Committee considered

various   international  models,  including   the   1996   World

Intellectual Property Organisation Copyright Treaty and the 1996

World   Intellectual  Property  Organisation  Performances   and

Phonograms Treaty.  The Committee has a wide representation.  In

addition   to   representatives  of  the  relevant  governmental

agencies, the Committee also included representatives  from  the

National  University of Singapore and the media.  The  Committee

also  consulted the Law Society and various industry players  on

the substance of its proposals.   Sir, this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2070</b></font><br><br>

is a Bill arrived at after an extensive consultative process.

<br><br><i>Amendments to improve copyright protection in cyberspace</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having made those introductory remarks, let me move on to

the  proposed  amendments.  I would first deal  with  the  first

group  of  amendments, i.e, those intended to improve  copyright

protection  and  enforcement measures for  copyright  owners  in

cyberspace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first aspect is that concerning temporary or electronic

reproduction  right. One of the key rights of a copyright  owner

is  the  exclusive  right to make copies of his  works.   It  is

presently  not  very clear if this exclusive  right  extends  to

electronic  copies and transient copies made in  the  electronic

environment.  The Bill clarifies this by extending the right  to

cover  electronic  reproduction.  Such an  extension  will  give

copyright  owners an effective means to control the  copying  of

works  that  they  make  available on the Internet  and  through

electronic transmissions.

<br><br><i>Protection for compilations</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, development in computer technology and the

advent  of the Internet has led to a proliferation of multimedia

works.   The issue of copyright protection for multimedia  works

has  become  increasingly important.  A multimedia work  can  be

made  up  of different types of underlying works, such as  sound

recordings,  photographs, film clips  and  write-ups.   Each  of

these  underlying  works presently enjoys  individual  copyright

protection  but the multimedia work itself, that is, the  effort

expended  in selecting and compiling these individual underlying

works together, may not be protected by copyright.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill address this anomaly by

replacing the existing definition of "literary work" in  section

7 of the Act with an expanded definition set

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2071</b></font><br><br>

out  in a new section 7A.  Currently, "literary work" is defined

to include a compilation in words, figures or symbols.  There is

uncertainty  as  to  whether  this is  confined  to  compilation

consisting  solely of literary works (in which case,  multimedia

works   would  not  be  protected),  or  if  it  also   includes

compilation   of  different  kinds  of  work  (in  which   case,

multimedia  works  will  be  protected).   The  Bill   therefore

provides  a  new  definition  which says  that  "literary  work"

includes  a compilation of any form of works.  This will  afford

copyright  protection to multimedia works.   This  new  form  of

protection will be limited to the intellectual creation involved

in   the  selection  or  arrangement  of  the  contents  of  the

multimedia  work.   The protection will be in  addition  to  and

independent  of  the copyright protection which  the  individual

underlying works may already enjoy.

<br><br><i>Protection for electronic rights management information</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copyright owners are increasingly using electronic rights

management  information to protect their rights  in  cyberspace.

Electronic  rights  management information includes  information

attached electronically to a work which identifies the work, the

author  or copyright owner and any terms and conditions relating

to  the  use  of the work.   Clause 34 of the Bill provides  for

civil   remedies   against  tampering  with  electronic   rights

management  information.   The legal  protection  of  electronic

rights  management information will help copyright owners better

protect their rights in cyberspace.

<br><br><i>Amendments to provide legal certainty</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I turn now to the second group of amendments aimed at

providing  greater  legal  certainty  for  the  application   of

copyright protection in the digital environment.

<br><br><i>Browsing exception</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that the use of the Internet has become

increasingly prevalent.  It has become an invaluable  source  of

information and entertainment for many in the world today.  I am

told that every

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2072</b></font><br><br>

time  a  person views a web page on the Internet, he  causes  at

least  six  copies  of  the web page to be made.   Consequently,

there  is  some uncertainty whether copyright is being infringed

when  one  browses through the Internet.  The new  section  193E

introduced  by clause 21 of the Bill makes clear that  copyright

is  not infringed when end users cause incidental copies  to  be

made in order to view, listen or utilise works made available on

the Internet.

<br><br><i>Limitation  of  liability  for  network  service  providers  and removal of infringing materials by network service providers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to what are probably the central provisions of

the Bill.  Network service providers play a vital role in the on-line  delivery of content for copyright owners.  It is therefore

important  that  the  legal  framework  gives  network   service

providers certainty about their liabilities and responsibilities

to copyright owners.  Clause 21 of the Bill therefore introduces

sections 193B to 193D to address these concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments ensure that network service providers are

not liable for any kind of incidental copying that may occur  in

the  technical  processes of carrying out their activities  (for

example, caching).  The amendments distinguish between materials

to  which  the  network  service provider  provides  access  and

materials which are hosted by a network service provider at  the

direction  of a user.  In the latter case, section  193C  allows

the  protection  to  be  lifted if a  copyright  owner  files  a

Statutory  Declaration that those materials are  infringing.   A

network service provider faced with such a Statutory Declaration

can do one of two things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can immediately remove the materials as demanded by the

copyright  owner.   If he does that, he retains  his  protection

under  section 193C against copyright infringement actions.   At

the  same  time,  section  193D  protects  the  network  service

provider  against  any action brought by persons  who  want  the

material  to remain on the network.  By adopting this course  of

action, the network service provider ensures that he

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2073</b></font><br><br>

cannot  be sued for copyright infringement for materials  hosted

by him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, the network service provider can choose to

ignore  the Statutory Declaration.  Once he does this, he  loses

the legal protection conferred on a network service provider  by

section  193C.   This  does not mean that  the  network  service

provider    automatically   becomes   liable    for    copyright

infringement.   What  it  means  is  that  the  network  service

provider's  liability  will  then  have  to  be  determined   in

accordance  with the other general provisions in  the  Copyright

Act, and it also means that he can no longer rely on the special

immunity  given  to  a network service provider.   Why  would  a

network  service  provider choose this  course  of  action,  and

thereby throwing away the network service provider immunity  and

risk  being found liable for copyright infringement under  those

general legal provisions?  He may want to do so, for example, if

he  is confident, that the material is not infringing.  A person

who  makes  a  false Statutory Declaration can be  punished  for

doing so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new sections 193B to 193D finely balance the

rights and interests of copyright owners, users of materials and

network  service  providers.  They provide legal  certainty  for

both  network  service  providers as well as  copyright  owners,

while  preserving  at the time, a certain level  of  freedom  of

action for network service providers.

<br><br><i>Transfer of electronic copies</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 of the Bill further introduces a section 193F to

facilitate  the  transfer of works in the  digital  environment.

This  clarifies  that if a person who has bought  an  electronic

copy  of  materials transfers it, the transferee will  have  the

same  rights  as  those enjoyed by the transferor  provided  the

transferor does not keep any copy for himself.

<br><br><i>"Reasonable portion"</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me touch on some minor amendments to extend existing

copyright

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2074</b></font><br><br>

concepts to make them relevant to the digital environment.   The

first  concerns the concept of "reasonable portion".  Currently,

the  Copyright Act permits copying of a reasonable portion of  a

copyrighted work under certain circumstances.  As a guideline, a

"reasonable  portion" is defined by reference to the  number  of

pages  of  the work.  Such a measurement may not be possible  in

the  electronic  environment.  Clause 3 of  the  Bill  therefore

extends the definition for works in the digital format by  using

the measurement of electronic bytes.

<br><br><i>Exceptions for libraries and archives</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment concerns the exception for libraries

and archives to make a copy of a work for preservation and other

purposes  and  the exception for anyone to make  a  copy  of  an

unpublished  work kept in a library or archive for research  and

private study in sections 47 and 48.  These amendments remove or

replace words like "microform" and "manuscript".

<br><br><i>Exceptions for educational institutions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third amendment concerns the ability of educational

institutions  to  make copies of works within prescribed  limits

for  educational purposes.  Clauses 10 and 11 of the Bill extend

this   permission  to  include  copies  of  works  on   networks

controlled or operated by educational institutions.   This  will

facilitate educational institutions using Internet and other new

technologies  to  conduct distance learning  courses  and  other

educational activities.

<br><br><i>Performers' protection</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we introduced provisions in the Copyright Act to

protect performers' rights.  These provisions are found in  Part

XII  of  the  Act.  Based on feedback which we have received,  a

number of measures are introduced in this Bill to fine-tune  the

provisions  concerning performer's rights  and  to  allow  those

rights to be protected more effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in order to conform with international norms,

performers' rights are extended to allow performers to have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2075</b></font><br><br>

recourse  against commercial dealings in pirated  recordings  of

their  performances  and  to make such  commercial  dealings  an

offence.   Secondly, the present restriction in the Act  against

assignment by performers of their right to sue is removed.  This

will   allow   performers  to  take  action  through  collective

management   agencies.   Thirdly,  the  Bill   also   allows   a

broadcaster  and a performer to agree to a period  of  retention

for  recordings of his performance made for broadcast  which  is

longer  than  the statutory prescribed period.   This  amendment

will give effect to existing commercial practice.

<br><br><i>Border enforcement measures</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Copyright Act was amended to introduce

border enforcement measures.  These are in sections 140A through

140R  of the Act.  These provisions allow a copyright owner  who

suspects  that  a  shipment  of pirated  goods  is  coming  into

Singapore to alert the Customs and Excise Department so that the

goods can be seized.  Certain safeguards have already been built

into  the provisions when they were introduced last year.  Based

on   feedback   and  experience,  two  further  safeguards   are

introduced by clauses 18 and 20 of the Bill to ensure  that  the

border enforcement provisions are not abused.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first safeguard will empower an authorised officer to

require  a  complainant to give security in relation to  damages

which he may be ordered to pay for wrongful seizure.  The second

safeguard is to allow a person aggrieved by the seizure to apply

to the court for compensation if the complainant fails to follow

up on the seizure by taking infringement action, or having taken

infringement   action,  the  court  then   rules   against   the

complainant or if the complainant withdraws the action.

<br><br><i>Other Amendments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to wrap up, may I quickly touch on the remaining

amendments in the Bill.  Clause 13 deletes section 108(2) so  as

to  widen the scope of the public performance rights of authors.

Clauses 15

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2076</b></font><br><br>

and 17 amend sections 120 and 136 to widen the category of items

on  which the court may make a delivery up order.  The amendment

to  section 136 further allows an application for search warrant

to  be made in any court.  Currently, such applications can only

be  made before a magistrate.  Clause 22 amends section  199  to

provide that a broadcaster's right to re-transmit a broadcast by

cable  without  infringing copyright in the underlying  work  is

restricted to broadcasts originating in Singapore.

<br><br><i>Future directions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in closing, let me say that this Bill reinforces

Singapore's commitment to provide a strong intellectual property

rights  regime  to encourage the growth of a knowledge-based  or

information  economy  and  to promote  e-commerce  and  creative

innovations.   As  technologies are ever  evolving  and  as  new

issues   surface   as  a  result  of  the  constantly   changing

environment, I must say that this Bill is by no means  the  last

word  on the subject.  We will continue to monitor international

developments  and we may have to propose further refinements  to

our copyright regime to cope with the technological developments

as  and when the need arises.  We are committed to ensuring that

our  copyright law will be responsive to the changing  needs  of

industries  and we will continue to evolve to take into  account

new developments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to support the Minister's motion and the three  purposes of

this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to address, however, certain

wider  concerns and make certain clarifications which will  help

in the future interpretation of the Act in the market place.   I

am  also  glad that the Minister says that this Bill is not  the

last  word, and I therefore think that even if these issues  are

not addressed today, they can be addressed in a future copyright

amendment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2077</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to realise that copyright was a right

created to protect the authors of books, and it has been  slowly

extended  over  the  years  and centuries  to  include  dramatic

performances,  sound  recordings,  films  and  now  the  further

extension into the world of e-commerce and the Internet.  It  is

very  important  to realise too that some of the older  concepts

have to be changed, because as the Minister has mentioned, every

time  we browse and surf the Internet, we are actually breaching

somebody's copyright, because we are copying his material on  to

our  computer.   It is therefore good to have this  Bill  but  I

think  it  may  one day be important for us to think  of  a  sui

generis  protection, not to extend copyright but to think  of  a

specific right to protect computerised material.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I would like to raise certain issues in

clause 3 of the Bill which redefines the proposed section  7  of

the Copyright Act.  Under the proposed section 7(2), there is an

attempt to indicate what reasonable portion means in the context

of electronic material.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old world of paper, we could say that 10% of a book

would  be a substantial copy, and anything beyond that is not  a

reasonable  portion  to use.  However, I am a  little  concerned

that we are now trying to extend this paper world rule into  the

electronic medium and trying to say that instead  of 10% of  the

material,  we now talk about 10% of the bytes.  And 10%  of  the

bytes, to me, is really an arbitrary and rigid definition for an

electronic medium.  For example, if I take two pages from a book

of  100  pages, that is not an infringement under the 10%  rule.

But  two  pages  from an electronic work of similar  length  may

actually  contain  two pages in format which contain  a  lot  of

bytes.   It  could be, for example, in PDF format, video,  sound

or  animated graphics, which require a lot of bytes.  Or perhaps

in  these  two  pages,  the  author  has  embedded  his  digital

watermark and therefore there are a lot of bytes in there.   And

just by taking two pages from the book, not knowing that he  has

embedded this digital

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2078</b></font><br><br>

watermark,  I  have infringed his copyright.  I would  like  the

Minister  to  assure  us  that this  indeed  is  not  the  case.

Otherwise, a blind extension of the old rule is not good enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 4 which is a new section 7A, there is an

attempt  to  include multimedia material in  the  definition  of

"compilation".   Most web sites today would be  compilations  of

some  sort.  There will be different things in there  -   texts,

graphics,  animations, video and so on.  And it would really  be

useful to say that these things are also protected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I would like to explore the further question which

is  whether  we  should  really try and extend  the  concept  of

literary  work  to  these areas, or whether we  should  actually

start thinking of a special right, perhaps a database right  and

special computer compilation right.  Some countries have  indeed

database  law.  However, computerised material does not  contain

just computer databases.  And under section 7A, that appears  to

be the intention.  The compilation should be of various relevant

materials  which includes sound recordings, cinematograph  films

and so on.  But sub-section (3) of the proposed section 7A deals

with  compilation  or  table wholly  of  relevant  materials  or

compilation   or   table  of  partly  relevant   materials,   or

compilation of data.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of "data" here is not stated but I suppose

reading in the context, it refers to computer data and therefore

you either have a compilation of relevant materials wholly or in

part or just purely computer data.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do believe however that the word "data" is not just

simply a technical word for bytes and bits of computer data, but

it  also means nuggets of facts and figures which together  form

information.  And therefore that is the plain English meaning of

this  word  and  it would mean therefore that a compilation  can

either  be  of  relevant materials like video, tapes  and  sound

recordings  and/or  data.  And so when this section  deals  with

compilation as disjunctive references, I take it that it  misses

out on the fact that a database

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2079</b></font><br><br>

or an Internet site may contain video and data at the same time.

Perhaps  the  Minister could also clarify this rather  technical

point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, "relevant material" here is defined but I think

it  probably misses out on certain aspects of computer databases

and  web  pages,  and that it does not appear  to  me  to  cover

animated  graphics or unpublished computer programmes  basically

on  the exclusio unius principle, ie, in the first definition of

"relevant   material",  it  refers  specifically  to   a   work,

"including  a computer program".  Therefore, subsequently,  when

it  says in paragraph (d) "a published edition of a work", there

would be no reference to a computer program.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I want to make about this Bill is that in

clause  10,  in  the proposed section 51(3) and (4),  there  are

certain  exemptions given for teachers who teach in  educational

institutions.   Sometimes  they  do  have  to  make  copies   of

copyrighted material and we do need to give them some protection

from   being   prosecuted  or  sued  for  breaching   somebody's

copyright.  I hope, however,  and this is not clear in the Bill,

there  is protection for a teacher who is teaching a class using

a  laptop  and - besides the fact that he has got to download  a

website and other relevant copyrighted materials on his laptop - sometimes,  he may actually need to access on-line, say,  eg,  a

website  to demonstrate the features of the website.   Sometimes

not  all  classrooms have got the on-line connection, or perhaps

there  is an on-line connection but the teacher feels that  when

he  teaches,  he  wants to be sure that he  can  logon  to  that

website  without  having to wait for traffic to  clear,  without

having  all  kinds of unexpected problems.  So he  may  actually

want  to download the whole site onto his laptop, and then refer

to  it  in  the  course of his lectures.  As I  read  currently,

clause  10,  it  does not seem to protect him in  that  sort  of

situation, because when he downloads a whole website to  protect

himself from unexpected downtime, for example, he would actually

be breaching the 5% or the 500-page rule.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2080</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point I want to make is on clause 21 which is

the proposed section 193B.  There is this further elaboration of

what a network service provider will be protected against.  When

I  first read this Bill, Sir, I realised that there is a general

immunity to network service providers given in section 10 of the

Electronic  Transactions Act.  And when I heard  the  Minister's

speech in this House, I have the understanding - and I hope  the

Minister  will correct me if this is the wrong understanding   - that   there   is   the  general  immunity  in  the   Electronic

Transactions Act, and what we are legislating here  is  that  in

certain  circumstances where copyright is concerned, we  have  a

special immunity for certain network service providers who  feel

that  they can come under this protection and therefore it  does

not   prejudice   his  general  defence  under  the   Electronic

Transactions  Act.  If it does prejudice his  position,  then  I

would  urge  this House to include the words "without prejudice"

to  the Electronic Transactions Act as a prefix, so to speak,  a

clause which prefixes this new section.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my final point is that under clause 21 of the Bill

which proposes a new section 193C, particularly subsections 2(a)

and  2(c), there is mention of control and I seek the Minister's

clarification.  "Control" is not defined and it  could  well  be

technical.   Most  of the time it is a technical  control.   But

would it be possible for somebody to argue in court that because

the  ISP has put in certain contractual provisions, for example,

to  prohibit  a  user  from accessing  pornography  on  pain  of

damages,  that  he  therefore has control and  is  out  of  this

defence?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point under this clause I want to raise is that

there is a procedure of what I would call a notice to take down.

In other words, if a network has got infringing material and the

copyright  owner says, "I send you notice to take it  down,  you

must  do so."  As it is phrased currently, I think there is some

room  for abuse.  First of all, it is possible where the  stakes

are   high  enough  for  somebody  to  allege  infringement  and

therefore  send  a statutory declaration purportedly  signed  by

him.  And then there is no timeframe to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2081</b></font><br><br>

take  down the pages and there is no procedure to challenge this

notice to take down.  It, first of all, should be necessary, not

just  to  have a statutory declaration, because a person,  where

the stakes are high enough, may say, "I am happy to be fined for

perjury, but I want to stop this competitor in his tracks."   So

it  would  be  necessary for a properly authenticated  statutory

declaration, or perhaps a court order.  Secondly,  it  would  be

important to clarify how an overseas copyright owner can  get  a

statutory  declaration that is valid under Singapore law.   What

happens  if his own law does not allow for or does not permit  a

statutory  declaration?  There is also a need to make sure  that

there is a certain time frame to respond and a redress mechanism

perhaps  for  abuse of the notice to take down.  This  procedure

can also be evaluated in a court of law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on clause 21, I would certainly hope the Minister

can  clarify,  because the words "network service provider"  are

not  defined, whether perhaps a search engine provider would  be

such  a network service provider.  In the circumstances where  a

search engine provider may actually allow a user of the Internet

to   download  certain  copies  of  other  people's  copyrighted

materials, would a search engine provider then be deemed to be a

violator,  infringer or a facilitator of that  infringement?   I

hope  that with these clarifications, the Bill would  be  a  far

more  understandable provision when it is applied in the  market

place.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand to support the

Copyright (Amendment)  Bill.  However, I would like the Minister

for Law to deliberate on several areas of the Bill.

<br><br><i>Clause 3 -</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7(2A)(a) states what constitutes a reasonable

portion for copying as not exceeding 10% of the total number  of

bytes.  May I ask the Minister why this portion is fixed at  not

more than the 10% stipulated?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7(2A)(b) states "in a case where the work is

divided into chapters, exceeds,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2082</b></font><br><br>

in  the  aggregate, 10% of the total number  of  bytes  in  that

edition  but contains only the whole or part of a single chapter

of the work".  This is rather ambiguous, if not confusing.  Does

this mean that copying of 10% of each chapter is allowed or that

the  total copying of the whole edition regardless of the number

of chapters should not be more than 10% of the whole text?

<br><br><i>Clause 10 -</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 51(5) specifies that a person cannot make a copy of

any  other  part of that work "within 14 days after the  day  on

which  the previous copy was made."  I would like the Minister's

deliberation  on this time interval.  In my opinion,  a  shorter

period  like  seven  days  would,  in  fact,  be  better  as  it

facilitates the users' need for research.

<br><br><i>Clauses 15 and 17 -</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In section 120(1), the words "predominantly used" have not

been  defined.  Similarly, the words were used again in  section

136(a) and not defined.

<br><br><i>Clause 23 -</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 201B is unsatisfactory because it would cause some

injustice.  When the partnership or the body corporate has  been

charged   or   punished,  the  individual  should   be   spared.

Punishment  to  both  individual and  the  partnership  or  body

corporate  would result in duplicity of charges and  punishment.

If  the  individual should be culpable, then he should  be  held

responsible and not the partnership or body corporate.  However,

if  it  is  intended  to  be a collective punishment,  then  the

partnership   or  body  corporate  be  punished  and   not   the

individual.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank both Dr Toh See

Kiat  and  Dr Lily Neo for their comments.  Before I  deal  with

their specific points, since the issues they have raised touched

on  fairly  technical  matters, let me make  a  few  preliminary

comments.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2083</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I am not an expert on some of these technical issues

and  I  will  bow to my colleagues on technical issues  such  as

digital  watermarks, animated graphics and so on.   But  let  me

assure  my colleagues that these and other questions of  details

have been carefully considered and formulated by an inter-agency

Committee  which included experts from different agencies,  such

as   the  National  Computer  Board,  staff  from  the  National

University of Singapore who are well versed in computer  law  as

well as representatives from other agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I want to make is that on the solutions and

approaches which I referred to and which are to be found in  the

Bill, I do not expect them to please or satisfy everyone because

there are so many different ways and approaches to solving these

very   difficult  problems  in  the  context  of  ever  changing

technological  developments.   Also,  different  countries   are

grappling with these issues and have adopted diverse approaches.

We  could, of course, wait for months and years to see  how  the

dust  has  settled  in  other countries.   But  because  of  the

considerations which I have alluded to in my speech just now  as

well  as  last year, we want to have an effective and up-to-date

copyright  regime  and intellectual property right  regime.   We

have  to make changes as and when the need arises.  So we cannot

wait  for  all the developments which have taken place and  then

decide  which  is the most perfect solution.   It  is  really  a

matter  of  judgment.   In arriving at the approaches,  we  have

taken  into account the developments in other countries as  well

as the existing scheme in our Copyright Act because our approach

has  been  that  if  the  existing scheme  for  other  forms  of

copyright has worked fairly well, then we will try to follow  as

far  as  possible  a  similar approach and we  will  try  to  be

consistent.   But as I said, this is not the last  word  on  the

subject.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me turn to some of the specific

points  raised  by  Dr Toh See Kiat, in the order  in  which  he

referred  to.   First, he talked about clause 3 (section  7)  on

"reasonable portion".  Of course, he has a point as  to  whether

we could leave

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2084</b></font><br><br>

"reasonable  portion"  undefined  for  electronic  documents  or

whether  10% of the bytes is arbitrarily rigid.  Let me  explain

that  the  approach  we  have taken  is  to  define  "reasonable

portion"  for electronic works because we wanted to  provide  in

the  legislation a minimum level of certainty.   Therefore,  the

definition, I should stress, is not exhaustive.  It is expressly

provided that the definition does not limit the meaning  of  the

phrase  "reasonable portion".  If, say,  more than  10%  of  the

number of bytes is copied, the court could still regard that  as

copying only a reasonable portion, because it all depends on the

circumstances  of the case.  I am advised that such  flexibility

will  address  the special cases which Dr Toh See Kiat  referred

to, such as the example concerning digital watermarks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he referred to questions of compilation, whether it is

conjunctive or disjunctive in clause 4 (new section 7A).  Let me

say that this definition in subsection 3 is actually intended to

capture any compilation that falls within either paragraph  (a),

(b)  or  (c).   The  definition should not be made  conjunctive,

because  if  we did so, then it will imply that the  compilation

must  satisfy  all three paragraphs before it can be  protected,

and that is not the intention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh also made a point about "relevant material". The

way  the phrase "relevant material" is defined in section  7A(3)

is  to  include  a work and a work is defined in  section  7  as

meaning   a  literary,  dramatic,  musical  or  artistic   work.

Therefore, graphics would be an artistic work and is a  relevant

material.   A computer program is a relevant material regardless

of  whether  it is published or not.  A published edition  of  a

work  is  specifically mentioned because  there  is  a  separate

copyright in the typographical format that lasts 25 years  in  a

published  edition.  There is no need to state computer  program

again  in  paragraph (d) since paragraph (a) already mentions  a

computer  program, and that will cover published and unpublished

computer programs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh See Kiat also spoke about clause 10, new section

51(3) and 51(4), and talked

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2085</b></font><br><br>

about  the  teachers' possible problem.  Let me say,  in  reply,

that  the 5% rule applies in the print media as well.  Thus,  in

the  print media, if he looks at the provisions of the Act,  the

teacher  can  only  make multiple copies of 5%  of  a  work  for

teaching purposes without infringing copyright.  But it is  felt

that there is no reason not to apply the same restriction in  an

electronic  environment.   I should  also  point  out  that  new

section 51 only applies to making a copy on a network controlled

or  operated by an educational institution.  I realise  that  Dr

Toh See Kiat would favour a more liberal regime where even if he

were  to  download it onto his personal laptop,  from  a  policy

point of view, it would be difficult to give a blanket exemption

for  downloading for teaching purposes.  But let me at the  same

time  point  out that teaching online is facilitated because  if

the  teaching is done through real time access to websites, they

can always rely on the exception for browsing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh See Kiat referred to clause 21, new section 193B,

and  whether we should insert the words "without prejudice".   I

should  point  out that the proposed new section 193B  is  wider

than section 10 of the Electronic Transactions Act because there

is  no  requirement that the material is a third party  material

which is found in section 10 of the other Act.  Therefore, there

is  no  need  to  insert "without prejudice"  since  it  is  not

narrower  than section 10.  It is wider.  In other  words,  this

provision  is  more detailed only because it is meant  to  apply

exclusively  to  the  question  of  copyright.  The   Electronic

Transactions Act has a different objective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh also talked about terminology control, technical

contractual  provisions, ISP prohibiting  users  from  accessing

pornography, and so on.  I think the answer to this  is  to  say

that  the control required is over the network.  The conjunctive

end  for  operator  and  control in section  193C(2)(a)  is  the

operative element.  Therefore, it must be a network operated  by

the  NSP  as  well.  An NSP is only obliged to remove  materials

from such a network.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2086</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also talked about the requirement of statutory

declaration.  I would say that we should not read too much  into

the  term purported as a statutory declaration really has to  be

authenticated.   As  Dr  Toh  See  Kiat  knows,  it  has  to  be

authenticated by a Commissioner of Oaths.  Having a  requirement

for court order, in my view, would be too cumbersome as the real

idea  here  is  to give copyright owners a quick redress  before

they  take  out copyright infringement actions.  So  nobody  has

said about statutory declaration.  But I do not think people  in

Singapore take statutory declarations that lightly because there

are  penalties which follow if one makes a statutory declaration

fraudulently.  The requirement of a statutory declaration, in my

view, itself should suffice to prevent abuse because there is  a

redress  for  prosecution for false statutory declaration.   Any

aggrieved  party can also take out a civil action for  malicious

prosecution against a defender who has made a false declaration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this provision concerns Singapore's network service

providers,  I  think  it is reasonable  for  us  to  expect  the

copyright  owners  would contact the network  service  providers

through agents located in Singapore.  It is foreseeable that  in

practice,   such   declarations  may  be  made  for   collective

management agencies.  As I have said, mechanisms for redress for

abuse  of notice can be taken care of by civil action.   In  the

United States, as he referred to the system in the US, there  is

a challenge mechanism because the notice is not required to be a

statutory  declaration as far as I understand the United  States

system,  and there is less safeguard against abuse.  But  as  we

have  incorporated  the  safeguard in  the  notice  through  the

requirement of a statutory declaration before a Commissioner  of

Oaths,  the  challenge  mechanism  involving  NSP  may  not   be

necessary.  That is the explanation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the timeframe in which the NSP should act, I think a

reasonable time is a tested formula, and I doubt if a NSP  would

not act within such reasonable time when it receives a statutory

declaration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the questions raised by Dr Lily Neo, first, she

also touched on clause

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2087</b></font><br><br>

3  (section 7, subsection 2A) on "reasonable portion".   Let  me

repeat here again that section 7(2A) is an extension of existing

section  7(2A) into the digital environment.  The 10%  yardstick

is  actually  taken  from section 7(2A) which  provides  that  a

reasonable portion includes a copy of not more than 10%  of  the

number  of  pages in a work.  The approach of taking  10%  as  a

yardstick,  of course, was taken sometime back when  we  enacted

this  particular  provision  in 1987.   It  is  felt  that  this

provision  has worked quite well all these years.  And  when  we

decided  to  insert  the  new section 7(2A)  to  make  the  term

"reasonable portion" relevant to the digital environment, it was

felt  that there was no good reason to depart from the yardstick

of  10% which has been used all these years.  While it is  clear

that  copying only 10% for the purpose of research  and  private

study  will  not amount to infringement, I want to  stress  that

this does not mean that copying more than 10% will automatically

result  in  infringement.  In other words,  where  more  than  a

reasonable  portion is copied for the purpose  of  research  and

private  study, we then deal with the issue whether the  copying

is  a  fair  dealing in the light of circumstances of the  case.

And as Members know, there are other provisions which relate  to

fair dealing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also touched on provisions which talk about

work  being  divided  into chapters and so  on,  whether  it  is

ambiguous, if not confusing.  Here again this phrase is a mirror

of section 7(2B), the existing provision.  The amendments merely

extend  the  application  of an already  existing  provision  to

enable  its  application  in a digital  environment.   What  the

provision  really  says  is that "reasonable  portion"  means  a

single chapter of the work or 10% of the work, whichever is  the

greater.   But this is based on an existing approach already  to

be found in the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 10, Dr Lily Neo raised the question of 14 days

and  7  days.   Here again I want to point out that  the  14-day

limit  is  the approach already to be found in existing  section

51.  The Bill merely extends the existing provisions so as to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2088</b></font><br><br>

make  them applicable in an electronic environment.  Section  51

is   more   appropriate  for  multiple  copying  by  educational

institutions.  If her concern, as I understand it, is about  the

problems  which  researchers and students may face,  I  wish  to

point  out to her that students or researchers can rely  on  the

fair  dealing  provision in section 35  for  private  study  and

research.  And in section 35, there is no 14-day limit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Dr Lily Neo referred to clauses 15 and 17 concerning

section  120(1) on the phraseology "predominantly used" and  why

this  has  not  been  defined.  We have not  defined  this  term

because in some instances, and this is one, it may be better  to

leave  it to the courts to apply the provisions to the facts  of

individual  cases.   It  is  not  possible  really  to  give   a

definition  to  every  term because circumstances  may  vary  so

vastly.  In appropriate circumstances, for example, in the  case

where  a photocopying machine has been found to be predominantly

used  for  making  infringing copies by  the  defendant  on  the

particular   facts  of  a  case,  the  court  can   order   that

photocopying  machine, for example, to be delivered  up  to  the

plaintiff.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo then referred to clause 23. It is a provision

relating   to  offences  committed  by  partnerships   or   body

corporate.   Let me say here that this provision is not  new  in

our  laws.   An equivalent provision can be found in  the  Trade

Marks  Act  and the Patents Act.  In fact, you can find  similar

approaches  in  at least 20 other pieces of legislation  in  our

statute  books.  The provision really gives flexibility  whether

to  charge  only  the  corporation or the individual,  or  both.

Sometimes  the  facts of the case would make it  appropriate  to

charge  only one or the other.  Sometimes it would be  necessary

to charge both the corporation and the individual to ensure that

either one or the other is not let off unfairly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me stress that this is not what lawyers referred to as

a  "strict  liability" provision.  In other words, the  partners

who  are directors and who are proved to be ignorant or who have

attempted to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2089</b></font><br><br>

prevent  the  commission of the offence would not be  caught  by

this  provision.  In other words, the prosecution will  have  to

produce evidence against these people before they are convicted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have touched on the main provisions. But my

reply should not be taken to dismiss their ideas and suggestions

out  of  hand.   There  are many different approaches  to  these

difficult,  tricky issues of copyright.  The fact that  we  have

adopted  these measures shows that we would like to  give  these

approaches a try.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made amendments as a result of feedback and

experience  to  some of the other provisions  which  we  enacted

sometime ago.  And so it goes on.  Copyright is one area of  the

law which is fast evolving.  So we will see how these provisions

work.   I  hope that in the light of experience, they will  work

effectively.  But our consultations with the industry and  other

professional  bodies  as  well as  the  different  agencies  and

Ministries  will  continue.  And it may  be  necessary  after  a

decent  interval of time to come back to this House if  we  find

that the provisions need updating.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.

In   referring  to  a  classroom  situation,  the  Minister  has

mentioned  that in the print medium situation, the teachers  are

allowed  5% copying and that where online teaching is used,  the

teacher  would have ample protection.  I am just concerned  that

in the situation we are in today, we want to have a nation of IT

users  and  teachers must therefore have the utmost  freedom  to

teach and use facilities that sometimes may not be there,  in  a

sense  that not all classrooms have online connections  and  not

all  students  can  afford.  In a print  medium  situation,  the

students  can buy books if more than 5% is used.   But  not  all

students will be able to afford an online connection, especially

one without wires in a classroom situation.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> His concern is noted. I will discuss it

with the Committee.  It is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2090</b></font><br><br>

really  a  question of balancing.  From the  point  of  view  of

promoting  the  interests of our educational  institutions,  the

ideal  situation  of course is if they do not  have  to  observe

copyright at all!  But we have to balance the interest of  users

of  copyright in the private sector, individual users, corporate

users,  educational users, state users of copyright as  well  as

the  rights  of copyright owners.  This is really the  heart  of

copyright  legislation - how do you balance competing  interests

to  strike  a  balanced regime that promotes  and  protects  the

interest  of  copyright owners, and at the same  time  does  not

hinder  the dissemination of knowledge, acquisition of knowledge

and eventually the advancement of our national interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [Prof. S. Jayakumar].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;

read a Third time and passed.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2090</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>LAND SURVEYORS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Land Surveyors Act was enacted in 1970 to provide

for  the  registration of land surveyors  and  to  regulate  the

provision  of  cadastral survey works in  Singapore.   Cadastral

surveys  are  surveys  to  record land  boundaries,  subdivision

lines, buildings and related details. The Act requires surveyors

to  be registered with the Land Surveyors Board before they  are

allowed  to undertake cadastral surveys. However, the  Act  does

not require surveyors who undertake non-cadastral surveys to  be

registered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-cadastral surveys include topographical, engineering

and   hydrographic  surveys.   These  surveys  are  related   to

cadastral  surveys as they share the same set of survey  control

points and are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2091</b></font><br><br>

invariably  related to the parcel boundaries. This is especially

so   with  the  introduction  of  modern  equipment  using   new

technology   such  as  global  positioning  system   (GPS)   and

Information   Technology.   These  two  types  of  surveys   are

increasingly overlapping in scope.  Surveyors carrying out  non-cadastral  surveys  should  therefore  be  conversant  with  the

cadastral survey system and practices.  Their surveys will  then

be  consistent  with  cadastral survey plans,  thereby  reducing

inconsistency and errors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as surveyors undertaking non-cadastral surveys

currently  need not register with the Land Surveyors Board,  the

Board  cannot  discipline any non-registered  surveyor  for  any

negligence  in undertaking non-cadastral survey works.   Indeed,

the   Board   cannot  take  disciplinary  action  even   against

registered  surveyors  for any negligence  in  undertaking  non-cadastral  survey  works  as the Act  only  regulates  cadastral

surveys.   These  errant  surveyors can  currently  continue  to

undertake  even  cadastral survey works. Conversely,  registered

surveyors  who are suspended from practice by the Land Surveyors

Board  can  still undertake non-cadastral survey  works.    This

situation is not desirable for the surveying profession.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.17 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments will also check the undesirable practice

of  non-cadastral  survey  works being certified  by  registered

surveyors who have not supervised or been involved in the actual

surveys.  For example, in April this year, a registered surveyor

was  sued for an erroneous setting out survey plan signed by him

but  carried out by a surveying technician operating on his own.

Subsequently, two rows of terrace houses up to roof  level  were

demolished.   The  case  was settled out  of  court.   The  Land

Surveyors  Board  received a complaint  against  the  registered

surveyor  but  could  not act as it was a non-cadastral  survey.

This case is bad enough.  Let us not wait for a major

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2092</b></font><br><br>

disaster to happen before doing something about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above reasons, there is a need to amend the Land

Surveyors  Act  to regulate surveyors undertaking  non-cadastral

survey  works.   Clause 9 has the effect of requiring  surveyors

undertaking  any survey, whether cadastral or non-cadastral,  to

be   registered  as  Registered  Surveyors  and  to  hold  valid

practising certificates.  This will improve the quality of  non-cadastral survey work as all registered surveyors will  have  to

comply  with  rules made by the Land Surveyors  Board  for  non-cadastral survey work.  Besides upgrading professional standards

and  ensuring  accountability of all practising surveyors,  thus

promoting  public interest, this measure will also increase  the

pool of Registered Surveyors.  Sir, indeed, upgrading of skills,

especially  professional  expertise,  is  a  fact  of  life   in

Singapore.  This happens in other professions too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, rightly so, surveyors registered under the Act

must  possess acceptable qualifications specified  in  the  Land

Surveyors  Rules.   They must also pass prescribed  examinations

conducted by the Land Surveyors Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The requirement to register surveyors who undertake non-cadastral surveys will take effect immediately for new entrants

to  the surveying profession.  For practising surveyors who  are

currently not registered, a 4-year extension will be granted for

them to prepare for and pass the prescribed examinations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the requirement to upgrade and register will mean

adjustment  on  the part of those affected.   Some  may  not  be

happy.   They  include  members  of  the  Society  of  Surveying

Technicians.     However,   they,   like   their    professional

counterparts  in  the  Singapore  Institute  of  Surveyors   and

Valuers,  should  make  the  effort to  upgrade  by  taking  the

necessary courses and examinations.  That is why the requirement

to  register will only take effect in four years' time.  This is

ample time.  For those who have demonstrated that they have made

the effort but still fail

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2093</b></font><br><br>

to make the grade within these four years, they can apply to the

Minister  to extend this grace period for another two years.   I

will  move  an amendment to the Bill in the Committee  stage  on

this later.  For those surveying technicians who do not have the

necessary  academic or professional qualification, I  understand

that  Singapore Polytechnic is prepared to conduct  a  part-time

Advanced  Diploma course to enable them to obtain the  necessary

academic qualifications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other main amendment is to provide for the

registration  of field assistants, renamed assistant  surveyors,

under  the  Act.  They are also called Surveying Technicians  in

the  industry.   In  practice,  field  assistants  making  field

measurements  in  cadastral surveys have been  registered  since

1972.   This  Bill  makes registration and the Board's  approval

before a registered surveyor can employ an assistant surveyor to

undertake both cadastral and non-cadastral work a requirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Field assistants are employed by registered surveyors to

enter  land and buildings, to demarcate property boundaries  and

to make and record field measurements.  Such field data are used

in  survey  computation and plan drawings by office  staff.   As

field data are the primary data source of any survey work, field

assistants  should  possess  prescribed  qualifications  and  be

registered  under  the  Land Surveyors Act.   Like  the  earlier

amendment,  this will improve the quality of survey services  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, about 40 out of 400 field assistants provide

surveying  services on their own account, independently  of  any

firm  of registered surveyors.  As an effect of the Bill  is  to

require  all  forms of survey to be conducted by  or  under  the

supervision or direction of a registered surveyor, some of  them

may be concerned that their firms would be phased out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MinLaw has taken time to carefully consider this

concern.  Here, an important

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2094</b></font><br><br>

point  to note is that the Act will not take effect immediately,

but  only after four years.  As I had mentioned earlier,  during

this  time, field assistants who want to practise on  their  own

after   the   transition   period  should   upgrade   themselves

professionally  by taking the part-time Advanced Diploma  course

at  the  Singapore  Polytechnic.  I  understand  that  the  Land

Surveyors  Board  had asked Singapore Polytechnic  to  run  this

course  for  interested field assistants.  It  will  take  about

three    years   to  obtain  the  necessary  qualification   for

registration.   On top of that, as I mentioned  earlier,  anyone

who   despite   good  efforts  fails  to  pass  the   prescribed

examinations can apply to the Minister for an extension of up to

two years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers has

been  consulted  on these amendments and supports  them.   Major

users of non-cadastral surveys such as MINDEF, HDB and JTC  also

support the amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment brings the practice of land surveyors in

line  with  all the other professionals like the architects  and

engineers.  In the past, architects and engineers used  to  have

two  different  classes.  They used to have Class  2  registered

architects who consist primarily of those who have worked in the

profession mainly as draughtsmen for many years.  They have  not

gone  through  any  formal training but have  gained  sufficient

knowledge and experience to undertake simple architectural work.

At  that  time,  building  projects were  relatively  small  and

simple.  But as Singapore progresses and becomes a global  city,

building  projects become larger, in terms of size  as  well  as

complexity.  The demand and standard of architectural works have

also  become  higher  and higher.  As a result,  this  class  of

architects  has slowly been phased out and the registration  for

architects is now only confined to architects who are graduates

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2095</b></font><br><br>

from accredited universities with sufficient experience and have

passed  a professional practice examination.  Therefore,  it  is

timely  for the land surveyors, whether they do title survey  or

non-title survey, to be subject to the same regulatory standard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As building projects become more and more complex, the

skills  and experience of surveyors doing non-cadastral  surveys

are  just  as  demanding,  if not more than  cadastral  surveys,

because  of  the magnitude of the project size.  For example,  a

mistake in the setting out of a building, whether in the  siting

or, more critically, in the dimension, will create serious legal

and financial consequences.  The mistake, quoted by the Minister

of  State,  on the erroneous survey of the two rows  of  terrace

houses will be pale in comparison to the mistake made on a high-rise multi-million dollar project.  The amount of money involved

would be enormous.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is argued that, in cases like this, there is recourse

for  the aggrieved party to turn to common law.  However,  apart

from   the  legal  dispute,  there  is  also  the  question   of

professional   liability  and  accountability  for   negligence.

Therefore,  it  is  important that all practising  surveyors  be

governed   by   a   regulatory   board   that   oversees   these

practitioners, similar to that of the architects and  engineers.

Like  any other such changes, there will be people who would  be

affected  in  the  transition.  I am glad that the  Minister  of

State is moving an amendment to allow those who are caught,  ie,

those  without sufficient qualification, to seek an  opportunity

to  upgrade  themselves  so  that  they  can  be  qualified  for

registration.   The present surveying course in  the  university

will  only require four years to complete.  Therefore, I believe

that  those  experienced practitioners in the present  surveying

firms  would have the necessary experience and skills to upgrade

themselves and be able to pass the prescribed examination  after

attending  the  three-year part-time courses  in  the  Singapore

Polytechnic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also glad that the Singapore Polytechnic has provided

this part-time

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2096</b></font><br><br>

Advanced  Diploma course to cater to these surveyors.   However,

despite  the  Minister of State's explanation, I  am  still  not

convinced   by  the  provision  in  clause  16A  that  assistant

surveyors  must be approved by the Board before they  are  being

employed.   As registered architects and engineers  assume  full

responsibility  for  all their undertakings,  whether  they  are

executed  by them personally or with the help of their assistant

architects  or engineers, and whose employment does not  require

approval  from  their respective Boards even  though  they  also

perform  field work on behalf of the professionals, why then  is

approval  from  the  Land Surveyors Board be  required  for  the

employment of assistant surveyors?  I hope the Minister of State

can further comment on this point.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. I

shall  be very brief.  The Minister has pointed out the need  to

have  this Bill.  I am glad that this Bill will help in  raising

the standards of land surveyors in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in countries like Singapore, with its small size and

very  densely built, it is important that land surveyors have  a

high  standard, like the other professions.  I am very  relieved

that  the Minister of State has also assured that those who  are

caught in the transitional period will be given a further chance

of another two years because somebody has written to some of the

MPs here.  And I am glad that the Minister has acceded to this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the law will require every land surveyor to be

registered.  It will prevent any person from being employed as a

registered  surveyor  or  an  assistant  surveyor  without   the

approval  from  the  Board.   This  is  very  important.    Most

professional bodies require certain registration and I  am  glad

that this provision will help in lifting the standard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we would urge the Land Surveyors Board to do is to

have  courses conducted from time to time, just like the medical

and  legal professions are doing. It is important for us to have

registered surveyors.  It is very important

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2097</b></font><br><br>

for us in Singapore to improve ourselves by attending courses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I support in principle the Land Surveyors (Amendment) Bill

which  basically  aims to raise professional  standards  of  all

works performed by the land surveyors in Singapore.  This is  in

line  with  our current efforts to achieve world-class standards

of service in all our institutions to maintain our international

competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in our keenness to introduce legislative changes

to  achieve  a  higher standard of practice  and  service  in  a

particular industry, due consideration must also be given to the

interest  and  welfare  of the existing  service  providers  and

workers  who  have  contributed to the growth of  the  industry.

This  is  not only to avoid or reduce undue hardships  to  those

adversely  affected by the legislative changes of  the  industry

but  also  to help them to accept and adapt to these changes  so

that  they  can continue with their service and contribution  to

the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this amendment to the Land Surveyors Act, all land

surveyors including those who do not conduct cadastral  surveys,

will  be  required to be registered under the  Act.   Currently,

only  land  surveyors who conduct cadastral surveys need  to  be

registered.   The  existing definition of  "cadastral  services"

within  the  Land Surveyors Act (Chapter 156) would be  rendered

obsolete,  and  the  amendment would then be applicable  to  all

types  of survey services.  Directly affected by this new ruling

would be those surveyors who may have a track record of relevant

and  time-tested  surveying experience, but lack  the  requisite

professional qualification to register themselves with the  Land

Surveyors  Board  in  order to enable  them  to  continue  their

practice in the surveying industry.  Under the new ruling,  even

the registered surveyors would also not be able to employ any

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2098</b></font><br><br>

assistant  surveyor unless the Land Surveyors Board is satisfied

that  the  person  to  be  employed  as  an  assistant  surveyor

possesses the necessary qualifications recognised by the  Board.

These  constitute substantial changes from the current  industry

practice  and  require careful thought especially  in  terms  of

their impact on both the service providers and the end-users  of

the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would therefore like to ask the

Minister  whether he could provide statistics on the  number  of

non-registered  surveyors and assistant surveyors  who  will  be

adversely affected by these legislative changes and what sort of

measures  are  being taken to help those surveying professionals

adapt  to these changes so that they can continue their practice

to make useful contributions and earn a living in their field.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister whether his Ministry

has  studied  the  supply  side of the surveying  profession  in

introducing  such  a  legislative change.  Is  there  already  a

shortage of qualified professional surveyors to meet the growing

industrial  needs?   Moreover, I wish to  ask  whether  the  new

restriction  will lead to a severe shortage of  supply,  thereby

hindering  the  construction work and increasing the  price  and

cost of the surveying works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 does provide a transitional provision, whereby

all  land  surveyors who conduct surveys, other  than  cadastral

surveys, be permitted to engage in carrying out such surveys for

a period of four years from the date of commencement of the Land

Surveyors  (Amendment) Act 1999.  However,  in  my  opinion,  an

interim  period of four years may be insufficient for  the  land

surveyors who are currently not registered surveyors to  prepare

themselves for the new industrial criteria.  I am however,  very

pleased  to  note the latest amendment in the Bill which  states

that upon receipt of application filed before the expiry of  the

four-year  period,  the  Minister  would  consider  granting  an

extension to the original transitional period of four  years  by

another two years, and making it six years in total.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2099</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, while I fully advocate the

rationale for upholding the excellent service standards  in  the

land  surveying  business, especially  in  Singapore's  service-oriented  economy, we must also ensure that those  who  will  be

adversely  affected  will be given the necessary  assistance  to

adapt  to  the  changes, and that the costs of  delivering  such

services are kept competitive.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill as

amended.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to associate myself with some of

the  comments made by NMP, Mr Tay Beng Chuan, just before me and

I will try not to repeat the points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that clearly in this time of economic crisis, we

have  two  quite  different  but intertwining  concerns  of  the

Singapore  economy  as a whole.  First is to  help  people  keep

their  livelihood and the second is to upgrade to be  ready  for

the  new competition.  In this broader context, I find that  the

Bill  makes sense.  It does affect existing people.  It  affects

the  surveying technicians which others have spoken  about.   It

makes them unable to continue their practice as individual shops

or  their  own businesses in non-title surveys.   And therefore,

it  does  affect  their livelihood.  These are  a  small  but  a

necessary  number of sometimes very experienced individuals  who

know the ground well and who know their work.  And they have, in

that  sense, a legitimate concern.  In particular, one of  their

concerns  is  that  legislation seems  to  go  beyond  what  the

Australian  and UK requirements are as regards surveys  and  the

registration  of surveyors.  If I could invite the  Minister  of

State  to  comment on that.  If that is so, why is it  necessary

for Singapore to go beyond the Australian and UK requirements?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time, while we are affecting the livelihood

of  this  small but  necessary group, as I mentioned, the  other

impulse  and  requirement in Singapore's drive to become  world-class  is to upgrade to be competitive.  And here, I think  that

we should, in principle, support

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2100</b></font><br><br>

the  idea  of  registration and on improvements.   The  Minister

without  Portfolio, Mr Lim Boon Heng said it  quite  well  in  a

crisis.   He  said  that our degrees are in a  way  time-barred.

They  are  not a guarantee of perpetual employment or  perpetual

relevance to the economy that is emerging.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sense, the push for upgrading is the correct one.

What  we  then  need is to assist people who want to  make  that

upgrade,  that  is,  to make that possible  for  them  with  the

minimum  disruption. There would, of course, be  disruption  and

not everyone would be happy to have his or her normal livelihood

and  normal  way of life disrupted.  But I think the  amendments

proposed  by the Minister of State - to have a time period  upon

application,  possibly  six years, and  the  new  course  to  be

conducted  by  the polytechnics for the advanced diploma  -  are

necessary and sufficient.  But there is another hurdle of course

after that.  After the qualifications, there would still be  the

examinations  set  by  the Board and  I  would  ask  that  these

examinations be fair and foster suitable standards,  given  that

there  would  be in some ways a larger variation of quality  and

qualifications of people coming into the examinations.  That  is

to  say,  in  the past where it was mainly people of  university

degrees who sat for the examinations and only a small number  of

them  qualified,  we are going to have examinations  set  for  a

number  of  candidates without university degrees and,  instead,

with advanced diplomas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effort of the Minister to accommodate these changes is

a  very  good  one  and  shows that the Ministry  is  trying  to

accommodate differences.  This is not to preserve a monopoly  of

a  small clique, either the existing technicians or the existing

surveyors.  I think we must agree that a closed shop  in  either

sense  would be a bad thing for the construction and development

industry  of Singapore and Singapore as a whole.  Only  a  small

number  of  people  benefit from a closed  shop.   We  would  be

benefiting  if  we  were to professionalise in  a  way  that  is

competitive  and allows the pool of professional  and  qualified

people to be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2101</b></font><br><br>

increased  and  to  give the existing technicians  a  chance  to

compete on fair and even terms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, may I declare my

interest   as  an  employee  in  a  construction  and   property

development  company which would have, on many  occasions,  used

the  services of these surveyors and, in fact, our own staff  do

perform  non-cadastral  surveys and  they  are  unregistered  at

present.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to thank the Minister of State for his

explanation.   In  particular,  I  really  want  to  thank   the

arrangement  that  his  Ministry has  made  with  the  Singapore

Polytechnic  for  the  advanced  diploma  course  and  also  the

additional amendment to extend the period from four to six years

upon application.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that I fully agree with the need to register

practitioners  in this profession for the reasons  mentioned  by

the  Minister of State.  However, my apprehension is not in  the

need  to register but in the method of registration.  Right now,

the amendment as it is requires these people to be registered as

assistants  of  currently  registered surveyors  or  people  who

qualify  under current standards to be registered with the  Land

Surveyors  Board.   I  understand that  though  there  are  more

registered   surveyors,  actually  the  number   of   registered

surveyors    currently   practising,   that   means    providing

professional services for a fee, is only about 20.   This  means

that there is a possibility that if we cannot get more into  the

market,  we  might end up a closed shop and a very uncompetitive

market situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I would like the Minister of State to assure this

House  that  if  such a situation arises, he  would  change  the

method of registration to, for example, having a second registry

for non-cadastral surveys or even certain types of non-cadastral

surveys.  Then at least these people who perform the simpler non-cadastral surveys can be registered in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2102</b></font><br><br>

their  own names and probably maybe different standards be  set.

But  of  course,  they  cannot do the more complicated  or  more

complex  tasks  and  also certainly not the title  or  cadastral

surveys.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, at least there would be sufficient

practitioners   in   the   market  to  provide   a   competitive

environment. The reason that I am asking for this is that survey

work is a whole range of very simple surveys to very complicated

surveys.   It  is not like architectural work where the  minimum

standard  involved is relatively much higher.  But  there  is  a

range.   For  example, in the construction company that  I  work

for,  we  do a lot of very simple non-cadastral surveys on  site

and these are done by our own professionals. They could be civil

or  structural engineers, and they can do this. It is  not  that

they  cannot do it.  Of course, the starting point is  that  the

proper   cadastral   survey  is  done  by  a  fully   registered

professional.  But from the reference points, it is  really  not

difficult for somebody who is trained in engineering to do  very

simple surveys within the site.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, once you remove the word "cadastral" from the Act, as

it  is the intention of the amendment, then the question arises:

would  this type of very simple non-cadastral surveys be  caught

now  by the legislation?  Does this mean that anybody doing this

type  of work, whether the person is providing a service  for  a

fee or whether the person is doing it as a staff of, let us say,

a  construction company has to be registered?  Would the current

engineers  that are doing it now, where they actually  are  very

fully competent to do it, have to be registered too?  And if so,

would they have to take any additional examinations because,  as

I  said, these are all very simple survey works and anybody with

some  understanding of simple engineering skills should be  able

to do it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I would like the Minister of State to

confirm   that   the   registration  only   applies   to   those

professionals offering professional services for a fee and  they

do  not apply to staff of companies that actually do such simple

surveys for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2103</b></font><br><br>

their  company.  May I give an analogy that if a doctor were  to

prescribe medicine for somebody, even if it is a matter of  just

a  panadol  pill,  then obviously, he needs to be  a  registered

practitioner.   But  if  I feel sick, and  on  my  own,  I  take

panadol, it is self-medication.  Certainly, I do not need to  be

a  registered  doctor to prescribe panadol for myself.   So,  in

this  respect,  it  is the same thing.  If  I  ask  somebody  to

provide  a  non-cadastral survey for me,  then  I  am  asking  a

professional  for his services.  Then he should  be  registered.

But  if  one of my staff, for example, were to do a simple  non-cadastral survey on my construction site, then it is as if  that

the  company  is prescribing self-medication. I would  certainly

like  the Minister of State to confirm that there is no need  to

register such persons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to reiterate, I support the intent of the Bill to

register  all those who provide professional surveying services.

I  am  only concerned with the implementation of the intent.   I

therefore  hope  that  should the implementation  be  less  than

satisfactory,  the  Minister of State  or  his  successor  would

present another amendment Bill to this House at a future date.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I rise to express the concern of

the  Society of Surveying Technicians.  I believe they have also

written  to  other Members of this House and most of the  points

have  been  raised by speakers before me.  But I  just  wish  to

raise three points with the Minister.  Firstly, I would like  to

know  whether the cost of surveys would increase because of this

amendment Bill, as the number of survey firms would be limited.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like the Minister of State to assure this

House  that the existing practitioners would not be at the mercy

of  the  registered surveyors after the Act is amended.  Because

the  Bill, as it is now, requires them to be registered with the

registered  surveyors as assistant surveyors.  It  seems  to  me

that it is all under the registered surveyors' power or they are

at  their  mercy.  The market talk has been that the  registered

surveyors are waiting for money to come, because they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2104</b></font><br><br>

are  bound to make a lot of money as they will be the only  ones

who  will be able to practise when the amendment Bill comes into

effect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like the Minister to consider a suggestion

which was made by Mr Heng Chiang Meng.  Is it possible for us to

have  different classes of surveyors, instead of just registered

surveyors  that encompass everything?  Like in other trades,  we

have  technicians,  electricians and we also  have  professional

electrical   engineers.    There  are   different   classes   of

professionals.   Is  it  possible to consider  having  different

classes of surveyors doing different types of surveys?  They can

register directly with the board and practise, and they  can  do

whatever submissions that are needed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I thank all the speakers

who  have  spoken.  The different speakers who have spoken  have

injected various viewpoints to the discussion, some of which  we

have considered carefully after receiving representations.  What

I want to say at the outset is that, as captured very poignantly

by Mr Kenneth Chen and also repeated by Mr Simon Tay and others,

the  key  objectives of the amendments are, firstly, to  promote

accountability  of surveyors.  Currently the  situation  is  not

tenable, because there are people doing non-cadastral works  who

are not accountable to the Land Surveyors Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, promote public safety and interest. Mr Chen, who

is  an  architect, brings this up very well, that  as  Singapore

progresses in terms of  building styles and complexity, there is

a need to upgrade our surveyors.  Apparently simple mistakes can

result  in enormous losses.  And the example I gave in my speech

illustrates this point, where two rows of shophouses had  to  be

demolished.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I should start my speech on this point - the basic

objectives of the Bill.  Having said this, I want to debunk  any

allegation  that this Bill is to protect those who  are  already

registered.  This is related to what Mr Tay Beng Chuan has said.

He asked whether the amendments

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2105</b></font><br><br>

would  result in a shortage of registered surveyors.   In  fact,

the intent of this Bill is to require all professional surveyors

who   are  offering  survey  works  of  whatever  form,  whether

cadastral or non-cadastral, to register.  Currently, only  those

who  are  doing  survey  works of the  cadastral  type  need  to

register.   There  are currently about 30 of  such  unregistered

professional surveyors offering non-cadastral survey works,  who

are  not  yet  registered, which means that they  will  have  to

register.    What  they  will  do  is  to  take  the   necessary

examinations.   They  will  also  familiarise  themselves   with

cadastral  work,  and  then  they  will  register.   They   will

therefore  add  to  the  50-odd  registered  surveyors  who  are

currently  on the register, so that there will in fact  be  more

professional surveyors.  That is the first point.  This will not

reduce the pool but will increase the pool.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect of this is that these amendments will

indeed  give  impetus to field assistants to register.   In  the

Act,  they are renamed "Assistant Surveyors" and called  in  the

industry "Surveying Technicians".  The impetus will be there for

them  also to register, particularly those who want to  practise

on  their own.  As I have said in my speech, there are about 400

such  field assistants currently.  In fact, many will  be  quite

content with doing what they are doing now.  They are working in

Government departments and statutory boards, or they are working

as  field assistants for registered surveyors and they are quite

happy   doing  that.   So  they  will  not  want  to  take   the

examinations   to  upgrade  themselves  to  become  professional

surveyors.  But there will be some who will rise to the occasion

and  indeed these surveying technicians who have been  operating

on  their own, if they still want to continue operating on their

own, then it is quite likely that they will take the route which

is  open  to them.  The Singapore Polytechnic is organising  the

advanced diploma course for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good news for Mr Simon Tay is that the Singapore

Polytechnic is working towards a situation where they will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2106</b></font><br><br>

incorporate  the examinations which normally the surveyors  will

take  at the end into the course.  Because it is a part-time  3-year course, it will be comprehensive enough to also incorporate

the  legislation examination and the field work aspect into  the

course.   I do not think it has been finalised yet, but I  think

they  are  working towards that, so that it will  actually  give

incentive for those who want to continue providing survey  works

on  their  own to register.  This is an important point  because

this will in fact give the impetus, not only for upgrading,  but

for  more  to become registered.  Hence, we will have  a  larger

pool  of  people  offering  a higher quality  of  work,  thereby

enhancing competition and keeping costs competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other main point is the point that Mr Heng Chiang Meng

makes,  where he talks about the large variety of survey  works.

He  asks  whether  or not a separate register can  be  kept  for

people  who  want to do simple survey works.  I  should,  first,

clarify that there are two registration exercises.  The first is

to be registered as professional surveyors, and the other one is

registration as field assistants for those who are  working  for

or  employed by registered surveyors.  That is how the amendment

Bill is structured.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen realises this, because under the new

section  16A,  all registered surveyors who  want to  engage  or

employ  field  assistants will need approval of the  Board,  and

thereafter a register is kept for them.  Mr Chen asked why  this

needs  to be so.  I have mentioned in my speech the reasons  why

this  has to be so, because these field assistants are the  ones

who actually do the field work on the ground.  And in the nature

of  the  profession, they work very much on their own, no  doubt

under the direction and supervision of the registered surveyors,

but  the registered surveyors cannot be there all the time.  The

data  that they collect on the field is very important.  It will

be the original source data based on which the office staff will

do  the computation and draw up the field plans.  So there is  a

need  to ensure that field assistants are of a certain standard.

Having  said  this,  here  the standards  will  not  be  raised.

Registration for field assistants doing cadastral

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2107</b></font><br><br>

work  has  been  required since 1972.  So  it  is  a  matter  of

extending  it now to field assistants doing non-cadastral  work.

The requirements are quite basic  -  a diploma in surveying work

from  the polytechnic.  If not, then they need to pass a  course

in  cadastral  survey  conducted by the Singapore  Institute  of

Surveyors and Valuers.  These are not overly strict requirements

for field assistants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked whether, in Singapore, we are running

ahead  of other countries.  In fact, we are not the only country

doing this.  Our system is quite close to the Australian system,

and there are three states in Australia which also regulate both

cadastral and non-cadastral surveys.  Having said this, I  think

we  need  not be apologetic that we are progressive.  As Members

have  quite rightly captured the spirit here, the fact is  that,

in  Singapore, we are land scarce and high density, and we  have

little   room  for  error  in  the  positioning  of   buildings,

structures in our estates and infrastructural developments.   As

has  been  said,  the  cost of remedying  such  defects  can  be

enormous.   I  think  what we are doing is  justified,  more  so

because of the increasing overlapping between cadastral work and

non-cadastral work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the old days, we could have people say, "I just do

non-cadastral work."  But with the advent of modern  technology,

eg,  the  Global  Positioning System (GPS), the  use  of  modern

equipment, the overlap is becoming increasingly large.  There is

indeed  a need for those who do non-cadastral work to also  know

about cadastral work and what it entails.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this point addresses Mr Heng's question. He has asked

whether we are going to make further amendments to the  Act.   I

do  not think we want to have a separate register for people who

say  that they are doing simple works.   What I can ask the Land

Surveyors  Board  to  consider is to see,  without  jeopardising

public  interest and safety, for these very simple  minor  works

which  do  not  require certification by a registered  surveyor,

maybe  levelling of drains and so forth, whether or not we could

provide an exemption from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2108</b></font><br><br>

the Land Surveyors Act for these simple works.  But I think this

is something that I cannot give an assurance now.  It is an idea

that  Mr  Heng has suggested which the Land Surveyors Board  can

study,  because  under the Act, the Minister,  if  he  deems  it

suitable,  can  make an exemption.  But the important  point  is

that public safety must not be jeopardised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have addressed all the points.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, will the cost of surveys go up?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I have mentioned just now that

the  amendment will result in more surveyors entering the  field

and providing quality survey work.  So with more surveyors doing

the  work, cost will be kept competitive.  Nobody can assure you

that  cost will not go up or cost may go down.  I think it is  a

function of the marketplace.  What we can say is that it is  not

a monopoly or closed-shop situation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I do not think the Minister of

State has answered my question regarding those people doing very

simple, non-cadastral work, not as professional services, but as

staff  members;  for example, as the engineer in a  construction

company  doing  work  within its own construction  site.   These

people  are not providing professional services.  But as I  have

said, these people are doing some simple work, for example, some

measurements  here and there from certain reference  points,  as

part  of  their  job.  Under the present definition,  these  are

actually survey works.  I am trying to say that for this type of

work you do not need a registered surveyor to do it.  There  are

quite of lot of this type of very simple work.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Can I ask the Member whether

these  people  who are doing the survey work are offering  their

services?

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> These are the staff in the

construction company.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> So they are in-house.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2109</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> They are more or less in-house. I

want  to  know  whether these people would  be  required  to  be

registered.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> This is one situation which I

will  bring to the Land Surveyors Board's attention.   They  can

look into it and respond to the Member accordingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 6, after line 14: to insert -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(2) The Minister may, upon an application made before the

expiry of the transitional period by any person referred  to  in

subsection  (1),  extend  the transitional  period  of  4  years

referred to in that subsection for that person to practise as  a

land surveyor in respect of surveys other than cadastral surveys

for a further period not exceeding 2 years.".

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have indicated in my Second Reading speech, a

small  group  of surveying technicians currently  practising  on

their  own  have expressed the concern that their firms  may  be

phased  out after the Bill is passed.  The Bill already provides

a  four-year  grace  period for these surveying  technicians  to

either  join firms which are run by registered surveyors or,  if

they   wish  to  continue  practising  on  their  own,   upgrade

themselves  to become registered surveyors.  It will take  about

three  years for a surveying technician to obtain the  necessary

qualifications.   The  grace period  of  four  years  should  be

sufficient in most cases.  The amendment gives the Minister  the

power  to extend the grace period on a case-by-case basis for  a

further  two years.  This will provide more time for  those  who

have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2110</b></font><br><br>

actively  tried  to  upgrade  themselves  during  the  four-year

transitional period but, despite their hard work, failed  to  do

so within the four years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<div align="center"><b>INCOME TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Sir, I

beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 1999 seeks to give

legislative  effect to the income tax changes announced  in  the 1999

Budget  Statement.   It  also  incorporates  eight  other

amendments to the Income Tax Act.

<br><br><i>Tax changes announced in the 1999 Budget Statement</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall begin with the tax changes announced in the 1999

Budget  Statement.  There are a total of nine tax changes  which

require  amending the Act.  I will start with  the  tax  changes

affecting individual taxpayers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had announced a personal tax rebate of 10% for the Year

of  Assessment  1999 to help taxpayers tide over  the  temporary

difficult period.  Clause 25 amends the relevant section of  the

Act for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give further emphasis to the importance of lifelong

learning  and skills upgrading, I had also announced  that  with

effect  from Year of Assessment 1999, the maximum tax  deduction

allowable for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2111</b></font><br><br>

certain  education expenses for individuals will be raised  from

$2,000 to $2,500.  Clause 15 amends the relevant section of  the

Act for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are seven tax changes affecting the corporate sector.

I  had  announced  further refinements to the  bond  market  tax

incentives.  The refinements include extending the tax exemption

to  include  non-residents who have permanent establishments  in

Singapore, provided that such non-residents do not purchase  the

securities  using  funds  from  Singapore  operations,  and  the

introduction  of the 'Approved Bond Intermediary' (ABI)  scheme.

Under  the ABI scheme, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)

will  evaluate  a  financial institution's debt origination  and

trading capabilities in Singapore on an overall basis.   Once  a

financial  institution has been awarded  ABI  status,  all  debt

securities  lead managed by it would be treated  as  'qualifying

debt  securities'  and there would be no  need  for  an  ABI  to

satisfy,  on  a transaction-by-transaction basis,  the  test  of

'substantial  arrangement in Singapore'.  Clauses  5,19  and  21

amend the relevant sections of the Act for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also announced the introduction of an automated procedure

for the existing Tax Exemption Scheme for Syndicated Facilities.

This  is  to  give  arrangers upfront  certainty  on  whether  a

facility  qualifies  for tax exemption.  Clause  16  amends  the

relevant section of the Act for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage companies to locate and perform their

headquarters functions in Singapore to service network companies

worldwide,   I   announced   tax   exemption   for   Operational

Headquarters  which  perform  at least  one  substantive  global

function  in Singapore.  This change takes effect from  Year  of

Assessment 2000.   Clause 18 amends the relevant section of  the

Act for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage finance companies to build up their level of

general  provisions  further  and thus  strengthen  the  overall

soundness  of  the  financial system, I had announced  that  the

annual limits on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2112</b></font><br><br>

tax  deductions for general provision of finance companies  will

be temporarily suspended for two years.  Also, the overall limit

on  tax  deductions for general provisions of finance  companies

will  be  raised to 3% of qualifying assets. These  changes  are

effective  from  Year of Assessment 1999. Clause  9  amends  the

relevant section of the Act for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support Singapore's drive towards higher value-added

activities in the shipping sector, I announced the extension  of

the  existing Approved International Shipping Enterprise  Scheme

to   cover   income  derived  from  the  operation  of  Floating

Production  Storage  Offloading  vessel  and  Floating   Storage

Offloading vessel (or FPSO/FSO) in Singapore.  This change takes

effect  from  Year of Assessment 2000.  Clauses 3,  5(b)  and  6

amend the relevant sections of the Act for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had announced the extension of the One-Year Accelerated

Depreciation Allowance Scheme to the purchase of new  commercial

goods  vehicles  and  buses to replace an existing  old  diesel-driven vehicle which was registered before 1st January 1991, and

which  either  has at least one year of valid  COE  left  or  is

eligible for COE renewal.  Clause 13 amends the relevant section

of the Act for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage more financial institutions to take on the

role  of  Singapore Government Securities (SGS) Primary  Dealers

and  to  provide a significant incentive commensurate  with  the

obligations  undertaken by SGS Primary Dealers, I announced  tax

exemption  on  the  income derived by SGS Primary  Dealers  from

trading  in  SGS.   Clauses 19(b) and 19(d) amend  the  relevant

sections of the Act for this purpose.

<br><br><i>Tax changes not announced in the 1999 Budget Statement</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now deal with the other tax changes, which had not

been announced in the 1999 Budget Statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first tax change pertains to the Special Allowance for

Hotel Refurbishment announced last June as part of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2113</b></font><br><br>

package of off-Budget measures, to encourage hotel operators  to

refurbish  their premises during the lull period.  Clause  10(a)

introduces a new section 14M to grant approved hotel owners  tax

deduction of up to 150% of qualifying expenditure incurred on or

after 1st July 1998 on the refurbishment of their hotels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second tax change pertains to the payment of upfront

land  premium  introduced by JTC and HDB.  To  assist  companies

improve  their  competitiveness, JTC and HDB  have  allowed  its

lessees to opt for an upfront land premium for the entire tenure

of  the land.  Under existing tax rules, such premium would  not

be tax deductible nor would it qualify for tax depreciation.  To

provide  that  lessees would not be worse-off tax-wise  if  they

were  to opt to pay land premium upfront, a new section  14N  is

introduced  to  extend  tax deduction  to  the  amortisation  of

upfront  land premium paid by JTC and HDB lessees for industrial

land  leases  of less than 30 years.  Clause 10(b) introduces  a

new section 14N for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To increase companies' ability to adjust their equity base

and debt-equity ratio, and improve companies' return on capital,

the  Companies  Act has been amended to allow companies  to  buy

back  their  ordinary shares using their distributable  profits.

In  tandem with this, the Income Tax Act needs to be amended  to

provide for the tax treatment of share buybacks, such that share

buybacks  or  capital  reduction made out of  profits  would  be

treated  tax-wise as a dividend distribution.  The treatment  of

receipts from buybacks in the hands of shareholders will  depend

on  the mode of share buyback.  For example, in a normal "market

purchase" where it is not possible for the companies to identify

the shareholders from whom they are buying back the shares, what

the shareholders receive on the disposal of their shares will be

treated  as  sales proceeds, like any other disposal which  they

make on the stock exchange, and not a receipt of dividends.  The

shareholders will not be taxed on the sales proceeds

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2114</b></font><br><br>

unless  they are assessable to tax on profits from the  sale  of

shares.   Neither will they receive any tax credits.   The  same

tax   treatment   will  also  apply  to  selective   "off-market

purchases" as well as share redemption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4(b) and 4(c) amend the relevant sections of the

Act  to  provide for the tax treatment of payments made pursuant

to  buyback  of  shares, capital reductions  and  redemption  of

shares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, companies have also requested the Stock Exchange of

Singapore  allow for "market purchases" through special  trading

counters,  which  will allow listed companies  to  identify  the

shareholders from whom they are buying back the shares.  I  note

that transactions through special trading counters could provide

considerable room for tax arbitrages and abuses.  These  include

risk-free  arbitrages,  artificial  arrangements  with   low-tax

persons  to  transact  in  shares through  the  special  trading

counters  to maximise tax refunds, as well as the room available

to those trading in shares to tax plan or arbitrage arising from

their  ability  to  deduct the cost of  their  shares  from  the

receipts  for shares sold through the special trading  counters.

This  concern of tax abuse has in fact also been highlighted  in

the  media.  To prevent revenue leakage through such abuses, the

Ministry  of  Finance  and  IRAS will  be  studying  the  issues

thoroughly   before  share  buybacks  through  Special   Trading

Counters may be allowed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next tax change pertains to the existing tax incentive

for SIMEX members.  At present, SIMEX members who trade with non-residents  are granted a concessionary tax rate of 10%  on  such

trading income.  Clause 17 amends the Act to make clear that the

tax  concession is also applicable to transactions made by SIMEX

members  with Approved Fund Managers acting on behalf  of  their

non-resident clients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next tax change deals with the tax treatment of cars.

In  tandem  with  the  Land  Transport Authority's  vehicle  tax

rationalisation exercise in March 1998,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2115</b></font><br><br>

changes  were  made to the tax treatment pertaining  to  company

cars,   rental  cars  and  motor  cars  used  for  instructional

purposes.  Clauses 4(a), 7(c), 11(a), 11(b), 12 and 14 amend the

relevant sections of the Act for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 10% corporate tax rebate for the Year of Assessment 1999

was  announced as part of the cost-cutting package  in  November

last year.  Clause 24 amends the relevant section of the Act for

this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next tax change pertains to the 10% cut in employers'

CPF  contribution with effect from 1st January 1999,  which  was

announced  as  part  of the cost-cutting measures  announced  in

November  1998.   Arising  from the  cut  in  CPF  contribution,

clauses  7(a) and 7(b) amend the Act accordingly to  reduce  the

maximum deduction allowable for employer's contribution to  CPF,

or any designated pension or provident fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last change pertains to Non-Tax Assessment. Currently,

the Comptroller of Income Tax issues a notice of assessment only

to  taxpayers who have been assessed positively to tax.  In  the

case  where an assessment does not give rise to any tax payable,

the Comptroller would only issue a letter (rather than a notice)

of  non-tax  computation to the taxpayer.  The taxpayer  is  not

required  to  object  within 30 days to the  letter  of  non-tax

assessment  if  he disagrees with the computation.   The  6-year

time  limit  within which the Comptroller can make an assessment

or  an additional assessment is also not applicable in the  case

of a non-tax assessment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give greater finality to both the Comptroller and the

taxpayers for non-tax assessment cases, clauses 22 and 23  amend

the  Act to provide for the Comptroller to issue a notice  to  a

taxpayer even if there is no tax payable by the taxpayer and for

the 6-year time limit to also apply to non-tax assessment cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2116</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

buyback is  an  off-market  purchase  made in accordance with an

equal access scheme authorised in advance by the company at a general

meeting of the company.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment is to delete mention of the tax

treatment  for share buybacks to special trading counters  until

possible  tax  abuses involved with the share  buybacks  through

special trading counters have been thoroughly considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer the Member to my reply, at our last sitting, to the

question  from Mr Harun Ghani. I then informed this  House  that

senior  officials  from Singapore and Malaysia  have  had  three

rounds  of  discussions this year on the  package  of  bilateral

issues.   I had also informed the House that they would probably

have  a  fourth round of talks later this month in Kuala Lumpur.

This  remains the situation.  We are waiting for the  Malaysians

to revert with specific dates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the discussions to-date, both sides stated their

positions  on the various issues included in the package.   More

work  needs  to be done to bring our positions closer  together.

As  I had informed at our last sitting, my Malaysian counterpart

and  I agreed during his visit to Singapore last month that  our

officials should try to narrow the gaps on the issues so  as  to

arrive  at  a win-win package deal. This remains our expectation

and our approach.
