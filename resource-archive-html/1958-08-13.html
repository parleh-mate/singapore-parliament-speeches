<div align="center"><b>MESSAGES FROM THE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNOR</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Assents to Bills passed)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have received two messages from His

Excellency the Governor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first message dated the 23rd July, 1958, informs

me  that, in accordance with the provisions of Section 62 (2) of the Singapore Colony Orders in Council, 1955

and   1956,  His  Excellency  had  reserved  for   the

signification  of Her Majesty's pleasure  the  Malayan

Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (Amendment) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second message also dated the 23rd July, 1958,

states  that,  in  accordance with the  provisions  of

Section  62  (2)  of the Singapore  Colony  Orders  in

Council,  1955 and 1956, His Excellency had  that  day

assented to the following

Bills:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Merchant Shipping (Amendment) Bill;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Quarantine and Prevention of Disease (Amendment) Bill;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Light Dues (Amendment) Bill;

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENT,</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ROBINSON ROAD, AND CENTRAL POLICE STATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(SPECIAL BRANCH) (Access to public during "Police Weeks")</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Chief Secretary-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) if he is aware that the Criminal Investigation

Department at Robinson Road and the  top  floor

of  the Central Police Station occupied be  the

Special  Branch  were not open to  the  general

public during the recent "Police Week", and  to

state the reasons therefor; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) whether he will arrange for those two Branches

of  the  Police Force to be open to the public,

along  with Divisional Police Stations,  during

future "Police Weeks".



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. B. David:</b> Yes, Sir. The primary object of

"Police  Week" was to encourage the general public  to

familiarise  themselves with  those  sections  of  the

Police  Force which are concerned with direct  service

to  the public when they wish to make a report  for  a

request for assistance. The C.I.D. and Special  Branch

do not come in this category.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the second part of the question is in

the negative.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, by barring the

public  from  visiting  the  C.I.D. and  the  Special

Branch,  would  this not give rise to  more  suspicion

that the allegations of torture are true?



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> I do not agree with the hon. Member's

insinuations.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It would be a matter of opinion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>ACID BOMB THROWING</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Chief Secretary if he

is  aware  of  the  increasing use of  acid  bombs  by

gangsters  in  gang clashes in which innocent  persons

have  been  blinded or injured; and what measures  the

Government  has taken or proposes to take against  the

use or possession of acid bombs.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Chief Secretary to state the

number  of  cases  of acid throwing which  have  taken

place   since  1st  January,  1958,  the   number   of

convictions  in such cases; and whether this  form  of

crime is on the increase.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> With your permission, Sir, I will answer

questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crime of using acid to cause hurt is on the

increase.  Between 1st January and  10th  August  this

year,  there  were  15 known instances  of  such  use.

During  the same period, three persons were  convicted



of  offences under the Corrosive Substances Ordinance,

1955.  Under this Ordinance, the carrying of acid  for

the  purpose of causing hurt is subject to  a  maximum

penalty of ten years imprisonment and using it for the

same  purpose  a  maximum penalty of imprisonment  for

life  and  whipping.  Acid is  very  widely  used  for

legitimate  commercial purposes and  it  is  extremely

difficult   therefore  to  prevent  small   quantities

falling  into  the  wrong  hands.  The  Government  is

considering,   however,  whether  any  practical   and

effective   measures  are  possible  to  control   its

possession  and  storage.  The  Government   is   also

considering  the imposition of the death  penalty  for

the use of acid to cause hurt.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>DIVORCE SUIT NO. 32 OF 1957</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Attorney-General, with

reference to his showing cause in Divorce Suit No.  32

of  1957,  why  the  decree  nisi  pronounced  by  the

Honourable  Mr Justice Tan Ah Tah on the  22nd  July,

1957,  should  not  be  made absolute,  to  state  the

grounds  upon  which he acted; and  whether  full  and

proper   investigations   were   duly   conducted   in

Singapore,  Port  Dickson and Kuala  Lumpur  with  the

assistance of experienced officers of the Police Force

prior to and after showing cause.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. P. Shanks:</b> I intervened in this Divorce Suit,

Sir,  because,  as  a  result  of  information  I  had

received  and enquiries I made, I believed the  decree

nisi for dissolution of the marriage had been obtained

by  reason of material facts not being brought  before

the   Court.  Both  before  and  after  I  intervened,

investigations  were made in Singapore,  Port  Dickson

and  Kuala  Lumpur with the assistance of  the  Police

Force  and  I  have  no reason to suppose  that  those

enquiries were not both full and proper.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>



Since the decree was made absolute, that is since  the

adjudication  on  my  intervention,  I  have  made  no

further investigation into the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Attorney-General aware that by his intervention in this Suit,

he   has  caused  damage  to  the  reputation  of  the

petitioner?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is a matter of opinion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>INCOME TAX ORDINANCE (CAP. 166)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Changes)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Financial Secretary whether

the  Malayan  Board of Income Tax has recommended  any

changes  to be made in the Income Tax Ordinance  (Cap.

166);  and when an amending Bill will be presented  to



this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> The Malayan Board of Income Tax has

made certain recommendations for the amendment of  the

Income Tax Ordinance. These recommendations have  been

incorporated  in a draft Bill which  it  is  hoped  to

introduce at the September sitting of the Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>PREMISES BUILT AFTER</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SEPTEMBER 1947</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(To come under Control of Rent Ordinance)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government,  Lands and Housing if the Government  will

consider introducing amending legislation with a  view

to  bringing  premises  built after  September,  1947,

under  the provisions of the Control of Rent Ordinance

(Cap. 242).



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> The answer is no, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Is the Minister aware that

landlords  are taking advantage by charging  fantastic

rentals and issuing notices to quit because no control

of rents is being enforced?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would suggest

to the Member for Queenstown two considerations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the houses which are now subject to the

provisions  of  the  Control of Rent  Ordinance  were

almost  all  erected prewar at cheaper cost  and  the

controlled  rentals can be said to  represent  a  not

unreasonable return on capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, premises built or completed after 7th

September,  1947  were built in the expectation  that

there   would  be  no  control  of  rents   and   the

relationship between landlords and their tenants  was

one  freely established on such understanding.  There

is  no  special reason or emergency (such as  existed

when   rent   control  was  introduced   for   prewar

properties) to justify control of properties  erected

after  September,  1947. Such  control  would  indeed

result  in  stifling private enterprise  in  building

more  houses  and would merely aggravate the  housing

situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Is the Minister aware that an

amount  of  $500 increase in rentals is  demanded  by

such landlords to exploit their tenants?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>OFFICES AND STAFF FOR NEW</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>DISTRICT COUNCILS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Request for Statement)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government, Lands and Housing whether he will make  a

statement  on the office buildings being  constructed

and  the staff so far made available for the purposes

of  operating the new District Councils; and  whether

he  is  satisfied that the new regional  offices  are

working satisfactorily.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, temporary

District  Council Offices have already  been  erected

for  Serangoon and Katong District Councils  and  are

open  for  inspection. Each building  has  a  meeting

room,   secretariat  and  departmental  offices   for

engineering  and  building  staff,  the  health   and

cleansing staff and the assessment and revenue staff.

For  the Jurong/Bukit Panjang District Council, there



is  already  a permanent office which later  will  be

extended.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staffing needs as well as other problems

arising  from the establishment of District  Councils

were  studied  by  a  working party,  which,  in  its

reports   recommended  additions   to   the   present

available  Rural Board staff. The report was  adopted

by  Government  and the financial provision  for  the

additional  staff  was approved by this  Assembly  in

April this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the District Councils have been in operation

for  a few months, it will be possible to review  the

position to ascertain if all the provisions made  are

in  fact  adequate.  From  the  measures  taken,  the

District Councils should work satisfactorily.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Minister aware

that the horse now seems to be ready before the cart?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>ARREARS OF RATES AND</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ASSESSMENTS OF PROPERTIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government,  Lands  and Housing,  with  reference  to

paragraphs  12  to 17 of the Final  Report  from  the

Public Accounts Committee ( Sessional Paper No.  L.A.

14 of 1957), if he will state -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the arrears of rates as at (i) 31st December,

1957; and (ii) 30th June, 1958; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) how many properties have been assessed or re-assessed during the period January to June,

1958;  and  how many properties remain  to  be

assessed or re-assessed.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the arrears of

rates  as at 31st January, 1957 including the arrears

carried   over  from  the  past  year   amounted   to

$1,697,468.28.  Arrears for 1957 collected  from  1st

January  to  30th June, 1958 amounted to  $772,087.12

and  to  the  end of July $889,339.58.  This  sum  is

nearly equal to the sum of $940,006.67 which was  the

amount  of  arrears collected for the whole  of  last

year.   This   improvement  was  made   possible   by

reorganisation  of  work and the recruitment  towards

the  end  of  last year of five of the  required  new

seven bailiffs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding (b), 1,771 properties were assessed or re-assessed during the period January to June 1958, at an

annual  value  of  just over $1 million,  yielding  an

additional revenue of just over $200,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards remaining properties yet to be assessed,

it  is  estimated that there are about 2,000 permanent

buildings yet to be assessed of which about 1,500  are

new  houses  in such housing estates as Opera  Estate,

Glasgow   Road,  Jalan  Kayu,  Spring   Hill   Estate,

Sembawang  Road,  13½ m.s. Sembawang  Road,  Sembawang

Hill  Estate,  Thomson Ridge, Bukit Timah  Estate  and

Hong-Kong Park.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is on these properties that the Rates Officers,

including   three  newly  recruited  assistant   rates

officers,  are  now concentrating their efforts.  This

will  leave  resettlement areas throughout  the  Rural

Board  area and many attap houses situated  well  away

from the main roads yet to be assessed. Assessment and

reassessment on these localities will follow after the

large estates have been completed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>PANDAN FOREST RESERVE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Lim Koon Teck</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government, Lands and Housing what portion of the  832

acres  withdrawn  from the Pandan Forest  Reserve  has

been  set aside for allocation to persons whose  prawn

ponds  in areas required for development have been  or

will be acquired by Government.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> The answer to the Member's

question  is that no portion of the area excised  from

the  Pandan Forest Reserve has been set aside for such

allocation,  as the manner of allocation has  not  yet

been   decided.  Due  consideration  will  be   given,

however,  to  requests  or applications  from  persons

whose   prawn   ponds  are  affected   by   Government

acquisitions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, will the Hon. the Minister

give  an assurance that their claims would have  prior

consideration?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at this

juncture, I cannot give such an undertaking.

<div align="center"><b>CITY COUNCIL MASS HEALTH</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>MOVEMENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Instructions to principals and staff of schools)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> asked the Minister for Education

whether  he  gave instructions to the  principals  and

staff of schools in connection with the City Council's

mass  health  movement; and whether  he  will  make  a

statement in connection with those instructions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on 4th July,

1958,  the Mayor wrote direct to the school principals



asking from one to twenty representatives to attend  a

meeting  at  the Victoria Memorial Hall on  7th  July,

1958. He did this before any permission was granted to

him  by  me.  As the anti-spitting campaign  has  been

conducted  in all schools for some years  now,  it  is

nothing  new  and  in  view of the improper  procedure

adopted  by  the  Mayor, I gave  instructions  to  the

principals   not  to  send  representatives   to   the

scheduled  meeting. Any campaign in the school  should

be conducted by my Ministry through the principals who

are individually responsible for the administration of

their own schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Does it follow that the Minister is

not in principle against the mass health movement, but

that  he  has  taken offence because he has  not  been

first consulted before the schools were approached?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> In principle, I am not against the

mass  health  movement nor against  the  anti-spitting

campaign.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> In that case, does he see any

objection  to students writing essays in a competition

to show why spitting is a bad and pernicious habit?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> It does not form part of the

question.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> May I put it more bluntly to the

not very alert Minister? Does he find any objection to

school children writing essays on spitting, if  he  in

fact opposes spitting?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister has answered that it does not form part of the question. It is another question.

<div align="center"><b>(Number of doctors and daily average number of patients)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for Health to

state  the  number  of doctors attached  to  the  Out-Patient  Department of the General  Hospital  and  the

daily  average  number  of patients  who  attend  that

Department.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. J. Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are 16

doctors attached to the Out-Patient Department of  the

General  Hospital  out of which ten are  on  full-time

duty  and  the  remaining six work  part-time  in  the

afternoons for a period of two hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daily average number of patients who attend the

Out-Patient Department is 2,300. Of this figure, 1,600

are  seen  by the Medical Officers of that Department.

The remaining 700 attend for repeat treatment such  as



injections, dressings, etc.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Minister

tell  us the number of hours a full-time doctor  works

Minister consider that the ten full-time and six part-time  doctors are able to cope with 2,300 patients  in

one day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> As I have already said, 1,600 patients

attend  in  the morning and 700 in the afternoon.  For

the  16  doctors to deal with this vast number  is,  I

agree, a very heavy task but even if staff can be made

available,  which is hardly possible  at  the  present

time,   there   is   at  the  moment  not   sufficient

accommodation available for consultation purposes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Can the Minister then tell us what

action he proposes to take or has taken to rectify the

position?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, despite all our efforts

and   despite   the  introduction  of  a   system   of

appointments  of  times, patients insist  on  arriving

early  in  the morning and there is in consequence  an

unnatural  and  severe overcrowding.  We  are  however

developing  more  and  more out-patient  services  and

deviating  those who seek the services of the  General

Hospital to new out-patient departments. To this  end,

Government  has  so  far  increased  the   number   of

outpatient departments from six in 1954 to  15  during

its  term of office to date and are constructing three

new  out-patient  clinics, one at Pegu  Road,  one  at

Queenstown and another at Bukit Panjang, which  should

be  ready  for use by the end of this year.  In  1959,

three more out-patient departments will be constructed

at  Buona Vista, Yio Chu Kang Road at the junction  of

Jalan Kayu, and the third at Nee Soon.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for

Communications and Works whether the leading  airlines

using the Paya Lebar Airport require funds to be spent

on  a  new airport terminal to be constructed to  deal

expeditiously with the increasing number of passengers

and  freight carried by air; and whether he will  give

an  undertaking that work on the construction  of  the

proposed  new terminal will be started with the  least

possible delay.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Sir, planning for the improvement

or  extension  of  the  terminal  facilities  for  the

Singapore  Airport has been in progress for  the  past

two  years.  In  the course of this, the  Director  of

Civil Aviation has been in close consultation with the

airline  operators and is fully aware of  their  needs

and  requirements  in  the matter  of  passengers  and

baggage  handling facilities. To the extent  that  the

provision   of   such  facilities  will   entail   the

expenditure of public funds, the answer to  the  first

part of the question is yes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the second part of the question, I can

assure the hon. Member that within the financial means

of  Government, it has always been and  still  is  our

intention  that terminal facilities will  be  provided

with the least possible delay.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the Minister state

when the work will start on this building and how long

it will take to complete it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> At a later stage this morning, Sir, I

will  be making a statement on the development of  the

Airport. To avoid repetition, I suggest that the  hon.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE AIRPORT HOTEL LTD.</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Monthly rent)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  and  Works what is  the  monthly  rent

payable  by the Singapore Airport Hotel Ltd, for  the

use  of  the  Paya Lebar Airport restaurant  premises;

whether there are any arrears of rent payable  by  the

tenants and what is the amount.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The concession under which the Singapore

Hotel  Ltd, operated ended on 30th April  this  year.

Their  rent during the period of their concession  was



$2,833 per month until July 1957 and thereafter $2,874

per month. When the concession terminated, the arrears

of rent totalled $51,834.16.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Will the Minister state how these arrears

were  allowed  to  accumulate  and  whether  they  are

recoverable in full?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> With regard to their recoverability, the

company  has gone into voluntary liquidation and  what

this will produce towards arrears is not yet clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to how they were allowed to accumulate,

the hon. Member will appreciate that the Airport Hotel

is  different in its nature from the ordinary  run  of

hotels.  It  is not for guests coming to stay  at  the

place in the normal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



way;  the Airport Hotel is catering for the passengers

who  are  passing through. Consequently, it is closely

tied  up  with  the airline operators  and  it  cannot

therefore  be allowed to close even for a single  day.

In  these circumstances, and bearing in mind that  the



concessionaire had been successfully operating at  the

Kallang  Airport since 1937, it was thought  desirable

to  give every opportunity of meeting liabilities  and

by  so  doing  to  avoid what might have  been  urgent

difficulties in finding a replacement.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Does the Minister not feel that that reply

is  thoroughly  unsatisfactory? Will he state  whether

the  Singapore  taxpayer has to pay  for  Government's

incompetence  in  not collecting arrears  or  has  the

Minister other remedies?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I cannot ask a question in reply to the

question.  I  am not quite sure what the  hon.  Member

means  by  the  Government paying. The Government  has

suffered  a  loss  but there is  no  charge  that  the

Government  has  to meet. The bill has  not  yet  been

collected  and  I  cannot  say  how  far  it  will  be

collected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, is the Minister aware that

this  concessionaire, apart from the legal  person  in

the  Singapore  Airport Hotel Ltd. - the  person  behind

it - has since 1937 accumulated a fairly vast fortune as

a  result  of  work in the old Airport  Hotel  at  the

Kallang Airport? Should he not take steps to see  that

fortunes are not salted away while revenue is owing to

the Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I am aware of the other interests of the

proprietors  of  the  Singapore Airport  Hotel  but  I

cannot  answer  for  what  the  law  provides  on  the

question  of recovering the arrears. That  is  in  the

hands  of  the liquidator and is being dealt with  for

the  Government by the Treasury. I have no doubt  that

whatever can and should be collected will be collected

but  it  is  not for me at this stage to describe  the

procedure that will have to be followed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the Minister state

whether it was the fault of the Treasury that money was

not  collected  month  by month or  the  fault  of  his

Ministry?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I had better perhaps put the hon. Member

in  the  picture  as to the general  structure  of  the

control and management of such concessions. The day-to-day control and management are exercised by the Airport

manager who until recently had an assistant manager  to

help him. The contracts such as the concessions for the

Singapore  Hotel  are negotiated and completed  by  the

Commissioner of Lands who is the Government's agent for

this matter. The accounts are subject to audit scrutiny

and the Treasury has, of course, an overall interest in

the financial aspects of these contracts. The system is

satisfactory,  I  think, in so far  as  it  distributes

responsibility  and  ensures that  proper  scrutiny  is

made. It is perhaps less satisfactory from the point of

view  of  commercial  operation as  compared  with  the

ordinary run of Government business.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, will the Minister tell us

whether  any Minister in the Government was  approached

by  the proprietor of the Singapore Airport Hotel  Ltd.

with a view to writing off the arrears of rent?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Certainly nobody has approached me with

such  a  request  and  I  should  imagine  that  it  is

inconceivable that anybody would be approached with

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Does the Minister accept full responsibility

for this deplorable state of affairs?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Certainly I do, Sir, I accept full

responsibility  for  everything that  falls  within  my

Ministry and for the actions of all officers within  my

Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the

termination  of this concession, can the Minister  tell

us  how  the  present premises are let  out  since  the

Singapore Airport Hotel Ltd. has gone into liquidation?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> A new concession has been let out which

separates  the previous concession into two parts:  the

restaurant  and bar form one part and what I  think  we

can  call  the  coffee room on the ground  floor  is  a

separate     concession     now.     Up-to-date     the

concessionaires are both paying their rent punctually.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, why is it then

that  a  public  tender is not called  for  instead  of

giving it out on a concessional contract?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It seems to be a different question but

if the Minister wishes to answer, he may do so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Sir, it is planned that a one-way system

for  traffic  should be introduced  along  Dunearn  and

Bukit  Timah Roads. This cannot, however, be done until

adequate  bridges  are  built across  the  Bukit  Timah

Canal.  The planning and construction of these  bridges

is  intimately  related to a drainage  scheme  for  the

whole  area.  The  execution  of  the  drainage  scheme

depends on the availability of very considerable  funds

and  I  am afraid that there is little likelihood  that

the  drainage  scheme  will go  forward  in  the  near

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the Director of Tourism has

completed  a  survey  of  the  Colony's  present  tourist

facilities  and has formulated a plan for the  continuing

development of tourism over an extended period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate markets have been selected as initial

targets  for overseas advertising and a tourist promotion

campaign  is  scheduled  to  commence  in  September   in

Australia, New Zealand and the United States.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four descriptive folders will be printed for overseas

distribution, primarily for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>



backing  up  direct inquiries resulting  from  the  above

advertising,  and  for  distribution  to  travel  agents,

airlines and shipping companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of posters is being designed for distribution

to travel organisations for display purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comprehensive mailing list is being prepared to cover

four   thousand  travel  agents,  shipping  and   airline

companies, travel editors, and others actively engaged in

the  tourist industry overseas. A monthly News Letter has

been   started  and  copies  of  all  issues  and   other

productions will be sent to these outlets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the Director's report is available to all

interested  parties and this report outlines in  complete

detail the plan evolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the details of the planned expenditure of $300,000

voted   for  tourist  promotion  in  1958  would  involve

reference  to  detailed figures, I propose  to  circulate

this   information  in  the  Official   Report.   Broadly

speaking, however, approximately two-thirds of the amount

is to be spent on direct advertising.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Commerce and

Industry  if  he  will make a statement  regarding  the

setting up of a central wholesale fish market.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, various sites have been

considered  by the Government for the proposed  Central

Wholesale Fish Market. A site in the delta between  the

Rochore  and  Kallang Rivers was first  considered  but

when  the Merdeka Bridge project was under way  it  was

found  that the bridge had to be built further  seaward

and the head-room under the bridge in this location was

not  sufficient to permit access to the  delta  by  the

larger  fishing vessels. A second site at the  southern

end  of  Merdeka Bridge was then considered but it  was

found  to  be  too costly to build the  wholesale  fish

market here. A third site, at the end of the old runway

at  Kallang,  also  considered  to  be  suitable,  has,

however, been earmarked for the development of a public

park.  Finally, it has been proposed that  the  Central

Wholesale  Fish Market should be temporarily  sited  at

the  Telok  Ayer Basin. This proposal has not  received

any  support  from  the Singapore Port  Commission  and

would  involve the finding of alternative accommodation

for  the  M.R.N.V.R. which would  in  itself  be  very

costly. Until, therefore, a suitable permanent site can

be  found for the central wholesale fish market,  there

is very little hope of this project materialising.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Minister

for the delay in establishing this market?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Finance is now a question but this

matter has been pending for the last four or five years

and finance was not a question until recently.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Since finance is now the question

and  in  view  of  Government's policy to  curtail  all

expenditure,  will  the  Government  encourage  private

enterprise to set up this central market?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the question of private

enterprise  entering  into this is  one  that  requires

consideration and offhand I cannot answer that question

but  the question of finance coming into it now may not

continue in the future: we hope finances might improve.

<br><br>10.36 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Government has

been very much concerned with the fact that the present

structure of our economy based largely on our  entrepot

trading  activities would not seem to have the capacity

to  give employment to our increasing population in the

years  ahead.  Government has therefore emphasised  all

along   the   need  to  create  and  develop  secondary

industries  which could not only provide employment  to

at  least a part of our increasing population but  also

be  instrumental  in cutting down to  some  extent  our

imports  for home consumption purposes. Government  has

therefore  recognised the necessary role that  capital,

both   local   and  outside,  can  play  in   achieving

industrial development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a view therefore to encouraging outside capital

for  industrial  development  certain  assurances  were

given by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



me  to  outside capital in a statement I made  to  this

House  on  the 7th November, 1956. Financial assistance

is  being given to local capital through the Industrial

Promotion  Board and legislation to provide for  income

tax   exemptions   to  new  or  additional   industries

considered  to be of economic benefit to  Singapore  is

now  in  the course of preparation as an inducement  to

both local and outside capital. Although there has been

some   response   from  outside  and   local   capital,

Government notes with regret that its efforts  to  meet

the  unemployment threat by encouragement of investment

in  industries  are being frustrated  by  irresponsible

politicians who do not care what harm they  do  to  the

people  of  Singapore. Government  therefore  considers

that the time has now come for more positive action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now approximately two years, Sir, since I gave

an  indication  that some measure of  protection  might

have to be considered for our industries, but only as a

last resort. After careful consideration Government has

come to the conclusion that the principle of protection

must  be  recognised for our industries and  Government

will  therefore  commence taking immediately  all  such

steps   as  are  necessary  for  this  policy   to   be

implemented. Government recognises that entrepot  trade

will  always  continue to play  a  major  part  in  our

economy  and is therefore determined that the operation

of  protection should be carried out with  the  minimum

possible  damage  to, or dislocation of,  the  entrepot

trade. I wish to make it very clear therefore that  the

operation  of  protection is envisaged  on  a  strictly

selective  basis:  that  is,  only  where  the  benefit

accruing  to  Singapore through the industry  concerned

outweighs  any  possible harm to  the  entrepot  trade.

Under no circumstances will the operation of protection



be  allowed  to interfere in any way with the  entrepot

trade in produce, processed produce and textiles or raw

materials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government will also have to be satisfied that any

protection  granted  will not be abused  and  that  the

undertaking  concerned is operating or is  expected  to

operate in an efficient manner and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>



that  protection  would  not result  in  the  continued

marketing  of  goods of inferior quality  at  excessive

prices  by comparison with the standards and prices  of

similar  imported goods. The incidence  and  degree  of

protection  will have to be related to the capacity  of

the  local  industry  to meet the requirements  of  the

local market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside manufacturers wishing to manufacture their

products  here will, as a general rule, be required  to

come  to  an  arrangement with a local manufacturer  or

intending  local  manufacturer, if  any,  of  the  same

product,  or  failing  which with interested  Singapore

citizens.  Such  arrangement  should  either  be  on  a

partnership  basis with at least 49  per  cent  of  the

shares being held by the local interest or on the basis

of  the  local interest manufacturing under licence  of

the  outside  manufacturer. If after a reasonable  time

there  is lack of response from local interests  or  if

such arrangements cannot be made for reasons proved  to

the  satisfaction  of  the Minister  for  Commerce  and

Industry,  the  outside  manufacturer  will  be   given

permission to set up his own undertaking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside manufacturers are invited to apply to the

Ministry  of  Commerce and Industry if they  desire  to

manufacture  their  products  in  Singapore   and   the

Ministry  will give them every assistance to  make  the

necessary  local contacts and to carry out negotiations

with a view Lo entering into the arrangements mentioned

above.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This restriction on outside manufacturers is necessary

in  order  to encourage and safeguard local  industrial

investment.  However, a certain amount  of  flexibility

will  be  employed in the application of  this  general

policy according to the circumstances of each case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that Government may have the necessary

powers, I am introducing a Bill this morning making  it

necessary for manufacturers to obtain a licence from me

before they can engage in any manufacture in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further measures to implement vigorously Government's

policy to encourage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



industrial development are under examination.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the Minister state

what  form  of  protection is intended?  Has  he  under

contemplation the introduction of quotas on imports  to

protect local manufacturers.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I contemplate, Sir, using both

forms of protection wherever either is suitable.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could the Minister be a

little more explicit as to what he means by both forms?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> There are two forms of protection:

one is by quantitative restrictions and the other is by

tariffs.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE'S INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Expansion)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Communications and Works)</b></div>



<br><br>10.41 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to a

question  by the Member for Tanglin (Mr John  Ede)  at

the last sitting of this Assembly, I promised to make a

statement   on   the  expansion  at  our  international

Airport.   I  must  start  by  giving  you,   Sir,   an

explanation in connection with certain reports on  this

subject  which have been published in the  local  press

since I gave that promise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having promised to make a statement in the Assembly, I

felt myself bound to make it to the Assembly and not to

enquiring reporters beforehand. Consequently, I refused

all  requests  by  reporters for a preview  of  what  I

proposed  to  say,  telling  them  to  wait  until   my

statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, some reports anticipating my statement

did  in fact appear in the press. There is no objection

to that. Newspapers have a right, and indeed a duty, to

collect  information, to disseminate it and to  comment

on and even to guess about information.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, some reports went beyond this. One

newspaper,  in particular, tried to present  itself  to

the  public as having had prior access through official

sources  to the information I am this morning going  to

give  the House. It said that it had 'learned that  the

Council of Ministers took a decision on Tuesday' to  go

ahead with a new Terminal building. In the same report,

this  newspaper attributed to 'a Civil Aviation source'

alleged  information about Council discussions  on  the

matter and it also made a reference to the Director  of

Civil Aviation in the same report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I had given secret information about Council

affairs  to  a newspaper, or if any senior officer  had

done  so, the strictest disciplinary action would  have

been  deserved. I have, however, made the most  careful

investigation and I do not believe that this  newspaper

had  any  access  to such secret information,  nor  any

information at all about the matters in my statement. I

believe  that  its  report  was  no  more  than   what

reporters call 'intelligent guesswork' plus a rehash of

information already available to the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not concerned, Sir, to express an opinion of the

journalistic morality of a newspaper proceeding in this

way.  Hon. Members can judge that for themselves. I  do

wish  to  make  it  absolutely clear that  I  have  not

derogated  from  the proper dignity of  this  House  by

giving to the Press prior access to information which I

had  promised  to give to the House. Such action  could

only  be  justified in circumstances of grave  urgency,

such as have not arisen in this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, successive governments, both before and since

the  outbreak  of  that international insanity  usually

called World War II, have recognised the importance  of

maintaining  Singapore as a centre for air travel.  The

result,  based on wise and forethoughtful planning  and

fruitful  consultation with the airline  operators,  is

that  today  Singapore has a first-rate  basic  Airport

with  heavy  and increasing traffic. We  have  a  good,

though  not  a  final, picture of the probable  traffic

developments over the next few years. Planning is quite

up-to-date. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>



know the suitable next steps to take. We propose to  go

ahead according to plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had intended to let tenders for the next stage of

development  during  May of this  year.  Owing  to  the

recession,  I decided that letting should  be  deferred

for  a  short  period. I did not like  doing  that;  it

imposes   a  hardship  on  the  contractors  who   have

tendered.  It  was  necessary  to  give  time   for   a

re-examination  of  certain technical and  accommodation

aspects. Following re-examination, we are going to defer

for  a  while  one  section of the  building  proposals

costing  approximately $375,000. Apart  from  that,  we

have found nothing that ought to be varied or deferred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, of course, lost two months of development

rime,  which  I regret. When one is dealing  with  very

closely-knit plans, it is not safe to excise  one  part

without  most  careful examination of the  whole.  Such

examination  takes time, which has reduced our  margin,

but  that must be accepted as one of the results of the

recession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposals now to go forward are the erection of a

building  from which the operational control  functions

of  the  Airport will be exercised, together  with  the

installation  of the necessary equipment. Hon, members

had  better understand the context in which this  takes

place. Operational controls cover two fields. The first

is  the  Flight  Information Region, an area  of  about

140,000   square  miles,  centred  on  Singapore.   All

aircraft  movements within this region, both Civil  and

Military,  are rigorously controlled so as to  maintain

safe   aircraft  route-patterns  and  to   avoid   the

generation of aerial hazards. The second field  is  the

Singapore  Terminal  Area of  about  150  miles  radial

distance from Singapore, in which even more precise and

positive  disciplines  have  to  be  imposed   on   the

movements  of aircraft. The average number of movements

in  the  Area is approximately 10,000 a month. In  peak

periods it may rise as high as 50 movements per hour.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing system of control has worked well, but

will   not  much  longer  be  adequate  to  cover   the

increasing  frequency and rapidity of movements.  Civil

and  military  planes using our airspace and  the  area

around continually progress in numbers and speeds. Hon.

members will appreciate that if a plane flying south at



500 miles per hour confronts another plane flying north

at  the  same speed, they approach each other at  1,000

miles  an  hour.  This leaves no margin  for  emergency

decisions and introduces an element of risk that cannot

be  accepted. The risk can only be avoided by having  a

first-rate system of controls operating through  first-rate equipment. This we mean to have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going to provide a new Control Tower

approximately  120  feet  high,  plus  a   seven-storey

building giving rather more than 40,000 square feet  of

floor  space. Very roughly, 50 per cent of  this  space

will   be   used   for  installation  of,   operational

equipment;  15 per cent will be used for  the  officers

dealing with the equipment and its product; and 35  per

cent  will be rentable space for the Operations  Rooms

of the airlines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building will house the Area Joint Air Traffic

Control Centre, the Area Communications Centre, the Air

Information  Centre, a Military Air  Movement  Section,

and  the main Aviation-Meteorological Office in  South-East  Asia.  Its  equipment consists  of  a  completely

overhauled,   integrated  and  up-to-date   Air   Fixed

Telecommunications  Network, an Airport  exchange,  and

the  terminals of the operational aids installed at the

airport's periphery. These aids include a Visual  Omni-Range beacon, which gives a pilot the assurance that he

is  precisely on the course given him, and Surveillance

Radar,  which  tells the Airport if he  gets  off  this

course so that they can correct him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately and without allowance for unforeseeable

de1ays    or   circumstances   beyond   our    control,

construction  of this building will be  complete  about

the  third  quarter  of 1959, and installation  of  the

equipment  about four months later. The  whole  project

should be in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



operation  about  February, 1960.  As  near  as  I  can

forecast,  this  is  about the date  that  our  present

control  system  will  become  inadequate  for  traffic

needs, and the new system will be needed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of the building will be about. $2,000,000.

This   includes  special  feature  necessary  for   the



technical installations. It works out at about $25  per

square foot of total floor space.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost of the equipment and plant of all kinds to go

into  the  building and at the periphery will be  about

$2,000,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important point which has been provided for in

this  building  is  that  one  roof  houses  both   the

airlines'   operational  teams   and   the   specialist

departments on whose services they depend. As the  time

available for flight-planning and for briefing of  air-crews  is  limited, especially for jets whose  economic

operation calls for minimum time on the ground, this is

an  important  factor of efficiency.  The  building  is

designed  to  enable  the fullest co-operation  of  the

airport staff and of the operators with offices in  the

same building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides this development which I have described in

some detail, we must also provide additional length for

the runway, additional taxi-tracks, and special aprons.

These  are under engineering study, and I am not  going



to be specific about them. I can say that we may not be

able  to  keep  their cost below $2,000,000;  the  cost

could be a good deal more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These works and installations may be called Phase II

of  the current development at Paya Lebar. Phase I  was

the  International  Posts Building.  When  we  deferred

letting  tenders  for  Phase II  Part  One,  some  ill-informed  rumours  got round that  the  Government  was

going  to postpone development indefinitely. I  do  not

think anyone who knew anything about the matter thought

these rumours were true or were likely to be true,  but

they  were repeated in the Press. I therefore issued  a

release on 25th June, in which I said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Airport is essential to Singapore's prosperity

and  the  Government will see that it fully  meets  the

needs  of  our  expanding air traffic. Rumours  to  the

contrary  are damaging to Singapore and I categorically

deny them".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case similar silly rumours get about again, I

repeat   that   denial  and  I  reassert   Government's

intention  to  see  that our international  Airport  is

equipped to provoke adequate services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Question Time, the Member for Tanglin asked about

new construction for expeditious handling of passengers

and  freight, that is for what we may call  Phase  III,

that  aspect of the Airport which deals with the people

and  goods  once  they  have  through  the  Operational

Controls  been brought safely down to earth.  For  this

aspect,   we  must  have  airline  processing  offices;

accommodation  for  Customs,  Immigration  and   Health

controls;  public  concourses, restaurants, lavatories

and  enquiry desks; shops and stands; Press and  V.I.P.

rooms; and a mass of similar accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buildings at present used for these purposes were

designed  for early transfer to engineering and  stores

use,  with a new Terminal Building to take their place.

This  transfer  cannot be indefinitely  deferred.  The



present  buildings  are getting  to  be  chock-a-block.

Plans  for  the new Phase III buildings have been  kept



continuously    up    to   date,   with    considerable

modifications from the first proposals, chiefly in  the

direction of simplicity and economy. It may be possible

or  desirable to modify them further. In their  present

form,  they would cost between 2 and 3 million  dollars

to erect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon. Members  understand that we  are  faced  with  a

possibly serious diminution of national revenue due  to

the  recession. In such circumstances, all  investments

on  public  account must be carefully  scrutinised  and

their   desirability  weighed  against  other  possible

investments  of limited funds. Hon. Members  will  also

accept that large sections of public spending ought not

to   be   cut   down,   and  that  certain   types   of

investment - different  Members  may   favour   different

types -   must  go on. An investment of 2  or  3  million

dollars  for Phase III at Paya Lebar will  have  to  be

weighed  against other needs and given priority  within

the  context of available funds. I am not going  to  be

more specific than that at present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like now to make a point about the value of

the Government's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



investment  in  the  International  Airport.  We   can

describe  ourselves as being in the  entrepot  business

for  passengers  in much the same way  as  we  are  for

goods.  We  receive passengers in bulk  and  distribute

them  in small parcels throughout South East Asia, and,

similarly,  we collect small parcels of passengers  and

bulk  them for delivery to major points overseas.  That

is  the major business at Paya Lebar. The proportion of

through  or transit passengers, that is those who  stay

in  Singapore only for an hour or two, is about 15  per

cent  of the total. The other 85 per cent stop over  in

Singapore  for  varying periods, and thus  bring  us  a

valuable  inflow of cash. The volume of  passengers  is

steadily increasing and during the first six months  of

1958  was 134,124, an increase of 15 per cent over  the

same  period in 1957. This is a very valuable  item  in

Singapore's balance of payments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members will also be aware of the direct revenue

aspect of our Airport  - indeed, a question earlier  this

morning  has  focused attention on it. Returns  on  our

large  investment at Paya Lebar need  not  be  measured

solely in terms of tourist revenue. We can also set off

direct  revenue  received at the  Airport  against  its

recurrent   costs.   Items  such   as   landing   fees,

concessions  and rents bring cash which helps  to  meet

the costs of running the airport. I do not know that we

can at present expect that we can from this source look

for to a direct profit on our investment. To set direct

profit  on the investment as an objective might  defeat

the  objects for which the investment was made. We are,

however,  aiming to get a revenue sufficient  to  cover

the  costs of operating the Airport, that is to  ensure

that,  taking one year with another, we do not  have  a

loss on working account. We have not reached that point

of revenue yet, and in order to reach it, we must have,

as  in the Phase II building, investment in the sort of

accommodation that makes it possible to earn revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an interesting point of public finance to argue

whether in a period of financial stringency one  should

make  one's  national investments in  directly  wealth-producing projects or in others



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>



of  greater social value. I am not going to argue  that

point  here and now. I only want to assure hon. Members

that  in  considering  the future  development  of  our

international  Airport  that  aspect   has   not   been

forgotten and will not be neglected.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Minister for

his  lengthy  exposition but I would like  to  ask  him

whether -  you will agree it is a fact that the  Airport

is   a  revenue  producing  asset -  Phase  III  of  the

operation  is  more important or just as  important  as

Phase II and is it proper that it should be delayed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> This is indeed, Sir, the very point to

which I referred in my peroration. It is a question  of

in   what   you  should  invest,  possibly  in   social

investments  which  have a very long  term  fluctuation

period  or  in  immediately productive  investments  by

which  you  can perhaps reduce the amount  of  taxation

that  has to be imposed and I do not think it  will  be

helpful to discuss those points now.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it will be

extremely helpful. The Minister has posed the question;

will he give the answer?

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr, speaker, Sir, under the existing Ordinances both

in  the Federation of Malaya and Singapore, the affairs

of  the pineapple industry are entrusted to the Malayan

Pineapple   Industry  Board,  which  is  a  Pan-Malayan

statutory  body  with a membership of 20,  of  which  8

represent canners and can-suppliers. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>



Chairman  of  the  Board is elected  from  amongst  the

members  and,  like  the other  members,  works  in  an

honorary capacity only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the pineapple industry in this country during

the  postwar  years and particularly since  the  latter

part  of 1956 has encountered many difficulties in  the

face   of   ever-increasing  competition   from   other

producing  countries in overseas markets,  and  it  has

become   apparent  that  a  continuous  and   energetic

direction is necessary in the conduct of the affairs of

this industry, particularly in promoting effective  co-ordination in the production, processing and  marketing

aspects  of  the industry. It is for this reason,  Sir,

that  this  Bill is designed to provide for  the  joint

appointment  by  the Governor and the Yang  di-Pertuan

Agong  of an independent Chairman on a salary basis  in

place  of  the  present elected Chairman. This  measure

will  also  serve  to  remove the objection  which  can

legitimately  be raised to the election of  a  Chairman

who  may  be  said  to be the nominee of  a  particular

section of the industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is further considered essential by the two

Governments  that  representation on the  Board  should

appropriately  reflect the importance of the  different

interests  concerned in the pineapple  industry.  Under

the  present  Ordinance the Board is  now  composed  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One representative of the Singapore Government;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One representative of the Federation Government;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three representatives of State Governments;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Director of Agriculture, Federation of Malaya;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner for Co-operative Development,

Federation of Malaya;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman of the Canners Representative Association, who is from Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six representatives of canners, two of whom are from

Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two representatives of exporters, both from

Singapore;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One representative of can suppliers, also from

Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three representatives of small growers, all from the

Federation.



<br><br>It  is thought that a more equitable representation of

the  various interests on the Board would be  achieved

by  the proposals in the Bill to delete paragraphs (f)

and  (j)  of  section 3 (2) of the present  Ordinance,

which provides for the appointment on the Board of the

Chairman of the Canners Representative Association and

a  representative of can suppliers respectively.  This

will   have  the  effect  of  reducing  the   canners'

representatives  by one and will make  it  unnecessary

for  a representative of can suppliers to be appointed

to the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments contained in the Bill are

merely consequential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Board is Pan-Malayan, parallel action has

been  taken by the Federation to introduce an amending

Bill  on identical lines, and the Federation Bill  has

already  been  passed  at  a meeting  of  the  Federal

Legislative Council on 31st July.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Sir, I

second it.

<br><br>11.10 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to  say that I think it is a very happy move  to

set  on  its feet what I believe is the third  largest

industry  in  Malaya. During the last few  years  this

industry  has  received very serious competition  from

countries  like Australia, Africa and, also  I  think,

Taiwan. It is now time for this industry to be set  on

a  Pan-Malayan basis so that all the troubles  of  the

growers  and  the canners can be solved  by  one  body

which I hope and trust will lead to the prosperity  of

this industry and of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply, Mr Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> It is a point of clarification,

Sir. I think the hon. Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



for  Paya  Lebar is not aware that the  industry

has already been set on a Pan-Malayan basis since some

time  back,  because a Pan-Malayan Board  has  already

been  constituted. This amending Bill is  directed  at

readjusting the number of representatives on the Board

and the interests represented. It has been Said by the

Federation  that  the  small  growers  are  very  much

outnumbered and this probably would readjust that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

the Bill be now read a Second time"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to make two amendments to section 7

of  the Pensions Ordinance, 1956, which governs,  inter

alia,  the  retirement  of  public  officers  from  the

public   service in order to stand for  election  as  a

member  of any legislative body or any local government

authority  in Singapore. The present regulations  which

provide for retirement of public officers to take up  a

political  career  were drawn up in 1955.  Under  these

regulations,  the  public service is divided  into  two

classes  of  what are known as the restricted  and  the

unrestricted class.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restricted class, which embodies all officers

employed in an administrative or executive capacity, as

well  as  other officers whose duties bring  them  into

contact  with the formulation and execution of  policy,

comprises  all officers in Divisions I and  II  of  the

public service and a proportion of officers in Division

III.  These officers are not subject to any restriction

on  their right of private exercise of the franchise or

of  their  liberty to be members of a political  party,

but  they are otherwise prohibited from engaging in any

political  activity  whatsoever  and  are  required  to

maintain  complete reserve in all political matters  or

matters of public controversy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers in the unrestricted class, which comprises

all officers in Division IV of the public service,  as

well  as daily-rated employees and a limited number  of

officers  in  Division III whose duties are essentially

of  a  technical  nature, are  permitted  to  stand  as

candidates for election to the Legislative Assembly  or

to  any  local government authority as well as to  hold

office in political organisations. Any such officer who

is  nominated  as  a  candidate  for  election  to  the

Legislative Assembly or a local government authority is

granted  the  leave  due  to  him  together  with   any

additional  unrecorded leave without pay which  may  be

necessary to cover the period up to Polling Day. If  he

is  elected, such an officer is required to retire from

the  service  with  effect from  Polling  Day.  On  his

ceasing  to  be  a member of the Assembly  or  a  local

government  authority,  as  the  case  may  be,  he  is

eligible  for  re-employment  in  the  public   service

subject to certain conditions,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



and  he is then permitted to count his  service

prior  to  and  after the break as continuous  for  the

purposes of the Pensions Ordinance. Under section 7 (3)

of that Ordinance, he is eligible, whether or not he is

subsequently reemployed in the public service, for  the

award  of a pension on his attaining the age of 50,  in

the  case of a man, and 45, in the case of a woman.  If

such  an  officer  fails  to  obtain  election,  he  is

immediately re-employed in the public service and he is

required to return to duty on the day following that on

which the result of the election is declared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first amendment in the Bill before the House

seeks  to  remove one minor anomaly in connection  with

the  provision for awarding pensions to such  officers.

As  the law stands, they do not become eligible for the



award  of a pension until they reach the ages  which  I

have  mentioned, i.e., 50 years for a man and 45  years

for  a  woman. This, however, fails to take account  of

the  fact that there are certain categories of officers

whose minimum age of retirement under subsection (2) of

section 7 of the Pensions Ordinance is lower than these

ages. The effect of the amendment is therefore to bring

the  age  of eligibility for the award of a pension  in

the  case  of an officer in the unrestricted class  who

retires to take up political activities into line  with

the  minimum  age at which he would be eligible  for  a

pension if he retired in other circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment proposed in the Bill now before

the   House  relates  to  officers  in  the  restricted

category.  There  are  a number  of  officers  in  this

category  with  considerable  lengths  of  service  who

joined   the  public  service  at  a  time   when   the

opportunity of a political career did not exist.  While

it  is  desired  to maintain the strict principle  that

officers in the administrative and executive grades  of

the public service, since they constitute the machinery

through which the elected government of the day carries

out  its  policies, should properly  be  debarred  from

participating in political activities, it is considered

reasonable,  in connection with the first elections  to

the Legislative Assembly under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



the  constitution  which  will  confer  internal  self-government  on  Singapore, to give  an  opportunity  to

officers in this class also, who have a genuine  desire

to  serve  their  country in the  political  field,  to

retire from the public service in order to do so. It is

not  proposed to perpetuate this concession but to make

it   a  single,  once  and  for  all  opportunity,  and

hereafter  the  principle to which I have  referred  of

debarring the administrative ranks of the civil service

from  political activities will be strictly maintained.

The  amendment  in this Bill seeks to provide  for  the



award  of  pensions to such officers even  though  they

have  not  reached the minimum retiring age.  They  are

required to have completed 15 years' public service  or

ten  years' public service and to have attained the age

of  40  years.  Such officers will not be eligible  for

reinstatement  in  the  public  service  whether   they

succeed   in  obtaining  election  to  the  Legislative

Assembly  or  not; and the amendment to  the  Ordinance

consequently provides that a pension can be awarded  to

them  without  waiting  until they  have  attained  the

normal minimum age of retirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also to be noted that a similar concession to

public  officers  was  made in the  Federation  on  the

occasion of their last general election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should finally add that the arrangements made on

this occasion and which necessitate these amendments to

the   Pensions   Ordinance  have  been  adopted   after

negotiations with the Staff Side of the Singapore Civil

Service Joint Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid (Assistant Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Education (Inche Mohd.Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid):</b> Sir, I beg to second.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.25 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

as   the  Party  most  likely  to  benefit  from   this

amendment, we welcome the Bill. It is not a habit which

we should encourage in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>



the  civil  service, but once in the  lifetime  of  the

Colony  of  Singapore, particularly when one period  of

that  life is coming to a close in the next few months,

we  should  give  this opportunity to people  who  have

shown   from   their  past  activities,  qualities   of

leadership, political courage and moral convictions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am aware that some members of the civil

service  are  unhappy  at  some  very  senior  officers

leaving the service in order to participate in the open

political  fight. But the choice which this country  is

facing  is either to have honest and able Ministers  to

lead, or to have honest and able civil servants led  by

not  so  honest and not so able Ministers. The position

of  those who are concerned with the welfare and  well-being  of  this country is one which cannot be avoided.

Those  who are retiring under this amending Bill  could



well sit back in the security and the comfort of a well-paid civil service. But because they are fully aware of

what  is  going on with the fortunes of the  government

and  the  people,  they cannot just be spectators,  or,

worse,  unwilling tools in the destruction of  a  happy

and prosperous community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a matter for regret, of

course, that other political Parties are unlikely to be

able  to take advantage of this Bill. I would back  the

Government, and I think in this instance it is not  the

Labour Front Coalition faction of the Government  which

has  decided this particular Bill, but more those  who,

because they are not concerned with the inter-party day-to-day  trends  of the country, are therefore  able  to

take a more disinterested and dispassionate view of the

ultimate  fight in this country, whether the democratic

system  survives, or whether it goes under  because  of

ineptitude, stupidities and corruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome this Bill and I would like to say, for the

record of this Assembly, that those who are given  this

opportunity will do credit to the community which  they

are seeking to serve.

<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, just a very few brief words. I

welcome the support for this Bill which has been  given

by  the  hon.  Member for Tanjong Pagar,  but  he  will

perhaps  understand  if  I  do  not  associate   myself

entirely with some of his remarks. I would also like to

emphasise  that the decision which has  been  taken  in

this case is a collective one by the present Government

and  no individual Minister is more responsible for  it

than any other.

Congregation of Good Shepherd Nuns in Malaya.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Good Shepherd Nuns have been conducting

their work of care for adolescents and young people  in

their  Homes at Thomson Road in Singapore and at Ampang

Road in Kuala Lumpur. Their good work has extended  and

they  have  acquired properties. They have  also  built

more  homes. At the present moment, all the  properties

which  they have acquired are in the names of  trustees

and,  as  the  list  of  properties  increases,  it  is

extremely  inconvenient for the trustees to  be  called

every time to sign title deeds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore sought to incorporate the Reverend

Mother  Superior of the Congregation of  Good  Shepherd

Nuns in Malaya, so that all the homes and properties of

the  Good  Shepherd Nuns can be dealt by a  corporation

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. P. Shanks):</b> Mr Speaker.



Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second



time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the days when we had a Legislative Council it was

customary to refer to the "laying before" that  Council

of  subsidiary legislation, and the form of words  then

appropriate  still  appears in many Ordinances  of  the

Colony.  Now it is proper to speak not of "laying"  but

of  "presenting"  papers to the Assembly  and  Standing

Order No. 12 says explicitly how this should be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then another aspect in which the phraseology used in

some  Ordinances  is  now inappropriate  is  that  some

contain references to action which may be taken by  the

Assembly  by  way  of  approval or  annulment  at  some

meeting  subsequent to the meeting at  which  they  are

laid.  These references to meetings are now  misleading

and it is clear that when the legislature enacted these

various Ordinances, it had in mind what we now refer to

as sittings. I do not think I need embark on a detailed

exposition  of  the  technical difference  between  the

meaning  of the word "meeting", as used in the days  of

the  Legislative Council, and the words  "meeting"  and

"sitting", as used now in relation to the procedure  of

this House. The words "sitting" and "sitting days" are,

I  think, fully understood by all hon. Members  present

and I do not wish to take up their time unnecessarily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated, perhaps too briefly, in the explanatory

statement appended to the Bill, the main object of  the

Bill  is  to bring the now old-fashioned provisions  of

the  various Ordinances referred to in the Schedule  up

to date in the respects I have indicated, and to ensure

that  the Ordinances of the Colony will be in line with

the present procedure of this House. But the matter  is

perhaps  just a little more complicated than I have  so

far  indicated. Some Ordinances provide for  subsidiary

legislation  to be laid as soon as possible  after  the

meeting  thereof, without reference to  publication  in

the  Gazette;  others for laying at the  first  meeting

after   publication.  Some  provide  for  approval   or

annulment  by  a resolution passed within a  particular

period of time - variously one, two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



or   three  months.  Others  provide  for  approval  or

annulment without specifying any particular time.  Some

say  merely "at some meeting subsequent to the  meeting

at which they are laid".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now while the exact form of words used must

necessarily  vary  from Ordinance to Ordinance,  unless

there is to be a comprehensive revision, which would be

a  major undertaking, it is desirable that there should

be some uniformity and, particularly, that the Assembly

should  know  with certainty its powers in  respect  of

subsidiary   legislation  for  which  it  is   directly

responsible,  by  reason of the  need  for  affirmative

approval,  and in respect of legislation which  it  has

express powers to annul or vary by resolution. To these

ends, therefore, this Bill proposes the achievement  of

such  uniformity as is readily possible by the adoption

of a common form of words and the insertion, where none

exists  at  present, of a specific period within  which

the  Assembly  may  act.  The principle  on  which  the

Schedule  to this Bill has been prepared is that  where

no  period  is  at present mentioned, it shall  be  not

later  than the first available sitting day next  after

the  expiry  of  one month from presentation.  Where  a

period is already specified in an Ordinance, that  same

period - be it one, two or three months - should have been

adopted. Unfortunately I now find that in the course of

seeking further uniformity, some errors have crept into

the  drafting and, in some instances, the periods  have

been incorrectly set out. In respect of these errors, I

shall  at the Committee stage seek the approval of  the

House to correct them and also to delete a reference to

one  Ordinance which has been repealed since the  first

draft  of this Bill was prepared and to insert  another

that'  was  overlooked. But these, together with  other

matters  brought  to  my  notice  since  the  Bill  was

published, for which I am most grateful, are not  major

matters  of principle. The principles of the Bill  are,

as I have said, to bring our legislation up to date and

to  seek to achieve some uniformity and clear certainty

as to the powers of the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is one of the most important pieces of

legislation that has come up before this House.  It  is

drafted   primarily   to   implement   those   of   the

recommendations  of  the  Commission  of  Inquiry  into

Corrupt,  Illegal or Undesirable Practices at Elections

which  have  been accepted by Government. Although  the

Report  itself  was  not debated by this  Assembly,  it

formed  the basis of a debate on a motion by  the  hon.

Member  for Tanjong Pagar at the last Assembly sitting.

It  was  gratifying  to  note  then  that  whilst  some



speakers criticised the Report in varying degrees, none

criticised the recommendations of the Report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ten years now, Sir, the people of Singapore have

had   experience  of  elections,  and  it  has   become

apparent, during the course of these experiences,  that

as  the years go by certain unimaginable and disruptive

forces  have crept into the machinery of elections.  On

the  one  hand,  you  have the element  of  corruption,

thuggery  and intimidation; on the other, the insidious

infiltration  into  our  lawful  political   arena   of

Communism  and Communist tactics. Though the  Bill,  as

drafted,  is designed to wipe out the former, it  would

inevitably  lead to a lessening of the  threat  of  the

latter,  for  Communism cannot thrive without  thuggery

and intimidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question before this House and before the

people of Singapore is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



simple: Do we want clean elections or not? It is in our

hands  to decide, for what we decide today will  surely

affect  the future of Singapore and the future  of  our

children.  We certainly do not want their  fate  to  be

tossed about from one gang boss to another; still  less

do  we  want  their future to be left in the  hands  of

corrupt politicians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will help to bring about a change for the

better.  There are actually two parts to  it,  although

they are not so identified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first are amendments not connected with the Elias

Report,  but which Government feels should be  included

in the legislation for reasons which I shall enumerate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill changes the date from which

residence in Singapore is to be counted for the purpose

of  preparing registers of electors from 1st  April  to

1st  February. This follows a similar change which  has

been   made  to  the  Singapore  Legislative   Assembly

Elections Ordinance and makes it easier for those doing

the  work of compiling to publish both registers  about

the same time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the Bill remove the

mandatory provisions of the Ordinance which require the

publication in newspapers of various election  notices.

The publication of the notices in the form required  by



the Ordinance in newspapers has entailed heavy costs in

advertisement  charges. It is intended, Sir,  that  for

the  future  a short advertisement will be inserted  in

the newspapers which will refer to the detailed notices

in the Gazette.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill will make it unnecessary to

undertake  a  revision of the register of  electors  in

1958  or  in  any year in which the register  is  newly

prepared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 of the Bill amends section 57 of the Local

Government Elections Ordinance, 1957, to make it clear

that  although prosecutions for corrupt practices  can

only  be instituted with the sanction of the Attorney-General, the police may, nevertheless, take immediate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



action  to investigate any alleged corrupt practice  or

to prevent the continuance of any corrupt practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Sir, is the first part of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second

part   of   the   Bill   deals   primarily   with   the

recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 of the Bill seeks to expand and simplify

the  provision regarding "treating". It implements  the

recommendation  of the Commission of Inquiry  that  the

offence  of treating should be extended to include  the

provision  of  food, drink, refreshment, cigarettes  or

entertainment to any person for the purpose of inducing

such person to attend or remain at an election meeting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 of the Bill implements the recommendation

of the Commission of Inquiry that there should be added

to the several forms of bribery under section 56 of the

Local Government Elections Ordinance, 1957, a provision

making it an offence for any person to bribe any  other

person  who  is assisting or has promised to  assist  a

candidate at an election in order to induce him not  to

assist that candidate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 of the Bill prohibits the use of motor

vehicles  for  conveying  voters  to  the  poll.   This

implements  the  recommendations of the  Commission  of

Inquiry  as contained in paragraph 93 of their  Report.

In  this  connection, it will be necessary  to  provide



more  polling  stations  so that  voters  will  not  be

compelled  to walk long distances to cast their  votes,

particularly in the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 of the Bill implements the recommendation

of  the  Commission of Inquiry that on Polling  Day  no

vehicle   should  be  permitted  to  carry  or  display

anything (including any rosette or favour) which  would

indicate connection with any candidate or his political

Party.  In  order to make the provisions  effective,  a

contravention of them is made seizable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 adds five new sections. The first section

prohibits canvassing on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



Polling  Day  to  implement the recommendation  of  the

Commission of Inquiry in paragraph 90 of their  Report.

The  second  section  prohibits, inter  alia,  (a)  the



checking of names of persons entering polling stations,

and  (b)  loitering  within 200 yards  of  any  polling

station. These provisions implement the recommendations

of the Commission of Inquiry in paragraphs 98 and 99 of

their   Report.  The  third  section  defines  election

activity and prohibits any person under 21 years of age

conducting  any  election activity. It also  implements

the  recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry  that

no  person  should  be allowed to conduct  an  election

activity  on  behalf  of  a  candidate  without   being

appointed in writing to do so by the candidate and that

the Commissioner of Police may require the cancellation

of any authority given to a person by a candidate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth section provides that an assembly of five

or  more  persons  whose intention  is  to  disrupt  an

election  meeting  shall be an unlawful  assembly.  The

fifth section makes it a seizable offence to operate  a

loudspeaker  so  as  to  interfere  with  the  election

meeting  or  maliciously  to deface  election  posters.

These two sections implement the recommendations of the



Commission of Inquiry in paragraph 106 of their Report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, one major and controversial

recommendation which is not included in the  Bill,  and

that  is  the  question of compulsory  voting.  Various

views  have  been expressed on this issue and  although

the   Bill   does   not  include  this  recommendation,

Government does not wish to prevent it from being aired

in  this Assembly, nor does it wish to bind itself  for

the time being without properly sounding public opinion

and weighing its pros and cons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is Government's intention to commit the Bill

to  a  Select Committee, and at the appropriate time  I

shall  beg  leave to move the motion.  I  have  already

given notice of two minor amendments in clauses 11  and

17 which will be made in Committee, but there is,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



however,  one  other amendment which  Government  will

introduce  at  the Committee stage in connection  with

clause  18  of  the Bill, making the  new  clause  73c

subsections  (1)  and  (2) of the Principal  Ordinance

seizable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.54 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

introduction of this Bill marks a great change in  the

election system of this country. In the past  we  have

had  elections of a nature where people or  supporters

of the candidates crowded around the polling stations.

This Bill will also give a chance to those who wish to



stand   for  election  but  who  cannot  afford  heavy

expenses.  Also  with the introduction  of  this  Bill

there  will  be no more allegations of secret  society

activities on election day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that this Bill is framed in two parts. One part, according to the explanatory

statement, is that this Bill is designed primarily  to

amend  the Local Government Elections Ordinance, 1957,

in  order to implement certain recommendations of  the

Report  of  the  Commission of Inquiry  into  Corrupt,

Illegal  or  Undesirable Practices at  Elections.  The

second  part  is  "Another change is  the  removal  of

mandatory   nature   of   provisions   requiring   the

publication   in   newspapers  of   various   election

notices."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to clauses 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9, they

seek  to  do  away with advertisements  in  any  local

newspaper.  This, I understand, is for the purpose  of

economy. The Minister, when introducing this Bill, has

said  that  in  the past the Government  has  entailed

heavy  advertisement costs. If this Bill becomes  law,

Sir,  then the notices will only appear in the Gazette

and  not in the local newspapers. May I know from  the

Minister,  Sir, how many people in Singapore  actually

read  the Gazette or subscribe to the Gazette?  Except

for  Government departments and a few big firms  which

actually  subscribe to the Gazette, I  am  quite  sure

that  many  people will be deprived of the opportunity

to know about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>



the  notices  of  elections. A large majority  of  the

public do not even know where to get the Gazette. Then

how  can they be aware of notices of elections? If the

present practice is discontinued, Sir, the public will

be deprived of the opportunity of claiming their names

on  the  electoral registers if their names have  been

omitted. It will also deprive those who would like  to

object  to some names that appear on the registers  of

an  opportunity to do so. According to the Budget, the

Government  spends huge sums of money every  year.  By

doing   away   with  advertisements   in   the   local

newspapers, the saving effected is very small, and  if

the Government thinks that it is essential, then it is

penny  wise and pound foolish. For the benefit of  the

general  public, Sir, I still say that  advertisements

should  appear  in the newspapers and they  should  be

widely publicised. Instead of the term as contained in

the  Bill - "in one or more newspapers" - I would  suggest

that  it  should  be amended to read "in  all  leading

English and vernacular daily newspapers".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the implementation of the recommendations

made by the Elias Commission, it is surprising to note

that  the Government is only taking into consideration

certain     recommendations.    Why    only    certain

recommendations?  When  the  Elias  Commission  framed

their  recommendations, they took the whole aspect  of

the  election machinery into consideration and  not  a

part  of it. For instance, Sir, clause 16 of the  Bill

is a new provision by adding section 66A after section

66  of the principal Ordinance. This section prohibits

the use of motor vehicles on election day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 of the Bill seeks to prohibit canvassing

on  polling  day. I take it this is to prevent  secret

society activities on election day. I agree that these

recommendations or amendments are good, but  can  they

be  considered adequate? The framing of this Bill will

only  allow  a certain section of the public  to  take

part  in  election activities - may I say,  professional

politicians only?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has said that our experience of

elections goes back to 1948 - 10 years ago. We  should

be  considered an advanced country where elections are

concerned. But there are still people in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  who  do  not  want  to  be  dragged  into  a

political  warfare. Normally a friend  of  a  candidate

will  willingly offer his car or his assistance  during

an  election campaign; but if this Bill is passed, then

such  an  offer  of  a  car or assistance  will  be  an

offence. According to clause 18, that friend will  have

to  be registered before he can help a candidate during

election day or during the election campaign. This is a

most  cumbersome  procedure, Sir. As  supporters  of  a

candidate  will  now  be subject to  screening  by  the

police  if  they offer their assistance to him,  it  is

then  up  to  the  police to say  whether  or  not  the

supporters  can  take  part in the  election  campaign.

Furthermore,    people   with   a   high    sense    of



responsibility - and   therefore   good    citizens    of

Singapore - will no longer discuss openly the good or bad

points of a candidate of a certain political Party. The

interpretation of the new sections 73A, 73B and 73C  in

clause 18 may only be a technical point in the eyes  of

the  Government,  but the man in the  street  does  not

understand what the legislation is and he does not wish

to  be  involved in any political complications because

he  is  afraid  of  committing an offence  under  these

sections  in  clause 18. There would then be  very  few

people  who would be prepared to come forward to assist

a  candidate during his election campaign. So when this

Bill becomes law, it will mean that voters will have to

go  to  the  polls  voluntarily  either  in  their  own

transport, if they have it, or, if they have not,  walk

there.  It is encouraging to note that the Minister  is

prepared  to have more polling stations, especially  in

the  rural areas, so that people will have only a  very

short distance to walk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the face of it, the amendments appear to be good

and  I  am sure every Member in this House will support

them, having regard to the recent Kallang by-election.

But  does  the  Government visualise the percentage  of



voters who will go to the polls? Every voter will  have

to  make up his own mind voluntarily that he should  go

to  the  polls and exercise his right to vote. I recall

to  this  House, Sir, what happened at the Kallang  by-election. The Government claimed to have a record  poll

at this by-election, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>



it  was  only slightly above 50 per cent. The political

Parties  and  their  candidates  took  great  pains  to

persuade people to go to the polls. Had it not been for

this.  I  am sure the percentage of voters at this  by-election would have been much lower.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also give credit to the Department of

Information Services during the Kallang by-election.  A

van  toured the division every evening with neon lights

appealing to the people to go to the polls and  telling

them that they must exercise their franchise right. Yet

in spite of all this, only slightly over 50 per cent of

the  voters,  as I have said, voted. Without  all  this

work  by the Government, the percentage might have been

20 or 30 per cent only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of this Bill, Sir, there will

be  no more cars roaming about the streets with badges,

posters or symbols. There will be no more canvassing by

supporters  and,  what  is  more  important,  no   more

annoyance  will be caused to the voters  by  supporters

coming to their doors every half-hour or 15 minutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Government wants to implement the Elias

Commission's recommendations, why not take all of  them

into  consideration rather than some of them? I am glad

that the Government is prepared to refer this Bill to a

Select Committee. If it were not prepared to do  so,  I

would have done it. My reason for wishing this Bill  to

go  to  a  Select Committee is so that more  amendments

could   be  introduced  to  implement  adequately   the

recommendations  of  the  Elias  Commission.   At   the

Committee  stage  I  hope  the  Government  will   also

consider the point I have raised - that advertisements of

notices  of  election should appear in all English  and

vernacular daily newspapers.



<br><br>12.04 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I felt dismayed



after having listened to the mover of this motion,  but

after  hearing  the flow of words from the  Member  for

Queenstown, I have forgotten my dismay. Sir, the  pious

and sanctimonious incantation of democracy, in order to

rig  election  laws for the benefit of those  who  hope

that they will win the next election, leaves me aghast.

We are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>



told that the whole purpose of these amendments to  the

Ordinance is to have clean and honest elections so that

clean and honest men would be elected to this Assembly,

and  that  they have done no more than just adopt  what

the Elias Commission recommended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, Sir, the recommendations that

were    made   were   inter-related.   One    of    the

recommendations  said, "Polling day a public  holiday".

Another  said  compulsory voting, no  canvassing.  Sir,



everybody knows that a public holiday will increase the

votes  of  the  candidate who has the  support  of  the

working  class. Everybody knows that at every  election

the  workers  jam the polling booths between  half-past

six   and   eight  p.m.  Therefore  we   welcomed   the

recommendation  to make polling day a  public  holiday.

That is part of the recommendation of the Report, but I



am  sorry to see that the Labour Front, which professes

to  be a Labour party and therefore should hope to  get

the  support of the working class, has decided  not  to

make  polling day a public holiday, although it is part

of the recommendations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were told that the Government is considering the

question  of compulsory voting. Let us be honest  about

it. Let us not be hypocritical. For about two months we

were reading in the newspapers every day about the  hue

and  cry from the Chief Minister being actively opposed

by  his  Deputy  Chief  Minister,  both  of  whom  were

actively  opposed  by the ex-Chief Minister,  and  they

were  all running around in excited circles. We took  a

completely  disinterested and  dispassionate  view  and

said,  "Come  what may, we will still win, whether  you

have  compulsory  voting or not." Everybody  now  knows

that compulsory voting is off, because the Deputy Chief

Minister  believes that if there is compulsory  voting,

there will be very few areas where U.M.N.O. supporters

and  the  Malays  will  outnumber  everybody  else  and

therefore win. Therefore he is anti-compulsory  voting.

And  therefore  the Chief Minister is in  a  bit  of  a



difficulty,  because he may be left without  sufficient

Members  to form a government. All this in the name  of

democracy!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recommendation not to have canvassing on

polling day is tied up with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



compulsory voting. If you have compulsory voting,  then

it  is  unnecessary to canvass. But, of course, because

they  do  not  expect  to be able  to  bear  again  the

enormous expenditure of men, money and materials  which

was  put  in  at  Kallang, it is  better  not  to  have

canvassing on polling day. It is a very expensive and a

very exhausting process. Particularly if one could also

throughout the whole election, block all those under 21 - presumably the governing Parties do not expect to  get

anybody  under 21 to work for them. They do not  expect

to be able to muster sufficient people to canvass votes

for  them - therefore nobody under 21 should  participate

in  election  activities. Therefore  no  canvassing  on

polling  day.  But no compulsory voting,  because  that

would  work  adversely  against the  interests  of  the

ruling Parties



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when this Bill was first published, I informed

one  of my Branch Committee members that it is intended

that  in  future  nobody under 21 could participate  in

election  activities. He said to me, "How can that  be?

People over the age of 18 are asked to take a gun to do

national  service in defence of Queen and country, and

you say they cannot participate in election activities?

They  are  prepared to send them to the  front-line  in

order  that they may be shot, to defend politicians  as

their  institutions,  but  they  are  not  allowed   to

participate in election activities?" Further,  is  this

21-year  limit  recommended in the  Elias  Report?  Who

thought it out?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regarding the screening of election workers, it

is  a  good and reasonable suggestion. Anybody  with  a

secret  society  record, with a card  in  the  Criminal

Records  Office - and this Office keeps a card  of  those

suspected  of  being  secret  society  gangsters,  with

pictures  and ten thumb-prints - should be debarred.  But

clause 18, section 73C (4) says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A candidate or election agent shall if so required by

the  Commissioner of Police withdraw and deliver to the

Returning Officer the written authority given by him to

any  person who is stated by the Commissioner of Police

to  be  a  person in respect of whom an order has  been

made  under  subsection  (4)  of  section  22  of   the

Societies  Ordinance  for  the  photograph  and  finger

impressions of such person to be taken."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  we  saw - and  this is about 17 days  ago - Assistant

Ministers running around with gangsters in Kallang  and

here  we have this pious provision to say that it shall

all  be illegal. We are asked to accept with equanimity

and calm the suggestion that the Commissioner of Police

can  just say no to any election worker, when  we  know

that the 24 Gang was all massed on behalf of the Labour

Front  at Kallang! Sir, first of all, in principle,  we

object to this procedure of registering, because it  is

an  infringement of the democratic rights. If I  choose

to  canvass for a person, if I speak to another  friend

and  say,  "Vote for that person", that is an  election

activity.  And you cannot curb that. The definition  of

"election  activity" in section 73C (5)  of  clause  18

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'For the purposes of this section "election activity"

includes any activity which is done for the purpose  of

promoting  or procuring the election of a candidate  at

any  election other than clerical work wholly performed

within enclosed premises.'



<br><br>I  visit friend X in Rayman Avenue and ask him to  vote

for  the  P.A.P.,  because it is an  honest  and  clean

Party, and do not vote for the Labour Front, because  I

think they do not know where they are going anyway, and

because they are going to dissolve themselves. And I am

committing an offence. What is the purpose of all this?

Has  the Government seriously considered the effect  of

section  73C  (5)? On principle, we object  to  it.  In

practice, we say that what is going to happen  is  that

all the gangsters will be allowed to have the authority

to  help  certain Parties, and all the good and  honest

men  may  be suspected of being gangsters because  they

are going to help the Opposition Parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Select Committee to which this Bill is going

to  be  committed, we will have certain  amendments  to

make  as  to,  firstly, the feasibility of  introducing

this  scheme;  secondly, if it is to be introduced  for

the purpose of eliminating secret society gangsters - and

if  that is the manifest and specific intention of  the

Government  and  no  other - then  we  can  work  out   a

provision whereby secret



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



society gangsters, although suspected to be members  of

such  gangs  by  the  Registrar of  Societies,  can  be

eliminated   altogether.  But  there   should   be   no

infringement  on  the  right of a  private  citizen  to

canvass,  to  denounce, or to bring about a  change  in

government by bringing about the non-election of any of

the  candidates  of a party that he  dislikes.  In  any

case,  such powers cannot be vested in the Commissioner

of Police. They must be subject to a judicial authority

reviewing his actions and either approving or  negating

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of transport. It is true that we

suggested  two  years  ago  that  there  should  be   a

restriction on the use of cars. Because the  Government

Parties  and the Liberal-Socialists then believed  that

as  they  could muster more cars they could  have  more

advantage   out  of  this  factor,  our  proposal   was

rejected.  The consequent result is that every  polling

day  sees  a motorcade in every constituency.  Sir,  in

Kallang  I  do not imagine there were less  than  1,000

cars  milling  around a very small area.  According  to

results, not more than 8,000 people went to the  polls.

According  to our analysis, at each polling station  no



more  than 4,000 voters were carried there in cars.  In

other words, 4,000 people went by themselves and voted.

In  case the Labour Front are wondering how they  lost,



let  me tell them that the people walked there, slipped

through  the  polling station gates and  voted  against

them,  despite all the high pressure tactics  of  using

cars and gangsters. We think clause 16 - an amendment  to

add section 66A (2) - is inadequate. It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing in this section shall prevent any person

employing  a motor vehicle for the purpose of conveying

to  or from the poll himself or any member of the  same

household or borrowing a motor vehicle from a member of

the same household to be employed for that purpose."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the English law on this point has been tested

for quite a long time, and it says that nobody can give

anybody a lift, be he a member of the same household or

otherwise. If we allow this to go in, then we will have

a  lot  of  cars  running around, or  which  have  been

borrowed, by members of the same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>



household. It may well be that the provision of  public

transport   along  some  of  the  main   roads   in   a

constituency   could   be  a  solution   to   all   the

difficulties over transport. In the rural areas - let  us

face  the  facts - the position is, of course,  difficult

unless  one puts up many more polling booths  than  are

contemplated  at  present.  The  difficulty  could   be

overcome  by  providing  public  transport  along  main

roads,  but there is then the administrative difficulty

of  seeing  that  such transport is  confined  only  to

voters for the purpose of going to and from the polling

stations.  But  if we are to ban transport  altogether,

then  it  must be an effective and conclusive  ban.  It

cannot  be one with a loophole which allows for members

of  a  household.  "Members of a  household"  can  mean

anything - because  you can have  a  house  which  has  a

hundred  persons living in it, and they are all members

of the same household.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I have this to add to my strictures on

the  conduct  of  the Government in  this  Bill.  Clean

elections  can  only  be  brought  about  if  the  main

political   Parties  are  clean.   I   will   give   an

illustration of this. The days of the Independents  are

over and those who have not got a Party had better look

around  quickly for one. When one Party adopts  tactics

which  do  not  abide by the Queensbury  Rules,  so  to

speak,  the  other Party must either  counter  them  or

succumb.  For instance, if one Party puts  up  a  large

number  of people outside the polling station  for  the

purposes of:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Morale, and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Gentle persuasion, albeit bordering on

intimidation,



<br><br>the  other  Party  is compelled to  do  likewise.  When

therefore, for the purposes of avoiding an incident  in

the   Kallang  by-election,  we  invited  all   Parties

voluntarily  to agree not to have canvassing  within  a

hundred  yards of any polling station, great reluctance

was shown from the Labour Front. The ex-Chief Minister,

for  his own selfish motives, because his Workers Party

probably had nobody to put outside the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>



polling  stations - I think he has only got a gang  named

304  now - cornered his successor in a public  interview,

into agreeing to this, and yet, despite that agreement,

the  following day at Rayman School up to half-past one

we saw masses -



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Of P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - of young men wearing Labour Front

badges, Hawaiian shirts and drainpipe trousers - we have

pictures  to prove it too - and because it could  not  be

stopped,  at  2 o'clock we gave orders to our  workers.

And  we  have  workers who are bigger chaps,  strapping



people,   man  for  man,  S.T.C. bus  conductors   and

drivers - not gangsters. The result was to neutralise the

position.  Let  them remember this:  that  every  dirty

tactic and every bit of foul play can be countered by a

Party  which has an organisation and has facilities  to

back  the  resources of large masses of people  in  the

unions.  If  you  have that, then you  have  much  more

resources  than  if  you have money to  buy  gangsters,

because,  after all, a man who is paid to do a  job  is

not  going to exert himself more than what is necessary

to  earn  the money. But if a man comes into the  field

because  he  feels it to be his duty,  and  because  he

wants  to  return a favour done for him and his  union,

then he is going to go out and do his level best to see

that  his side wins. If the Government really wants  to

see  a clean election, then, first of all, let us  have

clean  and  fair play during the whole  course  of  the

election. Let us discuss these amendments not with  the

purpose  of trying to cripple another Party,  but  with

the   purpose  of  getting  the  gangsters  and   other

undesirable elements out of it. But so long as  we  see

in  this  Bill an intention to take some advantage  and

cripple the other side, we shall fight it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members will need a little reminder from  me  of

the  current situation in regard to the enforcement  of

law  and  order  in Singapore due to the activities  of

secret   societies.  Every  day  they  pick  up   their

newspapers  and  read of gang fights  or  other  crimes

committed by members of these gangs in pursuit of their

object  of terrorising the law-abiding people  in  this

island.  Moreover, there has of recent weeks,  as  hon.

Members will be aware, a serious increase in this  form

of  crime owing to two groups of these societies having

come into violent conflict.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only the culmination of a steady increase in

gangsterism over a period of time and which has led  to

the  adoption of a number of measures with the approval

of this House which it was hoped would have enabled the

police  to reassert the authority of the law and  bring

the  criminals to justice or at least to restrict their

activities.  I  should  like to  give  the  House  some

statistics to show not only the steady increase in this

form  of  crime which has been going on for some  time,

but  also  the  serious deterioration which  has  taken

place  recently. In 1954, there were 30 secret  society

gang  fights;  in 1955, there were 24; in  1956,  there

were 25; in 1957, there were 150; and in the first  six

months of this year, there were 157 - double the rate for

last year. Even allowing for the fact that a change  of

classification  came into being last year  and  certain

minor  fights  which had previously been classified  as

affrays  are  now brought into the category  of  secret

society gang fights, hon. Members will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



see  that  there has been a very serious rise  in  this

type Of crime. During the six weeks since 1st July this

year, there have been not only 51 gang fights, but also

six  murders, either committed in the course  of  these

fights  or  for  reasons concerned with  membership  of

those  societies. In addition, the incidence of  house-breaking  and  thefts in 1958 has been double  that  of

previous years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first question which naturally has to be

answered  is why cannot the police, whose duty  it  is,

detect  the criminals and bring them before the  Courts

to  be  dealt with under the ordinary law of the  land?

Hon.  Members  are,  I  know,  already  aware  of   the

difficulties  with which the police are  faced,  but  I

should like to repeat them in order to explain why  the

Government  feels  it  necessary to  seek  the  special

powers which are embodied in the Bill before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a crime is committed, whether it be a gang

fight,   an  assault  or  a  murder,  those   who   are

responsible do not commit their crimes before the  eyes

of the police so enabling the police not only to arrest

the  offenders there and then, but also to furnish eye-witness evidence to bring a charge before the Court. On

the  contrary, they take very good care to ensure  that

there are no police officers present before they embark

on   a  crime.  The  police  consequently  only  obtain

knowledge of the crime some time and, in certain cases,

a quite considerable time, after it has been committed.

The  perpetrators have disappeared and the only  method



of  detection  open to the police is to question  those

members  of  the public who may have been witnesses  to

the  crime  or for some other reason have knowledge  of

it.  This  interrogation, coupled with  any  deductions

which  can  be  made from any material evidence  to  be

found  at  the scene of the crime, is the only  way  of

obtaining information which may lead to identifying the

criminals.  They have in addition their own  knowledge,

culled  over  a period of time, of the members  of  the

secret  societies involved - who are the fighters and  so

on - but  that  is of little value when it comes  to  the

second stage of the proceedings, which is to bring  the

accused persons before



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>



a  Court and produce first-hand evidence to satisfy the

Court  that the persons are guilty of the offence  with

which they are charged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At both stages of this procedure - detection and

prosecution - it has unfortunately to be recognised  that

they seldom receive the assistance from members of  the

public to which they are entitled and without which  it

is  quite impossible for them to carry out their  task.

The  reason  is a simple one - that those concerned  are



too  frightened of reprisals from other members of  the

gang  if they furnish any information which would  lead

to the arrest of a member of the gang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These gangs have in short succeeded in establishing a

very  widespread form of terrorism which  inhibits  the

law-abiding  citizen  from carrying  out  his  duty  in

assisting in the enforcement of the law. Even  if  they

are  prepared,  as  they  sometimes  are  prepared,  to

provide  information in secret in such a way that  they

are  satisfied that it will not become known that  they

have done so, nothing will induce them to stand up  and

give their evidence in open court or in the presence of

the accused persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, there is little if anything

the   police  can  do  to  detect  and  prosecute   the

criminals.  They can only exercise the  limited  powers

open  to  them in other directions - to have  members  of

unlawful societies placed on record under the Societies

Ordinance, or, in a very limited number of cases  where

they  can  produce sufficient material to  satisfy  the

Court,  to have them bound over under the provision  in

the law to which the House assented earlier this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these measures are only palliatives and, as is

apparent  from  the events of the last few  weeks,  are

quite   inadequate   to  stem  the   rising   tide   of

lawlessness.  It  is  in these circumstances  that  the

Government has decided that more drastic steps must  be

taken  to  protect  the public from the  activities  of

these  gangs,  and that since, for the reasons  I  have

given,  it  is not possible to achieve that  protection

through  the  normal judicial processes of the  Courts,

these safeguards, which are adequate in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>



ordinary  times,  must, in the present abnormal  crime-wave,  be supplemented by executive action. It  is  not

only the duty of the Government to do this in discharge

of  its  primary responsibility for the maintenance  of

peace  and  good order, but I believe that there  is  a

wide public demand that such action should be taken and

that  it  will meet with wholehearted support from  all

law-abiding members of the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers, Sir, which it is sought to take under

this  Bill,  to  detain  for a limited  period  without

trial,  are designed to be used against the ringleaders

of  these gangs and those who are primarily responsible

for  their activities. I would emphasise that it is not

intended  to  use  these powers indiscriminately.  They

will be used selectively to break the gang organisation

and to remove the leaders to a place where they can  no

longer  coerce the less vicious members of their  gangs

as  well as the general public. As the House knows, one

of  the worst features of the present situation is  the

extent  to  which young boys have been drawn  into  the

coils  of  these organisations, in the  long  run  this

trend  can  be  countered  by measures  to  direct  the

leisures  and  energies of our youths into  useful  and

productive  channels, but that is of no immediate  help

and the need is for effective action now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I come, Sir, to the details of the Bill, I

should like to touch briefly on two other matters.  The

first  is  that the necessary powers which  it  is  now

sought  to take, I already exist under the Preservation

of  Public Security Ordinance, but the Government  does

not think it proper that they should be invoked for the

present  purpose, firstly, because that  Ordinance  was

enacted  for a different purpose and, secondly, because

the  Government considers it only proper that it should

obtain the specific endorsement of the House to the use

of   executive  powers  to  meet  the  current   threat

presented by these criminals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter to which I wish to refer, Sir, is

the  life  of the parent Ordinance to which  this  Bill

seeks  to make amendments. As the House is aware,  this

Ordinance will lapse in two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>



months' time. It is the intention of the Government  to

seek  the approval of the House to an extension of  the

life  of  this Ordinance at the appropriate time.  This

will  also  give  the  House a further  opportunity  of

considering these provisions in common with  the  other

provision of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now, Sir, to the provisions of this Bill. The

new  Clause 47 empowers the Chief Secretary to make  an

order  of  detention  for a period  not  exceeding  six

months.  I  have already given the House  an  assurance

that  this power will be used selectively and only  for

the  purposes  I have mentioned. It has, however,  been

represented to me since this Bill was drafted that  the

wording of the new clause 47 is exceptionally wide, and

I  do  propose  at  the  Committee  stage  to  move  an

amendment to this clause with the object of relating it

more  restrictively to the persons against whom  it  is

aimed.  The amendment which I shall be moving  to  this

clause  is  to insert, after "custody," in  the  fourth

line  of the new clause 47, the words "that such person

has  been  associated  with activities  of  a  criminal

nature and" that it is necessary, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These powers, Sir, can be used selectively since the

police  have much information regarding the  leadership

and many of the members of these gangs even though they

cannot  bring that information before the  Courts.  The

maximum  period for the duration of an order is limited

to  six months since it is hoped that within that  time

it  will have proved possible to break the back of this

problem.  Nevertheless, it is not possible to count  on

that measure of success, and provision is made, in  new

clause  50,  for  such orders to  be  extended  by  the

Governor in Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new clause 48 provides for every order made by

the  Chief Secretary to be referred within a period  of

28  days  to  an  Advisory  Committee  for  report  and

recommendation. It is intended that the  Committee,  in

discharging  this task, should be at liberty  to  carry

out the fullest enquiry, and every facility will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



made  available to enable it to do so. The  report  and

recommendations of the Committee are finally considered

by  the Governor in Council, which has power to confirm

or cancel the order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New clause 49 provides for the suspension of orders

on  conditions. This provision, Sir, is very  desirable

in  that it will facilitate releases at an earlier date

than could otherwise be justified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New clauses 51 and 52 provide for the appointment and

functioning of the Advisory Committees. The  Government

has  considered, Sir, whether provision should be  made

for  one  member  of  the Committee  to  have  judicial

qualifications,  but  the Government  feels  that  this

would be placing an undue burden on a limited class  of

persons  many  of whom are already carrying  out  other

public  duties. Nevertheless, if the House  feels  that

this  additional safeguard would be an  important  one,

the  Government would be prepared to accept a  suitable

amendment at the Committee stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 53 is inserted to protect the sources of

information where it is necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 54 provides for the custody and movement of

detained persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 55 gives the police power to arrest and hold

persons  in  custody for a limited  period,  while  any

further necessary investigations are carried out before

it is decided to apply for an order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 56 and 57 concern powers of arrest in

pursuance of these provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 58 should be read in conjunction with the

provision  in  clause 47, that no  order  can  be  made

without  the consent of the Public Prosecutor.  I  have

already  given  an  assurance  that  these  powers   of

detention  will  not  be  used  indiscriminately.  This

provision is designed to ensure also that they will not

be  used  as a substitute for prosecution in accordance

with  the ordinary processes of law. In any case  where

it  is  possible  to bring a prosecution,  it  will  be

brought  and,  on  the  facts  presented,  the   Public

Prosecutor will not give his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>



consent  to  an order unless he is satisfied  that  the

individual concerned cannot be prosecuted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one further minor amendment I shall be

moving  at the Committee stage, both to clauses 57  and

59. As these clauses are at present drafted, the powers

conferred  under  them  are  applicable  to   all   the

provisions of the main Ordinance. It is not intended or

desired  to  extend  the powers of the  police  or  the

Government in relation to the other provisions  of  the

Ordinance  and I therefore propose to move an amendment

which   will   have  the  effect  of  restricting   the

application of these two clauses to the new Part VII of

the Ordinance which is contained in this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I should like to reiterate that it is

only  the  exceptional gravity of the present state  of

gang  lawlessness which compels the Government to  seek

these   exceptional  powers  for  immediate   use.   No

democratic government will lightly curtail the  liberty

of  any  individual by executive action, nor  would  it

wish  to curtail that liberty for a moment longer  than

is   absolutely  necessary.  This  Government   is   no

exception but when there is no other means of restoring

peace  and  good order to the island, and removing  the

dark  shadow of terrorism which is spreading  over  the

lives of innocent citizens, then the Government has not

only  no alternative, but a positive duty to the public

to  take  that action. So long as the public  fails  to

give their full co-operation in the enforcement of  the

law, the ordinary judicial processes are stultified. So

long  as  the criminals concerned cannot be brought  to

justice, the public will continue to live in fear,  and

that fear will inhibit their co-operation. This vicious

circle must be broken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the slowly increasing mutual confidence between

the  police and the public following Police  Week,  and

other  measures to promote that confidence,  there  are

encouraging  signs,  and information  received  by  the

police  has  resulted  in the recovery  of  substantial

quantities of weapons and other material



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>



stored  away against gang fights. But this  process  is

slow  and it may well wither away if the present  level

of  gang  activity is allowed to continue. It  needs  a

catalytic  agent. I believe this measure  will  provide

one,  and  I  sincerely hope that if we can  accelerate

this process and prevail on the public to give more and

more  assistance to the police, it would  not  be  very

long before the conditions in which these gangsters can

flourish will no longer obtain, the normal processes of

law  will  once more be adequate to detect  and  punish

crimes,  and  these  special powers can  be  thankfully

surrendered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Sir, I

second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

when  I  read  in  the  newspapers  this  morning  that

Government  is  to introduce legislation  to  give  the

police more powers to wipe out gangsterism, I was  very

happy and, with a determined mind, I came here to  give

full support. When I came to this sitting this morning,

I  was handed a copy of this Bill by the Hon, the Chief

Secretary,  but on reading through it,  I  felt  rather

disappointed and will now have to change my mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I am not a lawyer, while going through the

contents of the Bill it appears to me that its  wording

is more or less identical with that of the Preservation

of  Public Security Ordinance. Sir, any extra powers to

be  given to the police to stamp out gangsterism should

be  most welcome to the public. I am sure everyone will

support these extra powers because gangsterism has been

on  the  rise recently. In fact Government should  have

introduced such powers long, long before. This Bill  is

long  overdue. And if Government had done so, I am sure

it  would  have saved a few lives. Within a  period  of

only three months, we find



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>



that  seven people were killed and a number of  persons

injured  arising  out  of gangster  or  secret  society

clashes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore must be happy to read that

more  than  70  people  have  now  been  arrested   and

detained,  but when they come to know the  contents  of

this Bill, I am sure they will feel as disappointed  as

I am.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hm! Hm!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> This is certainly true; there is no

"Hm! Hm!" about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police claim to know the identities of the big

gangster  chiefs, and even their hideouts.  The  police

even  have a list prepared of the wanted persons.  What

surprises the man in the street is this: that  although

the  police  know full well who the gangsters  are  and

their  hideouts, no action has been taken so  far.  Why

all this delay?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a report in the newspapers, it appears to

me  that the police do have powers under section 12  of

the  Secret Society Ordinance. I have an extract  here,

Sir. Section 12 of the Secret Society Ordinance reads -

<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Dr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Societies

Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Societies Ordinance - section 12

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Any person who is or acts as a member of an

unlawful  society, or attends a meeting of an  unlawful

society,  shall be liable to a fine not  exceeding  one

thousand  dollars, or to imprisonment for a term  which

may extend to six months, or to both.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Every offence against the provisions of subsection

(1) shall be deemed to be a non-bailable offence and  a

seizable  case  within  the  meaning  of  the  Criminal

Procedure Code.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the police do have powers under this section,

why  not  introduce legislation to amend this Ordinance

rather  than  introduce amendments  in  line  with  the

provisions  of  the  Preservation  of  Public  Security

Ordinance?  We  can increase the term  of  imprisonment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



under  the Societies Ordinance from six months  to  six

years,  or  even to 10 years, 20 years,  if  the  Chief

Secretary, so desires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introducing an amending Bill of .this nature is most

undemocratic. It is a departure from the principles  of

normal procedure that a man is not brought to court for

open   trial.  The  Preservation  of  Public   Security

Ordinance gives powers to the police to detain  persons

suspected  of subversive activities. These  offences  I

take  to  be political, but under the Criminal  Justice

(Temporary Provisions) Bill, powers are to be given  to

the  police to deal with criminal offences. Gangsterism

is  a  criminal  offence, and  there  is  a  difference

between  the Preservation of Public Security  Ordinance

and  this  Bill  on criminal law, as explained  by  the

Chief Secretary in moving the Second Reading. Why then,

Sir,  put  the contents of the Preservation  of  Public

Security Ordinance into this Bill dealing with criminal

offences?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When subversive elements are detained, it is a matter

of  political affairs and, may be for security reasons,

the  Government is not prepared to bring them to  court

for   open  trial.  But  where  criminal  offences  are

concerned,  what  is there to hide?  If  a  person  has

committed a criminal offence, let us bring him to court

for open trial and judge if he has in fact committed an

offence.  Democratic  justice  must  be  given  to  the

accused  and if anybody is arrested under any  criminal

law,  he  must  be tried in open court and  the  matter

should  not be kept secret. If he is found guilty,  the

penalties,  as I said, can be increased to imprisonment

for any number of years that is deemed necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Bill is accepted, Sir, may I say that there

will  be  abuse  or misuse by some police  officers  in

enforcing  or implementing it. The Chief Secretary  has

given  an  assurance  that  this  Bill  will  be   used

selectively  and  that  every care  will  be  taken  to

implement  it.  In  the  past I  have  brought  to  the

attention of the Government so many allegations of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>



torture,  of  abuse  of  the  Preservation  of   Public

Security Ordinance. So if this Bill becomes law,  I  am

afraid  that  the  same thing will happen.  There  are

still  many people who are brought to the C.I.D., where

they are subject to torture -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> - though this has been denied by

the Government. Whether it is right or wrong or whether

it  is true or not - "nonsense", I hear from the opposite

Benches - it  is  left  to  the  detainees  and  to   the

Government's  conscience to say. I am not  prepared  to

argue further on that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is there, then, to stop the police from

arresting anybody? One day it may be the Chief Minister

when  he is no more Chief Minister, or may be I myself;

the police officers concerned may have a grudge against

one  of  us.  By taking advantage of the provisions  of

this Bill, they will just pull us into the C.I.D.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I hope you get a walloping too!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Oh, you hope! I certainly do not,

but if I do I will know where the cause is - this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the new clause 47, if the Chief Secretary

is  satisfied  that  a  person is  detrimental  to  the

interests  of good order, public safety or peace,  then

he   can  be  detained.  'If  the  Chief  Secretary  is

satisfied' - now, Sir, that will be a matter  of  opinion

by  the  Chief Secretary. Who is there to argue against

him? On many occasions in this House, we hear that this

or that is just a matter of opinion. In this case, Sir,

it  is  to  be  only a matter of opinion - the  personal

opinion of the Chief Secretary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must emphasise, Sir, that I am not actually against

the  introduction  of any new legislation  giving  more

powers  to the police to stamp out this gangsterism.  I

am  all  for it. But what I am against is this: that  a

man is detained without open trial. Why should a man be

detained without open trial? Give him a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>



chance; where criminal cases are concerned, I say again

that  democratic justice must be shown. If he is really

guilty of the offence, punish him as heavily as we can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> As we can?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Or as the Government can, or as

the  Court  can - even the Government  has  no  right  to

punish; it is for the Court to punish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is going to happen to the many schoolboys who

are  thrown out of school when they have completed Form

IV? After reaching Form IV they will have to sit for an

entrance  examination to go into Form V, and  if  they

fail  that entrance examination they are denied further

education.  They will then be thrown on to the  streets

and so may be led into gang-land by gangsters or secret

society  organisations. The C.S. in  framing  this  new

legislation must have thought that where Europeans  are

concerned, there are very few European youths  in  this

country,  so  he  is  not in the least  interested.  No

European  youth will be dragged in under the provisions

of this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have no knowledge of a Member

of the Assembly being named "C.S."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir - I mean the

Hon. the Chief Secretary!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in Singapore, Sir, the majority of the people

are  Asians. We the Chinese the Malays and the Indians,

have  sons  of  youthful  age.  When  they  are  denied

education, they may be dragged in for no reason at all.

What is there to protect them? Some form of employment,



then,  must be offered to them. What has the Government

done  in  helping these young people to get employment?

If  the Government can do something to help them to get

employment, I am sure that gangsterism will not  be  as

bad  as it is today. The City Council, Sir, has started

a mass health anti-spitting campaign -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear! Hear!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> "Hear! Hear!" - and Government

should now start an anti-gangsters campaign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear! Hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> "Hear! Hear! I think the

Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary has in mind

something about this question of starting an anti-gangsters campaign. I hope that while going through

this Bill, he will declare what is in his mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government in organising this anti-gangsters

campaign can form divisional good citizens committees.

In the Federation, there are good-citizens committees.



Why cannot we form such committees here? The



Assemblyman for each division should volunteer his

service and lead such committees. The public can also

co-operate by joining such committees, and Members can

go out in their respective divisions to detect

gangsters or bad hats within them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of being handed straightaway to the police

for arrest, I think they must be given a chance. They

should be told that crime does not pay and that they

should change their mode of life. They should be

encouraged to join youth clubs, community centres or

organisations of a similar nature. Then they will feel

that they are wanted by the public and are not real

criminals. In fact when they join such youth clubs or

community centres, they can get education on what a

good citizen's life is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reformatory schools also should be started by the

Government where some sort of trade or handiwork could

be taught. The products of the handiwork of these

youths could be sold in the market, and that work will

at least form some sort of employment or temporary

employment -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Must we

be plagued by all these irrelevancies and trivialities?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have not found anything irrelevant; as

to matters being trivial, I cannot say that that is out

of order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is - it is completely unconnected

with what we are debating.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Well, I find that there is nothing

irrelevant being uttered by the Member so far.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Thank you very much, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just making suggestions to the Government to

introduce more powers to stamp out gangsterism, and I

think it is up to Government to accept or reject them.

I cannot see where the question of order comes in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is not in good order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Certainly it is in very good

order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member address his remarks

to the Chair?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I am much obliged, Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, the products of these reformatory

schools could be sold to the public and provide some

sort of temporary occupation or employment for these so-called gangsters or youths. And if after serving a

number of months or years in a reformatory they pass

out with a trade, Government can find employment for

them in the particular trade in which they are

qualified. By educating such people I think we can

slowly wipe out gangsterism. It should not be, as

stated in the press, a question of meeting violence

with violence; if we do so, I am sure bloodshed will

come. But if we deal with it in a passive way, I am

sure we will be able to wipe out gangsterism very soon.

<br><br>3.09 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the number of democrats there are in this House who are

so intent on remaining unsophisticated and preserving

the unsophisticated rights of non-democrats often

astounds me. I sometimes wish that we could all conduct

a little experiment and, at the end of the experiment,

go back to the status quo. What I would like to see

happen to the Member for Queenstown is to let him be a

victim of his policies and his fond and false beliefs

about democratic rights and dealing - if I heard him

right - passively with active gangster elements. Then,

when the whole thing has fallen down like a ton of

bricks over his ears, we can sit back where we are in

this House and pass this legislation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us face the facts: either we bring these

gangsters  to trial, or we do nothing, or we lock  them

up  without  trial. Well, we prefer to  bring  them  to

trial  if  we  could.  As I know,  and  I  think  every

practising  lawyer  in town knows,  the  point  is  now

reached   when  police  officers  frankly  admit   that

gangsters  are not scared of the police any more.  They

keep on arresting them, lock them up for 24 hours.  The

gangsters  know  the  procedure  by  heart.  They   are

produced before a police court, they get bail, they get

two  chaps  to stand guarantee, $5,000, case  postponed

four  months.  They  engage a lawyer,  lawyer  goes  to

court. On the day proceedings commence, they fix a  few

witnesses  who decide that it is healthier not  to  say

anything, and they are acquitted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now quite frankly either you surrender and say, well,

the  judicial  process is inadequate and  therefore  we

have been beaten by gangsters, or we say, well what  do

we  do about it? I say, well, if there is no other way,

then  we had better deal with them firmly. But  at  the

same  time  I would like to point out to the Government

that  there is no use passing Bills of this nature when

they   get  Assistant  Ministers  running  around  with

gangsters in Kallang. I mean what -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member was

guilty of making the same reference this morning and  I

did  not pull him up, but I must remind him there is  a

Standing Order which prevents any Member from referring

to  the  personal  conduct of  Members  except  upon  a

substantive motion. The Standing Order is 31(9),  which

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The personal conduct of Members of the Assembly shall

not  be  referred  to except upon a substantive  motion

moved for that purpose.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I put it this

way: it is really no use for the Government in power to

have  important Party personages romping round  Kallang

with known secret society personages.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That of course perhaps is

inferring an improper motive to Members of the Assembly

who are members of the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I was referring, Mr Speaker, Sir,

to  members of the Labour Front who may not necessarily

be members of this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nevertheless it makes a mockery of the whole

thing. The whole solemnity of the judicial process,  of

the  legislative process, is gone through  to  nab  the

gangsters  to bring law and order, and the police  know

that  the  gangsters are often seen in the  company  of

important political personages. Now where are we headed

for? I say if we want to get to the bottom of this, let

us  establish some morality, some standards of dos  and

don'ts,  and one of the don'ts is: don't get  mixed  up

with gangsters in public life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Speaker, Sir, the powers themselves; in

fact I was remarking to the Chief Secretary that he  is

a  little  bit  kinder  to  gangsters  than  he  is  to

political subversives - he locks up political subversives

for two years, he is going to lock up gangsters for six

months  at a time. But I would like to make this  extra

plea to distinguish between those who are locked up for

ideological and other political matters, from those who

are  locked  up  for more mundane and  matter  of  fact

reasons  of dollars and cents, of extortion,  of  pick-pocketing,  and bashing and acid-throwing. Let  us  not

have  any distinction in the treatment they receive  in

the places to which he has the power to direct them.  I

see  that the provisions in this Bill for the detention

and  the places of detention are similar to those under

the  Preservation of Public Security Ordinance. But  we

should  make  it  clear that these men  should  not  be

detained  in  the  same places or in contiguous  places

with  political  detainees. Political detainees  are  a

class  apart.  In 19501 believe there  was  a  practice

sometimes of putting the gangsters with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>



these  political subversives. The idea  originally  was

that  the gangsters would break down the morale of  the

political subversives and then corrupt them. I was told

the  practice was subsequently dropped because some  of

the  gangsters  were  converted to more  effective  and

purposeful  methods  of employing  their  energies  and

spare  time.  I  hope  not only for  the  sake  of  the

gangsters  and  the  conscience  of  this  House,   but

generally for the distinction which you must keep clear

in the public mind between political and other forms of

subversion,  that this is a class apart - we are  dealing

with  thugs here, we are not dealing with ideals, ideas

or convictions be they right or wrong. And when we deal

with thugs, we cannot deal passively, as the Member for

Queenstown suggested we ought to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless one should be careful that none of the

allegations  which the Member for Queenstown  so  often

repeats in this Assembly ever come to life; they should

never  be  true. There should never be a  situation  in

which  it  is  generally believed, rightly or  wrongly,

that  force  is  being used. That is a  matter  of  the

utmost importance in the preservation of the morale not

only  of the police force, but the morale of the public

generally. If it is believed that members of the police

and  Secret  Societies Sub-Branch do in  fact  beat  up

secret  society  detainees, and that  belief  generally

prevails throughout the whole community, then I say you

have a very ugly situation developing in which loss  of

confidence  and  public morale, and general  alarm  and

despondency  at the executive powers of the  Government

will undermine the whole basis of the democratic state.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with that reminder to the Government, I would say

that   any   responsible   political   Party,   however

distasteful extraordinary powers may be, must give  its

support to this Bill.



<br><br>3.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Mason -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Mason (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after

two such flights of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



rhetoric  I am rather reluctant to get on my  feet  but

there is one point which I feel I must protest against,

and that was a statement made that, sooner or later, if

these  powers  are  granted to  the  police,  a  police

officer  will abuse them. Now Mr Speaker, in the  last

year  or so, with the idea of preparing themselves  for

the   responsibilities   of   self-government,   the

Governments  of  this Island and of the  Federation  of

Malaya  have  very  rightly insisted on  many  sweeping

changes.  Amongst those changes, we have seen  a  large

change  in  the  makeup of the Singapore Police  Force.

Many  previous officers who came from overseas to serve



in this Island have been pensioned off on very generous

terms. Their places have been taken by the local boy - if

I  may refer in such a lighthearted phrase to the  very

highly-trained,  highly capable  and  highly  efficient

Asian police officers which we have today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot believe for one moment that any of those

officers  or the men under them will abuse  any  powers

that  are  granted them by this House. I feel  when  it

comes to voting, I really hope to see a unanimous  vote

in favour of this Bill, which would be tantamount to  a

vote  of  confidence  in our own  police  force,  which

police  force, I think I may say, if this House  cannot

claim  paternity  it  can claim  at  least  to  be  its

godfather.



<br><br>3.19 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, I wonder

whether  the  hon.  Member for  Queenstown  might  have

changed  his  mind  after  he listened  to  the  speech

delivered   by  the  hon.  Member  for  Tanjong   Pagar

regarding  so-called democratic open trials.  Sir,  the

hon. Member for Queenstown really represents the man-in-the-street,  and we know he is really one  of  them - the

hawkers,  the workers, the ordinary people - he  is  very

popular  among  them, and I am sure he can  learn  from

them  a  great deal how gangsters get off  through  so-called  justice and fair trial in open  court.  Sir,  I

give  my hearty support for the statement made  by  the

hon.  Member  for Tanjong Pagar who opposed  these  too

greedy,  unscrupulous lawyers who want  to  make  money

quick



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



and who fix witnesses. As what the Member of the Bar -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Point of explanation, Sir,I do not

want to be quoted to the Bar Committee, through the

honorary offices of the Member for Changi, that I have

suggested that members of the Bar fix witnesses against

persons. I do not believe that they would be so rash

and stupid as to do such a thing and, secondly, I did

not say that. What I did say was that usually when the

trial comes on, between the time when the case was

first mentioned in court, in the two or three months

before the trial, somebody, somewhere, at some place,

at some time, got at some witnesses. And they are not

lawyers who do this, because I do not believe, having

seen the members of the Bar and the recent recruits to

it, that they have the physical necessity, the

requirements, the prerequisites to instil the kind of

fear which I think one secret society gangster can

instil in another.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I must express my thanks for

the  explanation given by the Member for Tanjong  Pagar

in  that  he admitted that there are a few people  who,

somewhere  and at some time, unscrupulously,  greedily,

fix  witnesses and help gangsters to get off.  Sir,  as

the Member for Tanjong Pagar has admitted that he is  a

member  of  the Bar Committee, I wish he  would  assure

this  House that he would bring this matter to the  Bar

Committee  to  discuss  whether even  one  unscrupulous

lawyer is practising such things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next comment is on the statement by the hon.

Member  Mr  Mason  about  abuse  of  power  by  police

officers.  Sir, I think this point is worth considering

more. Yes, all along we respect the integrity and  high

ability of the police force in this country, but  as  I

mentioned during the April sitting, police officers may

be  misled into misusing and abusing their powers; they

may  not do this purposely but because they are  misled

into   it.   Why? - the  C.I.D. forces  are  unreliable,

untrustworthy.  This  is  known  not   only   to   many

honourable Members of this House, but, I think, even to

the police themselves. So it is high time, Sir, for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



the  Hon. the Chief Secretary to consider whether  the

police force should set up a new branch, say a juvenile

section, to deal with delinquents; to clean out the bad

hats  among  the  plainclothes men; and immediately  to

recruit a new force of plainclothes men to build up the

confidence and trust of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support Mr Mason that this Bill should

be  supported unanimously by this House. It is not only

timely   but  already  overdue.  Anyhow,  despite   its

importance  and  timeliness, I have a few  comments.  A

patient is told by a doctor he suffers from high  blood

pressure. From time to time he has headaches.  We  know

too  well that he suffers from high-blood pressure. But

he only relies on Aw Boon Haw's "Tiger Balm". Every day

he  rubs this "Tiger Balm" to try a cure. Sir, that  is

useless.  Similarly,  to me this  Bill  can  only  cure

temporary headaches but not the high-blood pressure. We

Chinese  say, "Yao tzu pen pu nen ke tzu piao; tzu  pen

pu nen ke tzu piao."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> What does that mean?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Translated - you must get to the

root  of the trouble. You can never have a cure by just

rubbing any oil or any ointment into the skin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I appeal as an Independent Member: all political

Parties,  hands off gangsters! This is most  important.

As  long as any politician belonging to any Party tries



to  seek  support  from gangsters, the  gangsters  will

continue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we talk about the unemployment problem. I think

now  is  the  right time for the Hon, the Minister  for

Labour  and Welfare to give us an exact figure  of  the

unemployed in Singapore. Many a time when I  asked  him

please  to  quote  the figure of unemployment  in  this

Colony,  he  mentioned only a few  thousand  registered

unemployed  at the Labour Exchange. Sir,  this  is  not

true -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think if the Minister for

Labour  and Welfare attempts to do that, I must  rule  him

out

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>



of  order  because there is nothing in the Bill  about

figures of unemployment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I am trying to cure the high-blood pressure, but not by this "Tiger Balm" type of

Bill.  It is useless, Sir. The problem of gangsters  is

not  only  a  social one but, to me,  an  economic  and

political one as well. Simply by empowering the  police

to  have the vital right to make arrests and detention,

you  cannot expect the gangster problem to die. To  me,

Sir,  the  fundamental problem will still  remain,  not

solved.  Give us the real figure of how many unemployed

there  are in this Colony, including hawkers, for  many

of them are also unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Minister for Commerce and Industry made

a  very  timely and constructive statement this morning

but  we  know that, despite his hard work and sincerity

to  try  to  improve industrialisation and promote  the

entrepot trade, his hands are tied, and that even  time

is  against him. How to promote industrialisation  when

even  at  the Causeway the tariffs are so high  against

him? As for the entrepot trade, does the Indonesian and

Chinese trade improve or decline?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my conclusion I wish to make a point. This

Bill  is introduced by an expatriate officer, the  Hon.

the  Chief Secretary, to meet the problem of gangsters,



but  if  Whitehall in London insists  on  dividing  our

people into the Bornean, Singaporeans and Malayans, the

three  territories will forever not be  able  to  enjoy

either economic or political stability, and as long  as

there    is   economic   and   political   instability,

gangsterism can never die. Sir, I think it is high time

for  Whitehall to consider. Do not divide us. Let these

three territories become one. We cry about unemployment

in  this Colony, yet North Borneo makes an announcement

inviting  Hongkong farmers and workers to open  up  its

territory. Sir, of course you are going to rule me  out

as being irrelevant, but it is the only remedy to solve

this problem.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member has anticipated me!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>



3.30 p.m



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Sir, when I was

handed a copy of this Bill this morning - I have had a

short time with which to look through it - I was very

unhappy and uneasy in my mind to know the additional

powers that were asked for by Government to be given to

the Police. This Bill curbs to a certain extent the

liberties of the people of Singapore and certain

clauses make me almost feel that I should oppose this

Bill, particularly clause 55 which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...if an officer of or above the rank of

Superintendent   of  Police  is  satisfied   that   the

necessary  enquiries  cannot be  completed  within  the

aforesaid  period of forty-eight hours he may authorise

the  further detention of such person for an additional

period not exceeding fourteen days...".



<br><br>This  indeed  is a very wide power given  to  a  Police

Officer  but  the manner in which the  Hon, the  Chief

Secretary delivered his speech this afternoon stressing

upon  the  gravity of the situation that  confronts  us

today,  quoting  us figures showing  the  incidence  of

crime,  murders, burglaries and thefts  connected  with

gangsterism,  then I must say that my mind  is  changed

and  I have no hesitation in supporting this Bill  this

afternoon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad indeed that he has assured us that the

purpose  of this Bill is to get at the leaders and  not

at  the small men because it is the leaders who must be

detained   and  I  hope  that  all  efforts   will   be

concentrated on them so that the smaller fry will  then

be  given  a  chance  to know that Government  and  the

public  of Singapore are prepared to resort to  extreme

measures to make this place suitable for us to live in.

I  am  glad also to note that in two months' time,  the



parent  Ordinance, that is the Criminal Law  (Temporary

Provisions)  Ordinance, will come up again before  this

Assembly for us to approve or to deny its extension. By

that  time I hope a full statement will be made  to  us

and we shall be able to judge whether the provisions of

this  Bill  which  gives so much power  to  the  Police

should be extended or not.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems to me

that  the newspapers during the last week have  focused

their attention on gangsterism which made us feel  that

gangsterism is a new problem that has just cropped  up;

but  I would like to remind this House that gangsterism

has existed for a very long time. Since the founding of

Singapore,  there has been gangsterism. All along,  the

Government has had in its armory many types of laws  to

curb  this undesirable activity. All along, it has  had

plenty  of time and money that it could spend  usefully

to  prevent  an occurrence of this type of  gangsterism

and yet today we find that the Government comes to this

House  to  ask for extraordinary powers. I do  not  say

that  that is wrong but I would say that the Government

has  been caught on the wrong foot and that we must now

support Government in this measure in order to bring to

Singapore  the  peace  that  we  enjoyed  before.  This

problem of gangsterism, I believe, is not due to people

just wanting to become gangsters at once but there  are

a  lot  of contributory causes. Many of the Members  in

this  House  have rightly pointed out that one  of  the

causes    is   unemployment.   I   agree   with    them

wholeheartedly. I agree that due to the  present  trend

of  events,  many people are afraid of operating  their

businesses  here. They are chased away by the  uttering

of  very  irresponsible politicians.  They  close  down

factories;  they refuse to expand their businesses  and

they  refuse to start new businesses. This, of  course,

has  increased  unemployment on a  greater  scale  than

ever. If this situation is not rectified soon enough, I

believe  that the law will have to be prolonged  for  a

longer period than necessary. The Minister for Commerce

and  Industry has come out with a little plan.  I  wish

his  plan  success  but it will  only  succeed  if  all

politicians will be less irresponsible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, gangsterism is not merely due to

unemployment.  There  are  so  many  young  people   in

Singapore  who  have not been given the education  they

deserved.  They have been turned out on to the  streets

at an early age - an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



age too young for employment and with knowledge far too

meagre  to be wanted. Something must be done to  bridge

this  gap  and  although  the Government,  through  the

Welfare  Department, is doing what it can, yet I  think

it  has  not  done  enough.  More  assistance  in  this

direction will help Singapore on its way to get rid  of

this  menace. If money is not spent to help our  youths

to  occupy their time usefully to learn a trade or  get

themselves   into  organisations  and  help  themselves

usefully  until such time when they are of an age  that

would  be acceptable for employment, then we will  have

to  spend  more  money  on other departments  like  the

Police  and  the Prisons Departments. I  know  we  have

these troubles all these years; when every time a  vote

comes   before   the  Hon. the  Financial   Secretary,

invariably he cuts out or reduces the assistance  given

to these youths by the Welfare Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, I have read about the utterings of many

important  people  in Singapore on gangsterism  in  the

papers  during the whole of last week. Everybody  said,

"It  is  a terrible thing. We must curb it. We must  do

something about it." But I notice one thing. All  these

prominent  people will only shout their heads  off  but

will not do anything that is useful to help correct the

situation!  I  wish the people of Singapore  would  not

just   shout  but  would  come  out  to  help  in  this

direction.  Politicians should  not  just  condemn  one

thing  or  another  but should come  out  to  work  and

contribute  something towards the  well-being  of  this

country.  We have today a situation whereby gangsterism

is  slowly  taking over the powers of the  Police.  The

people  are more afraid of gangsters than they  are  of

the  Police.  The gangsters, as the Member for  Tanjong

Pagar  (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) said, know the law by  heart.

We  have  to  do a few things to improve the situation.



There was the "Police Week" that was staged not so very



long  ago. I visited a number of police stations and  I

was amazed by the courtesy shown by them. I was glad



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>



to  see the change of heart of the policemen. They were

all  ready to serve but they were only ready  to  serve

during  Police Week! Once the Police Week was  switched

off their readiness for cooperation also dimmed. I hope

that  the  Police Week staged not so long ago  will  be

staged  365  days  a year. The courtesy  shown  to  the

public  should be shown every day of the year.  If  the

people know that they can run to the Police every  time

they   are  in  trouble,  for  protection,  they   will

invariably choose the path which is lawful. But if they

know  that  running  to  the Police  means  endangering

themselves  or  their opinions falling on unsympathetic

ears, then gangsterism will be on the rise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard what the Member for Tanjong Pagar said about

gangsters;  how they know the law, how they  know  that

they  can be detained for 24 hours and later on brought

before a Court to be charged, get themselves bailed and

then  come  up before the Court again in a few  months'

time  for the case to be heard. But he missed  out  one

very  important  thing and that  is,  usually  at  such

hearings,  there  will be a willing  lawyer  to  defend

them. As a member of the Bar Committee, I wish he could

bring  this  matter up before their attention  so  that

they  should not only count the dollars and cents  that

they  can  rake in, but should also consider the  moral

behind a case and see whether it should be defended  or

not.  If  there is cooperation again in this direction,

then  we  will not have too many of these gangsters  or

murderers  getting  free!  I  think  that  is  a   very

important  point  for the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  to

press home. Today, before us we have this law, a law to

curtail the liberty of the individual. We know that  it

is  impossible not to have this law; this  law  is  not

welcome  if it is considered in the light of democracy.

But we say we support this Bill reluctantly and we like



to  see this Bill repealed as soon as it has served its

usefulness. I hope that the period for this  Bill  will

be  about  a  year or less. After that,  it  should  be

rescinded.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We love our ways of life. We love freedom - freedom of

the person - and we must come to a compromise, either  to

give  such powers to Government or the gangsters taking

over. As soon as we have the upper hand, then we should

want   to  reclaim  our  liberty.  I  recall  one  very

interesting statement in a paper last week. There was a

very  prominent visitor to Singapore in the  person  of

Mr  Ogata who was the Police Commissioner here  during

the  Japanese occupation. He told us, "During my  time,

Singapore  was all peaceful. You could sleep with  open

doors.  There were no gangsters. It was just peaceful."

But  I  would  like Mr Ogata to know that  we  do  not

relish that type of a peace. We lived in fear. We  lost

all  our  personal liberties. We resented  their  being

here.  We  resented  their method of arresting  anybody

they liked and of administering the law in the way they

did.  We have never welcomed them; we have never  loved

them; we have not forgotten them and we will not forget

them!



<br><br>3.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Words, words and words, Sir, and

pretences! "We support this Bill with reluctance."  Why

not  come  out  in  the open and admit  that  emergency

circumstances require emergency measures? There  is  no

need   to   hide  behind  the  bush  and  to  talk   of

"democracy", the "freedom of the person",  "the  rights

of  the  citizen" and "liberties". What  price  liberty

next  year  when  a backseat driver of the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar might be Prime Minister? Have  you  ever

thought  of that? Talk of liberties and this and  that!

Freedom  from gangsters during the Japanese  occupation

is  all  right,  but  what about the  Government  then?

Freedom  from  gangsters next year probably,  but  what

about  the Government that you are going to get?  Think

of  that  first. What price liberty! And that, Sir,  is

the  weakness  of democracy. Democracy nibbles  at  the

problem.  A  totalitarian  political  party  gets   its

candidate  in, whereas a democratic party  talks  about

fairness  in fighting an election, and this  and  that.

Yet in spite of all that you get people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



coming out and posing as virtuous ones, like the Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar,  by  admonishing  politicians  and

telling them not to have anything to do with gangsters.

Only,  he would not say what part his Party had  to  do



with  gangsters  though in the Elias Report  there  was

some  mention of gangsters being tied up in the Tanjong

Pagar by-election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the whole problem boils down to this. Do we or

do we not have confidence in the Police? There might be

some  members in the Police Force who might abuse these

powers,  but  as a whole if we have confidence  in  the

Police, then the individual has nothing to fear. If  we

do not have confidence in the Police, let us say so now

in which case we should not pass this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are basic reasons we admit, but in spite

of education and in spite of all the necessities that a

human  being  wants  we still have  gangsters  in  many

countries and gangsters need not be only the poor. They

need not be gangsters because of force of circumstance.

You  have examples of rich gangsters, gangsters who sit



high  in  society. They are big names and they move  in

the  best  of circles but basically they are gangsters.

Their method of gangsterism is different; that is  all.



In  some  places, they call them capitalists,  in  some



places they call them vested interests but there it  is

still gangsterism. However, today we are trying to  pin

down  the  gangster  who  uses  physical  violence  and

intimidation.   Of   course,   politicians   too    use

intimidation  in  getting votes and getting  themselves

returned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, Sir, I am afraid that economic

conditions  are not going to get better. Employment  is

going to get more and more difficult and even if I have

to say it, I think I should be open and frank about it.

Our population is increasing at a terrific pace and  we



have  not  a  hope of catching up with  the  employment

problem  unless everyone in Singapore works towards  it

and  the  only way to work towards it and to  save  our

rice  bowl is to get united and fight these politicians

who are frightening away all forms of investments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>



Let us not talk about capitalism. Let us not talk about

democracy. Words, words and words! When your stomach is

empty, all these words do not mean a thing to you. What

you  want is first a job, a house, to get your children

married, and so on, and that is not going to come about

by  mere platitudes sounded in this Assembly and on the

election  platform.  If we are  going  to  have  honest

politics,  Sir, and if we are going to do something  to

save  Singapore  from destruction, let  us  forget  all

these  platitudes, and let us get united  and  work  to

save Singapore - I say to save Singapore and to save  our

rice bowl.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chief Secretary, in reply?



<br><br>3.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> In reply, Sir. I welcome the general

support which has been given by previous speakers  with

possibly one exception to the Bill which is now  before

the   House.   I   would  like   also   to   offer   my

congratulations  to the hon. Mr Mason  on  his  maiden

speech  in  this House and to say that I  am  sure  the

Commissioner  of Police and his officers  will  welcome

the  very generous tribute which he paid to them in the

course of that speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar suggested that it was

important  that there should be no grounds which  would

shake  the  confidence of the public in the Police  and

the way in which they exercise their powers. I entirely

concur  with  him on that and I could  only  wish  that

certain  Members  of  this House did  not  seize  every

opportunity to continue to refer to allegations of that

kind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of the debate on this Bill, Sir, has ranged over

the  economic reasons which lie behind unemployment and

what  gives  cause  for persons to  take  to  crime  in

desperation. That, Sir, is something on which I do  not

propose to embark. As far as this measure is concerned,

the Government is introducing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



it  as  a temporary measure to meet an immediate threat

and  as  soon  as the circumstances are such  that  the

threat  no  longer exists, then it is  not  desired  to

retain the powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi (Mr Lim Cher Kheng) sought, if

I  understood  him  correctly, to  draw  a  distinction

between the Police Force and the C.I.D. He also,  if  I

understood him correctly, suggested that I should  sack

the whole of the C.I.D.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.

I mean part of the C.I.D. which consists of undesirable



elements - among the plainclothes men. They are not  only

known  to Members of this House but they are also known

to  the  Police  themselves.  These  people  have  been

recruited from bad hats and ex-convicts.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> I thank the hon. Member for the

clarification,  Sir.  This  is  a  matter   which   was

discussed  at  very  considerable length  in  a  motion

before  the  House  in April and I do  not  propose  to

follow him on it now. I would only remind him of what I

said  then  that  the  members of the  C.I.D. and  the

members  of the other branches of the Police  Force - the

uniformed branch - are now interchangeable.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> The Member for Tanjong Pagar accused me of

adopting  a  less hard-hearted attitude  towards  these

gangsters in the provisions of this Bill than those who

are  detained  under the provisions of the Preservation

of  Public Security Ordinance in that the provision  in

this  Bill  only provides for orders to be made  for  a

period  of  six  months. As I explained in  introducing

this  Bill,  Sir, it is the Government's  sincere  hope

that  during  the first six months, we shall  see  some

substantial improvement in the present state of law and

order  and  that  if  it is necessary  to  continue  in

certain  cases  the validity of those orders  then  the

provision  is  made  in the Bill for  the  Governor  in

Council to do so. I will also have very much in my mind

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



matter  to  which he drew my attention on the necessity

of  segregating persons detained under this  Bill  from

those  who  are  detained under the provisions  of  the

other Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong)

expressed the hope that the attitude and courtesy shown

by the Police during Police Week towards members of the

public  would be continued during the remainder of  the

year  and would not just be turned on and off  for  the

one week. There I am entirely in agreement with him and

I  can assure him that everything possible will be done

to see that whatever can be done by the Police to build

up  this  mutual confidence between the Police and  the

public will in fact be done. I was, I confess, a little

surprised  to hear the remarks he made when  commenting

on  the  speech  by  the Member for  Tanjong  Pagar  as

regards  the defence of these gangsters when  they  are

brought  and charged before the Court. I am, of course,

speaking  only as a layman but I had always  understood

that  it was the etiquette of the legal profession that

counsel  for the accused does not concern himself  with

the  merits  of  the  case of his  client  in  deciding

whether  or not it is his duty to represent him  before

the Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I may conclude, Sir, by coming to the speech of

the  Member  for  Queenstown (Mr  Lee  Choon  Eng),  I

realise, Sir, that he has not had very much opportunity

to  study  the provisions of this Bill and I  therefore

appreciate  that some of his remarks such  as  the  one

that  detention  under this Bill  will  be  entirely  a

matter  for  the  opinion of the Chief  Secretary  were

perhaps made because he has not so far had the time  to

read  on  a little further in the Bill and to see  that

the  order  of the Chief Secretary has not only  to  be

referred to an advisory committee but it is subject  to

confirmation  by  the  Governor in  Council.  But  even

though  he has not had sufficient opportunity  to  read

the  Bill, I think he has had ample opportunity to hear

what I had to say in introducing it and I confess I was

extremely disappointed when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>



he  quite patently ignored the difficulties which I had

been  at  such  pains  to stress over  the  problem  of

bringing these criminals before the Courts and charging

them  under the ordinary processes of law. If the  only

solution that the Member for Queenstown can suggest  to

this  problem  is to increase the penalties  under  the

various Ordinances that, as I made plain in introducing

this Bill, can be no answer to the present problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just conclude, Sir, by saying that I agree

with  what  was said by the Member for Serangoon,  that

this problem of gangsterism is one with which Singapore

is  familiar  and it has had its ups and downs  in  the

extent  of  the lawlessness to which it has given  rise

but I think it has been shown on more than one occasion

that  in  the last resort the only effective method  by

which this gangsterism when it is beginning to get  out

of  hand  can be curbed is by removing those  primarily

responsible from the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill.-[Mr David.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.





<br><br>4.09 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Certain amendments are to be moved by

the Chief Secretary. Perhaps hon. Members may have

amendments to suggest. So I propose to take the clause,

section by section, referring to each section as new

section so and so. Hon. Members are reminded that if an

amendment is moved to one particular line, no Member

can move an amendment to a previous line; so that if

the Chief Secretary moves an amendment to, shall we

say, line 4 of the new section 47, it will mean that if

an hon. Member wishes to move an amendment before that,

he should rise and do so, otherwise he will be

debarred. I trust I have made myself clear. We are now

on new section 47.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 4 of new section 47, after "custody,", to

insert  "that  such  person has  been  associated  with

activities of a criminal nature and".



The  reason  for proposing this amendment, Sir,  is  to

restrict  the width of this section for the  reasons  I

gave in introducing the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In lines 7 and 8 of new section 47, to leave out "the

Public Prosecutor" and insert "a judge".



<br><br>Sir,  the  Public  Prosecutor is the man  to  whom  the

police will pass on information. It is he who will  ask

the police whether to institute proceedings in court or

not. Therefore, when it comes to a detention order,  he

has already had his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>



mind  made up in going through the case. I think  there

is  no  necessity  for  the  Public  Prosecutor  to  be

consulted, because he has already made up his  mind  on

the matter.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concerns the detention of a man not proved in

court, and it should be done with the greatest of care.

We do not want to give the person who issues that order



of  detention  the  power to do  so  unless  there  are

safeguards. All Government servants, except the judges,

come  under the jurisdiction of the Ministers;  whereas

the  judges are independent of the Executive and  carry

out the order according to what they think is right.  A

person  who is going to suffer detention should deserve

full  sympathy and his case should be fully  considered

in  the first instance. I know that later on there will

be  a  reference of the detention order to an  Advisory

Committee. This probably would be done some time  after

the  man has been detained. The Advisory Committee  may

consist  of  a  judge  with some responsible  prominent

citizens. I think it would be much better to  have  the

case  fully  justified  before  the  man  is  sent   to

detention, rather than send him to detention  and  then

have  his  case confirmed by a person who always  deals

with  that  aspect of the law. I say  put  a  judge  in

instead  of the Public Prosecutor and you can have  any

other man on the Advisory Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, the Government cannot accept this

proposed  amendment.  The  hon.  Member  for  Serangoon

appears  to  have  misunderstood the  reasons  for  the

inclusion of this phrase in section 47. I would like to

repeat, for his benefit, what I said in introducing the

Bill - that  the sole object of inserting this  provision

for the consent of the Public Prosecutor to be required

before  an  order  is  made  is  to  ensure  that   the

provisions  of  this  Bill and the  detention  provided

thereunder should not be used as a substitute for using

the ordinary judicial processes of law. It is therefore

a  safeguard  against the police, or in  this  case  it

might  be  myself, making an order as being  an  easier

thing to do under this Ordinance than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>



to   bring  a  prosecution.  That  is  the  purpose  of

inserting  this phrase in section 47 and the subsequent

section  58.  The  hon. Member for  Serangoon,  if  his

amendment were accepted, is seeking to incorporate into

this  section a further level of safeguard  against  an

order being made on inadequate grounds. We have already

provided  in  this  Bill  for  the  order  to  be  made

originally  by  the  Chief  Secretary,  for  the  Chief

Secretary's order to be subject to review,  report  and

recommendations   by   an   Advisory   Committee,   and

subsequently  to  be  confirmed  or  cancelled  by  the

Governor  in  Council. Now, Sir, I suggest  that  those

three  levels  of  safeguards  are  quite  adequate  to

provide what is necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in my view, it would be quite

inappropriate to bring the judiciary into  this  system

of   safeguards  at  all.  We  are  dealing  here  with

executive powers, and it is undesirable, save  in  very

exceptional circumstances, that the judiciary should be

associated with the exercise or non-exercise  of  those

powers.  It also seems to me that it would be extremely

undesirable  that a judge of the High Court  should  be

brought  into these proceedings at the stage which  the

hon. Member proposes. If he gives his consent, it means

that  the  judge's estimate and his summing-up  of  the

case  that is put before him is then subject to  review

by an Advisory Committee and finally by the Governor in

Council. Sir, to obtain a judicial decision and make it

subject  to review by the Advisory Committee which  may

no  doubt  consist of two prominent unofficial citizens

would, in my view, also be quite wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the hon. Member's reference to the period

between  the time when the order is made by  the  Chief

Secretary  and  when  it  comes  before  the   Advisory

Committee  for  review, I would assure  him  that  that

period  of  28 days is intended to be a maximum  period

within  which the reference must be made, and in  every

case the reference will be made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



as soon as it is practical and convenient for him to do

so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanks:</b> I think, Sir, that it is desirable that I

should  say  something here about the position  of  the

Public   Prosecutor.  The  moving  of  this   amendment

discloses   what  is  to  my  mind  a  most  lamentable

misunderstanding of the responsibilities of the  Public

Prosecutor, and while this is no occasion to explain in

detail what those responsibilities are, I think  it  is

important that the hon. Member for Serangoon and  other

Members  who  are  considering this, amendment  should

understand  that  the  Public Prosecutor  performs  his

functions subject to no direction. The fact that he  is

a  Government servant does not mean that in  performing

his  functions he does as he is told by any  government

or  any  Minister.  He  has to act  judicially  in  the

exercise  of  those  functions.  If  that  is  properly

appreciated,  as  it  should  be,  I  think  that,   on

reflection,  the  Member for Serangoon will  understand

that  there  are against this amendment  not  only  the

compelling explanation given by my friend the Hon, the

Chief  Secretary  but also the fact that  it  is  quite

unnecessary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, so far as the position of

the Public Prosecutor is concerned, I know that he will

be independent after the next election. During the life

of  this Government, however, that office is also  held

by  the  Attorney-General - two offices in one.  However,

with  the  explanation  given by  the  Hon, the  Chief

Secretary,  I am quite satisfied with the whole  matter

and would beg leave to withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of debate on Question, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Report  of  the  Commission of  Inquiry  into  Corrupt,

Illegal  or  Undesirable  Practices  at  Elections  was

tabled on 14th April, 1958. I cannot  understand why the Government is moving  at  this

snail's  pace.  It could have brought up  these  things

much earlier and not in August. In any case, these have

been  brought up, but there is no decision as  to  when

the  Select Committee will end its de1iberation. I  do

sincerely hope that the Third Reading of this Bill will

take place on 10th September.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the intention of the Government is to go slow

and  delay the introduction of the new constitution,  I

will  tell  them that they are sadly mistaken  if  they

think  that they can oppose the will of the  people  of

Singapore. On the other hand, the holding of  elections

to the District Councils is not inter-dependent with the holding of the general elections to

this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have to pass some remarks on the age of

persons  canvassing and taking part in  the  elections.

The age limit is set at 21. On what basis, and why? The



Member for Tanjong Pagar said this morning that you are

asking our boys to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



take up national training at the age of 18 and yet  you

are  not  giving  them  the  right  to  participate  in

election activities. I will go further than that,  Sir.

Is  there  any restriction if a boy or a girl wants  to



get  married at the age of 18? I do not think there  is

any. If a person of either sex can set up house at  the

age  of  18, why cannot he or she be eligible  to  take

part in the elections? Sir, the right thing should have

been that teenagers, or Secondary school students under

17,  be debarred, but those students who are above  the

age  of  17  or  who are doing post school  certificate

studies  should not be debarred at all. After  all,  we

should  not  forget  that the population  of  Singapore

consists more of youngsters than others and it is their

inherent  right to take part in politics and  select  a

Government of the type they want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, I hope that the Government will not

delay in getting this Bill to the Select Committee  and

have   the  Bill  ready  for  Third  Reading  on   10th

September.



<br><br>4.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member

for Queenstown brought up the subject of advertisements

in  the local newspapers in respect of certain sections

of  the  Local Government Elections Ordinance,  and  he

criticised the proposed amendments in the Bill. Sir, it

is  considered  by Government that it  is  a  waste  of

public  expenditure to advertise in  the  way  that  is

required  by  the law. It is felt that  this  could  be

achieved  by  just  a  general advertisement  of,  say,

relevant  particulars, such as the electoral districts,

the  polling stations, and the names of the candidates,

instead  of  going through the usual legal  jargon  and

having  to  put  in  an insertion for  each  and  every

division  that is to be contested. In the case  of  the

last  City Council elections in December, Sir, it  cost

the Government $15,700 just to insert advertisements in

two  newspapers. For the Kallang by-election, just  one

insertion  in  one  Chinese, one Malay  and  one  Tamil

newspaper cost the Government $800.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar, as usual, made wild

accusations against the Labour Front in regard to  what

he  says  the  use  of  gangsters in  the  Kallang  by-election. He also made those allegations some time  ago

in  this Assembly. As a result of such allegations, the

Elias  Commission was appointed and its Report did,  of

course,  reveal some astonishing disclosures  regarding

his own Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member criticised the Government for

inserting the age of 21 in regard to the prohibition of

persons  from  taking part in election campaigns.  That

age,  Sir,  was fixed for the purpose of a debate.  The

Minister  in  charge of this Bill, Sir, in  moving  its

Second  Reading, said that it would be  referred  to  a

Select  Committee  and all the points  raised  by  hon.

Members of the Opposition will of course be considered

in greater detail there. So I hope that the Members who

spoke  on  this  Bill will be appointed to  the  Select

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while levelling charges at the Labour Front, the

Member for Tanjong Pagar made an astonishing disclosure

indeed  when he said that those who came out to support

his  Party  during the Kallang by-election did  so  for

favours  done. It would seem, Sir, that one must  curry

favour with his political Party and that those who come

out  and  support his Party are those who have received

favours from it. It was therefore not surprising,  Sir,

for  me  to  see one Sunday before Polling Day  a  very

senior  official  of the City Council who,  because  of

favours  done perhaps by the Mayor, was canvassing  for

his Party.



<br><br>4.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Labour Front



believes in clean elections. The Labour Front itself is

clean.  The P.A.P. has always claimed that  it  is  the

only  Party which is clean, but the P.A.P. has its  own

dictionary and it has a different meaning for the  word

"clean". I heard with great interest the analysis  made

by  the  Member  for Tanjong Pagar on the  Kallang  by-election which a P.A.P. candidate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



contested. He said that the P.A.P. had no cars and that

the voters all went to the polling stations by walking -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of clarification. I did

not say -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the hon. Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I did not say we had no cars. What I

said was they walked there and voted for us, in spite

of the intimidation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> He may have said that he had some cars, but

he  definitely said that many people went to the  polls

by walking and by cycling. But anyone who -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the hon. Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> - was in Kallang on polling day would not

have  lost sight of the hundreds of cars bearing  their

symbols  carrying voters. I was told,  Sir,  that  they

even  persuaded  car drivers for the Workers  Party  to

tear off their symbols depicting a hammer and paste the

P.A.P. symbols in their place. In fact, the P.A.P. had

the  largest number of cars and big American cars  were

used..



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member stated that the P.A.P. wanted to avoid

incidents  and  that  they were compelled  to  make  an

agreement with other political Parties not to put Party

men  within  200  yards, of the polling stations.  Here

they  tried  to  be clean. Please refer to  the  P.A.P.

dictionary  again  for its meaning.  The  P.A.P. tried



every  means  to  catch votes. They  held  more  public

meetings  than any other Party. They insisted that  the

Labour  Front is a capitalist Party, that Mr  Lim  Yew

Hock  is a colonial stooge, and that Mr Chew Swee  Kee

is  against Chinese education. They encouraged personal

hatred.  They even brought a colonial agent to  one  of

their polling meetings.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is not the hon. Member going into

too  great  detail?  He is at liberty,  of  course,  to

generalise  but if he goes into detail I will  have  to

say it is irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I was just explaining how clean the

P.A.P. was  in the by-election. Sir, the P.A.P. even

thought -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think if the hon. Member says

"unclean", perhaps that would be sufficient.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I think this is a very serious matter

in which I have to bring in more facts to prove that we

have been clean.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the hon. Member insists on going into

detail, I must rule him out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, what I was trying to say was that the

P.A.P. used  more unclean methods in this  by-election

than the Labour Front.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reference was made by the hon. Member for

Tanjong  Pagar to canvassing for votes. He referred  to

an  agreement made before the polling day to the effect

that  Party men should not canvass within 200 yards  of

the  polling  stations. Sir, what happened  really  was

that  half  an hour before the polling commenced,  very

many  P.A.P. supporters who wore no badges came outside

the  polling  stations and had their places  ready.  At

about  10 a.m. when they found that the going  was  not

very heavy, they all wore their badges and they took up

positions.   Later,   when  they  found   that   P.A.P.

supporters  were already there, Labour Front supporters



came  and complained to us and said, 'Now we have  made

an  agreement; we have not put in any men; but why  are

the  P.A.P. putting men outside the polling stations?'

Therefore,  Sir, you will see that that  agreement  was

not carried out by the Party itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has become a practice in this Assembly to

make  allegations  against Assistant Ministers  without

making  any  mention of the name whatsoever.  I  think,

Sir, we all must agree we must



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



respect  each other and we must treat people as  equals

and  human beings. It is not fair to anybody to  accuse

unnecessarily  and without substantiation.  I  do  hope

that the hon. Member for

Tanjong Pagar will have his facts clear first before he

makes any allegations.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. P. Shanks):</b> I wonder,

Mr  Speaker,  if  I might perhaps try  and  steer  the

motoring part of this debate back to clause 16  of  the

Bill. I understood the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar to

say  this  morning that the proposed  new  section  66A

contained  in clause 16 of the Bill differed  from  the

English  provisions in that in England a  person  could

not  even  use  a  car for the conveyance  of  his  own

family.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No; household, not family.



<br><br><!-- Mr Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanks:</b> Household - I beg his pardon, I understood

him  to  say  family. I would suggest that  the  Select

Committee,  in  considering this  clause,  should  have

careful regard to the corresponding provisions  of  the

English  Representation of the People Act from which  I

think  they  will  find  that the  restrictions  to  be

imposed are probably greater under the Bill before this

House than they are in England, where, for example, the

expression  "member of the same household"  includes  a

visitor spending the night before or after the  day  of

the  poll. And far from being less fierce, I think  the

provisions  of the Bill will be found to be  much  more

restrictive  than the corresponding provisions  in  the

United Kingdom.



<br><br>4.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must confess

I  enjoy  very much having the privilege  of  being  an

Independent  Member  belonging to  no  political  Party

after  listening to A Party accusing  B  Party,  and  B

Party accusing C Party, of corrupt practices during the

by-election  at Kallang. Sir, I think it  is  an  open

secret to the people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



of  Singapore that that by election was a fight between

the   samsengs  and  haksengs,  i.e. gangsters  versus

students;  gangsters versus gangsters; students  versus

gangsters;  English  school  students  versus   Chinese

school  students;  the 08 Group versus  the  24  Group.

Therefore  when I speak on this Bill, I must extend  my



congratulations  to  its  mover.  It  is   timely   and

important, although of course many amendments should be

made  to it especially about the age limit and  the  so

many  troublesome and cumbersome procedures which could

be easily abused by the Party in power to disqualify  a

candidate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I wish the Government to assure that the

Select  Committee  will  be  established  as  soon   as

possible  and give a target date for the completion  of

this Bill, in order to fulfil the promise that District

Council elections will be held.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I wish the Government Party have the same

confidence  as the leader of the P.A.P. - face  them,  do

not   suffer  from  a  certain  degree  of  inferiority

complex, challenge them.



<br><br>4.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> In reply, Sir, I do not think I

have  very  many  points to clear. Although  the  Chief

Minister  mentioned, in passing,  the  remarks  of  the

Member for Queenstown, I would like to say a few words

with regard to his comment on the advertisements in the

press.  He  would  appear to me to fear  that  lack  of

advertisement in the press would result in  the  public

not   knowing   that   there  is   an   election   and,

consequently, that not very many people would go to the

polls.  Well,  Sir, I disagree with him. My  experience

has been that very few people read such advertisement.

They have no news value except when presented as a news



item  in  pure journalese. Secondly, as the recent  by-election  at Kallang had indicated, it all  depends  on

the  virility of political Parties and their supporters

to make people conscious that there is an election on.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point raised by the Member for Tanjong Pagar with

regard to holiday on polling day is a point again which

needs  clarification.  The Bill which  is  before  this

House only deals with the machinery of local government

elections. Government has accepted the principle  of  a

holiday  on polling day but the appropriate legislation

is not the Local Government Elections Ordinance but the

Holidays  Ordinance  which  empowers  the  Governor  to

declare from time to time any day a holiday in addition

to those which are already embodied in the schedules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons given by the Member for Tanjong Pagar

with  regard  to what he calls U.M.N.O. opposition  to

compulsory voting, are quite incorrect. My Party, Sir -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is it democratic?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> - it is very, very democratic, Sir,

it  is  more democratic than the People's Action Party,

because  we  are  anti-Communist  and  they  are   non-Communist.  My  Party, Sir, did not  oppose  compulsory

voting  for  communal  reasons, but  because  of  other

reasons  which  cut  right through the  rights  of  the

individual. Even so, we are prepared to be persuaded to

the contrary if there can be sufficient safeguards with

regard to prosecutions and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will recall that last year this Assembly

approved  a  revised salary structure for  Division  IV

officers in the Government service. It was not possible

at  that  time to include the Revenue Officers  of  the

Customs   Service,   as  had  been  intended,   because

negotiations  with their Union had not been  completed.

These  negotiations have now been completed.  Agreement



has been reached with the Union on the scales shown  in

the  Schedule to the Sessional Paper, to be  introduced

with  effect  from 1st January, 1958,  subject  to  the

approval of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will note, Sir, that the new scales which are

shown  in the Schedule are part of the salary structure

of  Division  IV which has already been  approved.  The

additional  cost in 1958 is calculated to  be  $44,400,

and  the general effect, I am informed, will be to give

Revenue Officers an increase of about $9 per mensem  on

the  average. This is in line with the general  run  of

increases  resulting from the revision of  salaries  of

Division IV officers already approved.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedule-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The summary is at page 8.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 11-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $46,522 for Head 11 stand part of

the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am somewhat

bewildered to find under Head 11 - Subhead 4, new item...

$12,000 in respect of the Royal Malayan Navy. It says

here: "Housing allowance for married locally

commissioned officers". Sir, I understood the Singapore

Government handed over the Royal Malayan Navy, together

with its personnel, to the Federation of Malaya

Government. In fact, there was a ceremonial handing

over of the crafts involved, together with, I think,

the changing of the colours on the crafts. I would like

to know why we are being asked to incur this

expenditure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Part of the agreement entered into with the

Federation Government for the handing over of the Royal

Malayan  Navy  was  that we would  be  responsible  for

expenditure for the remainder of 1958.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The remainder of 1958 means up to

31st  December,  1958, I take it. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I

think it is right and proper that information regarding

conditions and terms of the hand-over which were agreed

should  be  disclosed to this House. We were under  the

impression - and  I think we were entitled  to  draw  the

inference which we all did - that the Navy had been handed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>



over  lock, stock and barrel. If, in fact, we  were

asked to pay for the expenses for the rest of the year,

we  should  be  so informed. I do not  think  we  would

seriously object to it. We are quite relieved that  the

Federation  of  Malaya Government has taken  over  this

Navy  which was going to cost us millions of dollars  a

year, but at least we were entitled to know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I was under the impression that hon.

Members  were  aware of this. There  was  certainly  no

secret about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under "AUXILIARY

FIRE  SERVICE,  subhead  171 (1) - Personal  Emoluments:-

Staff  Officer, Reimbursement to City  Council  ...

$17,052",  may  I know for what period this  amount  is

required?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The period in question is for 1957.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I take it then

that it is required for twelve months, which works  out

at  $1,421 per month, and I take it that this  was  the

salary  of  this Staff Officer. Can the Government  not

recruit a Staff Officer on their own rather than have a

secondment from the City Council?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> It was considered to be more appropriate

and  more desirable to make use of the services  of  an

expert on the City Council Fire Establishment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is there no one

in  Singapore  who has the qualifications  of  a  Staff

Officer of the Fire Service, whose salary per month  is

$1,421?  The Airport do recruit Fire Officers on  their

own.  Why should we, as the Government, have to recruit

this officer seconded from the City Council?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I think I have already answered the

question,  Sir, in so far as I have said  that  it  was

considered more appropriate and more desirable to  make

use  of the services of an officer of the City Council.

We  merely  pay  him  the  emoluments  which  he  would



normally draw from the City Council.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $46,522 for Head 11 ordered to stand part

of the Schedule.







<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 17-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $5,100 for Head 17 ordered to stand part

of the Schedule.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 18-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $115 for Head 18 ordered to stand part of

the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 24-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $100,000 for Head 24 ordered to stand part of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 26-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $57,240 for Head 26 stand part of

the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, under Head 26, on page 3 of

the  Paper, it reads "New Subhead-Crown Agents' Agency

Fees ... $57,240", which is a  large  sum.  The

explanation reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Crown Agents have found it necessary to make a

one  per  cent  charge on all payments in  respect  of

salaries,  allotments,  pensions  and  passages,  with

effect  from 1st April, 1958, to enable them  to  meet

increased  costs  of  operation. These  services  have

hitherto   been   performed   without   charge,    but

necessitate  the employment of a large staff.  On  the

basis of previous payments, the cost of this charge is

expected to average $6,360 per month."



<br><br>The  question arises, Sir, why a service that has been

performed  without charge up to the 1st of April  this

year should suddenly require such a tremendous charge.

We  would like to know whether bulk purchases  through



the Crown Agents have fallen to such a low figure that

it  is  not remunerative any more for the Crown Agents

to  perform such services for us, which they have done

for  the last 50 odd years, I believe. This is a  very

large sum, Sir, and I think we should require quite  a

lot of explanation before we can part with $57,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I want to know further, Mr

Chairman,  Sir, whether this charge has been  made  in

respect  of only certain colonies or whether it  is  a

general  provision now. If, in fact, it is  a  general

provision and not one directed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



at  Singapore  alone,  and if  I  understand  what  is

intended by the explanatory note, we can easily  avoid

paying   this   $57,240   by  making   all   salaries,

allotments,   pensions  and  passages   payable   from

Singapore. If anybody wants to collect his  salary  or

pension  in the United Kingdom, then he pays  the  one

per cent. Why should the Government pay for him?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> The Crown Agents, Sir, have performed many

services for this Government as well as for the  other

governments   in  the  Commonwealth   and   for   many

governments  outside the Commonwealth. In  respect  of

the various services which they perform, they normally

charge  a fee. For example, if they purchase materials

on our behalf and inspect the materials while they are

being manufactured and inspect them on delivery,  they

charge  a fee. Similarly, they charge a small fee  for

supervising  the  operation of our loans,  or  surplus

balances  in London and for the handling of  our  cash

balances  in London. Hitherto, they have  not  made  a

charge   in   respect  of  the  payment  of  salaries,

allotments,  pensions and passages and  other  matters

which  are connected with personnel. They have managed

to  meet  the proportion of their total charges  which

these   services  represent  from  income  from  other

sources;  but with the very considerable  increase  in

their overhead charges in recent months - an increase in

the  salaries  of the staff employed  in  London,  and

increases  in staff to deal with the increased  volume

of  business - they have found it necessary  to  levy  a

charge  on  the various governments who  make  use  of

their  services for the performance of these services.

They  made  an approach to the Secretary of State  who



considered   the  matter,  and  it  was   subsequently

recommended  to all the governments that  this  charge

was  an  appropriate charge for the services performed

in   this  connection.  We  were  then  asked  by  the

Secretary of State if we would agree to this levy, and

in  the  circumstances, we considered that we  had  no

option  but  to do so. We have been into  this  matter

with  considerable  care and do  feel  that  it  is  a

legitimate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



charge  in all the circumstances of the case. When  you

consider the volume of business which the Crown  Agents

do  for  us, I do not think that it is an inappropriate

amount  to  pay  and I hope that hon.  Members  of  the

Assembly will agree to provide money for its payment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point raised by the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar, for many years it has been the practice

for  officers  of  this service of  the  Government  of

Singapore  and  of  all the other  governments  in  the

Commonwealth to have their leave salaries, pensions and

other  emoluments drawn from Government paid in London.

The  question of making a charge for these payments has



never hitherto been raised. I do not think we would  be

justified at this particular juncture to say  to  these

officers  that, if they wish to have their pensions  or

salaries  to be continued to be paid in London,  or  in

the case of the local officers who are doing courses in

London  or in the British Isles generally, they  should

pay  this  one  per  cent charge levied  by  the  Crown

Agents.  I  think  it  is  an  appropriate  charge   on

Government and I hope that hon. Members will agree with

me in that respect.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, there was no

charge  before  for  paying  people  their  leave  pay,

pensions,  and  so  on in the United  Kingdom,  because

nobody  charged us for it. But if we are  going  to  be

charged  by  the British Government for making  use  of

their  services  to  pay pensions  and  salaries  while

officers  are  on  leave, it is only  appropriate  that

these officers or retired officers either agree to  pay

the  one  per  cent charge, or arrange  to  have  their

pensions collected in Singapore. I see nothing  immoral

in  standing on our rights. In fact, I think it will be

immoral  on the part of this Assembly to incur  further

charges just for the convenience of these officers, and

because  the British Government have decided that  they

will no longer bear the expense of the distribution  of

the money.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, from the Hon. Minister's

reply,  I take it that the volume of purchases  through

the Crown Agents has not diminished at all; possibly it

is  still  increasing because the price  of  goods  has

increased. The only justification so far is  that  this

sum  is required to meet the increased cost of salaries

of  the  staff; but to my mind the volume  of  business

that  they get from us has a very important bearing  on

this  question whether we should agree to this one  per

cent charge. In any case, I think that one per cent for

just  payment of salaries and pensions is a  very  high

charge. Why is it not possible for the Treasury here to

arrange  with one of the local banks, say the Chartered

Bank  or the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank - or one of  the

very efficient banks here - for their accounts to be paid

locally  into the officer's account and let  the  banks

handle it? We can save three-quarters of this money.  I

am quite sure that the banks would not charge more than

a quarter per cent for collecting salaries and pensions

on behalf of government servants on leave.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, I am not in a position to say what the

banks would charge for this particular function, but  I

think  I  am right in saying that we guarantee pensions

under the Pensions Ordinance to be paid at 2s. 4d to  a

dollar.  If  pensions  were paid  locally,  or  if  the

salaries  or any other payments to be made to  officers

in  Britain were paid locally and the money remitted to

London,  they  would do so at a loss to themselves  and

Government  would  fail to meet its obligation  to  pay

their   salaries  or  their  pensions  or   any   other

emoluments at the rate of 2s. 4d to a dollar. As I say,

Sir,  it  could be argued that the officers  themselves

should bear this new charge. On the other hand, I am of

the opinion that this is a charge which Government,  as

a  fair  and benevolent employer, should bear on behalf

of the officers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, I must say that this point

has  not  been thoroughly ventilated yet. I would  like

the  answer  to  my question to be made more  fully.  I

would  like  the  banks  to  quote  us  rates  for  the

collection of monies. I am quite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>



sure  that  there will not be any loss to the  Government

servant. I think the exchange rate is less 1/8 th of one

per cent, in which case there would be no loss at all  to

the Government servant:

whereas  we  can save something of this large  sum  every

year. Sir, may I move that this item be held over to  the

next sitting? May I move an amendment?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Notice of an amendment needs two days. I

think  all that the hon. Member can do is to vote against

the  Question.  The other alternative, of course,  is  to

request  the Estimates Committee to look into the matter,

but  in so far as this Committee is concerned, I must put

the Question and take a vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Possibly, Sir, may I suggest that

the  Hon. the Financial Secretary might like to ask  this

matter to be adjourned?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not think our procedure allows a

splitting of a matter of this nature. All I can do now is

to take a vote on the Head.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> May I suggest, Sir, that hon. Members vote

for  the  sum required on the understanding that we  will

examine  the  whole  matter and  perhaps  report  to  the

Estimates Committee? We merely have to vote money for the

rest of the year.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Those are details which really should not

be  ventilated in this Committee. I have allowed  details

to  be  mentioned for information, but in  so  far  as  a

debate  is concerned, it must be on the principle of  the

service for which the money is required, and all I can do

now is to put the Question to the House and take a vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $57,240 for

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parts of the Eastern Principal Quarantine and

dangerous reefs obtrude into them. The useable  space  of

the existing anchorage is inadequate; hence a new area is

being defined for this anchorage, the whole of which will

be useful to shipping.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Eastern Explosives Dangerous Goods and Petroleum

<div align="center"><b>MEDICAL AND DENTAL OFFICERS: CONSULTATION FEES,</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>AND ALLOWANCES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Health

why  Government  medical and dental officers  will  be

prohibited,  from  1st September, 1958,  from  drawing

fees  or  retaining consultation fees hitherto allowed

under the Fees (Public Officers) Regulations, 1951.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. J. Braga:</b> The system of payment of fees under

the   Fees   Regulations  has  not  proved  altogether

satisfactory.   Its  worst  feature   has   been   the

disproportionate  range  of earnings  in  the  various

specialities  although the standard  of  qualification

and  the  length  of training for the various  special

branches  are much the same, and Government  does  not

consider that it is proper that a civil servant should

be  advantageously placed to earn  fees  as  a  direct

result    of   being   supplied   with   a    suitable

establishment,   suitable   equipment   and   suitable

ancillary and subordinate staff - all at the expense of

public funds.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the system of payment of specialist fees

has  been  abolished in a number of other  territories

including  the United Kingdom, Hongkong,  Nigeria  and

Ceylon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was for these reasons that Government felt that

the  system  should  be reviewed and  that  it  should

appropriately be considered by a Committee of Inquiry.

This Committee was set up on the 28th June, 1957, with



the  following  terms  of  reference:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to

maintain  high professional and teaching standards  in

the  Government Medical Service, to enquire  into  and

make  recommendations regarding the  desirability,  or

otherwise,  of  paying an allowance or  allowances  to

officers      having     specialist      post-graduate

qualifications   who   hold   specialist    superscale

appointments in the Government Medical Service. If the

recommendation   is   that  any  such   allowance   or

allowances should be paid-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to recommend what amount or amounts should be payable; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) whether such allowance or allowances should be paid to Government medical officers with specialist qualifications who are appointed to posts not requiring specialist qualifications."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee of Inquiry invited representations from

relevant    sources   and,   after   examining    such

representations  made  to  it  during   the   enquiry,

considered      that      specialists      in      all

categories - including   clinical,   non-clinical    and

administrative officers - should be paid  varying  rates

of allowance, which it called a "merit allowance".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical and Dental officers holding administrative

posts  in  the  Medical Service  had  previously  been

allowed  to  draw  or  retain  consultation  fees.  In

recommending   allowances  to   these   officers   the

importance and need of attracting specialist  officers

to   undertake  administrative  duties,  such  as  the

superintendence of hospitals, was fully realised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After careful consideration of the recommendations of

the  Committee  of  Inquiry, Government  accepted  the

principle  of  paying varying allowances  to  officers

filling  superscale  posts substantively  and  holding

specialist qualifications and to the payment  of  such

allowances  to  officers while filling  administrative

appointments.

to  state  the reasons for the payment of an allowance

to certain medical and dental officers who are holding

Administrative  posts  in  the  Medical  Service;  and

whether  such officers have hitherto been  allowed  to

draw  fees or retain consultation fees under the  Fees

(Public Officers) Regulations, 1951.
