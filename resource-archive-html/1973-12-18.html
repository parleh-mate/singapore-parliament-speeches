<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>WORK PERMIT HOLDERS MARRYING SINGAPORE CITIZENS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Policy)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Labour  how  many  applications from  work  permit

holders  to  marry  Singapore citizens  have  been

approved,  and  how  many applications  have  been

rejected and for what reasons.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, hon. Members may permit me to recall

the rationale for the implementation of the policy

in July this year requiring work permit holders to

obtain  the  approval  of  the  Commissioner   for

Employment   before  contracting   marriage   with

Singapore citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's high rate of economic growth and the

resultant  tight labour situation in recent  years

have  led  to the adoption of a liberal policy  in

the  issue of work permits. There is at present  a

large number of such work permit holders, many  of

whom  are  in  the younger age group,  working  in

Singapore. For these young workers, it is  natural

for  them  to  mix  freely in our society,  making

friends,  marrying,  settling  down  and   raising

families  in  Singapore. A healthy infusion  of  a

vigorous  and hardworking people can  result  from

this,  provided  they  are  industrious  and  have

acquired the necessary skills. These qualities are

essential if the young work permit holders are  to

be  integrated  successfully into the  society  of

Singapore. The policy requiring work permit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>



holders to obtain the approval of the Commissioner

for Employment was implemented to discourage young

workers  on  work  permit from  contracting  early

marriages until they have shown that they are able

to  settle down successfully in Singapore  and  to

support  a  small  family. Unless  a  work  permit

holder  has  adjusted to the different and  faster

pace of life in Singapore's highly disciplined and

urbanised society, marriage between a work  permit

holder  and  a  Singapore  citizen  can  lead   to

difficulties for themselves and for Singapore.  In

processing     applications     for     marriages,

consideration  must therefore be  given  to  these

factors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 30th November, 1973, the Commissioner for

Employment  has  approved  a  total  of  702  such

applications. 792 others were rejected because the

work permit holders were unskilled and working  in

Singapore  for  too  short  a  period   prior   to

application.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, hon. Members may wish to note

that  no approval is required in marriages between

work permit holders where Singapore citizenship or

permanent  residence in Singapore is not  acquired

nor  desired. Furthermore, applications from  work

permit  holders who are skilled or who  have  more

than   five   years'  continuous   employment   in

Singapore will be favourably considered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, can the Minister say whether applications

will be approved for those work permit holders who

want to give up their work permits and who want to

marry local citizens?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, the answer is "No".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a

Malaysian girl applied for a work permit,  but  it

was  not  approved. A Singapore citizen  wants  to

marry this girl, but the application was rejected.

Can  the Minister give reasons why the application

for marriage was not approved?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, if the Member can submit

that case to me, I will certainly look into it.  I

would  also  like  to ask him whether  the  girl's

intention of coming to Singapore is to work or  to

get married.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, she wants to get married

in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> In that case, she should not

have applied for a work permit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

fully agree with the Minister for introducing this

regulation.  But I would like to ask him  why  has

the  regulation  been made retroactive.  When  the

regulation  came  into force on  1st  July,  1973,

those  people who had already contracted to  marry

before that date, applied to the Commissioner  for

Employment  for  approval, but their  applications

were  rejected.  I  want  to  know  what  is   the

justification    for   making    the    regulation

retroactive.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as I am

aware,  I  have  not rejected any of  those  cases

where the applicants have made arrangements to get

married,  i.e, if  they  have  made  bookings  of

restaurants,  and  if  they have  spent  money  on

furniture  and all sorts of things connected  with

the proposed marriages.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, I have even come across a

case where the girl is already pregnant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, that shows a lack of

discipline  on  the  part of the  couple.  If  the

couple can show to the Commissioner for Employment

that   they   have  already  made  the   necessary

arrangements, I think favourable consideration may

be given.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, never mind the discipline.

Everybody  makes mistakes. The fact is  that  this

couple  had contracted to marry before  1st  July,

1973.  And  when this regulation came into  force,

all  those who wanted to marry foreigners  had  to

get   the   approval   of  the  Commissioner   for

Employment. So the couple went to the Registry  of

Marriages and the Registrar referred them  to  the

Commissioner  for Employment, who turned  it  down

without finding out whether the contract was  made

before or after the 1st of July, 1973. This is the

point I am making: How can, the Minister make  his

regulations retroactive?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, if the Member can submit

his  case to me, I will look into it. If the whole

intention is to beat the deadline by submitting an

application for marriage even though there was  no

intention  originally, then I  think  we  have  to

think twice before giving approval.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, this is not the fault of the

people  who want to beat the deadline because  the

announcement  was made earlier than the  effective

date  of the regulation. Naturally, those who  had

already contracted to marry wanted to apply before

1st  July,  1973.  Therefore, since  they  applied

before  1st  July, I just want  to  know  why  the

Minister turned them down.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Bras  Basah kept on repeating that the couple  has

contracted  to marry before the date.  As  I  have

said,  if  the  couple has already  contracted  to

marry  before  1st  July, then  approval  will  be

given. I have not rejected any such case.

<div align="center"><b>MULTI-STOREY STRUCTURES FOR PIG FARMING AT SEMBAWANG</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National Development if he will give  details

of  the  occupation  licences, rentals  and  other

conditions for premises in the proposed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>

Sembawang Field Station.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a piece of

State  land at Bah Soon Pah Road to the  north  of

the   Primary  Production  Department's  Sembawang

Field Experimental Station has been set aside  for

pig  farming.  The land has been sub-divided  into

eight  lots  of about five acres each. These  lots

will be let out to interested pig farmers on a 30-year  lease at an annual rent of about $1,600  per

acre,  which amounts to about six per cent of  the

freehold  value of the land at about 60 cents  per

square  foot. It will be a condition of the  lease

that the development of the land must be completed

within  two  years from the date of possession  of

the  site.  Lessees are expected to employ  modern

intensive farming techniques, and preference  will

be  given  to  those who make use of  multi-storey

structures   and   efficient  methods   of   waste

disposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Production Department will soon be

inviting  applications, and further  details  will

then be supplied to interested applicants.

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD ESTATES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Overcrowding of Cars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National  Development  how  the  Housing  and

Development   Board   intends   to    solve    the

overcrowding  problem  of car  population  in  the

existing  housing  estates of the  Board  and,  in

particular,  the problem of the current  overspill

of  car  parking on to public roads caused by  the

Board's  recent  introduction of the  paid-parking

system in Toa Payoh New Town.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in recent

years,  the  car ownership population in  existing

Housing  Board  estates  has  increased   due   to

increasing affluence. However, it is not  feasible

for the Housing and Development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>



Board to cater for the parking needs of every  car

owner  who  lives  in  a Housing  Board  flat.  To

alleviate the situation, paid parking of cars  has

been  introduced  progressively in  Housing  Board

estates.  This  should  ensure  more  orderly  and

systematic parking of cars and prevent  misuse  of

the  car parks. The parking fees in Toa Payoh  New

Town  at  20 cents per hour, or for season tickets

at $15 per month day-and-night, are reasonable and

not  beyond  the means of car owners. Car  parking

will  not  be  allowed to overspill on  to  public

roads. Car ownership may eventually require  proof

of  a car parking space either in a parking lot or

private   garage.   Meanwhile  the   Housing   and

Development Board, in conjunction with the Traffic

Police,   is   looking   into   the   problem   of

overspilling and to get these cars off the  public

roads on to parking lots.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in  view of the apparent inadequate  parking

facilities in certain areas in Toa Payoh, will the

Minister  be prepared to ask the Housing Board  to

consider allowing season parking ticket holders as

well  as short term period ticket holders to  park

within   Toa   Payoh  Town  itself,  rather   than

restricting them to certain parking lots only? The

Housing   Board  should  also  prohibit   lorries,

trailers and buses from parking in the various car

parks  in  Toa  Payoh. I am sure this  restriction

will, to some extent, relieve the parking problems

in Toa Payoh New Town as a whole.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Consideration will certainly be given

to the suggestion of the Member for Toa Payoh. But

I  think I have to repeat what I said earlier  on,

and that is basically the car ownership population

has  increased considerably and the  Board  cannot

cater for the parking needs of every car owner.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Sir, I thank the

Minister  for the answer. Obviously, the  planning

assumptions in the existing Housing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>



and  Development Board estates on  which  the  car

parking   provisions   were   based   have    been

outstripped by the rapid growth of car  ownership.

There  is  insufficient  car  parking  space -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ong, are you asking a supplementary

question, or are you proposing a vote of thanks to

the Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, I am coming to my

question.  The overspill problem that I  mentioned

earlier  on is due to the insufficient  number  of

parking   spaces  provided  by  the  Housing   and

Development Board in their estates, based on these

wrong  planning assumptions. This problem is  also

partly  due  at  the very outset to  the  lack  of

planning and control on the allocation of  parking

spaces  in  HDB estates. Therefore, I am wondering

if  the Minister would in future take into account

the  car  ownership  when making  allocations  for

Housing Board flats.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> By that, does the Member mean that if

a  person  owns a car he is entitled to a  Housing

Board flat?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> No, Sir,If the Housing Board

is providing, say, only 200 car parking spaces for

every  three  blocks of flats  and  allocation  of

flats   is  made  without  consideration  of   car

ownership,  then when the people move  in  with  a

total  of, say, 400 cars, obviously there is going

to be an over-spill problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> If what the Member means is that the

Housing Board must supply or build a car park  for

every  car  owner,  then I  say  he  has  got  his

priorities wrong. The job of the Housing Board  is

really  to build houses for the people. It  cannot

at  the  same  time build one car park  for  every

house  it  builds. That is the short  answer.  The

houses take priority. Some people say that "if you

live in a Housing Board flat, you should not own a

motor car!"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, this over-spilling is really

a  hindsight wisdom! But my question is: will  the

Housing  Board  in future take into  consideration

the  provision of sufficient car parking space for

the Housing Board tenants?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Again, the answer is not a question of

bad planning in the past. There has never been any

bad  planning. If the planning is such that  every

Housing Board flat owner deserves a car park, then

I say it is bad planning. But the planning has not

gone  that way. Due to rising affluence, the Board

is  trying its best to provide more car parks,  as

suggested by the Member for Bras Basah. Obviously,

the  Board  cannot build one car  park  for  every

occupier of a flat, whether owner or tenant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok (Boon Teck):</b> Sir, will the

Minister  consider allocating parking  spaces  for

those  who  require  to  use  vehicles  for  their

livelihood?  I  agree with the Minister  that  the

Housing  Board  cannot build car  parks  for  flat

owners  who  possess cars, but I think that  those

who   are  required  to  use  vehicles  for  their

livelihood deserve consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I can put the Member's suggestion to

the Board. But many people require the use of cars

or  vehicles - some for business and some to go to

work.  So  where  do we go from  there.  It  is  a

question of priority. If someone uses his mini-bus

or lorry for business, is he entitled to priority?

If  he says "yes", another Member says, "Throw the

lorry out."

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  (a) if be is aware that after the lifting

of  import duty on certain goods, those goods  are

still being sold at high prices, and if he intends

to look into the matter; and (b) on how many kinds

of  goods  has import duty been lifted  since  1st

January,  1973; what has been the loss in revenue;

and what has been the benefit to consumers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I propose to answer  the  Member's

questions in reverse order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since January this year, the import duties on 151

items  have  been  lifted. These are  mainly  food

items,   building   and  construction   materials,

household  goods and other consumer products.  The

Government  will lose approximately $19.6  million

annually  in revenue. The consumers, on the  other

hand, should benefit both in terms of lower prices

in  some of the imported commodities and a greater

variety  and  regularity  of  supplies.  In  other

cases,   where   the  duties  have   been   mainly

protective in nature, the prices of goods of local

manufacture   could  also,  because  of   possible

competition from imports, be significantly lowered

to the benefit of consumers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, the prices of imported goods should be

cheaper at least to the extent of the duties which

have been removed. In practice, importers who have

paid  duty  on  existing stocks and  do  not  face

immediate competition from other importers may not

be  willing to reduce prices immediately. I  would

expect   importers,   however,   in   their    own

enlightened self-interest, to reduce prices on new

stocks  which are no longer subject to  duty.  The

Department  of Trade is keeping a close  watch  on

the  prices  of  goods on which duties  have  been

lifted,  and  if  the prices are not  reduced  the

importers will be required to explain why.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Importers, who are competing against local

manufacturers and have not been importing  in  the

past  because of the duty, may need some  time  to

establish  fresh  links with  overseas  suppliers.

When   such  links  have  been  established,   the

Government  expects that prices in Singapore  will

at least be comparable to international prices. It

is  heartening to note that prices of some of  the

imported items which are no more subject to import

duties have gone down by 10 to 30 per cent, but in

other cases the prices have remained high or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>



even increased because of the world wide shortage

and increasing cost of production.

<div align="center"><b>USE OF PETROLEUM AND ELECTRICITY BILL</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>First Reading</b></div>

<br><br>2.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to introduce a Bill intituled

"An  Act  to  make  temporary  provision  for  the

imposition   of   restrictions  on   the   supply,

distribution    and   use   of    petroleum    and

electricity."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill read the First time.



<div align="center"><b>Second Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Second Reading, what day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Now, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency signed by the President in

respect  of the Bill, laid upon the Table  by  the

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill distributed to Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the gloomy reading in the news these

days,  Members of the House will need no  reminder

of  the  grave  situation facing  many  countries,

including  Singapore, as a result of the reduction

in   oil   production  by  Middle  East  producing

countries.   While   we   must   all   hope   that

international discussions in the near future  will

lead  to  some  alleviation of the  situation,  it

would  be foolhardy to assume that there  will  be

any  early  resumption of the normal  supplies  of

petroleum  products to consuming  countries.  Many

countries  in  the  world have  already  begun  to

introduce  compulsory  measures  to  conserve  all

energy  resources. Singapore itself has started  a

Save Energy Campaign, with active participation by

the public, the Public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>



Utilities  Board  and all the oil  companies.  But

while  there has been a useful drop of electricity

consumption  since the start of the  campaign,  we

have  not achieved anything like the 12 to 13  per

cent  savings  required by the  present  level  of

restriction in petroleum supplies. We must  expect

this  level  to  go progressively  higher  in  the

coming   months.  It  is  clearly  unlikely   that

voluntary  restraints alone would be effective  in

cutting down the often unnecessary consumption  of

energy  to the desired extent. Compulsory measures

must therefore be considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government already has certain powers under

various Acts enacted by Parliament. The Control of

Essential  Supplies Act, 1973,  approved  by  this

House  at  its  last  sitting,  gives  powers  for

control  of the domestic sale, including  possibly

rationing, of essential commodities but it is  not

entirely suitable for the control of petroleum and

electricity  consumption. Under the Petroleum  Act

also,  action  can  be taken against  hoarders  of

petroleum.  Under the Public Utilities Board  Act,

measures to restrict the use of electricity can be

imposed.   And   under  the  Road   Traffic   Act,

prohibition  on  the use of public  roads  can  be

introduced. But these Acts will have to be amended

if,  as  announced in Government's press statement

sometime  ago,  compulsory  measures  to  conserve

energy  have to be implemented and heavy deterrent

penalties  imposed,  such  as  the  suspension  of

driving  licences and the cancellation of  vehicle

licences. It is desirable, therefore, that all the

necessary  measures  to  cope  with  the   current

situation be provided under a single Bill and  not

by amendments to several existing Acts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before the House will provide the

Government  with the necessary powers to  restrict

the  supply, distribution and use of petroleum and

electricity.  It also provides for the  imposition

of severe penalties for the prohibited use of cars

or  hoarding  of  petrol or the excessive  use  of

electricity.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>



Penalties include the cancellation of vehicle  and

driving  licences and the cutting off or reduction

of  electricity supplies to premises. Offences may

be compounded however, in appropriate cases, for a

sum not exceeding $500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public need have no fear that the wide

powers  under  the  Bill will  be  permanent.  The

sweeping  measures contained therein are  intended

for use only during the current energy crisis, and

it  is therefore provided that the Act will be  in

force  for an initial period of one year only.  It

can,  however, be extended for one year at a  time

if the situation so demands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, today, we

have  to consider this emergency Bill. We have  no

choice  but to accept it if we want to  avoid  the

dark days ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time last year, we did not anticipate

that an energy crisis would occur and would affect

many   developing  countries.   We   were   making

tremendous   progress  both  in  our  social   and

economic  fields. But now, because of this  energy

crisis,  our economic growth for the coming  years

is going to be bleak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill appears to be drastic as restrictions

are   provided  for  the  use  of  petroleum   and

electricity.  However,  looking  at  the   world's

supply  of oil, it is apparent that the supply  of

oil  will  never meet the demand of the  consumers

even  if  the producing countries were to increase

their exports in later years. I wonder whether the

Minister  has  any  plans  to  obtain  alternative

sources, like building a tidal barrage in the  sea

to  generate  electricity, or to  utilise  gaseous

vapours as substitutes for petroleum for our daily

requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistics have shown that our major oil users

are as follows: electricity 45 per cent; transport

38  per  cent;  industry 14 per cent and  domestic

heating 3 per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>



cent.   Our   main   users  are  electricity   and

transport,   while  the  industrial  sector   only

utilises  14 per cent. We must be careful  not  to

restrict  the industrial sector too much  or  else

our economy will be greatly hit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the implementation of the law should be

carried out carefully. We should not be penny-wise

and  pound  foolish, because there may be  avenues

where  a  small percentage of oil and  electricity

may  be  saved but in terms of production  we  may

lose heavily. On the other hand, there may also be

areas  where electricity and petroleum are heavily

used, but the profits are nominal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst implementing the Act, consideration

should  also be given to the safety of  our  shift

workers  in the factories and industries  who  may

have to go to work in blacked-out streets. In this

regard  more security personnel should be provided

in those blacked-out streets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  view of the importance of conserving fuel  and

the   need   to   cut  down  the  consumption   of

electricity, it appears to me that the  Government

is not setting a positive lead. Take this Chamber,

for  instance. Do we need to light  up  these  two

chandeliers? Why has this Chamber always got to be

kept  cold at this temperature? And I think  there

must  be a great number of Government offices air-conditioned to a pretty low temperature. We should

set  an  example. These two chandeliers are merely

for  ornamental  purposes. There  are  also  other

areas  where electricity can be saved. Why  should

our  television  programmes  still  go  on  to  12

midnight? Cannot we cut them short to 10.00 p.m.?



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I would like to join this debate  by

making a particular appeal to a special sector  in

our  society. It is perhaps unfortunate that  this

Bill  has  to  be passed in this Chamber.  But  it

serves  to emphasise the gravity of the crisis  in

the world at the moment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>



While  there is no cause for panic, Sir,  I  think

there  is  need for many of us to tune in  to  the

disorders   of   the  day  resulting   from   this

international  oil crisis and grasp their  meaning

in so far as they relate to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us have benefited from a bouyant economy

in recent years which resulted from investment and

industrial  activity in the State. With  affluence

and  additional  income,  people  sought  to  gain

higher  standards of living and, in  fact,  gained

them.  In  transport, the scooter, the motorcycle,

the  car, has been bought. In home convenience and

comfort,  the electric oven, the washing  machine,

the   vacuum  cleaner,  the  air  cooler  or  air-conditioning  plant, has been  bought.  Additional

lighting   for  sophisticated  effects  has   been

installed,  complete with solid state stereophonic

system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A high standard of living means a high

consumption  of fuel and electrical power.  It  is

imperative that our industries do not drag and  it

is  also  imperative  that the  entire  industrial

infrastructure supporting our economy is fed  with

sufficient  energy  in  order  that  it   operates

smoothly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to help ensure this situation, Sir,

those  of  us who have benefited from the  economy

and  become  high fuel and energy consumers  as  a

result  of  being  able  to afford  cars,  energy-consuming   appliances,   comfort   devices    and

amusement  gadgetry,  should  be  the   first   to

restrain  ourselves in our daily manner and  tempo

of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only does the Government accept this but I

think  I  may say that the greater number  of  the

less  well-off  people  expect  such  self-imposed

restraints from those who can afford to bear  such

restraints.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a compact nation and should easily jell

around  a  slogan  for  survival  to  achieve  the

necessary measure of social discipline in the face

of  national threats or difficulties. I think here

lies  a strength peculiar to ourselves with  which

we  can  withstand hardships falling upon us  from

time to time. Our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>



experience  has  shown that  collectively  we  can

respond  and  discipline to national difficulties.

We  have done so in regard to the 1971 anticipated

recession,  the  Employment Act, National  Service

and flat-dwelling in urban conditions. And we have

responded to these difficulties satisfactorily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need but to retain in us a sober and rational

approach  to  national problems,  and  if  we  are

prepared  to  transcend beyond  self-interest,  we

should  be able to contain the difficulties  ahead

of us.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

just  want  to  say  a few words  to  balance  any

impression  that may have been perhaps unwittingly

conveyed by the hon. Member for Jalan Kayu.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with him entirely that Government should

take  a  lead  in  setting the example  of  saving

electricity, and that this should start  with  the

various  Ministries, Government offices, statutory

boards,  and  so  on.  But  where  Parliament   is

concerned,  I would like to correct the impression

that  perhaps this institution is not  setting  an

example.  If anybody were to come here on  a  non-sitting day, he will have to grope his way through

dark  passages and feel the presence  of  a  musty

odour affecting him wherever he goes, because  all

the  lights  and the air-conditioning  are  turned

off.  In  this case, Mr Speaker, Sir, I think  you

are  also  at  a  disadvantage  because  the  air-conditioning here is turned on for one hour only a

day   and   you  have  to  work  in  these   musty

conditions.  I say this, Sir, just to correct  any

wrong  impression that may have been  conveyed  to

the public by reference to this Parliament.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, I would like to ask

the  Minister a few questions. To what extent  are

we  dependent  on  the Middle  East  for  our  oil

supplies, and what efforts have been made  by  the

Government  to  look  for alternative  sources  of

supply? The next question



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>



is: Has the Government sought the co-operation  of

the  Malaysian  Government  for  such  alternative

sources of supply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am much

obliged to all the Members of this House who  have

spoken   and   given  us  their   views   on   the

conservation of energy. It is very necessary  that

all  of  us pay attention to the requirements  for

saving  which  will  be necessary  in  the  coming

months.   I  am  therefore  gratified  that   this

particular  Bill has attracted so much comment  in

the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the various questions which have

been  asked,  I think one which has  received  the

attention of more than one Member is the  question

of  whether we can have alternative energy sources

and   whether  we  can  formulate  any  plans  for

replacing  petroleum  as the  energy  source.  The

answer to this is, in the short-term, "No" because

-  and this is in answer to another question - the

main  sources of oil supplies come from the Middle

East.  Of  course,  there are some  supplies  from

nearer  Singapore,  but the amount  is  relatively

small,  and  the proportion of energy which  comes

from oil is also very high. The amount that we can

get   from  wood  or  charcoal  is  really   quite

negligible. In the long term, of course, it  would

be  to  Singapore's advantage to try and diversify

our  sources  of supply and I have no  doubt  that

this  is  a matter to which we ought to give  some

attention.  The  Public  Utilities  Board  and  my

Ministry have, between them, set up a committee to

study  the  feasibility of setting  up  a  nuclear

power  station. This will to some extent  help  us

lessen  our  dependence on oil as  the  source  of

energy  for Singapore. There is also a possibility

that  coal  may be used and may be  fired  in  the

boilers  for  the power station.  But  this  is  a

matter  which, I have no doubt again, my  Ministry

and  the  Public  Utilities Board will  give  some

attention in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the various comments on the need

for    ensuring    that   Government,    including

Parliament,   should  take   the   lead   in   the

possibilities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>



of reducing electricity consumption, I should like

to  say  that  it  is  really necessary  that  the

business of Singapore should be carried on  and  I

would  suggest that the business of Parliament  in

the  passing of this Bill is as important  as  any

other  activity  in  trying to reduce  electricity

consumption in Singapore. But I quite  agree  with

the  Member for Jalan Kayu and other Members  that

it  is very necessary that we should always be  on

the   look-out  for  ways  and  means  of   saving

electricity, for example, raising the  temperature

of  rooms  cooled by air-conditioning and  thereby

saving electricity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with the Member for Serangoon

Gardens  that  with  our very  high  standards  of

living  and  perhaps a very lavish use of  energy,

which  is  a  manifestation  of  our  standard  of

living,  we can all afford to make some  sacrifice

against our high standards of living. This is,  in

fact,  the  position in many other very  developed

countries in the world to-day. I also concur  with

him  that  in  a cohesive and homogeneous  society

like  Singapore's,  we ought to  be  able  to  co-ordinate our efforts in the campaign to save a lot

more energy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered all the questions,

except perhaps those raised by the Member for  Toa

Payoh.  I  think his first question was, "What  is

our   dependence  on  the  Middle  East?"  I  have

answered  that we are almost wholly  dependent  on

the  Middle  East oil for our sources  of  energy.

What alternatives have we got? It is possible,  of

course,  that  the sources nearer Singapore,  i.e.

Indonesia and Malaysia, may be available. I  think

suggestions  had  already  been  made   by   ASEAN

countries  that additional supplies of oil  should

perhaps   be  made  available  first   to   ASEAIN

countries.  But  in regard to his question  as  to

whether   we   have   approached   the   Malaysian

Government, the answer is no. I do not  think  the

Malaysian  Government  at  the  moment   has   any

additional  supply  of oil to spare.  If  they  do

have,  I  shall have no difficulties in making  an

approach to that Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, various measures need to be taken to curb

speculation in land and to keep prices  of  houses

for  our citizens within reasonable limits.  Quite

apart  from  the continuing need to  acquire  more

land  for  housing  as well as  for  other  public

projects,  it  will also be necessary  to  acquire

properties  left  undeveloped by  owners  who  are

obviously  speculating in land -  land  which  the

public   interest   dictates  should   be   better

utilized.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill

before  this House provides specifically  for  the

following  basic  changes  in  the  existing   law

relating to the compulsory acquisition of land: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) It freezes prices payable on acquisition of

land under the Act to the base of market value  as

at  30th  November, 1973, or at the dates  of  the

appropriate  Gazette notification under  the  Land

Acquisition Act, whichever is the least.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The market value of acquired land shall be

deemed  not to exceed the price which a bona  fide

purchaser  may reasonably be expected to  pay  for

the  land on the basis of its existing use and  in

anticipation of the continued use for the  purpose

designated  in  the Master Plan.  Zoning,  density

requirements and other restrictions imposed  under

the  Planning  Act  as  well  as  any  restrictive

covenant  in the title of the acquired land  shall

be taken into account in determining market value,

but  no  account  will be taken of  any  potential

value  of  the  land for any other more  intensive

use.  This  will  obviate  the  argument  that  is

sometimes  made where land has been  zoned  for  a

restrictive  use,  as  for example,  "public  open

space",   that   the  land  has  got  considerable

potential for development for residential or other

purposes. In future, such arguments based  on  the

hypothetical consideration that a future change of

zoning  or  use  will be granted by  the  Planning

Department will not be taken into consideration in

determining   the   compensation   payable    upon

acquisition.   Thus,  land  zoned   "Agriculture",

"Rural",  "Green  Belt" or "Unclassified"  at  the

time of acquisition, will be valued as such.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) In the acquisition of land used as burial

grounds,   for   the   purpose  of   compensation,

consideration in cash or kind already received  by

the  owner  of the acquired land by  the  sale  of

grave  plots,  will be taken into account.  Again,

any potential value of such land on the basis that

it  could  be  put to more intensive use  will  be

disregarded.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Other amendments tighten existing provisions

to    discourage   speculation   and    fictitious

transactions aimed at securing a higher value  for

such  land, or are redrafts of existing provisions

to make intentions more explicit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 2 of the Bill amends the definition

of "person interested" to provide that a statutory

tenant,  under  the Control of Rent  Act,  of  any

acquired  land  cannot claim any  compensation  on

account of acquisition of land. Attempts have been

made  before Collectors of Land Revenue to draw  a

distinction  between a "statutory  tenant"  and  a

tenant from month to month who, under the existing

provision,  is  not entitled to compensation.  Re-defining the section to specifically exclude rent-controlled tenants would make it abundantly  clear

that   such   persons   are   not   entitled    to

compensation,  and  would  therefore  reduce   the

number  of  claims made to the Collector  of  Land

Revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 provides for a hiatus in the law. A

notification  made  under section  3  of  the  Act

(which  is a notification that land is "likely  to

be  acquired"  for  a public purpose)  will  lapse

after a period of one year if not followed by  the

publication of a declaration of acquisition  under

section 5 of the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 provides for a new Collector of Land

Revenue  to continue to hold an inquiry which  was

previously held by another Collector, and  enables

the  new  Collector to lodge the  grounds  of  the

award  on  behalf  of another  Collector  who  has

ceased   to   hold  office.  This   amendment   is

administratively desirable as it would obviate the

need for inquiries to be held afresh consequent on

transfers of officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 provides for the cost of an appeal to

be   paid  by  the  appellant  if  the  appeal  is

withdrawn without any agreement being made by  the

parties thereto as to costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 repeals and re-enacts section 33 of the

Act   which  provides  for  the  matters   to   be

considered  by  the Appeals Board  in  determining

compensation  to be awarded for the land  acquired

under the Act.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the basic changes I mentioned

earlier   of   freezing   land   values   and   of

disregarding   potential  value,   the   following

changes are also made: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the actual earnings of a person affected by

acquisition  of his land, shall be disregarded  by

the  Board in assessing compensation for the  land

acquired;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the Board shall take into account any fees

for  costs relating to any survey, issue  and  re-registration of title, stamp duty and other costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 of the Bill amends section 34 of the

Act   to  provide  that  the  Board  in  assessing

compensation   shall   disregard   the   following

matters: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Oral or documentary evidence of any

conveyance,   assignment,   transfer   or    other

disposition  affecting the acquired  land,  unless

the   instrument   has  been  duly   stamped   and

registered  in  the Registry of  Land  Titles  and

Deeds  and  filed  with  the  Chief  Assessor   of

Property  Tax prior to the date of publication  of

the  declaration under section 5 of the  Act.  The

Appeals   Board   must  be  satisfied   that   the

conveyance,   assignment,   transfer   or    other

disposition  affecting the acquired land  is  made

bona  fide  and not for the purpose of  increasing

the  value of such property artificially  and  the

onus  of proving that the instrument was made bona

fide is placed on the appellant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Evidence of sales of comparable properties,

unless  the Board is satisfied that the sales  are

made  bona  fide and not for speculative  purposes

and  the onus of proving that the transactions are

made bona fide shall lie with the appellant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisions are designed to discourage

speculative  transactions and to  prevent  persons

from  making  claims  for higher  compensation  of

acquired   land  by  making  use  of  bogus   land

transactions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 enables the Collector of Land Revenue

to  serve  any notice under the Act on  any  agent

authorised  to  receive service on behalf  of  the

person named in the notice.

been taken.

<div align="center"><b>TIMBER INDUSTRY BOARD (INCORPORATION) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Timber Export Industry Board was established

in  1968 under the provisions of the Timber Export

Industry  Board (Incorporation) Act,  1966,  as  a

joint  Singapore-West Malaysian Board. It had  ten

members, three from Singapore and seven from  West

Malaysia.   These   members   were   drawn    from

representatives of the Government and  the  timber

industry from both sides of the Causeway.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During its existence, the Board did good work in

promoting,  regulating and  improving  the  timber

export  industry in both countries. It was  always

self-financing through cess collection on  exports

of  sawn timber and logs and the Singapore  Office

of  the  Board has till today a substantial amount

of liquid assets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This position has now changed to the extent that

the Malaysian Government on its own initiative has

decided  to have a separate Timber Board  for  the

timber industry of Malaysia only. Consequent  upon

this  decision, the Malaysian Government  repealed

the   Malaysian   Timber  Export  Industry   Board

(Incorporation)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>



Act, 1966, thus dissolving the joint Board. A  new

Malaysian  Timber  Industry Board  (Incorporation)

Act,  1973,  was passed and came into  force  with

effect from 1st June, 1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the Singapore industry is concerned,

it is encouraging to note the large and increasing

exports  of sawn timber. The f.o.b, value of  this

timber, both graded and ungraded, rose from  $67.9

million  in  1968 to $132.8 million  in  1972,  an

increase  of  95  per cent during  the  last  four

years.  Owing  to  an  unprecedented  demand   and

consequent  high  prices for this  commodity,  our

exports for the first six months of this year  for

sawn timber topped $140.5 million - more than  the

value  of  our  1972  exports.  In  view  of   the

importance  of the timber industry and  its  major

contribution   to  our  external  trade,   it   is

considered   that  it  should   continue   to   be

controlled and regulated by a statutory body as in

the case of the rubber industry. It will therefore

be  necessary for Singapore to establish  its  own

Timber Industry Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing Timber Export Industry Board

(Incorporation) Act, 1966, the now  defunct  joint

Board  was  responsible  only  for  problems   and

operations affecting the export of sawn timber and

logs  only.  It  is proposed, however,  under  the

present   Timber  Industry  Board  (Incorporation)

Bill, that the functions of the new Board will  be

extended  to cover all matters pertaining  to  the

timber  industry, which include not only logs  and

sawn   timber  but  also  veneer,  plywood,   wood

mouldings and other wood products.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides for the establishment of a

Timber  Industry Board which shall  consist  of  a

Chairman,  a Deputy Chairman and eight members  to

be   appointed  by  the  Minister.  Of  the  eight

members,  four  will represent the Government  and

four  the  timber  industry.  There  will  be  one

representative each from the Singapore Sawmillers'

Association,  The  Singapore  Plywood  and  Veneer

Manufacturers' Association,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>



the  Singapore  Timber Exporters' Association  and

the Singapore Manufacturers' Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also provide for the establishment

of  "The Timber Industry Board Fund of Singapore".

Income  for this Fund will come mainly  from  cess

collections  levied on the export of  sawn  timber

and  logs. It is not proposed to vary the existing

rate  of 55 cents per cubic metre for sawn  timber

and  45  cents per cubic metre for logs.  The  new

Board  will  have,  as its share  from  the  joint

Board, liquid assets of $1.45 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no change as far as staff matters

are  concerned  except that the present  Assistant

Secretary  of the joint Board will be renamed  the

Executive Secretary of the new Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also provides for the new Board to

make  rules and regulations to govern its  day-to-day  functions and to submit its Annual Report and

Accounts to Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Timber

Industry  Board (Incorporation) Bill is  a  timely

measure,  being much more comprehensive  in  scope

than    the    Timber   Export   Industry    Board

(Incorporation) Act which is now to be repealed. A

fundamental defect of the existing legislation  is

that  it confines itself, as the Minister has just

said, to the regulation of timber export.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed legislation, I am happy to note,

has done away with the impractical distinction  of

regulating  timber for export and ignoring  timber

for  local consumption. All timber sold, processed

or  manufactured in Singapore, whether for  export

or  local  use, are henceforth to come within  the

purview  of  the  proposed  Bill.  Similarly,  the

registration   of   timber   exporters,   graders,

suppliers,  packers or manufacturers  -  that  is,

everyone who has anything to do with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>



the  timber  trade  or  industry  in  Singapore  - provides  a  firm basis for the proper control  of

the timber trade or industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My only regret is that, under clause 4 of the

Bill,  the  proposed Board seems to be constituted

of  the representatives of the Government and  the

timber    exporters,   suppliers,    packers    or

manufacturers.  The Second Schedule  to  the  Bill

lists out the four recognised associations for the

purpose  of clause 5 of the Bill. Nowhere  in  the

Bill   has   any  reference  been  made   to   the

representation  of  the  interest  of  the  timber

graders in the proposed Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it would not be practical for the proposed

Board  itself  to  employ all the  timber  graders

required in the timber industry in Singapore, most

of  the graders would be and are, in fact, in  the

service   of   the  timber  exporters,  suppliers,

packers or manufacturers themselves. As such,  the

timber  graders represent a vital group of persons

in  the  timber  industry who  can  make  positive

contributions towards the further improvement  and

rationalisation of the timber industry. But at the

same  time they also constitute a body of  persons

who  are extremely vulnerable to any conflict that

may  arise between the interest of their employers

and  the  objective  of the proposed  Board.  Many

timber  graders  are  members  of  a  trade  union

affiliated  to the National Trades Union  Congress

for  their  own  protection.  Under  the  Bill  it

appears   that   whatever   scant   trade    union

recognition  or protection the timber graders  may

presently have would not be given expression to in

the proposed Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the hon. Minister for

Finance would be able to give an assurance that  a

member  would be appointed under clause 4 (1)  (a)

of  the  Bill  to  represent  the  timber  graders

indirectly  through  the NTUC  or,  alternatively,

since there are provisions for five members to  be

appointed under clause 4 (1) (b), to list the NTUC

as  the fifth recognised association in the Second

Schedule to the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am happy to note that important

changes  have been made by this Bill which,  among

other things, repeals the existing legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to speak on the question of timber

grading in Singapore. In the past, as the Minister

has  mentioned, timber grading was  based  on  the

criteria  set down in Malaysia. Sources of  timber

for  Singapore  are diversified. We cannot  solely

depend on Malaysia for our timber supply. In fact,

over  the past few months we have imported  timber

from   Indonesia  and  other  sources.  Sir,  some

sawmillers  have made representations to  me  that

timber  and logs from Malaysia and Indonesia  have

different  criteria for grading. As a  result,  if

our  local timber graders are to grade the  timber

from Indonesia according to the criteria laid down

in  Malaysia, there will be difficulties. In fact,

difficulties  have  been faced,  and  I  hope  the

Minister will take note of this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I note and

welcome  the  Member for Toa Payoh's  support  for

this   Bill.   With  regard  to  his  comment   on

representation,  I  will consider  whether  timber

graders  should also be represented on the  Board.

As  he  has  pointed out, there is  provision  for

adding  to the number of representatives,  and  it

may  be that, after investigation, there is reason

also to appoint a representative of timber graders

on the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member for Bukit Panjang, I

noted his suggestion about timber grading and  the

fact  that it is based on Malaysian timber. I will

take   note  of  his  suggestion  for  the  future

operations of the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion* standing in my name as it appears on the Order Paper.

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The motion read as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Parliament in accordance with

section  4  of  the Foreshores Act (Chapter  270)

approves  the reclamation by Government of  those

portions  of  the  foreshore  and  seabed  around

Pulau   Seraya,  Pulau  Seburus  Luar  and  Pulau

Seburus   Dalam  containing  a  total   area   of

approximately  386 acres as shown coloured  green

on  the plan marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN

NO.  11173",  which  is  deposited  in  the  Land

Office, Singapore.'

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is proposed to reclaim the foreshore

around Pulau Seraya, Pulau Seburus Luar and  Pulau

Seburus  Dalam, thereby amalgamating  these  three

small  islands with deep water frontage, into  one

large island to provide sites in the most economic

manner for petrochemical companies wishing to  set

up  operations in Singapore. The development  will

not  only create a comprehensive oil refining  and

petro-chemical complex in the Southern Islands but

will also provide the Jurong Town Corporation  and

the  Port  of Singapore Authority with a  suitable

dumping ground for surplus dredged materials  from

the  Corporation's port extension projects as well

as  the  Port  of Singapore Authority's  projects,

including dredging of nearby navigation channels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed reclamation will cover an area of

approximately 386 acres of the foreshore, as shown

coloured green on the plan marked as "LAND  OFFICE

RECLAMATION  PLAN NO. 11/73", a copy of  which  is

displayed  in  the Library of this House  for  the

information  of Members. The reclamation  cost  of

$26  million  will  be borne by  the  Jurong  Town

Corporation  which will undertake the  development

as agents of the Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1403</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On completion of works, the reclaimed land will

be  proclaimed as State land and alienated to  the

Corporation on terms and conditions to  be  agreed

with the Commissioner of Lands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reclamation proposal at Pulau Seraya,

however,    necessitates   the   acquisition    of

approximately  33  acres  of  the   private   land

therein.  Compulsory acquisition  proceedings  are

being  taken. Clearance of those affected will  be

undertaken  by  the  Resettlement  Department   in

accordance  with  its  present  policy.  The   350

inhabitants,  including  34  Temporary  Occupation

Licence  holders required to be cleared  from  the

island,  will  be  resettled by  the  Jurong  Town

Corporation  in  the  Corporation's   flats.   The

Corporation will also arrange for the clearance of

the  mosque  which  is  on a Temporary  Occupation

Licence,  the  Government primary school  and  the

community centre on the island.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270) approves the reclamation by Government of those portions of the
