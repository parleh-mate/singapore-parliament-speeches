<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Extension)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr R. Ravindran</b> asked the Minister for Communications

whether there are plans to extend the MRT line from the Boon Lay

MRT  station to the Tuas Second Link Bridge (Customs/Immigration

Checkpoint)  and,  if  so,  if he  will  indicate  the  date  of

completion of the extension line.



<div align="center"><b>LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT SYSTEM LINKING</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>BOON LAY MRT STATION TO JURONG WEST</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr R. Ravindran</b> asked the Minister for Communications

whether  there  are  plans to build a Light Rail  Transit  (LRT)

system  linking Boon Lay MRT station to the Jurong West  Housing

and   Development   Board  estates  encompassing   Jurong   West

Neighbourhoods 6, 7, 8 and 9 and, if so, if he will indicate the

date of completion of the LRT line.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr John Chen Seow</b>

<b>Phun) (for the Minister for Communications):</b> Sir, as Questions

1 and 2 are related, can I take them together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, the Land Transport Authority

(LTA)  has  assessed that an MRT line extension  from  Boon  Lay

Station  to the Second Link in Tuas is not operationally  viable

at the moment.  Neither will any benefit outweigh the high costs

of  the  construction of such an extension.   Nevertheless,  LTA

will   continue  to  monitor  the  situation  and   review   the

feasibility of this line regularly as part of its long-term rail

development  plan.  Under this plan, LTA has also been  studying

the  feasibility  of operating LRT systems in various  parts  of

Singapore.  The Jurong West housing estate is included  in  this

study.   Results of the study are expected to be  ready  in  two

years' time.

<div align="center"><b>CHINESE AND JAPANESE GARDENS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Free use by members of the public)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr R. Ravindran</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  whether  his  Ministry will consider  opening  up  the

Chinese  and  Japanese Gardens for free use by  members  of  the

public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Trade  and  Industry (Mr Tang Guan Seng) (for the  Minister  for

Trade  and  Industry):   The Chinese and  Japanese  Gardens  are

managed  as a business by Singapore Leisure Industries  Pte  Ltd

(SLI), which is a subsidiary of JTC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SLI has invested $12.5 million in the Gardens and incurs

about  $1  million  a year in operating expenses.   Despite  the

admission  charges  of $4.50 per adult and  $2  per  child,  the

revenue is insufficient to defray the operating expenses and SLI

has incurred a deficit of $240,000 in FY 97/98.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage the public to visit the Gardens more

frequently, SLI introduced in August 1997 a scheme of  unlimited

entry, except during special functions, at a nominal rate of $20

per  annum per person.  SLI will continue to review the existing

scheme and look into further measures to encourage public  usage

of the Gardens.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the Senior

Parliamentary  Secretary would appreciate that over-26  hectares

of  land are grossly underutilised and that very few people  use

it  other than on special occasions.  So I would like to ask the

Senior  Parliamentary Secretary whether, in view of the deficit,

he  will consider requesting for a grant from the National Parks

Board  and  open these two Gardens to members of the public  for

free use.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng:</b> Sir, at the moment, the profits f from

other  areas of SLI's commercial operations, such as  land  use,

land  lease  and landscape services, help to fund  the  Gardens'

deficit.   So there is no need to seek a grant from the National

Parks Board.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to another question raised by the Member, I would like

to  inform him that as the site has redevelopment potential,  it

is not advisable to turn it into a public park.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, how many people

visit the Chinese and the Japanese Gardens per month?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng:</b> I do not have the specific information

with  me now.  But as I said, it has been running at a loss  for

the last few years.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I share the

sentiment   of  Mr  Ravindran.   I  have  another  supplementary

question.   JTC is a big organisation.  Would it consider  as  a

public  service and community service, even if it is to  cost  a

few  million  dollars, to reduce the entrance  fees?  I  am  not

asking  that  we make it completely free but to  look  to  other

means such as leasing the property nearby to shops, food stalls,

etc.   I have been there quite a few times myself and I see that

it is not well patronised.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Rai, can you ask your question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> The question is: would the Ministry

consider reducing the charges further so that more people  could

enjoy  the  beautiful  facilities of both these  Gardens?   JTC,

being a Government organisation, should consider this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng:</b> As I mentioned just now, SLI will

continue  to review the existing measures and look into  further

measures to encourage more public usage of the Gardens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question [12th March, 1998],



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head O of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100." - [Dr Ong Chit Chung].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br>12.38 pm



<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b>

Sir,  may  I  continue with my response to  the  various  points

raised yesterday.  When we adjourned, I was responding to Dr Ong

Chit  Chung's question on the United Nations.  The second  point

he  had raised on the UN was with regard to our candidature  for

the  United Nations Security Council for the non-permanent seat.

He asked me for a progress report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that Singapore presented its

candidature  for the non-permanent seat in the Security  Council

for  the period 2001 to 2002.  The elections for that particular

vacancy  will  take place in the year 2000 and, if  elected,  we

hope  that  we  can bring a constructive and useful perspective,

shall  I  say,  a  small state perspective, to the  UN  Security

Council.   It is an important perspective because a majority  of

the  United Nations members are small states.  Participating  in

the UN Security Council will also allow Singapore to learn first-hand  how  the UN Security Council operates, both in its  formal

session  as  well as in the consultations.  Since  we  became  a

member  of  the United Nations in 1965, we have never served  in

the  UN Security Council which of course, in a sense, is at  the

very  heart  of the UN system.  So far, Singapore  is  the  only

declared candidate for the Asian group seat for the year 2001 to

2002.  Our candidature has been endorsed by ASEAN countries  and

many  other countries, both from within the Asian group as  well

as outside the Asian group, have expressed their support for our

candidature in writing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise that within our limited manpower and financial

resources, Singapore can do only so much at the United  Nations.

But let me assure the House that we will continue to do our part

as a responsible member of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>



UN  system and as a member of the international community.   And

that  is one of the reasons why we have sought the non-permanent

seat in the Security Council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may, Sir, proceed to the other points which were

raised  yesterday  and not answered.  First,  I  will  take  the

various comments which were made on Singapore-Malaysia relations

by  Dr  Ong Chit Chung, Mr Chiam See Tong, Mr Hawazi and  a  few

others.  First, to recap the events since we last discussed  the

situation in this House.  When we recall our last discussion  in

this  House,  it  was  in the context of still  fairly  strained

relations  between our two countries.  But on that  occasion,  I

did  say  that  there  were  some  encouraging  developments  to

indicate  that relations were slowly getting back to normal.   I

would  say  that since then there have been further  significant

developments in our bilateral relations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that in September last year, the

Malaysian Customs commenced stringent checks on lorries ferrying

goods  from  Malaysia to Singapore and vice versa.   An  adverse

effect of this move was the chronic vehicular congestion at  the

Causeway  that  lasted up to one month or so.  Fortunately,  the

situation  eased soon after the two Prime Ministers met  at  the

Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Edinburgh in October

1997 and they agreed that both sides should see how this problem

should be resolved early.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the recent developments? Since the two Prime

Ministers  met  in  October, they have  met  on  three  separate

occasions,  once  in January and twice in February,  the  latest

being 16th February when Prime Minister Goh visited Malaysia  in

Kuala  Lumpur.  Prime Minister Goh's visit to Kuala  Lumpur  was

significant  in  that it took place against a  backdrop  of  the

regional economic downturn which has been described as the worst

crisis faced by the region since the Second World War.  In  this

regard,  our Prime Minister's visit was a useful opportunity  to

continue  with  his  earlier  discussions  with  Prime  Minister

Mahathir,  the earlier discussions being held a few weeks  prior

to that in February



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>



as  well as on 20th January.  These discussions were focused  on

how  Singapore  and  Malaysia could  cooperate  closely  in  all

possible areas for mutual benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the interests of Singapore and Malaysia are closely

intertwined,  particularly in the economic area.  The  contagion

effect of the regional financial crisis has underscored this and

emphasised  the  fundamental  interdependency  between  regional

countries  and  the  need to cooperate.   Our  Prime  Minister's

visit, I believe, reflected the readiness of both Singapore  and

Malaysia  to  work towards realising the full potential  in  our

bilateral  relationship based on the principle  of  prosper-thy-neighbour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the discussions between Prime Minister Goh and Dr

Mahathir took place in a warm and friendly atmosphere.   And  on

the  whole, the visit was useful for both Singapore and Malaysia

because  both  sides  can  now build on  this  for  even  closer

relations.   I believe, Sir, that this is a direction  in  which

Singapore-Malaysia relations should continue to develop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outcome of the discussions between the two Prime

Ministers is reflected in a joint communique which was issued at

the  end  of  our Prime Minister's visit.  That joint communique

spells out several areas of proposed cooperation between the two

countries,  including  financial and economic  cooperation.   It

serves  also  to  highlight  the commitment  by  both  sides  to

redouble   efforts  to  resolve  several  outstanding  bilateral

issues, such as the long-term supply of water to Singapore,  the

development of Malayan Railway land in Singapore as well as  the

dispute  over Pedra Branca.  As stated in the joint  communique,

the agreements reached between the two Prime Ministers have laid

a  firm  foundation for both Malaysia and Singapore to cooperate

closely in the future.  We hope that progress can be made on the

outstanding issues.  This will help to maintain the momentum  in

bilateral relations.  So in response to the questions  posed  by

Dr Ong Chit Chung and others on bilateral relations, I would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>



say  that  bilateral relations are back on track,  and  this  is

evident from the joint communique.



<br>12.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do not wish to mislead Members into believing

that  we  have solved all the problems.  There are still  issues

that  remain  to  be  solved.  These  issues  cannot  be  solved

overnight.   However, I believe that our Prime Minister's  visit

and  the discussions between the two leaders have indeed laid  a

good  foundation  for  further  progress  to  be  made  on   the

outstanding bilateral issues.  And as Prime Minister Goh said to

the  press  after the visit,  it was a useful  visit.   In  this

improved  atmosphere  and common desire to enhance  cooperation,

both   sides,  I  believe,  can  now  better  manage   bilateral

relations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noted what Mr Chiam See Tong has said about the

possibility of an economic union between Singapore and Malaysia,

a point which he had made previously when he spoke in the debate

on  the  President's Address last year.  I understand the  basic

thrust  of  his  proposal, which is that  he  recommends  closer

economic  cooperation between Singapore and  Malaysia.   And  as

Members  are aware, the joint communique issued after the  Prime

Minister's  discussion has indeed mentioned that  Singapore  and

Malaysia  will intensify efforts to cooperate in  the  areas  of

banking  and finance, and all possible areas.  Efforts are  also

under  way  to encourage mutual investments in the key  economic

sectors  of  both  countries.   This  will  make  Singapore  and

Malaysia  stakeholders in each other's prosperity, to  cite  the

sentiments in the communique

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members in this House should also know that ASEAN

is  now working towards establishing a free trade area (AFTA) by

the  year  2003.   At  the moment, this is a  current  priority.

However, as for Mr Chiam's proposal of an economic union, and  I

am  no expert on this matter, I have no doubt that my colleague,

the Minister for Trade and Industry, would take note of this and

give it consideration within the broader context and desire of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>



closer  economic cooperation with Malaysia.  But we must  remind

ourselves, as Prime Minister Goh said last year in his reply  to

Mr  Chiam,  that such cooperation, of course, takes two  willing

parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the progress of various items in the communique, the

officials from both sides, I believe, will meet in the course of

the  next  few  weeks to follow up on the various items  in  the

communique.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam made reference to the question of the water

supply.  This has also been dealt with by Minister Lee Yock Suan

yesterday,  when  winding  up  on  the  Ministry  of  Trade  and

Industry.   To that, let me just add that, as reflected  in  the

joint  communique,  Dr Mahathir had agreed that  Malaysia  would

undertake  to  continue the supply of water to Singapore  beyond

the expiry dates of the existing 1961 and 1962 water agreements.

This general undertaking will be confirmed in an agreement to be

signed  within  sixty  days  from  the  issuance  of  the  joint

communique.   Officials from both countries, I understand,  will

be  meeting  in Kuala Lumpur on or around 9th April  to  discuss

this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had originally sought a full water agreement with

specific   terms  and  conditions.   Achieving  a   full-fledged

agreement   with  Malaysia  on  extending  the  existing   water

agreements  beyond the present expiry dates  of  2011  and  2061

would  help  not  only  in dismantling a  psychological  barrier

between  our two countries, but replace it with a new  framework

of   cooperation  for  mutual  benefit.   However,  Dr  Mahathir

indicated  that  he  was  unable  to  agree  to  a  full-fledged

agreement  at  this point of time.  He said that he  would  also

need  time to get the backing of state governments, as water  is

under state control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lacking a firm agreement that sets out explicitly and

comprehensively the terms and conditions for the supply of water

beyond  the present terminal dates, we will have, of course,  to

continue  to intensify our efforts to find new sources of  water

supply.   This is something, as mentioned on other occasions  in

this House, we have been actively doing over



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>



the  years, even though water is not of immediate issue for  us.

Currently,  desalination, of course, remains one salient  option

among several that are being explored.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn, Sir, to the comments and questions raised

by  colleagues on Singapore-Indonesia relations.  I would  first

speak  generally about bilateral relations since the House  last

met  in  the  Committee of Supply.  I would say  that  bilateral

relations generally are close and good.  Our ties with Indonesia

have  been built on a strong foundation based on common interest

in   many  spheres.   Relations  in  the  past  year  have  been

strengthened by regular exchanges of visits.  Our Prime Minister

and  President  Suharto have kept up their regular  meetings  to

discuss various issues.  In August 1997, some of our Members  of

this   House   visited  Indonesia  in  conjunction  with   their

independence day celebrations.  This is a good reflection of the

broad-based relationship between the two countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have also been concrete examples of close bilateral

cooperation.  One clear example was the difficult joint  search-and-rescue-cum-recovery  operations  in  the  aftermath  of  the

SilkAir  MI 185 tragedy at Palembang in December last year.   It

was heartening to see cooperation from the ministerial level  to

the  local authorities on the ground.  And the tragedy, while  I

believe  we certainly would have wished it had not taken  place,

had brought our two countries and people closer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But taking the situation as at present, we must recognise

that  Indonesia  is going through a difficult patch.   They  are

facing  economic  problems and a currency  crisis,  problems  of

drought,  shortage of food supplies, medicine,  etc,  and  there

have also been reports of sporadic unrest.  However, general law

and order have been maintained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we, in Singapore, must understand and empathise with

these  difficulties that the Indonesians are  experiencing.   We

are  concerned about the difficulties they face and we  will  do

our best to help them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>



overcome their difficulties.  As the Prime Minister has said, it

is  impossible for Singapore to close our eyes or fold our  arms

and  ignore the problems of our neighbours.  We should see these

problems in perspective.  Taking into consideration factors such

as their sheer geographical size and large population, Indonesia

would need time to tackle the financial crisis and stabilise its

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian government has to handle many competing

priorities, especially during the current economic difficulties.

But  the  problems  the  Indonesian  government  faces  are  not

insurmountable.  There are two reasons why I say  this.   First,

President  Suharto has begun his new term as  President  and  he

remains  in control of the situation.  We are confident that  he

will  make  some tough decisions to resolve the current  crisis.

As  Prime  Minister  Goh  said  in his  letter  to  congratulate

President  Suharto which was published recently, "Indonesia  had

faced  overwhelming difficulties and widespread poverty  in  the

past.    But  through  President  Suharto's  strong   will   and

leadership, Indonesia overcame them."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that the international community has

come  forward to assist Indonesia to stabilise its  economy  and

ameliorate  some  of the impact of the financial  crisis.   Yes,

there  may be differences in how the problems could be resolved,

but  I  believe that all concerned parties want to see Indonesia

recover  from  this  crisis by adopting the most  realistic  and

rational solutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in today's world, we see a series of cross border

linkages  bringing  countries  closer  together.   Strengthening

these  regional  or  global  linkages  will  be  beneficial  for

economic development.  In that regard, Indonesia is a vital link

in that chain for the region and for Singapore.  Indonesia is  a

key  strategic player in the region.  A politically  stable  and

economically  sound  Indonesia is therefore  important.   It  is

important not only for Singapore, it is important for ASEAN,  it

is important for the rest of the region and beyond.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with these considerations in mind that Singapore has

offered  a  contribution of US$5 billion loan to  Indonesia,  as

part of the IMF package.  Prime Minister Goh has also proposed a

multi-lateral  trade finance guarantee facility  for  Indonesia.

This proposal is awaiting responses from countries to which  the

Prime  Minister  has written, including the  G7  countries   US,

Canada, Japan, UK, France, Germany, Italy, as well as Australia,

Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Netherlands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, our assistance alone would not be effective. It

is  therefore  important  that we work  with  international  and

regional institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank, the Asian

Development Bank and other countries to assist Indonesia in  its

economic  recovery.  We are a small country.  Our assistance  is

within  the  constraints of our resources, and our US$5  billion

loan  package  and  our PM's proposal of a  multi-lateral  trade

finance guarantee facility for Indonesia should be seen in  that

light.   But  Singapore can play a catalytic role  in  proposing

workable ideas and getting others to join in doing more to  help

Indonesia.   In  other words, we try to play  a  supportive  and

constructive  role  alongside other countries  to  help  restore

confidence to Indonesia and to the region.  I hope that with the

international collective will and cooperation, Indonesia and the

rest  of  the  region will emerge out of the  regional  economic

crisis even stronger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to Dr Tan Boon Wan's comments about the

principle   of   non-interference,  and   how   do   we   tackle

transnational problems that affect various countries.   I  would

respond that we should and indeed we have always abided  by  the

principle of non-interference in the internal affairs  of  other

countries.  It is a principle that we should always uphold.  But

this  does  not preclude countries from helping one  another  or

formulating new mechanisms, and this was a point Dr Tan Boon Wan

asked  about  new  mechanisms.  It should not  prevent  us  from

formulating new mechanisms to ensure that problems like the haze

or  the  currency crisis do not recur.  In this  respect,  steps

have already been taken.  On the issue of the haze, for example,

Members have heard my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>



colleague, the Minister for the Environment, recently  tell  the

House  that the ASEAN Environment Ministers had met to look  for

ways to solve the problem.  Similarly, in the regional financial

situation,  ASEAN  leaders had met in December  to  discuss  the

issue.  A leaders' statement was subsequently issued.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, Singapore has offered its assistance to

which  I  have  referred.  Other ASEAN countries have  similarly

provided  assistance.  The ASEAN countries have  jointly  sought

solutions to the crisis.  Under the Manila Framework, six  ASEAN

countries   Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines,  Singapore

and Thailand  together with other Asia-Pacific countries such as

US,  China,  Korea,  Hong  Kong and Australia  have  agreed,  as

Members would have read in the press, on the need for a regional

surveillance mechanism for early detection of problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are indeed mechanisms for regional countries to

deal with such problems.  But to be realistic, I must admit that

we  cannot guarantee that such problems would not recur as there

are so many factors and causes involved.  On its part, Singapore

will  work  with the other countries to see how these mechanisms

can be strengthened in the future.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I turn to the two related questions asked by Mr

Shriniwas  Rai  about MFA's policy of diplomatic relations.   He

urged  that we have diplomatic relations with as many  countries

in the world as possible.  It is very difficult to disagree with

the  objectives  that  he  urges upon the  Ministry  of  Foreign

Affairs.    Presently,  Singapore  has  established   diplomatic

relations   with   some  149  countries.   I   would   say   our

considerations for establishing diplomatic ties are  three-fold:

first,  sometimes  we  are approached by another  government  to

establish  formal  diplomatic  ties.   Second,  to  do   so   is

consistent  with  our policy of cultivating  a  constituency  of

support from countries which are responsive to our interests  at

the  UN and other international forums.  Third, where we do  not

have  significant  bilateral relations with  other  governments,

there is merit in cultivating relations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I should explain to Mr Shriniwas Rai that in today's

world  of  diplomacy, the formality of entering into  diplomatic

relations is really not a condition precedent, i.  It is not  an

obstacle  or a bar to having interactions and having to  conduct

various relations with those countries.  In other words, it is a

formality that does not prevent visits, discussions and  so  on.

There  are  many  ways  in  which this  interaction  with  other

countries can be achieved, trade and economic linkages,  people-to-people  contact  and mutual support in international  forums.

So  the  fact that we may not have formal diplomatic  ties  with

some  countries  has never precluded us.  Indeed,  many  of  the

Foreign Ministers and other leaders have come to Singapore,  and

some  of  them  are from countries where we do not  have  formal

diplomatic ties.  I am not sure whether Mr Shriniwas Rai had  in

mind the formal act or whether he meant actually establishing  a

diplomatic  presence,  which  is of  course  a  different  thing

altogether.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1990, Singapore has formalised diplomatic relations

with  some  52  countries.  At the same time, we have  developed

ties   with  many  other  countries  with  which  we  have   not

established the formal act of diplomatic relations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about roving ambassadors. But in asking that

question, he was cognisant of the fact that, as a small country,

with  a developing foreign service, we just cannot have resident

ambassadors in many parts of the world.  So we establish a  non-resident ambassadors or roving ambassadors scheme as a means  of

expanding our diplomatic representation abroad.  When we appoint

non-resident  ambassadors, we do so after careful  selection  of

suitably qualified candidates.  I take his point that we  should

try to expand and build on this roving ambassadors.  We will try

to  do  so, but before the Government appoints more non-resident

ambassadors, we must ensure that we have the candidates who  can

adequately  and effectively represent the interest of  Singapore

in  the country of accreditation.  I should say that since  1991

we  have  appointed 14 non-resident or roving  ambassadors,  and

between the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>



14  roving ambassadors they cover 37 countries in Asia,  Europe,

Latin America and Africa and the Pacific.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I am obliged to

you  for  your  permission  to join in  the  discussion  of  the

Ministry  of  Foreign Affairs' budget.  My cut  relates  to  the

United  Nations.  Specifically, it is a suggestion  to  increase

Singapore's  financial contributions to United  Nations  and  UN

agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has risen in international profile. It has

demonstrated  increasing  political leadership  internationally,

commensurate with our economic development in the last  decades.

The  respect and success for our small nation has arisen because

of  our  pertinence, or relevance, and our  competence.   It  is

also,  largely  due  to  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  in

representing us abroad.  The United Nations has been  emphasized

by this Government as having a central role in giving a voice to

smaller  states like ours.  And Singapore, from my observations,

has  paid a constructive, helpful and supportive role at  United

Nations  and  other  international fora.  There  is  every  good

reason for Singapore to aim for a non-permanent Security Council

seat  in  the  UN.  Support, of course, Sir, has  many  aspects,

including  financial, which I am emphasising today.   I  respect

that  our first contribution must be in work and ideas.  I  come

to my question: should we contribute more on finance?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, Singapore has had a good record in paying up on

our  asscessed  contributions.  I turn then  to  our  record  in

voluntary contributions.  In reply to a question I submitted  at

a  previous sitting, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has  kindly

given  us  a 10-year series of how much Singapore has  given  to

United  Nations organisations.  Sir, to sum up the table,  which

is  in the records of Parliament, baseding on the last 10 years,

in   1988  we  gave  the  figure  of  US$305,230  only  to   one

institution,  United Nations Development Programme.   Ten  years

on, we gave US$390,000 to three organisations, again the bulk of

US$300,000 to the United



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>



Nations  Development  Programme.  Sir,  these  figures  are  not

adjusted for inflation and I think they show consistent, but  if

I   may   say,  stagnant  contribution,  which  is   no   longer

commensurate  with our increase in international  standing,  our

scope,  the  way  we play, and our ambitions over  the  last  10

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that this financial year will see an

increase.  Hence, my cut.  My proposal is that the sum should be

increased to agencies whose work is relevant to us, or  that  we

support in principle.  This is not a legal obligation but, if  I

may  say,   a moral expectation of what countries should  do  as

they  rise  in  international standing  and  economic  progress.

Developed  countries, as the Minister knows,  set  a  target  of

official  assistance  at  0.7%.   I am not  saying  that  figure

should  apply  to  us.  But I do urge the Minister  to  consider

setting  a base and then perhaps to increase it yearly according

to our own growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, my cut relates to the idea that specific agencies

should  be  better supported, in particular the  United  Nations

Environment  Programme.  Nothing is given in terms of  voluntary

contributions to this programme.  This programme  is  much  less

funded  than the United Nations Development Programme, which  we

largely  gave  to.   Yet, UNEP is of growing  relevance  to  the

international community and Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, Singapore joined in the four-country

initiative   for  the  environment  under  the   leadership   of

Chancellor  Kohl of  Germany.  With these other three countries,

Singapore has joined in calling for UNEP to play a larger  role.

UNEP  is  also  providing assistance to  have  an  international

conference in Singapore that will focus on model cities of which

I  and  others  believe Singapore is a good example.   UNEP  has

already  provided  assistance for the regional seas'  programme,

which  Singapore benefits from, being a major port in this area.

Very recently, the new Executive Director of UNEP has called for

this   institution  to  play  a  central  role   in   organising

international   attention  and  action  on  the  regional   haze

pollution, a problem that affects us.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I urge the Minister to consider that

Singapore  should increase voluntary financial contributions  to

the  United  Nations  as a whole, and United  Nations  agencies,

especially UNEP.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> With your permission, Sir, may I seek two

clarifications from the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the House agrees with the Minister's assessment of

the  situation with Malaysia.  I think Mr Chiam's suggestion  is

worthy  of  consideration and we should seriously  consider  it.

Perhaps  the  Government  may  want  to  set  up  a  Ministerial

Committee  to study how we could bring about an economic  union,

provided  the Malaysians are of the same mind.  In the  interest

of both countries, we should start afresh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware of the Prime Minister's regular visits to

Malaysia.   So  are  the Foreign Minister and  other  Ministers.

Could  we  institutionalise these visits?  We are  coming  to  a

stage  where  we  do not have many Ministers  in  the  Malaysian

Cabinet  who  have  studied in Singapore.   There  are   younger

Ministers  who have never been to either a Singapore  school  or

university.   So  it is important, both for the governments  and

the  civil  servants, to have regular dialogues.  As neighbours,

we  may  have our problem, but we should look at the  long  term

perspective in the interest of both countries.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> First, let me reply to Mr Simon Tay.

There  are  various ways in which you can look at the extent  of

our  contributions  to  United  Nations  organisations,  whether

mandatory or voluntary contributions.  The way Mr Simon Tay  has

looked  at it, he thinks it is not adequate and not commensurate

with  our  position or status and he, therefore,  calls  for  an

increase  in  contributions.  But in case he believes  that  our

contributions are inadequate, I would present a different way of

looking  at  it.  The fact is, firstly, we have over  the  years

increased our contributions.  But when we contribute, we  do  so

not  in order to solve the financial problems of that particular

international organisation but, more importantly, to demonstrate

Singapore's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>



support for that organisation for what they are doing and it  is

more  symbolic  of  support  and hopefully  will  trigger  other

countries to do so.  Really, large contributions have to be made

by other countries.  Let us remember that we are a small country

and  we  have  to  be realistic as to how much we  can  actually

contribute to international organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the 1997 UN handbook, there are more than 37

organisations within the UN system, and if you look at the  Year

Book  of  International  Organisations, there  are  some  13,600

international organisations.  Clearly, it is not possible for us

to   make  contributions  to  so  many  organisations.   So  our

approach  is: be selective, do what we can within our resources,

and  the objective is to show support for the UN system and  for

those organisations.  In that sense, we have traditionally  made

voluntary contributions to a number of UN related IOs, including

the UN Children's Fund, the UN Fund for  Women and the UNDP.  We

have  gradually increased it over the years.  It may not  be  of

the  frequency and the magnitude that Mr Simon Tay  would  want.

But  I  believe we have demonstrated Singapore's willingness  to

contribute to the international community as a country  that  is

mindful  of  our  role  and willing to perform  our  role  as  a

responsible member of the UN.  But to look at it really, we must

not forget that we also make contributions in other forms, which

are  very  difficult to quantify.  But if you ask the Ministries

and  the Ministry of Finance,  they can quantify it in terms  of

costs.   Our participation in UN related activities like  peace-keeping  operations,  that  is an important  contribution.   But

again, this is to show support for the system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay just now referred to the fact that we are

holding workshops, seminars and conferences.  Indeed, we do hold

conferences.   For the past three years, I have  been  guest-of-honour  at  seminars  and  workshops hosted  in  Singapore,  for

example, on peace-keeping.  There are certain  costs involved in

hosting that seminar.  I am sure that if I add up all the costs,

hospitality,  the  reception  we  have  given  and   the   local

transportation costs for all these conferences and workshops,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>



they can add to these figures, which I have not done so.  But it

is  a relevant factor.  It again shows our support.  In terms of

showing  our  willingness to perform our role, because  we  have

done  comparatively better than some other developing countries,

let  us  not  forget  our technical assistance  programmes.   Of

course, it is not a programme for contributions to international

organisations, but it shows your foreign policy stand, and under

our Singapore Cooperation Programme, which is bilateral, as well

as  through schemes which we tie up with other organisations and

countries, including the UNDP, World Bank, and so on.



<br>1.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-date, we have trained some 6,000 participants from 92

developing   countries,   under  various   types   of   training

programmes.   I think this is an important part of your  foreign

policy  objective.   How  else do you  support  the  UN  system?

Because  that is the way I look at it - contributions to support

the UN system.  I think we contribute to the UN system by paying

our  contributions  on  time.  And I  hope  Mr  Simon  Tay  will

sometimes  make  a  call for bigger nations,  whom  I  will  not

mention  specifically, to pay their contributions on time.   For

1997,  we paid US$1.7 million as our excess contribution to  the

UN's  regular budget, and US$314,000 to the peacekeeping budget.

Our   voluntary   contribution   to   UN-related   international

organisations  was about US$317,000.  Is it  a  lot?   Is  it  a

little?   It  depends  on how you look at  it.   It  was  a  27%

increase from our contributions in 1996.  Another US$182,000 was

made   to   non-related   international   organisations.     Our

participation  in  peacekeeping operations is  about  S$159,000.

And  the  Singapore Cooperation Programme, which I referred  to,

amounts to S$10 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if you look at it in financial terms,

Singapore's  contribution,  voluntary  and  mandatory,  just  as

administered by the Foreign Ministry - I emphasise that  because

some  other Ministries have similar programmes - was in the tune

of some S$15 million for 1997.  As I said,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>



other  than  MFA,  we have contributions to the  UN  Environment

Programme.  I take note that Mr Simon Tay would like this to  be

increased.  In 1997, we contributed US$15,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But apart from these contributions, I should also mention

there  are specific funds, such as the UNEP Trust Fund for East-Asian Seas.  For 1998, we contributed US$10,000.  And I am  told

that  the National Parks Board has also contributed S$15,000  to

the  Convention  on  Biological Diversity.   Primary  Production

Department  has  contributed  $10,577  for  the  Convention   on

International  Trade in Endangered Species  of  Wild  Fauna  and

Flora.  I do not know what else can be discovered from the other

Ministries.  But the point I want to make is, again, that,  yes,

we  can increase our contributions but we always have to bear in

mind  our  position and our resources.  And I think  within  the

constraints of our small size and limited resources, we have not

done badly in terms of our contributions to the UN system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Rai's comments on the economic union, I have nothing

further  to  add than what I have said to Mr Chiam, and  I  have

taken note of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to institutionalising links, there are various shapes

and forms in which countries can conduct relations.  And I think

between  Malaysia and Singapore, it is very fair for me  to  say

that  the different Ministries and different agencies have  very

good  contacts with each other.  The Ministers have good working

relations, not just with the Foreign Ministry, but also with the

communications,  as  well  departments  like  the   Police   and

Immigration  under the charge of my colleague, the Minister  for

Home  Affairs.  This has evolved over a period of years.  Do  we

want  to  change  it and have some institutional  system?   Some

countries  have  what  they call joint  commissions  which  meet

annually  at  specific dates.  So there are  various  forms.   I

think  from  my viewpoint, as Foreign Minister,  I  am  open  to

suggestions.   But  I  will pay emphasis to  the  substance  and

results, rather than form.  You can have form.  But it will be a

pity if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>



we have the form and elaborate structures, tremendous numbers of

meetings, but at the end of the day, very few results.   So  let

us go for the results, whatever the form may be.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, may I thank the Minister for his

immigrants and overstayers have been making the headlines in the

local  media.   Just  this morning, on the  front  page  of  The

Straits  Times, there is a report of some 200 illegal immigrants

of  various nationalities who were apprehended.  The problem  is

not confined to Singapore.  There are continuing reports on this

similar  issue  in  Malaysia almost  on  a  daily  basis.   This

morning, The Straits Times showed most graphically the situation

in  Malaysia  headlined, "Foreigners caught in  garbage  truck".

They  even  come in garbage trucks.  The following article  also

reported that Malaysia is urging Indonesia to act on this issue,

as  presumably a large number of illegal immigrants in  Malaysia

are from Indonesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the tightening up in Malaysia, combined with the

slowdown in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>



economies of neighbouring countries and the increasing number of

unemployed,  the problem in Singapore looks set  to  get  worse.

This  is  worrying.   As  the economy in  Indonesia  is  set  to

decline,  going by press reports, the problem must be contained.

Whilst  the  success  of  the police raids  is  commendable  and

comforting,   the  substantial  number  of  illegal   immigrants

apprehended  in the last few police raids, in fact,  means  that

this is just the tip of the iceberg.  There must be a large pool

of illegal immigrants and overstayers in our midst.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Singapore is not a large island, the coastline is

long  and  one can imagine the difficulties the Police  must  be

facing  in  trying  to stop the tide of those seeking  to  enter

Singapore illegally.  I have no doubt that the Police  is  doing

its utmost to contain or arrest the problem.  On the legal side,

employers  must be educated that this is a serious  problem  and

that  one  should not encourage illegal immigrants by  employing

them.   Despite  hefty penalties, there are  employers  who  are

prepared to flout the law.  On enforcement, the Police should be

well  equipped  with manpower and equipment, especially  in  the

seas,  to  prevent illegal entry.  Once they land  on  shore  in

Singapore,  and  in  our  midst, the  chance  of  detection  and

apprehension diminishes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure all Members support me when I say that the Home

Affairs  Ministry  should get a higher vote,  if  necessary,  to

implement programmes to counter this problem.  The Minister  may

like  to  assure the House and Singaporeans on the  steps  being

taken to contain this problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, the current financial

turmoil  and  economic crisis are forcing many people  from  our

neighbouring  countries  to  flee hyper-inflation,  severe  food

shortages and unemployment which are affecting them in their own

land.   They may be attracted to Singapore which is only a short

boat  ride  away.   In  the early hours  of  24th  February,  12

suspected  illegal immigrants were arrested in  the  waters  off

Changi.   The police spokesman stated that this was the  largest

number  arrested at sea for trying to enter Singapore  illegally

from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>



south.   The  Police  also reported that  the  total  number  of

illegal  immigrants caught at sea for the first  two  months  of

this  year stands at 39, compared to 84 for the whole  of  1997.

This  number  seems  incredibly small compared  to  the  numbers

reported  in  Malaysia  where  3,971  illegal  immigrants   were

arrested  in a three-week period last month.  No doubt, Malaysia

is  a  bigger  country with a longer coastline,  swampy  coastal

marshes  and deserted shorelines which all serve as good landing

points.   But I wonder whether, apart from the relatively  small

number  who  has been arrested so far, there were other  illegal

immigrants who have managed to avoid arrest and slip through our

surveillance net to land on shore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to formulate a comprehensive and effective

approach  to  prevent,  detain,  and  deal  with  such  economic

migrants.    We   must   formulate  a  realistic   approach   in

anticipation  and  in  the event of a  mass  exodus  of  illegal

immigrants from our neighbouring countries.  Are we able to cope

should large numbers of foreigners turn up in our waters?  If we

are  to arrest and imprison them, can our prisons house and feed

all of them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the problem should be approached from at

least  four different angles.  The first is to nip the Taikongs,

or  boatmen, who exploit the desperation of these foreigners  by

smuggling  them to Singapore for a fee.  If found  guilty,  they

should be given heavy deterrent penalties, including jail terms,

caning,  confiscation  of their boats, so  as  to  cut  off  the

provision  for  this  ferry service and  to  deter  others  from

offering  it.  We might pity the illegal immigrant who is  often

driven  by  deprivation and turmoil back home to risk  venturing

overseas.  But no pity should be given to the boatmen  who  seek

to profit from the desperation of others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, surveillance of our coastlines and onshore patrols

must  be  stepped up.  This requires the coordinated efforts  of

the   Police   Coast  Guards,  the  Navy  and  the   Immigration

Department.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, citizens should be vigilant and look out for illegal

immigrants  in their neighbourhoods.  Any suspicious  characters

should be reported to the Police for their identification to  be

verified  and, if found to be not in order, to be arrested.   If

large numbers of foreign workers are known to be congregating in

any particular place in Singapore, combined operations should be

mounted to check on them and round them up.  And those who  have

come  in  illegally  or  have overstayed should  be  dealt  with

accordingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, residents who harbour and provide refuge for

illegal immigrants should be severely punished.  We have to also

track  down  illegal  immigrants  who  make  use  of  make-shift

accommodation  in the nature reserves and other deserted  areas.

To address this problem, a combined operation by the Police, and

perhaps the army, should be launched to flush them out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the crisis and turmoil in the region would inevitably

lead to more illegal immigrants trying to land on our shores. We

should  not  think that that is not a big problem as the  number

arrested  so far is small.  Many might have slipped through.   I

believe  this  problem  is potentially serious  and  warrants  a

concerted multi-pronged approach to deal with it effectively.



<br>1.30 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, in addition to

the  usual illegal immigrants we have from time to time from the

traditional foreign workers market, we can expect a  big  influx

of   illegal  immigrants  for  the  next  few  years  from   our

neighbouring  countries  who have been  badly  affected  by  the

current economic turmoil.  It will no doubt cause a great strain

to the Police Department's resources to deal with this situation

as  Singapore is an island and the task of patrolling our shores

would be much more difficult.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As illegal immigrants not only cause social problems, but

more importantly,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>



they  will present security problems that involve the safety  of

all  Singaporeans, I hope the Ministry can take early preventive

measures  to  tighten security and coordinate with  perhaps  the

armed  forces who can patrol the outlying areas and  the  forest

areas, the navy who can help to patrol our shoreline, and  other

law  enforcement agencies like the Immigration Department  could

tighten  control  of the influx of these immigrants  to  prevent

anyone from entering Singapore illegally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who may have slipped through our first line of

defence,  I  suggest that, apart from continual  raids  or  even

intensified vigilance on construction sites, factories and other

workplaces,  the  Police Department can work  with  the  various

grassroots  organisations, especially  the  Neighbourhood  Watch

Groups  to  alert  residents in the HDB estates  to  notify  the

Police   as  soon  as  they  detect  any  strangers  who  behave

suspiciously  and,  more  so, speak no  local  languages.   They

should also send continuous reminders to contractors and factory

operators  of  the serious consequence if they  are  found  with

illegal  workers.   This is perhaps the most  effective  way  to

minimise illegal immigrants to Singapore because if they  cannot

find work here, there is no reason for them to take the risk  of

being  caught.   I hope the Ministry can give the assurance  and

enlighten us on what other plans it has to keep Singapore a safe

and peaceful place for all of us to live in.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, other Members

in  the  House have already spoken about the expected influx  of

immigrants  from neighbouring countries.  Today, we  have  heard

that  over  300 illegal immigrants have been picked  up  in  one

operation alone last night.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, The Straits Times reported a story from Newsweek

that  an  official from a neighbouring country made  the  remark

that  even  if  10 million people were to leave for neighbouring

shores in their boats, they will not be stopped.  That is a very

scary  statement.  Even if 1% of that 10 million  were  to  gain

entry into Singapore, we would face very serious



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>



problems.   Crime control measures may have to be  increased  to

levels  as  yet  unknown and could adversely affect  our  social

life.   I  believe that all of us in this House would very  much

like  to know what are the steps that are needed to ensure  that

this   does  not  happen.   Do  we  have  the  resources?   More

importantly, do we have the will to deal firmly and sternly with

those who intend to come in illegally?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be very difficult to be strict. We naturally

sympathise with those who are in extreme distress.  We  remember

the anguish of the world for the Vietnamese boat people.  It  is

natural to want to help people in distress.  But I believe  that

in  Singapore,  we have to stand firm.  We already  have  around

450,000 foreign workers who are working here legally.  Land  and

resources  are in short supply.  Frankly, I believe we  have  no

choice.  I have every confidence that the Minsiter would be in a

position to assure us that effective steps would be put in place

to  control  the  influx of illegal immigrants  into  Singapore,

dealing with them firmly but decently.  Singaporeans would  need

to  know why we need to take such firm steps.  Quite simply,  it

is  to  preserve our way of life, to protect all  that  we  have

worked  for  over  these years, that is, in short,  what  is  at

stake.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, I

would  like  to  reply  to this question of  illegal  immigrants

raised  by  four Members first, because I think  it  is  a  very

important topic for all of us in today's climate where there  is

a  regional  economic  downturn and that  there  is  a  fear  of

potential  influx of illegal immigrants.  But,  first,  I  would

like  to assure Members that the Home Affairs Ministry is  fully

aware  of  this problem and has been dealing with  it  for  some

time.  I also want to thank Mr Chng for his support for a higher

vote for the Ministry of Home Affairs.  I think my colleague  in

the   Finance  Ministry  will  hear  him  loud  and  clear  and,

hopefully, his plea would be answered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, let me first say that Singapore welcomes all

foreigners to come here to work, visit, play or even  to  study.

But  they  must  come through legal channels.  "Legal  channels"

mean they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>



must  come  with proper papers and travel documents.  When  they

come  here for a visit, they apply for a social visit pass.   If

they work here, they apply for an employment pass, a work permit

or other documents, such as a student pass if they want to study

here.   If  they come in with these documents, we  will  endorse

their  stay  here.  Then, lawfully, they will be  residents  in

Singapore.  For those who want to come in by other means, then I

think it would be very difficult for them not to be detected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have taken and will continue to take a very tough

stand against all the illegal immigrants and overstayers, and  I

group   all  these  people  as  immigration  offenders.    These

immigration  offenders could also include their  smugglers,  the

Taikongs, as mentioned by Mr Ong Kian Min.  There are also ,  or

the  harbourers (the ones who allow them to live in their homes)

or the employers of these people who give them jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain why we cannot afford to be lax or kind to

these  illegal  immigrants.  Singapore is a very  small  country

with  limited  natural  resources.  We  therefore  cannot  allow

people to come here just to stay and work illegally.  They  will

pose  a  very  serious and grave national, social  and  security

problem  for us.  We therefore have enacted very tough  laws  to

deal  with  these illegal immigrants and overstayers.   We  will

enforce these laws vigorously which we will apply equally  to

all  nationalities regardless of where they come from.  If  they

come  here  illegally or prolong their stay here  illegally,  we

will deal with them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The punishments prescribed under our laws are very severe.

For  example,  illegal immigrants will be  imprisoned  up  to  a

maximum  of  six  months  and will be given  a  mandatory  three

strokes of the cane.  Overstayers will also be imprisoned up  to

six  months,  and if they overstay for more than 90  days,  they

will  also be subject to a minimum of three strokes of the cane.

We  will  be  deliberately tough on those  who  smuggle  in  the

illegal immigrants,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>



the  Taikongs, the people who employ them, harbour them or  give

them  accommodation.   These smugglers  will  be  punished  with

imprisonment of not less than two years and caned a  minimum  of

three  strokes.  Those who harbour and employ illegal immigrants

will  be jailed for a term not less than six months and fined  a

maximum of $6,000.  But for those employers who employ more than

five  immigration  offenders, whether they  are  overstayers  or

illegal  immigrants, they will be imprisoned not less  than  six

months  and  fined  not exceeding $6,000 and  caned.   Since  we

amended  the Immigration Act in 1989, many employers  have  been

caned.   In  fact,  since we tightened this up  in  1996,  seven

employers have been caned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the same reason that we are a small country with

limited  natural resources, Singapore is also not in a  position

to  accept anyone who claims to be a refugee, whether he  is  an

economic  or  a  political  refugee.   We  could  otherwise   be

overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of people who want to come here

and  claiming themselves to be refugees.  Therefore, anyone  who

enters Singapore's territorial waters illegally will be regarded

as  an illegal immigrant and he will be treated accordingly.  If

they  come  in through to our waters illegally, we will  try  to

stop  them.  If they refuse to stop, then we will have no choice

but  to use force to stop them.  Prof Chin asked whether we have

the will to do so.  Yes, let me assure him that we have the will

and  the  Police Coast Guard (PCG) will have the  will  to  stop

these people from coming in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past, we have been kind enough to agree to take

in   Vietnamese  refugees  with  third  country  guarantees  for

resettlement.  And for years, we were saddled with them  because

these  third  countries which agreed to resettle  them  did  not

honour  their guarantees.  Eventually, when the camp had  to  be

closed,  these Vietnamese had to be sent back.  We  have  learnt

our  lesson and we will no longer accept any refugee even  if  a

third country promises to resettle them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me give Members some idea of how serious the

problem is by quoting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>



the  following numbers.  In 1997, 13,910 immigration  offenders,

of  whom 7,600 were illegal immigrants, were arrested.  In 1996,

14,260   immigration  offenders,  of  whom  5,710  were  illegal

immigrants, were arrested.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the number of immigration offenders arrested as a

whole  dropped by 2.5% in 1997, the number of illegal immigrants

arrested  during the period has gone up from 5,710  in  1996  to

7,600  in 1997.  This is because Singapore Immigration tightened

up the entry requirement for some nationalities.  Of the illegal

immigrants  arrested  in 1997, the top five  nationalities  came

from  China,  that  is,  PRC, Indonesia, Myanmar,  Thailand  and

India.   In other words, not all came from the South,  that  is,

Indonesia.   The  number  of  illegal  immigrants  has  gone  up

significantly  mainly through Malaysia.  They  came  across  the

Straits of Johor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than half or 53% of the illegal immigrants came in

from  the sea, 46% came in by land and less than 1% claimed that

they  came by air.  For those who came by land, in 1997,  nearly

400   illegal  immigrants  sneaked  in  through  the   Woodlands

Checkpoint  by hiding in lorries, while about 200 hid themselves

in  the  car boots.  And many more came by speed boats over  the

Straits of Johor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, joint efforts are needed between the Singapore Police

and  the Malaysian Police to tackle this problem.  The Singapore

Police has sought the Malaysian Police's cooperation to stem out

this  illegal immigration problem.  Both the Police Forces  have

already  met  and discussed the problem and they have  exchanged

information on the syndicated operations and the staging  points

where  both  forces  can  cooperate to weed  out  these  illegal

entries.   We hope that the Malaysian government will take  this

problem seriously and deal effectively with the syndicates which

smuggle  illegal immigrants into Singapore from Johor,  just  as

the  Malaysian government is very concerned about the Indonesian

illegal  immigrants and they have taken up with  the  Indonesian

government to solve this problem.  The Malaysian government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>



knows  the  seriousness of the problem they  face  with  illegal

immigrants from other countries, especially from Indonesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this illegal immigrant problem is likely to get worse, I

have  asked the Police and the Singapore Immigration to be  even

more  vigilant and to step up their enforcement action.  Let  me

now outline or explain what these actions are.



<br><br><i>Increased Vigilance</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like some Members pointed out, our first line of defence

is  our  coastal front where we will enhance our patrols by  the

Police  Coast Guard.  The Police Coast Guard will  do  this

with  radar  surveillance systems.  That  will  help  to

detect all those who come by sea all round our island.  I  think

some  Members may have seen this on television a few weeks  ago.

The  radars  on  board  the PCG can detect  any  penetration  of

illegal  immigrants on vessels from the sea.  PCG also has  land

based radar stations to supplement the patrol boats and we  will

buy more patrol boats to increase the detection of these illegal

immigrants.  Police has also stepped up  shore patrols  and  set

up  observation  points, as some Members  suggested,  along  the

coast  and  at  landing areas.  Police Land Divisions  are  also

deploying  more  men  to  patrol the illegal  immigrant  landing

points.  The Police Coast Guard has also increased deployment of

its  patrol  boats in the Johor Straits and in  the  Straits  of

Singapore.    The  police  has  also  stepped  up   intelligence

gathering, because we just do not act without information.



<br>1.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Ministry empathizes with these poor hungry people

who  want  to come here to work illegally, and they  risk  their

lives  to  come a long way,  we cannot afford to allow  them  to

come  in.  Our primary responsibility is to safeguard the safety

and  security of all Singaporeans, and not let anyone  come  and

remain  here  illegally to work, as they  will  pose  a  serious

social and security problem for us.  All illegal immigrants will

ould be arrested, prosecuted, punished and repatriated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>



We  will  press  for  deterrent  sentences  against   the

immigration  offenders, especially the people who  smuggle  them

in.



<br><br><i>Enforcement Actions</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police and Immigration have been conducting operations

to arrest illegal immigrants and overstayers.  Some Members have

read about this in the papers in the last few days.   Checks and

raids  have  been  conducted regularly at  congregation  points,

construction sites, workplaces and even  forested areas, because

they  could  be a good hiding place for criminals.  Police  have

also  set  up  road  blocks to sieve out immigration  offenders.

Lodging  houses are also being targetted and harbourers will  be

prosecuted.  An island-wide operation was conducted just  a  few

days  ago  which resulted in the arrest of 91 illegal immigrants

and  124  overstayers of various nationalities.  Another island-wide operation lasting  two days also resulted in the arrest  of

more  than 200 illegal immigrants and overstayers.  We will  ask

the courts for maximum sentences for these employers, harbourers

and immigration offenders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members that Police and Immigration will

continue  with  their  relentless effort in enforcement  against

these  immigration  offenders, and we will  flush  them  out  as

quickly as we can.



<br><br><i>Tighter Border Control</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreigners, who come to Singapore and who fit the profile

of  suspected illegal workers, will not be allowed to come  into

Singapore.   In 1996, 97,710 such people who fit the profile  of

suspected illegal workers were denied entry into Singapore.   In

1997,   92,400  such  people  were  not  allowed  to  come  into

Singapore. Police and Immigration will be more vigilant  now  in

monitoring  all  our  border entry points.   The  monitoring  at

checkpoints at the Causeway, Tuas, land checkpoints, seaport and

the airport will all be stepped up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police and Immigration will also intensify the checks at

these checkpoints



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>



to  detect the smuggling of illegal immigrants by vehicles.  Let

me  give  Members an idea of what the numbers are of  those  who

were  so  detected.   In  1997, 26  illegal  immigrants  and  11

smugglers  were  arrested, and 13 vehicles seized  at  Tuas  and

Causeway checkpoints.  Vessels carrying illegal immigrants  will

be  stopped by force, if necessary.  And iIf they try  to  evade

arrest despite being told to do so, then the Police Coast Guard,

as  I  said, will use force to stop them.  If they are arrested,

these  vessels will be confiscated and they will be disposed  of

or  destroyed.  In 1997, last year, 30 such vessels were  seized

together with 255 illegal immigrants arrested.



<br><br><i>Tightening of Visa Control</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immigration also imposes visas to address the overstayer

problem  for some years, and visas have been imposed  on  people

coming from countries such as the People's Republic of China and

India.   Last year, we also imposed visas on people coming  from

Myanmar and Bangladesh.  We will consider imposing visas on

other  nationalities if they pose a serious overstaying  problem

here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, given the regional situation, it is in the interest of

all Singaporeans that we continue with our very strict and tough

stance  against immigration offenders.  The Police,  Immigration

and  the  other agencies in the Home Team and indeed members  of

the  public  can  also help us and we will spare  no  effort  to

detect and deal firmly with immigration offenders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Home Team will closely monitor the situation, take the

necessary actions, adjust the strategies and deployment and stay

on  top  of the situation.  This will help to ensure the  safety

and security of Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, the salary structure of the Police

Force  was adjusted last year.  This is good news for the police

officers  already in the force and is certain  to  attract  more

capable  men and women into the force.  I am pleased to read  in

the  press  recently  that  the  prison's  recruitment  exercise

attracted an unprecedented number of applicants.  I hope that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>



from  this  wider and better pool of applicants to choose  from,

the  prison authorities and the Police Force as a whole will  be

able to recruit higher calibre officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, earlier, I spoke about the problem of illegal

immigrants,  which  has been answered by the Minister,  and  the

need to have the necessary equipment to stop this problem at our

coastline.    Investing   in  high-technology   equipment   will

complement and supplement the limitations of human resources, as

they  can  give  early warning and pinpoint the  locations  with

accuracy.  With the economic crisis in the region, the waves  of

illegal immigrants, as the Minister and other Members have said,

will foreseeably be more frequent and intense.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that technology is also making great progress

and  white-collar crimes have become increasingly  more  complex

and  complicated.   There was a report recently  that  some  FBI

agents  in the US are equipped with laptop or notebook computers

to  help  them fight crimes, and they have achieved some measure

of success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the investment in equipment and the changing climate

of  crime  entails  that  the quality  of  our  law  enforcement

officers   must   continue  to  rise  to  match   the   changing

circumstances.   There  is  also a compelling  need  to  operate

across  departments  and  Ministries,  as  issues  become   more

complex.   Joint operations require well thought out  plans  and

coordination to ensure a greater degree of success.   Therefore,

it goes without saying that the quality of leadership is crucial

in such operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be pleased to hear the Minister elaborate on some

of  his  Ministry's  plans to improve the  quality  of  our  law

enforcement officers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chng, you can go on to your next topic.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, Singapore has been rated as one of

the safest cities in the world.  Singaporeans can take pride  in

our  police  force for making this possible.  Recent reports  on

the crime statistics



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>



show that crime has been declining despite a number of cases  of

serious crimes in the first two months of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the economic conditions appear to be less

favourable  this means it is bad news for crime.   The  reported

rise  in  illegal  immigrants also  spells  bad  news.   Illegal

immigrants  without  gainful employment  are  good  targets  for

crime.  Since the beginning of this year, the spate of break-ins

seems to be on the increase, as the press reports  go.  Most  of

them involve burglary in landed properties and in most of these,

the  burglars were armed.  This is most worrisome, as  it  shows

that  these armed burglars come prepared and their victims  were

subdued.   In other words, criminals are getting more desperate.

On 4th March 1998, three condominium units in Seletar Hills were

burgled.  Even condominiums  which have some measure of security

are not safe when it comes to crime.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is every possibility of the crime situation getting

worse  this year.  Besides increasing law enforcement  measures,

public  education must also be stepped up.  The recent spate  of

burglaries  may be avoided if the owners had been more  vigilant

and   if   security  systems  had  been  installed.    Educating

Singaporeans and reminding them to improve on security  measures

should be an on-going effort, but they do have their limitations

as it is human behaviour to think that bad things only happen to

others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apprehending criminals in housing estates is much more

difficult  because of the size and location of these  houses  in

the  estates.   Greater police presence  may  not  be  the  most

effective way of preventing break-ins.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to elaborate on what steps

have  been taken to strengthen the existing measures and whether

the police could do more to contain this problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, at a recent press

conference,  the Criminal Investigation Department  assured  the

public that the number of murders, 15 in total, in the first two

months of this year is not unusually high.  In fact, there were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>



two  periods at the peak which exceeded the total of January and

February  this  year, ie,   between October and  November  1994,

there  were 15 murders, and between September and October  1993,

there were 16 cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is of little comfort because in the past years, the

average yearly number of murders was 45 cases.  It works out  to

be  an  average of four murders a month.  During the  first  two

months of this year, the total number well exceeded the average.

And  if  this is seen together with last year's trend, it  shows

that, although the number of crimes committed is lower, what  is

significant is that the reported cases for murder and rape cases

increased.  It is indeed an area for great concern as these  are

the  two most feared and serious types of crime.  The recent two

brutal double murders  really shocked all Singaporeans.  One  of

these  murders occurred in my constituency.  In fact, the  whole

neighbourhood was really shaken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the causes, it is not something that we should

consider  not  out of the ordinary, as has been  stated  by  the

Criminal   Investigation  Department.   We   should   never   be

complacent just because we have achieved a lower crime rate  and

Singapore  is perceived to be a very safe place for us  to  live

in.   While  I  compliment the police department  for  doing  an

excellent job in keeping the crime rate low, I would request the

department  to  put in greater efforts to address  our  concern,

especially in the case of murder and rape.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, first of all, I am very happy to note

that  the total expenditure for the Ministry of Home Affairs  in

FY  97  increased over actual FY 96, and a further  increase  of

$104 million has been budgetted for FY 98.  I fully support  the

need  to  build  up and maintain a credible and  effective  Home

Team.  The Home Team has done an admirable job in bringing  down

the  crime rate which has declined for the past nine years, with

some types of crimes registering record lows.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans and foreigners alike appreciate our safe

streets.  This is an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>



important  element in making Singapore one of the  most  livable

cities  in  the world and the best home for our people.   It  is

also  one  of  the  positive factors which top  foreign  talents

consider  when  deciding   to  relocate  themselves  and   their

families  to Singapore.  Therefore, in addition to our  emphasis

on   defence,   education  and  development  of   our   economic

infrastructure,  I  would  strongly  support  our  emphasis   on

maintaining  and  enhancing public security in Singapore.   Just

like a credible defence force, an effective Home Team cannot  be

created   and   developed  overnight.   It  requires   long-term

commitment  and  investment  in  manpower,  hardware,  software,

expertise and new technology.



<br>2.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our crime rates have dropped over the past nine

years, we must not be complacent.  Because, I believe, our  Home

Team will face particularly tough challenges in the face of  the

on-going regional economic crisis.  There is a real danger  that

crime  and  violence  may escalate under the  present  difficult

regional  circumstances.  In addition to the problem of  illegal

immigrants which I have raised earlier, an increase in crime may

be due to one or more of the following reasons:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the impact of the crisis on our local population is

profound.  Singaporeans, especially the younger generation,  are

used   to   enjoying  years  of  strong  economic   growth   and

appreciating  asset values.  Generally, we have  benefited  from

the  good years and there is no denying that there is a  sizable

proportion  of  Singaporeans who have grown  accustomed  to  the

creature  comforts of the good life, some even to the  point  of

being extravagant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, they are now faced with a slowdown and the real

possibility of a decrease in asset values, loss of  jobs  and  a

reduction of income.  In the light of this slowdown, they should

make adjustments to their lifestyles and trim expenditure.   But

some  may  succumb to temptation or pure greed and some  may  be

forced  by severe financial difficulties to take the easy  route

to money through crime.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Singapore is a very open country. Last year, there

were  more  than  6 1/2 million tourist arrivals.  Many  will  come

genuinely  looking to enjoy our beautiful country,  seeking  job

opportunities  or to trade.  But there will be  some  foreigners

who  come here with the intention to commit crime and those who,

while they are here on a legitimate purpose, turn to crime  when

the  opportunity  presents itself.  These  foreigners  take  the

chance, secure in the knowledge that they are anonymous in  this

country   and  can  flee  quickly  and  easily  without  notice.

Therefore,  more  in the areas of crime prevention,  encouraging

members  of the public to report and arrest criminals, and  fast

police response to the scene of crime must be done to arrest and

address this potential problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should not take our low crime rates for granted.

The police force and other Home Team agencies need resources  to

constantly  upgrade  their establishment, their  expertise,  and

operational capabilities to prevent, deter and solve crimes.  We

must do our utmost to support the building and maintenance of an

effective  Home Team so that our streets and homes  will  remain

safe in the midst of the on-going regional crisis and beyond.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, personal security, both in

the  home  and  outside, is a major concern for everyone.   Safe

streets, safer homes.  Singapore is fortunate.  We on the  whole

do  have safe streets and safer homes.  But recent robberies and

murders  highlighted by the press have led many with the feeling

of  unease,  particularly in the housing estates  affected.   It

often  translates into an emotive issue.   At grassroots  level,

Members  of this House would have inevitably been approached  by

residents  wishing to be assured of a higher level of  security.

That  is  understandable.  What is not  often  stressed  enough,

however, is that the war against crime is not just fought by the

Home  Team, the uniformed services.  It requires the support  of

the very people they are duty bound to protect.  The man-in-the-street must participate actively in crime prevention.  The  more

the public is aware of the need to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>



cooperate and be crime conscious the less crime there  will  be.

Public awareness has to be improved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Minister announced a new plan to restructure

the  coverage  of the Home Team in Singapore.   A pilot  project

was  started, I believe, and we are anxious to hear how the  new

NPC/NPP  combination has worked out.  Is it likely that in  this

year  we  can expect the restructuring to go on?  If  so,  which

areas would next benefit from the new methods of policing?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe too that there is a need, given the manpower

shortage  in the services, to give more thought to  the  use  of

electronic surveillance equipment in Singapore.  It was found in

studies  abroad  that where there were surveillance  cameras  in

place  crime  has  fallen.  Cameras have often  helped  also  in

identifying culprits and the like.  I would urge the Minister to

consider  installing  such equipment,  not  just,  for  example,

inside  MRT  stations, but also in the surrounding  areas  where

there  are usually pedestrians who may be walking home  late  at

night.   Indeed, it may be appropriate in due course  to  extend

such camera surveillance to housing estates, especially in areas

that are isolated, such as in blocks bordering parks or roads.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the control of crime calls for collective action. The

Home Team must help citizens protect themselves.  Crime can cast

a  dark  shadow over a large group of people, the  victims,  the

relatives,  the  bystanders,  the people  in  the  vicinity  and

neighbours.   Singapore takes a very hard line, rightly  so,  in

dealing  with  criminals, and for that we do have  a  very  safe

environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, internal security is every bit as

important  as our defence from external threats.  Total  defence

should cover the work of the Home Team as well.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, let me first deal with Mr Chng's

question about the training of the Home Team officers on the use

of  high-tech  equipment.  Let me assure him that  we  are  very

aware that we need to keep in touch with the changing times and,

as   a  result,  the  Ministry  has  embarked  on  a  number  of

acquisitions of high-tech equipment.  Therefore, we will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>



definitely  pay  a  great  deal of  attention  in  training  our

officers  on the use of high-tech equipment.  Over the next  few

years,  in fact, the Home Team will take a quantum leap  in  the

use  of  information technology (IT) and other high-tech systems

to  help the Home Team in its enforcement efforts.  I can assure

Members that the Home Team officers will be properly trained  in

the  use  of  these  equipment.  For  example,  all  our  police

recruits  are  now  trained in the use of  command  and  control

mobile  data  terminals that are needed for front line  policing

during their basic training.  Recently, 550 immigration officers

were  also trained in the handling of sophisticated IT  systems,

namely,  the  Tuas network infrastructure, the  entry  and  exit

control  upgraded  system, the immigration automated   clearance

system  and  the automated character recognition system  at  the

Tuas  Checkpoint to facilitate Singaporeans and other  users  of

the checkpoint to clear the checkpoint as quickly as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Defence Force, for example, also uses training

simulators  to  train  its  staff our  people  on  fighting  LPG

leakages  and  fires, flashovers and hazardous materials.   They

use these simulators to enhance training realism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another target for the Ministry is to make the use of

personal  computers more universal within the next two to  three

years.   This  we  do through the  intelligent  desktop

project  and it will help us to attain the goal of 100% computer

literacy  for  all our officers over the next few  years.   With

all  these on-going measures, we will work together  to  ensure

that  our  senior  and  junior  officers  are  trained,  quality

personnel  who  will be able to handle high-tech  equipment  and

systems well into the 21st century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Chng's and Mr Kenneth Chen's concern about the crime

situation  in  Singapore, in particular Mr Chen's concern  about

the  CID's comments recently that the number of murder cases  is

not  unusual, let me first assure him that CID is not taking the

matter lightly, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>



they  do  not  find the number acceptable.  But  what  they  are

trying  to  put out is the fact that, "yes, indeed,  we  have  a

number of murders over the last two months.  Let us take this in

proper  perspective and not be unduly alarmed by it, but at  the

same time not to be complacent about it".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CID actually compared the figures with previous years'

figures and found that the figures, are no doubt high.   But

they  are  not really unusual, and they have given some numbers.

For example, in 1993 and 1994, there were 15 and 16 murder cases

just  over  two consecutive months.  Eventually,  we  found  the

cause of those murder cases and since then we have no more  such

problems.  But I agree with Mr Chen that the past record of high

murder  rates  is not a good reason for us to feel   comfortable

about  the  situation.   For  the families  of  those  who  were

murdered,  our  sympathies and condolences  are  certainly  with

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all these 13 cases in the first two months of this year

were  unrelated. We do not have a serial murderer on the  loose.

The  murders are not concentrated  on  any  particular

geographical area.  The victims come from different  backgrounds

and  the reasons for their being murdered differed from  one  to

another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chen has expressed concern that the public sense of well-being and security may be affected because of the economic

downturn  and  more crimes like these murders may be  committed.

He  wanted to know how many of these were due to  economic

reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CID has assessed that none of the 13 murders in January and

February were the result of the economic downturn.  In three out

of the 13 cases, the perpetrators actually killed the victims in

order  to facilitate robbery, and the reasons for robbery  could

be  many.   The rest were either crimes of passion  or  isolated

cases  of  fights and disputes.  If these people could  not

settle the disputes, force was used and as a result people  die.

In  1996,  seven of the 31 cases of murder involved robbery,  as

did eight out of the 37 in 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the police doing about the increase, and whether

the number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>



murders  will  be further increased this year, as  Mr  Chng  has

asked.   The  year has not run out yet.  I hope the number  will

not  be large and it is still too soon to tell.  But we know  in

1997,  there were 37 murder cases compared to 31 in  1996.   But

these  were  actually  quite low figures  compared  to  previous

years, for example, between 1990 and 1995, we had between 42 and

58 murder cases.  The number fluctuates from year to year.  Five

of the 13 cases committed this year have already been solved and

CID told me that they were making good progress in the remaining

cases and they are confident of solving more of them soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng is also concerned about the recent spate of reports

of  robberies  or  house-breaking incidents in  private  housing

estates.   Yes,  indeed,  there are some  reports  about  house-breaking.   Whether we have more of such cases,  again  in

1998, I would say that it is too soon to tell.  But in 1997,  we

had 42 such cases of private estate house robberies compared  to

only  17  in  1996.  So we can see that there is an increase  in

house-robbery cases between 1996 and 1997.  Again, there  is  no

particular reason to explain this increase and neither is  there

a sign that the trend will continue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng has asked what steps police will be taking to deal

with the problem.  The police told me that:  Firstly,  they have

set  up  a  Fast  Response  Task Force  to  respond  quickly  to

apprehend  the  suspects when the cases occur.  But  again  that

depends  on  the residents and the people who were  affected  to

report the commission of crime as quickly as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, they have deployed temporary police posts to

areas which are affected by the robberies in order to project  a

higher police profile and visibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, they have intensified the crime prevention

activities with the residents; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, they have helped the residents form

Neighbourhood Watch zones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like some Members have said, I would like to stress also

that crime prevention is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>



not  the  sole responsibility of the police.  All of us  play  a

part.   We  must do our share and we must help to keep crime  at

bay.  Although the crime rate has been declining every year  for

the  last  nine years, we must not be complacent and think  that

wethey will not be a target for criminals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are indeed many measures which residents, the home

owners  themselves, whether they live in a HDB estate  or  in  a

private  condominium or landed property, can take  in  order  to

make  the homes more secure.  For example, they can install good

quality  locks  or alarm systems.  And iIf they  have  an  alarm

system,  for goodness sake, please switch them on when they  are

needed.   I  know  quite a number of these  private  residential

properties have alarm systems, but, unfortunately, they were not

turned  on  when  the criminals and the robbers  went  into  the

house.   Even when they leave their homes, residentsthey  should

take  the  necessary precaution of securing the home by  closing

the  windows and doors, shutting the grilles and so on, and  not

like in one instance, where I read in the papers, they just left

things  as  they were and walked out of the home, thinking  that

everything  would be fine.  The worst thing you  can  do  is  to

tempt  the  robber or any perpetrator who may want to  commit  a

crime, passing by your home and finding it is so unprotected and

giving  him an opportunity to commit a crime.  Those  living  in

private  condominiums or even in landed properties can  help  to

form  Neighbourhood Watch Groups.  In fact, I think it  is  good

for  them  if they can form Neighbourhood Watch Groups not  just

for  protection of their own homes, but also for the purpose  of

building  neighbourliness.  At, at least  theyyou  get  to  know

theiryour  neighbours.   And Iif they see suspicious  characters

lurking around, I think they should report them to the Police as

quickly as possible, and the Police will respond.



<br>2.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police, in fact, is going around helping to form

Neighbourhood  Watch Groups.  In the past few  years,  they  had

formed  8,000  such  groups  in  the  private  housing  estates,

including  condominiums.  And I would urge all those  living  in

private



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>



estates, condominiums, landed property, to form NWGs as  quickly

as  possible.  The Police will help them if they are asked.  The

Police   will   also  work  very  closely  with  the   Community

Development Councils and other grassroots organisations to  come

up  with measures to see how we can make the place where we live

more  safe  and  more secure, and they will jointly  come  upout

together  with a Community Focused Plan, which I will  elaborate

later on, on how to get the community more actively involved  in

crime  prevention.   So  actually it  is  a  very  simple,  very

commonsensical  thing to do.  Everybody should take  extra  care

and  precaution, and play histheir part to help keep crime rates

low  and  not  be complacent, especially during this  period  of

economic uncertainty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min has made many complimentary remarks on the

Home  Team  officers.  I am sure they are very pleased  to  hear

that.   And  I want to thank him for his support.  I agree  with

him  fully that home security and safety is as important as  our

external  defence.  Because if our home is not safe,  people  do

not  feel  safe walking the streets and do not feel  safe  going

out,  I  think  we willare be just prisoners in our  own  homes,

which  the  residents of some countries experience.  ThenAnd   I

think  no investors would want to come here.  One of the reasons

why  many investors want to come to Singapore is that they  feel

that  Singapore is indeed very safe, where they  can  work,  and

bring up their children too.    And I can assure Mr Ong that the

Home  Team  will  continue to remain very vigilant  in  fighting

crime and safeguarding our national security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked what has happened to the Neighbourhood

Police Centres which we announced last year and what actions  we

are  going  to take in the next couple of years, and whether  we

could use more electronic surveillance equipment.  Let me report

to  the  House that the pilot phase of the Neighbourhood  Police

Centre (NPC) scheme, which was launched on 1st October last year

in  Queenstown, indeed, has progressed very well.  The residents

in Queenstown are quite happy with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>



results  so  far.  The Queenstown NPC is doing well in  ensuring

the  safety  and security of the neighbourhood.  Now  Queenstown

NPC  is  a  one-stop  centre providing a wide  range  of  police

services.   Response  time has also improved.   There  are  more

frequent patrols, and crime reports receive immediate and better

on-scene investigations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some NPPs are now closed after 11.00 pm, because

there  was  not  much demand and the place was rather  quiet  in

those  NPPs, the presence of police officers on the  ground  has

actually  not reduced.  In fact, the presence of police officers

has  actually  been increased on the ground.   Patrol  man-hours

have  increased by 13%, for instance.  The number of  quick

response teams has also increased from five to seven during  the

peak hours between 6.00 pm and 1.00 am.  And anyone who comes to

the NPP, which is closed after 11.00 pm, can have quick and easy

access  to the Police through the Emergency Communication System

installed at the particular NPP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Queenstown NPC was set up, crime victims in that

area  are  now  better and faster served.   Instead  of  passing

through  a chain of investigators, from NPC officers, divisional

officers,  and so on, now the crime victim is served immediately

by  the NPC officer who is a front-line officer dealing with the

entire on-scene investigation process.  As the NPC officers  are

better   trained  and  now  have  greater  authority  in   crime

investigation, they can also process the case much faster.   For

example, now most of the on-scene investigations attended to  by

the NPC officers are processed within 40 to 45 minutes, compared

to about double the time previously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NPC has also enabled the Police to forge a stronger

community  participation, a partnership  in  the  fight  against

crime.   For example, the NPC has joined hands with the  Tanjong

Pagar-West  Coast  Community  Development  Council  to  organise

wholesome activities for youths who are at high risk of becoming

juvenile  delinquents.  The second storey of the  Alexandra  NPP

will  be  converted  into  a centre for counselling  of  wayward

youths.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>



In  December  last  year, the Queenstown NPC and  the  Citizens'

Consultative Committee jointly organised a Queenstown Family Day

with  the  twin objectives of increasing social interaction  and

raising crime prevention awareness amongst the residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these service improvements are quite apparent and clear

to  the residents.  A telephone service audit, conducted by  the

Quality  Service  Unit  of  Clementi  Police  Station  recently,

revealed  that the residents served by the NPC were  very  happy

with the services received.  There were no adverse comments from

the  respondents.  And crime victims who were served by the  NPC

officers responded that the standard of investigation was good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin was asking whether, with the cut in the budget,

our  NPC roll-out plan would be affected or not, and what  would

be the roll-out plan for the next few NPCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that the Clementi Police Division will have its

full complement of NPCs, with the addition of three new ones  in

Jurong East, Clementi and Bukit Merah by April 1998.  But due to

the tighter budget situation, the roll-out of other NPCs will be

staggered  over  a slightly longer period of time,  compared  to

what was originally planned.  The entire NPC programme will  now

be completed by June 2001, instead of July 2000.  So it is about

11   months  of  delay.   This  slight  delay  in  the  physical

infrastructure  will  not mean a delay in the  transfer  of  the

experience  and knowledge gained from operating the NPC  scheme.

The  Police  will  proceed to transfer the  lessons  learnt  and

experiences gathered from the operational NPCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Police Force has been successful in keeping crime

rates  down for nine years.  Crime rate has become  quite

low and the people feel quite safe now to walk the streets.  The  Police  will continue to keep the vigilance.  But,  again,

let  me  say  this: that the community has a  part  to  play  in

keeping  its own living environment safe and  secure.   The

community cannot depend solely on the Police for its safety

and security.  People can take a proactive stance by forming

Neighbourhood Watch Groups or Zones, for example.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One major initiative that we are now actively responding to

is  to  strike a stronger partnership between the CDCs  and  the

Home  Team.   Safety  and  security are  at  the  heart  of  the

community's well-being and an integral element in the  self-help

building process.  As such, I believe the Home Team can help the

CDCs  achieve their aim of greater community ownership of  civil

affairs, especially in safety and security issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Home Team plans to help each CDC develop a Community

Focused  Plan  (CFP)  to  involve the community  in  safety  and

security  issues.   The  CFP  is  basically  a  plan  for  joint

proactive  community and Home Team initiatives,  programmes  and

projects,  which  are tailored to meet the safety  and  security

needs of that particular community.  The CFP will provide a more

structured, focused and coordinated approach for the  Home  Team

to   help  CDCs  engage  and  mobilize  the  community  to  take

responsibility for their own needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start with, the CFP will focus on police issues.

Activities  that will form part of the CFP, for  example,  could

include  crime prevention, road safety, community-based  problem

solving  and  victim support.  After about six months  into  the

CFP, the activities could be extended to include other Home Team

issues   such  as  fire  prevention,  civil  defence  education,

emergency  drills,  preventive  drug  education,  care  for  the

families of those who are incarcerated and helping those who are

released from prisons to reintegrate into our community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the CDCs, the Chairmen and Mayors, that the

Home  Team will spare no efforts to help make this joint venture

a success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin is also concerned about new towns and whether

the Police will take an interest in the new towns or not.  I can

assure  Prof.  Chin that Police take an interest  in  all  areas

which  are  prone to crime.  If there is a serious problem,  the

Police  will  attend to it.  If not, Police  resources  will  be

diverted  to  places where it is most needed.  In  the  case  of

Sembawang,  particularly in the place where  Prof.  Chin  is  in

charge of, from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>



data  I  know,  I  think it is a very safe place.   Compared  to

national  statistics, I think that area where Prof. Chin  is  in

charge of has one of the lowest crime rates in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, early this month,

the  Police  reported  that juvenile  crimes  showed  a  smaller

increase  of  1.8% to 2,147 youngsters arrested  in  1997.   The

moderation  is due mainly to a drop in the number  arrested  for

fights  in public and the Police noted that the banning  of  tea

dances  may  well  have well checked such  incidence.   What  is

disturbing is the rise in stealing offences by youths,  as  such

acts are probably a manifestation of an underlying problem  -  a

lack  of  self-esteem and the need to seek attention.   What  is

equally disturbing from a separate analysis of trends in  recent

years is the increase in more violent crimes and a higher female

participation rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the small increase in overall youth crime of 1.8% in

1997  is  not  cause  for  celebration as  juvenile  delinquency

remains a social problem, one that concerns parents, schools and

society at large.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a multi-organisation approach, involving the

Police,  MCD, schools, home and the community, is  in  place  to

tackle  juvenile  delinquency, both in terms of  corrective  and

preventive  measures.   However, to avoid overlapping  and  poor

monitoring,  especially of recalcitrants who might slip  through

the  cracks,  either a single agency should  be  set  up  or  an

existing  agency  be made responsible for the  coordination  and

follow-through of all efforts, in an exhaustive manner, to  help

delinquents and even teens-at-risk.  This agency should  ideally

facilitate  an  exchange of information  between  the  different

implementing bodies, perhaps through the creation of  a  central

database.   The  focus should be on youths as  individuals,  and

this agency should ensure that all efforts are made to help them

rehabilitate.  Would the Minister consider putting in place such

an arrangement?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, early last year, the

problem  of  juvenile  delinquency had often  been  highlighted.

Concern  for  the  deteriorating situation  had  caused  several

measures  to  be  introduced, one of which was  the  banning  of

teenagers  under  the  age  of 16  to  attend  any  tea  dances.

Assistance  also  is  sought  from grassroots  organisations  to

organise  more  activities  for  youths  to  keep  them  out  of

problems.  Teacher-cop was also introduced to the schools  which

I  understand has worked very effectively.  Since then, not much

has  been  reported  on the activities of juvenile  delinquency.

But  of  late, again, there have been some cases of gang  fights

being  brought to our notice.  Only a few days ago,  a  teenager

was  brutally attacked by a group of youths.  So it appears that

all  is not well with our youths.  I would therefore like to ask

the Minister to give us an update on the situation and inform us

whether  more  measures  would  be  introduced  to  address  the

problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Choo.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar):</b> I am not speaking.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Ho.



<br>2.30 pm



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho</b>

<b>Peng Kee):</b> Sir, I thank both Members for speaking on juvenile

delinquency.  Let me first respond to Mr Chen who has asked  the

House for an update on the juvenile delinquency situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the number of juvenile offenders arrested rose

steadily  from  1,205 in 1990 to 2,574 in 1995.  We  managed  to

reduce the number to 2,110 in 1996.  Last year, it rose slightly

by 37 to 2,147.  Sir, the increase was due to a higher number of

unlawful assembly cases as well as property-related cases,  such

as   shoplifting  and  robbery.   There  were,   however,   some

encouraging signs.  For example, the number of juvenile  student

offenders  fell slightly from 1,782 in 1996 to 1,749 last  year.

The number of juveniles arrested for rioting, an area of concern

which we focused on last year, fell by 30%, from 216



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>



in  1996  to 154 last year.  Nevertheless, I agree with Mr  Chen

that  the  situation  still  has to be  very  closely  monitored

because the numbers are still unacceptably high.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as alluded to by both speakers, in particular, Mrs

Lim,  juvenile  delinquency is indeed a  complex,  multi-faceted

problem.  And the number of arrests alone may not tell the  full

story.   The  reasons why a juvenile turns to crime are  diverse

and complex in nature.  These may include ineffective parenting,

parental  neglect,  boredom, undesirable peer influence,  greed,

the  desire to do the unconventional, or a combination of  these

factors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dealing with the problem effectively requires the

coordinated efforts of various Ministries and agencies, such  as

MCD,  MOE,  the  Police, the National Youth Council  (NYC),  the

courts  and voluntary welfare organisations.  Each must  do  its

part, maximising its own expertise and tapping resources in  its

respective fields.  But Mrs Lim's suggestion for a single agency

to be set up to deal with juvenile delinquency is one way to go,

but will not be the most effective one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our view, a better approach, one that we have

taken,  is  for the various Ministries and agencies to  continue

doing what they are best at, and for a single body to steer  and

coordinate  their  efforts  so as to avoid  duplication  and  to

derive  the  greatest synergy.  The Inter-Ministry Committee  on

Juvenile  Delinquecy (IMJD), which I chair, was set up in  April

1996  with  this objective in mind.  It has MPs and social  work

professionals on board with representation from MHA,  MCD,  MOE,

AG's  Chambers, the Juvenile Court, NYC and the National Council

of Social Services.  NYC provides the secretarial support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I informed the House in July last year, during the

Committee  of  Supply debate, IMJD's approach is to,  first  and

foremost,   prevent  youths  from  drifting  into   delinquency;

secondly,  take  strict  enforcement action  against  those  who

create   law   and   order   problems;  and   finally,   provide

rehabilitation opportunities for those who are amenable to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>



change.   MOE  leads in preventive education,  Police  leads  in

enforcement  efforts,  and MCD leads in  the  rehabilitation  of

juvenile offenders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IMJD acts as a catalyst for multi-agency initiatives.

It  provides a platform for the agencies to exchange experiences

and  share knowledge.  The Committee also identifies gaps in our

matrix  of  measures and makes recommendations as to  how  these

gaps  may be filled, all of which functions Mrs Lim has  rightly

pointed  out are very important.  Since its formation  in  1996,

the  Committee has coordinated about 20 measures on  prevention,

enforcement and rehabilitation which were mounted by the various

Ministries and agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you one example. One example is the StreetWise

Programme  that was implemented in October last year.   This  6-month  programme aims at imbuing life skills in youths who  have

drifted  into  gang activities through close supervision,  night

curfew,  counselling, and other developmental training.   To  do

this,  IMJD  has pooled together resources of the  Police,  MCD,

NYC,  VWOs  and the courts.  Another example which Mr  Chen  has

mentioned  is  the Honorary VSC - teacher officer scheme   where

IMJD acted as a catalyst to synergise Police and the schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This multi-pronged approach is an effective one, one that

has produced some results but, like I said,  we have to continue

to  work at it.  However, Wwhilst juvenile delinquency is  under

control,  we cannot be satisfied with the results  so  far.   As

mentioned  by both Mrs Lim and Mr Chen, all involved,  including

not  just  Governmental agencies, but and  many  people,  indeed

parents  and the community in general, must press on by  working

together  to  reduce  the numbers.  Hence, in  July  last  year,

Police  took  several new measures - - it appointed  11  teacher

officers as Honorary-VSC Senior Officers, itthey set up a Police

Caution Cases Guidance Programme, together with MCD, and stepped

up  preventive education.  Other partners in the IMJD have  also

launched new initiatives, such as peer mediation by the  courts,

Community Service Orders by MCD, promotion of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>



mentoring   schemes  by  NYC  and  issuance  of  guidelines   on

discipline by MOE.  These are just some examples.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chen asked what else will be done. This year, we will

assess  these  measures to see how their  effectiveness  can  be

further  enhanced.  Also, IMJD will consider new measures.   For

example,  IMJD will discuss with Community Development  Councils

and  see  how  they can help to reach out to youths,  especially

those   who  are  out  of  school.   Other  areas  where   CDCs'

involvement  can  be explored are in enlisting more  volunteers,

forming  mentor groups and helping parents and youths understand

each  other  better.  At the rehabilitation  end,  Prisons  will

strengthen  its  reformative training Pprogramme.   Likewise,  I

understand that MCD will strengthen its Boys' Home Pprogramme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mrs Lim suggested setting up a single agency to trackp

delinquents so that problematic juveniles can be identified  for

early monitoring and assistance.  She suggested something like a

central database.  I am happy to inform Mrs Lim Hwee Hua that an

Inter-Agency Work Group chaired by MCD, with representation from

MHA,  MCD, MOE, MOH, the Subordinate Courts and NCSS,  has  been

set  up  to  develop  a  centralised  inter-agency  database  on

juvenile  pre-delinquents  and delinquents.   The  participating

agencies  will transfer information on cases to the  centralised

database,  which  they can then tap on an on-line  basis.   This

will  facilitate  the sharing of records for  investigation  and

monitoring purposes, so that the necessary pre-emptive steps can

be taken to help delinquents who need assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mrs Lim in her speech also mentioned her concern about

female juvenile delinquency.  First, the numbers.  The number of

female  juvenile offenders arrested actually fell  from  737  in

1995  to  611  in  1996 and 582 in 1997.   More  than  80%  were

arrested for theft and related crimes, such as shoplifting.  The

number  of  female juveniles arrested for rioting in  1997  also

decreased by 50% from 76 in 1996 to 38.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even with 1997's reduced figures, the numbers

arrested  are still double the 267 female juveniles arrested  in

1991.  Therefore, rightly, we are concerned.  The efforts of the

IMJD agencies may therefore have arrested the sharp rise in  the

early  1990s,  but  we  must never assume that  the  decline  of

arrests   over   the  last  two  years  will   continue.    More

importantly, the raw number of arrests may not fully reflect the

peculiar  charactistics  of  female  juvenile  delinquency,   or

indeed, its extent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IMJD's comprehensive package of measures covers both female

and  male  juveniles.   What  we will  do  in  order  to  better

understand the profile of juveniles who riot, their backgrounds,

their motivation, their reasons, and so forth, is that IMJD  has

commissioned a study on juvenile fighting and rioting.  We  want

to  examine  actual cases to look into the backgrounds,  like  I

said,  and the reasons for rioting and also whether or not  they

are  aware  of the possible consequences of their actions.   The

study  will  be  completed by year-end and will  provide  useful

inputs  to agencies such as MCD, Police and NYC.  One  focus  of

this  study  will  be  on  female delinquents.   Female  teenage

delinquents may have problems peculiar to them as a  group,  and

the study will bear this in mind.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, the recent drug bust

resulting in the arrest of seven drug traffickers is certainly a

feather in the cap for the narcotic officers.  In fact, a number

of  successful cases in recent months have been highlighted with

large    amounts   of   prohibited   drugs   being    recovered.

Unfortunately,  this success story brings with it  more  worries

than comfort.  Because, if there is still such a great need  for

the supply of these drugs, then one can conclude that there must

be equally greater demand.  Therefore, I would like to know from

the  Minister  why, despite our all-out efforts to  combat  this

social  menace  and  the heavy punishments  we  impose  on  drug

traffickers,  there  are still so many drug  trafficking  cases.

Would  the  Minister enlighten us on the latest  number  of  new

cases of drug addicts?  Are they on the increase?  And



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>



what  about  the repeated cases?  If so, does it mean  that  our

rehabilitation   programme  is  not   effective   as   we   have

anticipated?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the repeated drug addicts are subject to

caning.  How effective has this form of punishment proved to be?

I also understand that these drug addicts are being treated with

a  drug called Naltrexone.  Since this is a very expensive drug,

has  it  been found to be cost effective and how is the recovery

rate after they have taken this drug?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, last year, I raised in the Committee

of Supply debate the issue of privatisation of non-essential law

enforcement  services.  Sir, the Police  Force,  or  Home  Team,

despite  the new salary structure will continue to face manpower

shortage.   A  police  officer is a highly skilled  and  trained

person.   He needs to understand the law, how to apply the  law,

trained  as a diplomat as he is in contact with the public  and,

at  the  same  time, he must be physically trained to  apprehend

wrong-doers  or  perpetrators.  Hence,  the  non-essential  jobs

outside the scope of the work of a police officer should be done

by  another  agency or perhaps be privatised, for  example,  the

role   of  the  Traffic  Police  officer  in  issuing  car  park

violations.   This is not a Police function.  Will the  Minister

highlight  to  the  House the progress  made  in  this  area  of

privatisation of services?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yuing:</b> Sir, our Traffic Police is a

familiar  and frequent sight on our roads and expressways.   The

officers maintain road discipline but other Members of the House

have  indicated or will indicate there is some concern over  the

rising  number  of  accidents and other  moving  offences.   The

installation  of  red light cameras and speed cameras  no  doubt

help  in  general traffic control.  But we do seem to need  more

officers on highways to ensure a greater degree of compliance to

traffic  laws.   Indeed, the existence of two types  of  traffic

officers  may  give rise to some confusion.  For example,  those

officers  under the LTA are concerned principally with  offences

relating  to  overloading  of  trucks,  emission  violations  or

unlawful modifications to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>



vehicles  and motorcycles.  They do not seem terribly interested

in speeding cars or trucks.



<br>2.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Police, on the other hand, are responsible for

the  general conduct of drivers on the roads.  I wonder  whether

it   is  not  time  to  consider  merging  these  officers,  not

physically but as a group, into a single body of men  and  women

charged  with  the  duties of enforcing  all  laws  relating  to

vehicular traffic and rules of the road.  Such officers could be

trained specifically for the control of traffic and vehicles and

for  the investigation of road accidents, which is really  quite

different  from  investigating  other  crimes.   Unless  someone

deliberately  runs  another down with an ulterior  motive,  road

accidents  are  usually  the result of  carelessness  more  than

anything else.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings to mind the training of the officers

themselves.  It seems unnecessary to train traffic officers  for

the  general  investigation  of  crime.   If  the  officers  are

recruited specifically for traffic control, their training  can,

in  fact, be faster and they can be put on the roads quicker  to

assume   duties.   The  training   can  also  be  more  focused.

Criteria for recruitment may also change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What all this leads to, if I may venture to suggest, is

that  it seems to be appropriate for the Traffic Police to  come

perhaps  under the Land Transport Authority, although I wish  to

assure  the Minister that far from it for me to suggest that  he

relinquishes  part of his authority.  It is a suggestion that it

may  be  better  for the Traffic Police to come under  the  Land

Transport Authority, which already handles many duties  relating

to the road system in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, I am sure that Members in the House will

want  to  know whether there are steps taken to rationalise  the

regulatory agencies with regard to land transport in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, with all the traffic

measures  such  as  the introduction of speed traps,  red  light

cameras, speed cameras, demerit points and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>



extremely heavy fines imposed on traffic offenders and the LTA's

constant efforts to improve our road design and conditions,  the

number  of   traffic  accidents still remains  high,  especially

fatal  accidents.  I would like to ask the Minister whether  the

Traffic  Police  could make a study on the main  causes  of  the

various accidents that occur.  Is it due to speeding or reckless

driving?   Or  is it due to the lack of skill and experience  of

the drivers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that there is a high percentage of

motorcyclists involved in traffic accidents.  At times, I marvel

at  the  dare-devil  way motorcyclists weave their  way  through

motorcars  at high speed on expressways.  I wonder whether  they

realise  how  close they are from encountering  fatal  accidents

every  time they do so.  I would like to ask whether the Traffic

Police  would consider lowering the speed limit for  provisional

drivers  and  motorcyclists if they  are  found  to  be  usually

involved in the many traffic accidents.  I hope that the Traffic

Police Department can take the necessary measures to monitor the

situation  so  that our roads can be made safer and  unnecessary

loss of lives can be kept to the minimum.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, first, let me deal with Mr Kenneth

Chen's  comments about the drug situation and whether all  these

success  stories  in  the raids mean more worries  because  more

people are still out there waiting to be caught.  He heard  that

there  are  still  more traffickers,  because  more  people  are

demanding drugs and therefore the situation has not got better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure him that CNB is also equally concerned about

the drug situation, and that is why it hasthey have gone all out

to  take  enforcement actions against people who perpetrate  the

use of drugs, traffic in drugs or take drugs.  But let me assure

him  that the drug situation in Singapore is under control.   We

do  not  have as  serious a problem as in many other  countries.

Just  for  his information, the number of drug addicts  arrested

has  actually fallen from 6,160 in 1994 to 4,750 in  1997.   The

relapse rate of drug addicts has also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>



improved.  The relapse rate means that people who took drugs and

after  a  period,  they  went back  to  drugs.   This  has  also

improved.  It has declined steadily from 81% in 1994 to  56%  in

1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one indicator whether we are getting more drug addicts

or  not  is  the  arrest of the number of  arrest  of  new  drug

addicts,  ie, people who are arrested for the first  time.   The

number  of new drug addicts arrested  also registered a decline.

Compared  to 1996 when we arrested 1,420 new drug addicts,  last

year, only 1,130 new addicts were arrested.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other indicators such as the continued high price and low

purity level of heroin also  confirm that the drug situation  in

Singapore  has  actually  improved.   The  heroin  purity  level

dropped to an all-time low of about 3-4% in 1997, compared to 7%

in  1996.   What this means, according to CNB, is that the  drug

suppliers,  people who supply drugs to the addicts, are  finding

it  more  and  more  difficult to get drugs and  therefore  they

reduce the purity level of heroin in the phials supplied to  the

addicts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have kept the drug situation under control through

a  multi-pronged  strategy of preventive drug  education,  tough

laws,  strict  enforcement, rehabilitation and after-care.   The

National  Council  Against  Drug  Abuse  (NCADA),  the   Central

Narcotics  Bureau, the voluntary organisations,  all  work  very

closely  together with the schools, the youth organisations,  to

organise  preventive drug education talks.  Anti-drug  seminars,

exhibitions, advertising campaigns are also conducted  regularly

to  raise  the  public's awareness about  the  dangers  of  drug

consumption.  CNB  has  also  kept up  very  heavy  pressure  on

traffickers  and abusers.  In 1997, CNB mounted a  total  of  46

major  operations which crippled 26 drug trafficking syndicates,

and resulted in 2,150 arrests.  It also conducted a total of 110

raids and checksed on night entertainment outlets last year.  As

a  result  of these raids, 200 people were arrested for  ecstasy

abuse,  while  two  nightclub entertainment  outlets  had  their

operating  hours actually reduced for allowing their patrons  to

use the place for drug taking.  These raids serve as a very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>



strong signal to the nightclub entertainment operators that   it

is their responsibility to help keep their premises drug free.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will not let up on the strong enforcement

actions against the traffickers and abusers.  So far, just  this

year,  three  major  operations have been  mounted  against  the

syndicates and four dragnet operations were also mounted against

the abusers.  93 and 457 offenders respectively were arrested in

these operations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some Members may have read in the papers in the last few

days,   Operation Phantom, which CNB mounted over the  last  few

days, saw the biggest heroin haul from a single syndicate in its

history  that  resulted in the seizure of more  than  47  kg  of

heroin  which is worth  more than $2 million in the market.   We

also  confiscated  116 phials of liquid ice  as  well  as  small

amounts  of  cannabis and other kinds of drugs.  A total  of  29

suspects were arrested, of whom 10 may face the capital charge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1996, I have spoken several times of the

Government's intention to take very tough measures against hard-core opiate addicts. Unlike  what  Mr Chen has understood, we have  so  far  not

caned repeated addicts when we send them to court.  The law  has

not  come into force yet.  But the law will come into force when

the new amendments are made in this Parliament some time later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these hard-core addicts, if they are convicted, they

will  be sentenced to a long term imprisonment of up to 13 years

and  12  strokes of the cane.  Feedback from the prison officers

indicate  that these announcements alone have had an  impact  on

the  DRC  addicts.  This is shown, for example, in the declining

number  of third timer and above addicts in the DRC.  The number

of  third  timer and above addicts fell from 2,850  in  1995  to

2,010  in 1997.  In other words, fewer of the hard-core  addicts

are  now  under  detention in the DRCs  as  a  result  of  these

announcements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rehabilitation and after-care is an integral part of the

Ministry's multi-pronged approach towards fighting drugs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>



Our  rehabilitation programme provides treatment and  after-care

support,  and  also employment opportunities  for  the  released

addicts.   Under  the  community-based rehabilitation  programme

(CBR),  more  than  500  inmates  have  been  emplaced  on   the

Naltrexone  programme since 1995.  Mr Kenneth Chen  asked  about

the success of the Naltrexone programme.  It is too early to say

how  successful it will be, because the assessment time ,  which

is the completion rate, is not due yet.  It will only be in June

this  year.  It is only after , after two years of being on  the

Naltrexone programme, that we will know whether or not they will

go back to drugs.  But so far, after completing one year without

any  breach  of conditions, we have seen that more than  80%  of

them  are  still  on  the  programme.  This  is  a  marked

improvement  compared  to  the  50%  completion  rate  for   the

rehabilitation programme before June 1995.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the CBR programme, addicts are also released into the

community,  eg,  into  half-way houses to  continue  with  their

rehabilitation  programme  in  a  more  supportive  environment.

Agencies  such as SANA and SCORE are also providing  counselling

and aftercare services to these ex-addicts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing employment opportunity is also an important

aspect  to  the  successful rehabilitation of the drug  addicts.

Agencies  like  SCORE have  a number of schemes  to  help  these

addicts  inculcate  in  them a strong  work  ethic  and  instill

confidence  and discipline in them, so that they can  remain  in

the  workforce.   So  far, 14,000 inmates  and  ex-inmates  have

benefitted from the SCORE's job placement services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What sort of problems do we face in tackling this drug

addict situation?  The Government and its agencies and the  non-Government  agencies face two main challenges in  tackling  this

problem.  Firstly, they need more active volunteers to assist in

the  after-care of these discharged inmates.  However  good  the

rehabilitation programmes are, these programmes will not succeed

unless  the organisations have enough volunteers and counsellors

who  are dedicated and committed to the rehabilitation cause  to

implement these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>



programmes.   Secondly, the community must be  prepared  to  re-accept into its ranks the ex-addicts who genuinely want to  turn

over  a new leaf and give them a second chance.  Ex-addicts  who

have  strong support from their family members and their friends

are  those who are most likely to kick off the habit.   Changing

social  prejudices  and attitudes would take  time,  but  it  is

something  that  we must continue to work at  to  help  the  ex-addicts successfully re-assimilate into our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the privatisation of services, Mr Chng said that police

officers  should not waste their training by doing things  which

are not germane to their training or mission.  Let me assure him

that  the  Police always reviews its services to make sure  that

the  services itthey performs are in line with itstheir mission,

and if they are not, itwe  will find other agencies who are most

capable of doing them.  Since we train officers to a high  level

of  efficiency and proficiency, we do not want them  to  perform

non-essential  functions which are not police  functions.   Then

the  police  officers who are freed from all these non-essential

functions can spend more time on crime prevention, investigation

and  maintaining law and order. For example, the Traffic  Police

has  already privatised the towing of illegally parked  vehicles

to  private contractors.  ItThey  no longer tows these  vehicles

away.  The driving centres are also now privatised.  Police used

to  run  athe  driving centre, but this has now been privatised.

For big organisers who want to organise big events which involve

a  lot  of  people  and they need crowd control,  unless  it  is

absolutely  necessary  for the purpose of  maintaining  law  and

order  and  the police hasve an interest in it, like a  national

function, we will also ask these organisers to employ their  own

guards to safeguard the place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police will also be reviewing other types of services

to  see  whether they can be transferred to other Ministries  or

other agencies. For example, noise pollution.  I know that  from

time to time residents would ring up and say, "This construction



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>



site is making a lot of noise.  My neighbour is making a lot  of

noise.   Please  come  and stop them from  making  noise."   The

police  will not do that in future.  The police will  rightfully

pass  this  on  to the right Ministry to tackle noise  pollution

from  construction sites.  We also know that from time  to  time

people  will call up the police and say, "So and so urinates  in

the  lift.  Please come and arrest him."  That again the  police

will also in future not do, and it will consider asking the town

council  or whoever that is the rightful authority to take  over

this  task.  For illegal parking in void decks, as Mr Chng said,

weyou  do not need a fully-trained police officer to book people

for  parking  illegally.  We  will also  consider  passing  this

function  to  the  right  people.  As I said,  the  police  will

continue  to review its roles and functions to ensure that  they

stay focused on crime prevention and maintaining law and order.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin has asked about the Traffic Police

department and whether the Singapore Police Force is really  the

right  place  for  the Traffic Police to be sited  in.   He  has

presented a number of good reasons why the Traffic Police should

be  merged with the LTA.  I am not averse to that. In fact, some

time  ago, I did study this and I did put up such a proposal  to

the  Ministry of Communications and they declined.  I think they

have  good  reasons not to do it.  I have decided to  leave  the

matter  be.   But if the Ministry of Communications  decides  to

take  this over, I have no objection.  I will leave it to  them.

But  if Prof. Chin  thinks that it is better to do so,  I

suggest   he   also   takes  it  up  with   the   Minister   for

Communications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen is concerned about the traffic accidents

and  the number of traffic accidents that he reads about in  the

newspapers.   He is concerned whether the Traffic  Police

has  studied the causes of these accidents and whether it is due

to  the  training of the drivers or due to speeding, or whatever

reason.   He  has  suggested  lowering  the  speed  limits   for

probationer drivers and motorcyclists.  Let me just quickly give

him some statistics on the causes of accidents.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 1996 and also in 1997, the major cause of

accidents is speeding, which accounts for at least a quarter  of

the number of accidents.  The other causes are careless driving,

inconsiderate driving and so on.  Whether it is due to  training

or  not,  we know that when we go for training we obey  all  the

rules  and everything the instructor tells us.  Sometimes, after

we  have passed, some of us do forget some of the rules that  we

have  learnt and decided to take short cuts.  I think all of  us

were  taught not to speed.  I am sure many of us do.  All of  us

were  taught not to beat the red light.  I am sure that some  of

us also do.  So really the responsibility is that of the driver.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whether there is a serious concern about the number of

accidents  or  not,  certainly we are very  concerned.   Of  the

number  of  accidents we had last year, 257  people  died  as  a

result  of road accidents and that number is slightly more  than

the  previous  year of 225.  Of these 200-odd  fatalities  as  a

result  of  road accidents, about 110 of them are either  motor-cyclists  or  their pillions. We are  also  very

concerned  about the motorcyclists because, of  this  number  of

fatalities of motorcyclists and pillion riders, about

one-third of them are Malaysians who come here to work or  visit

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, his suggestion about lowering the speed limit by

motorcyclists and also by probationary drivers can be studied by

the police.  But let me tell him that I have also asked them  to

do  this  some time ago and they have told me that it is  really

not   so   practical  to  enforce  a  lower  speed   limit   for

motorcyclists.  You must be on the road all the time  to  be  on

the  watch-out to make sure that they do not speed, and then you

can  book  them.  If you do not see them, they will be  speeding

anyway.   Not  just motorcyclists but also motor  cars.   So

basically,  we are talking about enforcement and to do  this  we

need  to  have  other  means  of  helping  the  Traffic  Police,

particularly  the  mobile  squad, in tackling  this  problem  of

speeding.  One of the things that we will do is the installation

of  more  speed  cameras on our expressways.  We have  installed

quite  a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>



number of speed cameras already and more such speed cameras will

be installed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Police will continue to have campaigns to

educate our motorists.   and mMany campaigns are organised right

through the year, whether they are drink driving campaign, don't

drink  and  drive  at  the  same  time,  don't  speed,  be  more

courteous,  and so on.  In a few months' time, we will  organise

another speed management campaign to raise the awareness of  the

motoring  public  of the dangers and consequences  of  speeding.

But one effective way of dealing with people who speed is really

to  raise  the  penalty  for speeding in terms  of  raising  the

demerit points and probably even raising the fines.  The  police

is  studying  this.  If, instead of 6 points  for  a  particular

offence  or 9 points for a particular offence, thesey  were   to

be  increased  the  demerit points, then moreit  will  take  the

motorists  will  be  taken off the road sooner  than  under  the

current  system.  The Traffic Police is also reviewing the  Road

Traffic  Act to make sure that they are in line with the current

problems that we face.  If the law needs to be amended, we  will

certainly amend the law to make sure our roads remain  safe  for

everybody,  not just motorists but also pedestrians who  form  a

significant group of people being killed on our roads.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head Q (cont.) -

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (1), Mr Ong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

according  to the crime statistics released by the Police,  last

year's crime rate dropped by 5%, the 9th successive year of drop

in crime rate.  This is indeed something we can be proud of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police Force plays a very important role in ensuring

our  internal  security,  just as the armed  forces  ensure  our

protection  against invasion from outside.   Once  our  internal

security  is threatened, not only will our people's daily  lives

be  affected,  the foreign investors will also be  scared  away.

Therefore,  the  job  of the Police is very important  and  very

challenging.  For this reason, while we need to attract talented

people  to  join the Police Force, we must also  find  ways  and

means  to  recruit  and  retain  the  capable,  experienced  and

dedicated policemen to keep up the good work of the Police Force

and to ensure that the crime rate is kept under control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the moment, if young people who reach the age in

which  they  are  liable for national service join  the  regular

police force, they will be exempted from national service  after

five  years. If we are unable to retain these experienced police

officers  after they have completed five years of service,  then

we  will  have a rather serious problem at hand.  We are  losing

experienced  police  officers.  The Police Force  will  have  to

recruit new officers and train them afresh.  Training will  take

quite  a  period of time, and the operations of the Police  will

surely be affected.   What we are worried is that more and  more

young people are enrolling in the Police Force as an alternative

to  national  service.    As soon as they have  completed  their

mandatory  period  of  service,  they  will  leave  the   Force.

Recruits  with  `O' level passes who  have not  completed  their

national  service, get a starting pay of $1,350.  On  the  other

hand,  those who  go for 2 1/2 years of full-time national  service

in  the  army are paid some $200 to $300.  So from the financial

point



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>



of  view, it is very attractive for these national servicemen to

join the Police Force, because they can get better pay.  But the

question  is:  after five years, how do we retain  them  in  the

Police  Force, and make them take Police as a life-long  career?

If  we  cannot retain them, then the Police Force will face  the

question of manpower shortage every year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that the Police can consider the following

suggestions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, apart from adjusting the pay for the Police

officers, we must also increase various kinds of allowances, eg,

shift  allowance, children's education insurance or  dependants'

allowance.   Police officers will not have to worry about  their

families when they carry on  their duties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we must extend the five-year Police service bond

in order to be eligible for exemption from national service.   I

understand  in the recruitment exercise last year, for  the  700

vacancies,  there were only 300 applicants.   About 88% of  them

were  more  interested in exemption from national  service  than

service   in  the  Police.   So  if  we  extend  this  five-year

qualifying period for exemption from national service,  then  we

will   be  able  to  attract  those  people  who  are  genuinely

interested in joining the Police Force rather than those who are

only  using  the  5-year  stint as a  means  to  avoid  national

service.   In  this way, the Police will be better  able  to  do

their long-term planning for manpower and training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we know that the retirement age for junior officer

is  45.   I know that many junior officers who have reached  the

retirement age  do not want to remain in the Police Force.   Our

retirement age at the national level is 60, and will be extended

to 62.   I think retiring police officers at 45 years is a waste

of manpower.  The Police should review the conditions of service

and  to  persuade those with a good service record  to  continue

serving  in the Police Force.  They can put in another 17  years

of useful service to the Police Force.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that the Police job is a very challenging

one.  Our security, our children, our family's security are all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>



dependent  on the Police officers.  They are the pillar  of  our

social  order  and discipline.  We need capable and  experienced

officers  to  stay in the Police Force to lower our crime  rates

and  to  ensure our safety and security.  But when they  enforce

their  duties, they have to risk their lives.  So we  must  give

them  better  pay  and better care.  I think this  is  something

worth our consideration.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I

would  like to ask the Minister if a central database on spousal

violence  and  child  abuse  cases is  now  set  up  within  the

operation unit of the Police Force.  I am not referring  to  the

archival database on dysfunctional families established  by  MCD

nor  the  quantitative  large-scale data survey  that  they  are

collecting  at  this point.  I am referring  to  operation  data

which will enable police officers to better protect victims with

children, at the same time closely monitor perpetrators' violent

behaviour.  This idea was first mooted by the Ministry in 1995.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police operation data is important for four reasons:

(1) clearly establishes patterns of criminal behaviour over

time on  where, when, what and how the crime was committed; what

age groups, ethnic groups and kind of dangerous weapons used.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Capturing data helps guide intervention, policy

formulation,  as  well  as  identify  the  appropriate  security

measures and case management decisions.  Let me give an example.

If  we only know the total number of rape cases and not indicate

the age groups of the victims, we may be misguided in the way we

plan  our  community crime prevention programmes.   If  the  age

groups  of  victims  are  older,  a  community-based  prevention

campaign,  with  the  support of all forms  of  media,  is  more

suitable  to help increase awareness of this threat.  To  combat

teen  rape,  however,  the  target should  be  aimed  at  school

teenagers  and  street youth gangs.  Teachers and  youth  groups

have  to  be mobilised to talk to school teenagers about threats

and self-protection.  In police training, soliciting information

from a teenager is a different experience from investigating  an

adult victim.  The police



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>



therefore  needs to know the trend and focus their  training  in

developing different sets of interviewing skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Enhance coordination with FSCs. With the amendments

to  the  Women's Charter now implemented and the setting  up  of

island-wide  networking loop initiated by MCD  and  MHA,  police

officers now have additional network channels, through FSCs,  to

enforce  case  management.   It will  be  helpful  if  the  data

captured  by  the  Police  could be electronically  e-mailed  to

select  FSCs  appointed by MCD to take in  police  referrals  on

spousal violence and child abuse.  Then together, both FSCs  and

the Police can reinforce protection to the families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Similar cross-checks on victims and their case

history can be effectively achieved by electronically linking up

the  island-wide  Police network of NPCs and NPPs  to  guarantee

fast   response   to,   and  close  monitoring   of,   high-risk

individuals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seek the Minister's urgent attention to this matter for

the  purpose of enhancing policy formulation and enforcing  good

practices.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Would you like to move on, Mdm Chiang?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> I would like to ask the

Minister  in  the  planning for the Community  Focused  Plan  to

assure effective community intervention programmes, if he  would

consider employing social workers in the Police Force,  as  done

in  the  courts,  hospitals and schools, for the  following  two

reasons:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, cross-boundary skills enhance police enforcement

duties in difficult family disputes such as spousal violence and

child  abuse;  similarly, in traumatic  cases  like  rape.   The

argument is, by combining the efforts of the social workers  and

police  during investigation in such cases, both groups can  add

value  to the assessment of the case by offering varying imports

gathered  from  their  respective  training.   This  effort   is

particularly helpful in cases where criminal evidence cannot  be

established, yet expert opinions are needed to help  assess  the

risk levels of families in crisis.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The job of the Police is not merely to prosecute but to

protect.   Where prosecution evidence is lacking, protection  to

victims  must still be assured, and I argue it takes  a  trained

skill  from  a counselling background to observe the  signs  and

cues  of  potential  hurt  faced  by  the  family  members.   By

reinforcing  the  criminal  processes with  psycho-socio  inputs

during  investigation, we help to moderate the too  often  cited

criticism  that the Police, in the handling of family cases,  is

too  focused  on  prosecution  procedures  and  less  on  victim

protection.   In  rape cases, in particular, the  victim  is  in

traumatic  state.   By  clearly establishing  the  investigation

roles  of police enforcement officers and police social workers,

the former to adopt a line of questioning to establish facts  on

the  act  of  violence and the latter to restore  the  emotional

state  of  the victim through a counselling line of questioning,

two  sets of information can be examined in parallel for a  more

judicious appraisal and judgment of the case.  Over time, social

workers  and police officers, working under one institution  and

guided  by  the standard operating procedure, could  develop  an

understanding of their complementary roles of police and  social

workers throughout the investigative process, and then establish

a  shared  foundation for criminal investigation work in  family

and rape cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is, at the community level, with the

implementation of the amended Women's Charter last year in areas

of   spousal  violence  management,  police  officers  now  will

collaborate with social service agencies in a networking loop to

refer victims for counselling.  Within the framework of this new

operation guidelines, Police social workers can play a key  role

of being the networker and liaison case workers with FSCs.  In a

way, the Police social worker becomes an institutional broker by

increasing police awareness and usage of community services  and

promoting police-community relationships.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are not new ideas. They have been tested in

other countries.  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>



shortage of social workers is a definite challenge.  But  if  we

should let the market of supply self-regulate, the Police  Force

may  pick  up the professionals who decide to leave  the  social

service sector.  Anyhow, if we recognise this principle as  good

in itself, we should lead the way and find solutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will study this idea and let it

germinate to assess its applicability in our context.



<br>3.45 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, my cut concerns the Registry of

Societies  which comes under the Ministry.  My cut  starts  from

the  call  by the Prime Minister in this House last year  for  a

civil  society,  that  the  Government's  wish  and  vision  for

Singapore in 21st century is to have a strong people sector with

self-responsibility by citizens, self organisation by  citizens,

andkeeping self-help from many helping hands.  I think  this  is

pertinent this year when we look at the coming bad times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, people need to organise for a common cause.

Societies,   clubs   and  associations  need  an   institutional

framework.   Article  14  of  our Constitution  gives  them  the

fundamental right to assemble and associate and the laws provide

that  without  registration as a lawful  society,  they  may  be

guilty of illegal assembly or other offences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present laws do allow citizens to register as

societies with the Registrar of Societies.  But the present laws

also  give  a very wide discretion to the Registrar of Societies

whether  to  register  them.  Clause 4  creates  exceptions  for

issues,  such as security and national interest.  I do not  urge

that  these  principles are wrong.  These principles are  right.

But  the  law,  as  it  stands, does  not  allow  for  delay  in

registration  almost  indefinitely, and it  gives  a  very  wide

discretion  to  the  Registrar and the  Ministry  based  on  the

possibility that something might go wrong, not a reality.  As an

example,  if  I  may  draw  from  my  own  experience  with  the

Roundtable  of  which I am a member, it took  this  society  two

years to be registered.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the actual number of such delays in registrations may

be small but I believe there is a perception among citizens that

there  could be many obstacles into registering societies.   For

example,  it  has been observed in some reports by international

NGOs that there are no human rights societies in Singapore.  And

this  is clearly an ill perception because Singapore, in  recent

years,  has  acceded to human rights treaties  and  has  in  its

Constitution, fundamental liberties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my cut proposes to suggest to the Minister that it is

timely  to  change  the  laws and change the  functions  of  the

Registry,  ie, to keep the discretionary powers of the Registrar

to the minimum, to set a time limit for the Registrar to respond

yes or no.  A, and it is my hope that registration of societies,

clubs,  this people sector, would become automatic for Singapore

citizens  with a minimum of discretion, such as you  are  not  a

bankrupt  or  suffer  from  some other basic  disqualifications.

This   analogy  for  automatic  registration  is   not   without

precedent.   It  can  already be done for  the  registration  of

private companies, for businesses.  Should not the people sector

be as free as businesses?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in making the suggestion, I am still mindful that a

society once registered would still be subject to other laws  on

security,  public order, etc.  This is not a situation  of  free

licence.   It is merely to give a licence to register.  Perhaps,

the  role of the Registry of Societies should be changed to  one

that is more supportive and nurturing rather than policing,  one

that   is   like  the  National  Council  of  Social   Services,

supporting charities.  The Registry  of  Societies

should,  in my view, allow, promote and facilitate civil society

groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are already many obstacles to self-organisation

by citizens - time, work and other exigencies.  The Minister and

the  Ministry  would help us move towards civil society  in  the

21st century Singapore by allowing the registration of societies

to be amended in the way I have suggested.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, first, let me answer Mr Ong Ah

Heng's question about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>



extending   the  minimum term of engagement  of  those  national

service liable persons who serve in the Police Force.  NS liable

persons  are allowed to serve not just in the Police  Force  but

also  in  the  Singapore Armed Forces as well as  the  Singapore

Civil  Defence Force.  The minimum period is really five  years,

that is, about double their NS full-time liability.  The minimum

term of engagement (MTE) for Police was reduced from eight years

to  five years to attract more of such NS liable persons to join

the Police Force.  In the past, we had eight years.  I think the

results  were not that good and that is why we decided to  bring

it down to five years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These MTE police officers play an essential role in

ensuring  the  safety  and  security  of  Singapore  and   their

contributions are no less than those who serve the full-time  NS

in  the  SAF, the Police or the Civil Defence.  They have chosen

to  serve  their extended period as regulars in order to  fulfil

their full-time NS obligations.  But when they leave after  five

years of the MTE, they will be liable as operational ready NSmen

and their training which they receive while in full-time regular

Police Force will not be wasted because they will still have  to

do their NS while in the Police.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to Mr Ong's impression that many of them left the

service  after five years, the statistics do not  seem  to  show

that.   Between 1984 and 1992, an average of 67%  of  those  who

served  their NS under the MTE scheme remained with  the  Police

Force.   I think that is a pretty good retention rate.  Many  of

those  who did not stay on decided to go for further studies  or

have  found other jobs, which is quite natural for Singaporeans.

If  they want to find something else to do, they will do so.  So

I  do  not  think  there is a need therefore to extend  the  MTE

beyond  the  five-year period.  A better approach  would  be  to

encourage these officers on the MTE scheme to remain by offering

them  a more fulfiling job, enlarged job, better training,  more

satisfying  opportunities for career advancement and  give  them

competitive  terms and conditions which we have  recently  done.

Hopefully, with all these measures, they will remain with us.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>



But  even if they were to leave, it is no loss because they will

continue to be liable for NS under the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong's suggestion about rehiring those junior officers

who  retire  at  the  age  of 45 is  already  being  done.   For

oOfficerss whose performance is good, we will ccontinue  to  re-employ  them  on  contract.  So long as they  are  operationally

efficient and continue to be able to do their best, we will give

them a job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I just deal with the point which I forgot to answer

Prof.  Chin  just  now  about  electronic  surveillance  in  HDB

estates,  car  parks, void decks, and so on.  We do  not  see  a

major  need in this area.  But I know that in some HDB  estates,

they already have such security systems.  In Bedok, for example,

there  is  a  system  where the residents can  help  to  monitor

themselves.  But if there is a need and the community feels that

there is a need, the Police will help them set up such a system.

The  Police  will not be able to invest resources and  money  in

setting  up  the system.  But in places where we  have  a  large

congregation of people from time to time and we need to  find  a

way  to  effectively police the area, the Police is  considering

having  a  mobile surveillance system.  For example,  in  Little

India  or  in  places where large crowds of people  gather,  the

Police  is thinking of buying the mobile surveillance system  to

help  them  with the Police work.  I will leave it to  Prof.  Ho

Peng Kee to answer the other questions.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, first, let me take NMP Mdm

Claire  Chiang's point.  Mdm Chiang asked if a central  database

on  family violence cases can be set up.  I am pleased to inform

her that the Ministry of Community Development is leading a task

force, comprising representatives from MHA, Police, Ministry  of

Health  and  the National University of Singapore to  develop  a

central  database on abused victims and family  violence  cases.

The  online  database  will  not only facilitate  research  into

family  violence  cases but will also assist frontline  officers

from MCD, Police and the Health Ministry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>



in  the  operational work.  I think this was  her  concern.   It

should  not  be  just an archival database, but  one  where  the

parties can tap online to help them in their work.  I understand

that  MCD has established the basic requirements of the database

and  will commence its study on the systems design soon.  Police

will do its part in the context of this Committee and I will ask

them to bear Mdm Chiang's points in mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other suggestion that she made is whether MHA could

consider employing social workers in the Police Force.  Sir, our

response is that it is not really necessary for Police to employ

full-time   social  workers  as  cases  requiring  social   work

expertise  occur sporadically.  Police is nevertheless  prepared

to   consider   making  arrangements  with   voluntary   welfare

organisations  to  have social workers on  a  standby  basis  to

assist  Police as and when needed.  Instead of Police  employing

social workers full time, a better approach and a more effective

one  in  the  longer  term is for Police and social  workers  to

develop  a good and close working relationship with one another.

I  am  glad  that,  and  indeed  this  has  been  so.   T,  this

collaboration  and  synergy  has  evolved  steadily,  especially

overfor  the  last three years, and I believe  with  Mdm  Chiang

playing  a  part  in  bringing this about.   Police  and  social

workers now cooperate and coordinate closely with each other  at

both  policy  formulation and ground operation levels.   At  the

policy level, the Director of Operations of the Singapore Police

Force chairs the Women and Family Violence Committee, comprising

members from MCD, MOH and VWOs, such as the Singapore Council of

Women  Organisations  and the Society Against  Family  Violence.

The Committee sets out and reviews the work processes of various

agencies  involved in managing family violence.  It also  serves

as  an  avenue  to  explore  new  strategies  to  handle  family

violence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground level, medical social workers refer suspected

abuse  cases to police officers stationed in hospitals.   Police

officers   also   work   with  social  work   counsellors   when

investigating rape, juvenile delinquency and family violence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>



cases.   Police  have also worked out guidelines  to  deal  with

family  violence cases jointly with relevant agencies,  such  as

MCD and the VWOs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chiang talks about the Community Focused Plans that the

Minister  for  Home  Affairs has mentioned  earlier  on.   Every

Neighbourhood  Police Post (NPP) is linked to a  Family  Service

Centre  to  which the NPP can refer victims of spousal  violence

for counselling and conflict resolution.  But besides responding

to  cases,  managing  the scene of incident,  investigating  and

prosecuting  offenders, the police officers also advise  victims

of  spousal violence on the courses of action available, such as

the  taking  out of Personal Protection Orders from the  courts.

In addition, Police can arrange for the victim and the offending

party  to undergo conflict resolution and recommend recalcitrant

cases  for court action.  This is one of the refinements  Police

has  made in dealing with family violence crimes and victims  of

such crimes, something again introduceddone over the last two to

three years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chiang talks about the need for police officers and

social counsellors to understand each other's mindset so  as  to

be  able  to  effectively work together.  She is  probably  also

aware  that  police and social workers conduct  cross-  training

programmes  for one another.  For example, Police has  conducted

lectures  for social workers and MCD staff on police  procedures

and  handling of family violence cases.  Likewise,  the  Society

Against  Family  Violence  has conducted  workshops  for  police

officers to equip them with the relevant knowledge and skills in

dealing with abuse cases, such as family violence.  Such  cross-training  has  helped the police and social  workers  to  better

understand  each  other's role in handling  of  family  violence

cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we feel this is a better approach. To find ways to

strengthen  these working ties between police  and  social  work

agencies.   It  produces all the benefits that  Mdm  Chiang  has

talked  about, and more, better synergy and complementarity  can

be  found  this way than by the Police Force employing  its  own

social workers.  This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>



approach, we feel, taps diverse community expertise in different

ways  of  counselling  and  fosters  community  involvement  and

ownership.



<br>4.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now respond to Mr Tay's point as to whether or

not  the  Registrar of Societies' discretion can be  kept  to  a

minimum.   First, let me say that the objective of the Societies

Act  is  to ensure that groups which may pose a threat to public

order  and  national  security  interest  are  not  allowed   to

establish themselves in Singapore.  I am sure Mr Tay agrees with

that objective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Registrar of Societies does not really have a wide

discretion to reject applications.  Under the Societies Act, the

Registrar can reject an application when the group is likely  to

be  used  for unlawful purposes, or for purposes detrimental  to

public  peace, national security or national interest.  But  let

me  assure  Mr Tay that the Registrar exercises this  discretion

judiciously and will continue to do so.  And indeed this springs

from  Article  14 that he talked about.  Article  14(2)(c)  also

mentions the need for parameters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay brings up the point about delay. I think it is a

point taken.  In fact, MHA has been monitoring this.  As Members

know,  MHA  has  been asking its agencies to  serve  the  public

better   and,  certainly,  we  have  asked  them  to  facilitate

applications.   Sometimes, of course, delays are caused  because

when  the ROS makes inquiries, the applicants take some time  to

come back.  So it is not entirely the fault of the Registry.   I

think  it  is a point well taken.  We will certainly  take  that

into  account.   And  indeed we have acted on  it  as  shown  by

because  of  a  recent  measure that we  introduced.   Now,  the

Registry   of  Societies  provides  applicants  with   a   draft

constitution  based on model rules, because some applicants  may

not  be  very clear as to how to proceed to apply.  The Registry

would  readily  approve any application which adopts  the  draft

model constitution provided as long as the society is not set up

for  unlawful  or  unacceptable purposes.  Any proposed  society

which feels that its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>



application has been unfairly treated may appeal to the Minister

for Home Affairs for further consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this approach that we have adopted does not really run

counter  to efforts to build an active civil society.  In  fact,

it  can  be  said that this approach really keeps at  bay  those

groups whose formation will pose a threat to the interests of an

active civil society.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> The on-line database that was

set  up by MCD has taken some time to realise.  I would like  to

know  whether the Police itself has its own operation  database.

How is it tapped and whether we can get information from it when

we need?  That is my first question.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> This on-going project was not

really  a  recommendation of the Ministry of  Home  Affairs.   I

think in her speech, she said that we had suggested it.  It  was

a  recommendation  of the inter-Ministry work  group  on  family

violence  chaired  by the then Deputy Secretary  (Home  Affairs)

made  in December 1995.  And then a task force was set up  under

MCD  because the committee felt that MCD was the best agency  to

drive  this  project.   The  delay was  caused  partly  because,

originally, it was conceived as an archival type of  database  - which  I am sure Madam Chiang agrees would not be of much use  - and then it was to converted it into an operational database and

that  delayed it somewhat.  Let me assure Madam Chiang that  the

project  will  now proceed at a clip.  Like I said,  the  police

will  do its part to input whatever information that it can  and

then  I  am  sure this collective effort of all the agencies  in

building  up this database will advance the cause of victims  of

family violence in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> My question is: at the

current moment, how is the Police keeping its operation database

on  family violence cases and child abuse?  Do you have your own

Police operation database?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Yes, we have our own.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, for the last 4-5 years,

since  1992, I have been coordinating training classes  for  the

Police  on rape, and it is through that experience that  I  have

learnt  about  the  challenges between social  workers  and  the

Police  Force.   And  that  is precisely  why  I  am  suggesting

employing  social  workers in the Police Force  because  of  the

turfs   and   the   institutional  barriers  which   have   been

established.  Even as I walk in with all my front-line  agencies

to  the training, I feel the "we" and "them" boundary.  Although

we  try very hard to merge our mindsets and try to use the  best

of   our   competencies  to  investigate  and  manage  a   case,

nevertheless, the police feel that we are so different.  But for

five  years, I think we have achieved a certain level of rapport

and  I thank the Minister for giving us that opportunity to  get

entry.   If  we  cannot  get  social  workers  in,   as  he  has

suggested,   could  the  police  then  look  into  the  training

curriculum    and   inject  more  components    on   counselling

principles and the rest of it?

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, first of all, I am very heartened to

hear  from  the  Minister of State that  there  is  an  on-going

attempt to speed up the process of the Registry of Societies.  I

want  to  know whether there is a set goal.  Assuming  that  the

group, of course, responds duly, how quickly would the ROS  take

to complete the whole process?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> To some extent, it will depend

on the objectives and purposes of the society.  I think if there

is  any  delay,  it  would be caused more in terms  of  the  ROS

examining the objectives of the society.  We, like I have  said,

have  asked  the ROS to have its own parameters, its  timeframe.

We   monitor  these  goals  very  carefully.   There   are   set

timeframes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, further to what my friend, Mr Simon

Tay,  has  asked, I think Singaporeans, by and large,  would  be

grateful  to  hear of the announcement by the Minister  that  it

would take a shorter period.  In cases where people pose no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>



security  risk  to the State, would there be a  framework,  say,

within  six  months?  Because I find that it is  easier  to  get

other  societies  registered in Singapore within  three  months.

Why  not  cases of civil societies which are going to contribute

to  the growth of civic societies in Singapore?  The example  of

two  years  is unbelievable.  I know the Ministry is  trying  to

reduce it.  But if all the relevant information is given,  could

the  Minister of State assure the House what is a fair timeframe

to work on?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, it depends on the nature of

the  application,  but  I  think 3-6  months  would  be  a  fair

timeframe to work on.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, before I withdraw my amendment, I

shallwould  like to bring the Minister back to the  question  of

privatisation of services.  Since the Ministry of Communications

is  not  taking over the Traffic Police, will ould the  Minister

still  consider that perhaps the issuance of notices for illegal

parking may be privatised or transferred, let us say, to the HDB

or URA which have car park wardens who can be trained to do such

a job?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> For illegal parking in HDB estates, the

HDB  wardens  are already doing that.  If it is illegal  parking

along  our  roads, we will have to look at the Road Traffic  Act

and  find  a way to delegate or empower other groups to  do  the

job.  We are looking into that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, with the reassuring note of the

quite  sure that we all can rest much easier now.  On this note,

I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of the supply of doctors and nurses to meet

increasing  demand for health care in Singapore has been  raised

many  times in this House.  The White Paper on health  care  has

spelt out the strategic direction which will establish Singapore

as  a  quality medical centre, not only for our people but  also

for those who may come to Singapore to seek medical treatment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of this programme depends critically on the

number  and  quality  of  the  medical  staff  we  can  harness.

Increasing  enrolment in NUS and the Ministry's move to  attract

foreign  doctors and nurses in the last few years will  go  some

way  to  meet this demand.  Would the Minister inform the  House

the progress made in meeting these targets?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional economic difficulties have prevented many

people  from  the countries in the region to seek  treatment  in

Singapore.   I  understand that some hospitals  which  cater  to

foreign  patients  have  already taken  steps  to  downsize  the

facilities.   And doctors who look after foreign  patients  have

also  reported some heavy losses in business.  The question,  of

course, is whether the present downturn is temporary and  would,

therefore, not affect the longer-term demand.  Can the  Minister

comment on the impact caused by this current drop in demand?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Maarine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

over  the past few years, private hospitals havemedical practice

has  developed  quite  rapidly  in  Singapore.   Some  of  these

hospitals  medical  practitioners  have  already  evolved   into

medical  groups and they are continuously expanding their  scope

of  practice.   One  of these groups has even become  a  public-listed   company.   I  feel  that  the  development  of  private

hospitals  medical practice may result in  some brain  drain  of

Government  doctors and nurses to the private  sector,   causing

acute  shortage of medical staff in the public and  restructured

hospitals.  The Chairman of  the GPC for Health has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>



already mentioned that admission for medical students in NUS  is

quite  restricted.  This may be another reason for the  shortage

of  new supply of doctors.   Apart from all this, I think  there

may  be  a  question of income gap and the work pressure,  etc.,

which  have resulted in the migration of Government doctors  and

nurses from the Government hospitals to the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our GPC's visits to the polyclinics and hospitals,

we  discovered that one of the clinics which was supposed to  be

staffed  by  12  doctors had only 7 on duty,  a  shortage  of  5

doctors.   The same situation applies to nurses.  I  think  this

may be a question of social status, remuneration, workload, etc.

We should seriously look into the situation and try to find some

solutions to resolve the matter.  Otherwise, there may  be  some

negative results or undesirable consequences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, for existing doctors, I think their workload is

much  too heavy, and at the same time, this in turn may  affects

their morale too.  Secondly, there will be a longer waiting time

for  ppatients.   And  finally, oOn the whole,  the  quality  of

medical  service will be adversely affected.  I understand  that

the total number of doctors has been increasing every year.  For

example,  in 1987, we had 2,940 doctors.  In 1992, we had  3,960

doctors.   Last  year,  we  had 4,916  doctors.   In  1987,  the

doctor/patient  ratio was 1:940.  In 1992,  it  was  1:800.   In

1997, it was 1:760.  I believe that by the year 2010, our target

is  1:650.  What plans do we have in hand to train more  doctors

or to have more doctors?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of nurses, right now we have about 14,000 nurses.

But  by  the year 2000 we will need another extra 3,000.   So  I

would  like  to  know whether the Ministry  of  Health  has  any

measures to solve this problem of shortage in nurses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, our medical infrastructure is very advanced and

quite good. We have a New Changi Hospital, and the new Tan  Tock

Seng   Hospital  is  already  under  construction.   To  develop

Singapore  into  a  regional medical centre or  medical  hub,  I

believe we have all the necessary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>



hardware.   But  in terms of software, there is still  room  for

improvement.   Can the Minister please tell us  what  plans  the

Ministry of Health has in place to  resolve all these problems?



<br>4.15 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, it seems that there

is  an  enigmatic  exodus of doctors from our  public  hospitals

every  year.  This has led to a shortage of doctors and a vacuum

of  continuity  in  terms of teaching from the  seniors  to  the

juniors  in  these  hospitals.  We should  try  and  clear  this

problem promptly, especially when our healthcare facilities  are

in  the  midst of rapid change for the better.  Before going  on

further,  I  would like to state that I am a doctor  in  private

medical  practice  and  do  not have  any  direct  or  pecuniary

interests in this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the shortage of doctors in the public sector has

to be resolved.  This shortage means over-working the doctors in

the   hospitals.   Job-satisfaction  is  lost  and   morale   is

diminished.  This, Sir, is not fair to the doctors and  is  also

not  good for the patients.  The quality of care that we  expect

in  our  hospitals  may not be maintained, let  alone  improved,

under  these circumstances.  Unsatisfactory work-terms  must  be

the  reason  for  the  often-mentioned exodus  of  doctors  from

Government service for private practice.  What are the  problems

facing the doctors here?  Perhaps the following factors ought to

be looked into:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Unmatched long and tedious working hours in relation to

remuneration.  Well, this will always be a stumbling  block  for

the  public  service.  However, it should be the easier  of  the

problems  to  resolve, and it should be resolved in  conjunction

with  a  whole  new attitude towards the healthcare  service  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Uncertain prospects for their future in the public sector.

The  consideration of a lower income potential together with the

fear  of being phased down at a time when the energies are lower

for  striking  out in the private sector, may be  a  reason  for

people  to leave public service sooner than later.  Perhaps  the

solution here may lie with softening the line of demarcation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>



between  the  private  and  the public  sectors  of  our  health

service.    Allow  the  more  senior  doctors   a   choice   for

proportioned and responsible commitment in both sectors if  they

wish.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The medical officer dilemma. What options are there

for  the senior medical officers?  If not private practice as  a

general practitioner and if not into a specialist trainee  post,

what is there which the public sector can offer on a longer term

basis?   There is a need for some sort of career enhancement  in

this aspect.  Perhaps, a new work schedule, a new pay scheme and

a   new  hospital status could create a new mindset  and  a  new

breed  of  doctors.  If more medical officers can be induced  to

stay  back  because  they can see a worthy future  as  a  career

medical  officer,  there  will be a resultant  positive  effect.

There  will be less on-call nights, less pressures in not  being

speciality trained, less urgency to leave for full-time  general

practice.   In this latter aspect, perhaps the more senior  ones

may  also  be  given a choice for proportioned  and  responsible

private sector as partners or as locums in the GP clinics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the often lamented vacuum of continuity in the

teaching  of  junior  doctors by the more  senior  ones  in  the

hospitals  can worsen. The teaching and training of  our  junior

doctors  needs  to be maintained or our standard  of  healthcare

will   be  severely  compromised.   The  deficiency  of  capable

teachers can only be resolved if:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the system allows for more scope and better rewards for

those who like to teach and to do research, and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) more senior doctors who need to explore their prospects

in  full-time  private practice are obligated  to  contribute  a

certain amount of their time towards the public sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are a small and unique nation. We are more

amenable  to  change things for the better, of  course,  without

disrupting  the  lives  of  too  many  people.   In   terms   of

healthcare,  I  feel that to further integrate  the  public  and

private  sectors and to have them functioning cohesively,  would

be a worthwhile change for our people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, let me first commend

the  Minister for Health for having taken prompt action to  meet

both  the  short-term  and anticipated long-term  shortfalls  in

healthcare manpower.  I note that the intake of medical students

into  NUS was increased from 150 to 180 last year, and  will  be

further  increased to 200 this year, so as to meet the increased

long-term demand for doctors as our population grows  older.   I

also  note  that our public sector hospitals have been  actively

recruiting  foreign-trained  doctors  and  nurses  in  order  to

supplement our local supply of healthcare professionals and meet

the current shortages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I learn from recent press reports that the

regional  economic  crisis  has been  taking  its  toll  on  the

healthcare institutions.  Private sector hospitals have reported

decreases in their occupancy rates.  I have also read of private

sector  specialists who say that they are seeing  fewer  foreign

patients now than they used to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the fact that overall the demand for

healthcare  services appears to have declined, I would  like  to

ask  the  Minister for Health whether his Ministry is rethinking

its long-term strategy and projections for the supply of doctors

and nurses in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, will the increase in the local supply of doctors

and  nurses  result  in an oversupply, in view  of  the  current

economic climate?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, does the Ministry of Health have any plans to

reduce  the  foreign intake and recruitment of both doctors  and

nurses?  If not, foreign doctors and nurses may end up competing

with  our local doctors and nurses for work when overall  demand

for health care goes down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will clarify these two points.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> Sir, in the past several years, we have

seen  an increasing number of specialised medical centres  being

established.   We  have  now  in our midst  the  National  Heart

Centre, National Eye



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>



Centre,  National Skin Centre, the new KK Women  and  Children's

Hospital,  just  to name a few.  There is logic  in  setting  up

these  centres, as they concentrate specialised expertise  under

one roof, which should also help to lead to better treatment and

facilitate research.  There are, however, two effects which need

to  be addressed.  First, how do we reconcile treatment by these

centres  and  those  currently done in other general  hospitals?

While we can say, for instance, that the paediatric cases can be

handled by the KK Women and Children's Hospital, how do we  deal

with  specific paediatric cases which have to be handled in  the

other  general  hospitals?  The same, for example,  can  go  for

heart  cases, especially when the patient has multiple illnesses

and  cannot be wheeled from one hospital to another.  How do  we

ration  the  manpower  required  to  handle  the  treatment   in

different places?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the standalone facilities with their sparkling new

facades  and  very tasteful designs will give an  impression  of

high  cost  treatment.   In  reality, specialist  treatment,  of

course, will cost more.  It will be helpful if the Minister  can

give  an  explanation  on this and assure the  public  that  the

treatment costs at these centres are fair and reasonable and, if

higher,  whether  they  can be justified by  higher  value-added

service?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I go on to the next topic?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> On the school health programme, early this

year  the GPC for Health visited the Institute of Health,  which

implements the school health programme.  I must say that we  are

very  impressed by the comprehensive range of services  rendered

to  our  school  children, especially in respect  of  preventive

health  care.   I  believe that the school health  programme  is

little   known   to  the  public  outside  the   schools.    The

contribution   of   the  staff  involved  should   be   properly

recognised.  I think it will be good if the Minister can give  a

brief account of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>



school  health programme that is being implemented at the moment

and inform our people the good work that is being done.

<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I join my

Chairman  in commending the School Health Service for  having  a

very good and comprehensive health programme for our students in

schools.   The major types of health programmes, namely,  health

screening,  immunisation programme and health  education  ensure

that our school children are well looked after and they grow  up

to become healthy citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, presently, our school children undergo screening at

Primary  1,  Primary 6 and Secondary 4.  These health screenings

assess  their  nutritional status, their growth and development,

their  vision and any other health problems.  These assessments,

I  believe,  are very useful, as we can detect early any  health

problems  faced  by  our children, and thereafter  we  can  take

remedial measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister whether the Ministry has any

plans   to  conduct  yearly  health  screening  for  our  school

children.   If  not, could the Ministry perhaps consider  having

additional screening at these Primary 3 and Primary 4 levels and

also at Secondary 2.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the health problems amongst children is myopia.

I  wish  to ask the Minister whether the Ministry has any health

education programme to advise our children on myopia  so  as  to

prevent  more of them becoming myopic.  Further, Sir, I wish  to

ask  the  Minister  whether the School  Health  Service  screens

students  in  our  junior colleges and institutes  of  technical

education.  If not, could the programme be extended to them too?

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, we always say that

for  the  nation  to be strong we must have strong  people.   We

always  say  children are the future masters of the nation.   We

all know that we must have a healthy body and a healthy mind  in

order to get things done in the best possible manner.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, have we done enough to develop ourselves into

a   nation   of  healthy  people?   This  is  a  big   question,

particularly  on  the  health of our children.   Every  year  we

invest  a  lot of money on education.  However, are we  spending

enough on the health of our children?  When I look at our little

boys  and girls running about in my constituency, many  of  them

are  chubby  and  cute.  But a few years later, when  they  grow

older,   they  have a good chance of turning fat and overweight.

Obese school children seem to be a common sight nowadays.  If we

are  going  to spend so much money on education, yet  unable  to

cultivate our children into boys and girls,  then we would  have

lost the meaning of our total education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am told that when children are overweight, they are less

fit,  and  the majority of   overweight children are  not  doing

well  in  their  studies.  So we should do something  about  it.

Looking  after  the  well-being  of  the  children  is  also   a

responsibility  of  the Government.  While giving  them  a  good

living  environment, we should likewise  give them strong bodies

so  that  they could learn and grow up to be useful citizens  of

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year, the Ministry of Health is spending only $11

million on school health services.  Assuming that there are half

a  million school children, we are spending only about  $22  per

year  on  each  student.   I feel that this  amount  is  grossly

inadequate.  So I would like to ask the Minister for Health what

plans  has the Ministry to ask for more funds for their officers

to  provide  better preventive health service to  our  students.

For  example,  I heard that in many schools, they  are  engaging

some  medical  and  physical  education  experts  to  guide  the

teachers  and  students  on  ways of  healthy  living.  In  this

respect,  the  Ministry of Health should help by providing  more

resources for the schools to improve the general health  of  the

students.



<br>4.30 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, first, I

would like to thank the MPs who have spoken.  On the first  cut,

four MPs have spoken on manpower



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>



supply of doctors and nurses.  Mr Bernard Chen has asked  for  a

report on the progress that we have made in meeting the manpower

targets,  in terms of supply of doctors and nurses.  And  he  is

also  wondering  what  is  theits impact  of  from  the  current

downturn  in foreign patient load.  Mr Goh Choon Kang has  asked

what  are the plans for solving the manpower shortages  that  we

are  facing  in both doctors and nurses.  Dr Lily  Neo  is  also

worried  about the exodus of doctors and wants to know  what  we

are  planning to do, whilst Mr Choo Wee Khiang is also concerned

about  the  downturn in the economy and impact  on  the  private

sector,  and what we are doing to reduce the intake  of  foreign

doctors and nurses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are different perceptions from different angles.

I  would  like to assure Mr Bernard Chen that the steps  that  I

mentioned  last year in this House for increasing  the  manpower

supply  are  being taken.  The first step, of  course,  is  very

important - increasing the intake of medical students from 150 a

year  to 180 in the 1997 intake.  But I think it will be also

useful for me to briefly recap the four key factors underpinning

medium to long-term health manpower projections, because, unless

we  keep  these in mind, we will not be able to appreciate  what

the Ministry is doing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, is that patients' expectations will continue to

increase.  Singaporeans are better educated, and they are better

informed.  Increasingly, doctors tell the Ministry that patients

and  their  families insist on being told exactly  what  is  the

diagnosis,  what is the treatment being rendered  to  them,  and

what  are the implications of the treatment.  This communication

programme  is a very good one.  But, unfortunately, it  is  also

very time-consuming and therefore it will increase the need  for

doctors in the years to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, aging population. With the number of elderly

increasing,  the demand for doctors from the elderly  population

will also increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, medical research. This is also related to what Dr

Lily  Neo  has  said.  It is important that  we  focus  also  on

medical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>



research  in  our medical institutions.  This will allow  us  to

remain  at  the forefront of medical development as well  as  to

ensure  that we are able to maintain a high standard of  medical

care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth is, of course, foreign patient load. It has

gone down now.  But I think once the regional economies recover,

the foreign patient load will also rebound.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first three factors are definitely not affected by

the downturn and, therefore, we should continue with our present

programme to increase the supply of doctors.  The impact of  the

economic  turmoil, in fact, in terms of the Ministry's  manpower

supply,  has  in  fact  been  positive.   The  resignations   of

specialists from the Government hospitals has, in fact, declined

slightly.   For example, last year, in February and  March,  the

two  months, we lost a total of 14 specialists.  This year,  for

the first two months, that loss has been reduced to eight.  So I

think the trend is quite encouraging.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of actual plans to address the shortfall, whichat

Mr Goh Choon Kang has asked for, I would like to break this into

three different categories which are very important: the medical

officers (MOs), the specialists, and the nurses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For MOs, last year, I announced the improvement in terms of

service.   We  have  implemented that.  We have  adjusted  their

salaries,  we  have  adjusted their pay scales.   We  have  also

improved the work environment.  Last year, I mentioned about the

night  calls being very onerous.  We have reduced the number  of

night calls from between eight and 10, to six now.  So it  is  a

significant reduction.  Furthermore, we have also tried to match

the  postings of the medical officers with their interests.   So

if  a person would prefers to work normal office hours, then  we

try to make sure that the person is posted to a polyclinic which

operates  during the normal office hours.  If  a  person  has  a

certain  interest in, let us say, the elderly, then we also  try

to  make sure that we are able to give the postings that fit  in

with  that particular doctor's interest.  And I believe that  if

we can do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>



this  better, it is not always possible to match perfectly,  but

if  we  can  improve on the matching, then I think the long-term

ability  to make the job more interesting for the MOs  concerned

would  be  there, and therefore the long-term ability to  retain

them  would also be there.  Of course, we are recruiting  talent

from abroad.  The healthcare sector in that respect is following

what  the other sectors of the economy have had to do -  recruit

talent from abroad.  And I must say that the recruitment results

have been encouraging.  We embarked on that last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to inform the House that last year alone we

managed  to  bring  back  and recruit a  total  of  160  medical

officers and housemen.  In previous years, we were only able  to

get  about 50 a year.  So last year, with the concerted efforts,

we  have  tripled the results.  I do not think we  can  maintain

this  level,  because what we did was in reaching out.   We  are

also  able to reach out to Singaporeans who were already working

abroad  and  therefore  we brought them back.   That  pool  will

dwindle in years to come.  What is also interesting is that one-quarter  of the 160 are non-Singaporeans.  So, in fact, we  have

been  able to widen our talent pool.  And as a result,  we  have

managed  to  reduce the shortfall in the medical officers.   The

shortfall now is a very manageable 61.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to encourage Singaporean doctors to

return.   We  will continue to have regular dialogues  with  our

medical officers to understand what interests them and help them

to  do  their  career planning.  And I believe  that  with  this

concerted effort, we will be able to continue holding on to more

MOs  and  therefore  reduce the shortfall in the  coming  years.

Once  we  are able to do that, then I think the problem that  Mr

Goh Choon Kang brought up just now, that in the polyclinics that

he  visited, with a planned manpower of 12 doctors, we were only

able  to supply seven - .  I think if we are able to hold on  to

more  MOs, we would be able to ensure that the polyclinics  will

be fully manned in the next few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialists - this is a very crucial group, because

specialists do not only provide service but, as pointed out by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>



Dr  Lily  Neo, the senior specialists are also teachers  of  our

future  generation of doctors.  Therefore, it is important  that

we try to retain the better ones of the senior specialists.  But

having said that, I want to also ask the House to remember  that

there  will  always be a turnover of doctors and specialists  in

the  hospitals  because  if we have, let  us  say,  200  doctors

graduating  each year, and we train half of them as specialists,

it  is not possible for our public sector to retain all the 100.

So it is good, in fact, to have some turnover to ensure that the

public sector is not bloated and also to ensure that the private

sector is not stifled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector, as at the end of 1997, is still short of

70  specialists.   The figure is an improvement  over  the  year

before.   At  the  end  of  1996,  we  had  a  shortage  of   84

specialists.   We were short of 84 specialists.   So  it  is  an

improvement.  And, again, the existing shortage is mainly in two

areas -  anesthesia and diagnostic radiology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a short-term measure, we are asking the restructured

hospitals to continue recruiting from abroad to make up for  the

shortfall.   And we are also reaching out very actively  to  the

private  sector  to  encourage those who are practising  in  the

private  sector  to  devote  some  time  in  the  public  sector

institutions,  do  some service, conduct some teaching,  and  if

they  are  interested in research, we are  also  very  happy  to

involve them in our research activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of retention, it is not possible for the public

sector to pay the same amount as what private sector specialists

can earn.  In fact, we have not paid close to what they are able

to  earn  in  the private sector.  But because of  the  need  to

ensure  that  the better ones are retained, it is important  for

our payment system to ensure that our leading lights are able to

earn  more  and that the gap between what they can  earn  versus

what  they can potentially earn, if they went out to the private

sector,  will be closed or reduced.  This is something  that  we

are looking at very actively now and I think we should be seeing

some change in the coming months.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the overall environment, it is something that we

are  also  looking  at  actively - how to  make  sure  that  the

teaching  is more meaningful, more satisfying, and also  how  to

ensure  that we have adequate research funds for them.   Because

at  the end of the day, this is what distinguishes institutional

practice  from  private sector practice - the teaching  and  the

research.   In  terms of research, we are now  making  available

more funding for research and we are asking the hospitals to set

aside  protected time to enable those doctors who are interested

in doing research to actually conduct the research work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that with all this, we would be able to better

retain  an adequate number of specialists to serve in the public

institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nurses - the shortfall is still very significant,

unfortunately.   Last year, we managed to increase  our  nursing

manpower   by  400.   But,  unfortunately,  the  shortfall   has

increased from 6% to 8%.  And this is because the opening of the

Kandang  Kerbau (KK) Women and Children's Hospital and  the  New

Changi Hospital have resulted in an increased demand for nurses.

We  have opened more wards and therefore the two hospitals  have

had to recruit more nurses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national shortfall in nurses is expected to be about

1,300  between  now and the year 2000.  What  are  we  doing  to

resolve  this  problem which has been with us for a  long  time?

Sir, first, we are intensifying efforts to promote nursing as  a

career  of choice.  As you all know, there are tremendous career

opportunities  available now to our young girls  and  boys,  and

nursing will have to make a strong bid for their attention and a

strong bid for their decision.  So we are doing career talks and

exhibitions.  And I think the results over the past  two  years,

in  terms of enrolment in the diploma course in the polytechnic,

had been encouraging.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also recruiting from abroad for the time being. It

is  very  essential.  Because it takes three years  to  train  a

nurse.  Shortage is with us now.  Service is being affected.  We

need to recruit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>



progressively.   And  last year, in 1997,  we  had  one  of  our

biggest  recruitment drives.  We managed to recruit  800  nurses

from  abroad.  They mostly come from the Philippines, India and,

to a small extent, China.



<br>4.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the longer term, we are also looking at the

fundamentals.   To  achieve that, we  are  now  carrying  out  a

strategic  review of the nursing profession.  The  objective  is

how  to  make the profession, as a whole, more attractive,  more

challenging,  more satisfying.  We have set up a task  force  in

November 1997 to look into this and we expect the task force  to

complete its work by the end of May.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the next cut by Mr Bernard Chen.

He  asked  how  do  we reconcile the treatment in  the  national

centres versus other hospitals and his concern as to whether the

medical  centres  will  in  fact  result  in  higher  costs  and

therefore  higher fees for patients.  Sir, in order  to  discuss

the  first point on how we reconcile the treatment, let me first

explain  that the national centres are not meant to replace  the

existing departments in each of the hospitals, for example,  the

National  Heart Centre.  The National Heart Centre will  coexist

with  the  Heart  Department in NUH and  in  fact  will  provide

support  to the other hospitals, in terms of providing expertise

and working with them on their patients who have heart problems.

For most cases, because Singapore is very compact, the existence

of  a  national  centre will not impact on  the  safety  of  the

patient.   Let us say a patient has a very serious heart  attack

and requires a bypass.  Because Singapore is so small, even if a

person is staying in the eastern part of Singapore, it will only

take  about  20 minutes to go by the highway.  In the  meantime,

the  paramedics would be able to stabilise the patient.  And  if

the  patient  decides to go to, let us say, New Changi  Hospital

which  should be the nearest, the hospital staff there would  be

able  to stabilise him and get ready for a bypass operation,  if

need be, in the Singapore General Hospital or NUH.  So



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>



the  centres  will coexist.  But more importantly,  the  centres

will allow us to optimise the use of our limited resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, having a small population, also implies that the

rarer and more complex cases would be fewer.  Rather than having

these  rarer  and complex cases split over several  centres  and

each  centre not having enough of the critical mass  to  develop

the  expertise,  what  we will do is we  will  now  be  able  to

coordinate  and ensure that these more complex and  rarer  cases

are  centralised in one centre so that the chances of developing

in-depth  skills  will be better improved.   What  we  are  also

doing  is  that  we  are  reaching out  to  the  private  sector

practitioners  as well as practitioners in other  hospitals  and

encouraging  them to come forward and be dual- appointed.   This

means  they can have their appointments where they are but  also

receive another appointment at the national centre so that those

who  are  interested and have some expertise in  treating  those

more complex cases can also now come to the national centre  and

have the advantage of a bigger patient load.  So it is a win-win

situation  for  both the specialists involved  as  well  as  the

patients  who  have such conditions.  Also,  it  will  help  the

profession  greatly.  Because by having the leading  specialists

being  affiliated to the centre, we will also be able to upgrade

the  standing of the profession as well as better facilitate and

coordinate  the development programmes for that  specialty.   It

would  also  enable us to come out with, what you call  clinical

pathways,  ie, for certain complex conditions as well  as  other

commonly encountered medical conditions, a guideline on how that

condition  should  be best treated.  In this way,  the  patients

will get the best possible treatment and hopefully the most cost

effective as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the centres result in more costly treatment? Sir, the

answer  is no, because already at the present moment,  the  fees

charged  in these centres are exactly the same as those  charged

in  the  other restructured hospitals.  But of course  sometimes

the  perception could be that the patient goes in and  the  bill

size is a lot bigger.  But that is because patients going to the

nationalmedical centres tend to be patients



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>



with   more  complicated  conditions  and  therefore  they   are

subjected  to more tests and the result is a higher  bill  size.

But  the  point  is  that  if  they  had  gone  to  an  existing

department,  the  same  tests would  probably  have  had  to  be

conducted.  So in terms of costs, the answer is no.  If you  are

able  to now consolidate the pool of expertise and come out with

more cost effective treatment protocols, over the long term,  we

should be able to see a better control on our healthcare costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to ask my Senior Minister of State to

reply to the last part.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong (Senior Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Aline K. Wong):</b>

I  would like to thank Mr Bernard Chen, Mr Ibrahim Othman and Mr

Choo  Wee  Khiang  for  their  interest  in  the  school  health

programme.   As Mr Bernard Chen said, this part of the  work  of

the  MOH is not very well known.  In fact, thisits work has been

very much taken for granted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school health programme is one of the strategies to

achieve our Ministry's mission to promote good health and reduce

illness.   The health promotion and preventive health programmes

reach out to children when they are young and they help to lay a

firm  foundation  for good health.  This would  bring  long-term

benefits  to  the population.  MOH will continue to place  great

emphasis on such programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School Health Service (SHS) reaches out to about half a

million  students in our primary and secondary  schools,  junior

colleges,   Institutes  of  Technical  Education  and   Sspecial

Sschools.   Mr  Ibrahim Othman asked whether the  School  Health

Service  covers the junior colleges and ITE.  My answer is  yes.

They  are  already included in our programme.  The SHS  provides

three  major types of health programmes for the students: health

screening and follow-up care, immunisation, and health promotion

and education.  These programmes are conducted in the schools by

visiting  school  health  teams and are  also  provided  at  the

Student Health Centre at the Institute of Health.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health screening. A full medical examination is given to

our  students at Primary 1, Primary 6 and Secondary 4, as  noted

by  Mr Ibrahim Othman also.  They are given to students at these

levels  by  doctors  and  nurses who  assess  their  nutritional

status,  that  is,  to  see  whether  they  are  overweight   or

underweight,  to see whether they are growing and developing  at

the  appropriate  pace, to check on their eyesight  and  on  any

other  health  problems.  In addition, Primary 1  students  also

undergo  hearing tests.  Primary 4 students are given  a  spinal

screening in order to exclude a curved spine and students at all

the  levels  are  given an annual vision  test.   These  medical

examinations and screenings are given at important stages of the

child's development.  It is not necessary to give a full medical

screening  every  year.   This is the  opinion  of  the  medical

profession.   Students who are identified with  health  problems

are referred to the Student Health Centre for further assessment

and follow-up management.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Student Health Centre, there are clinics for

students  with  nutrition and weight problems, eye  and  hearing

problems, growth and development and adolescent problems as well

as  heart and spine conditions.  Visiting specialists to the SHS

will  attend  to  the  more complex cases.   If  students  still

require  further assessment and management by specialists,  they

are  referred to the appropriate hospital department.  After the

health screening, feedback is given to the schools.  So if there

are certain students in the school who require special attention

or  exemption from some school activities, such as PE, then  the

principal would be notified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immunisation. The school health teams visiting the schools

administer immunisations against the major communicable diseases

including  diphtheria, tetanus, polio, measles,  mumps,  rubella

and  tuberculosis, according to the Childhood Immunisation

Schedule.  About 95% of the students are covered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health promotion and education. The School Health Service

also carries out a lot of health education activities on leading

a healthy lifestyle, on eye care,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>



personal hygiene and other topics.  The school health teams work

with  the  schools in health promoting activities, such  as  the

school  environment,  canteen or tuckshop  and  also  on  parent

education.   For  some  years now, MOH  has  also  assisted  the

Ministry  of Education to incorporate health education into  the

school curriculum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our students are generally healthy. The school health

programme  has  greatly  contributed  to  this  happy  state  of

affairs.  However, among our school children, myopia and obesity

are  still common health problems.  In fact, in 1997, about  48%

of  the  students have shortsightedness and 12% of the  students

are  assessed to be overweight.  What do we do about  this?   We

educate  the students, the parents, the teachers and the  public

on  these two health problems.  Our strategy for control  is  to

prevent,  detect  and  also correct the problems  at  the  early

stage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For myopia, MOH has set up a Vision Care Committee and this

Committee has drawn up guidelines on measures that can be  taken

by  various organisations to prevent myopia.  And based on  this

Committee's  guidelines,  MOE has embarked  on  a  programme  to

ensure  better lighting in the classrooms.  All primary  schools

have  also introduced the eye relaxation programme and  this  is

being extended to the secondary schools as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for obesity, MOE, as you may be aware, has for a number

of  years  implemented the Trim and Fit scheme which  emphasises

physical  activities and proper nutrition.   Within  the  school

health service itself, we have now a Nutrition Clinic which runs

a  structured obesity management programme for students who  are

moderately  or severely overweight.  We also plan to conduct  an

education programme for parents of moderately and severely obese

children  because,  very  often, the parents  themselves  pamper

their  children.  They are not necessarily convinced and  during

school holidays, they feed them with all kinds of junk food.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>



As  a  result, children will come back to school gaining  weight

again.  So we are trying to educate the parents also.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SHS is able to do all these programmes and keep our

school  children  healthy at a budget of $11  million  per  year

through careful planning and efficient scheduling of activities.

In  health  care,  more spending does not necessarily  equal  to

better  care  or better outcome.  In fact, I think for  $22  per

pupil, we have done so many marvellous things.  We will continue

to  maximise  our resources and study ways of providing  a  high

standard  of  preventive health care for our students.   We  may

also consider extending such health promoting activities to  the

pre-school  age group because some of the health  problems  like

myopia and obesity also affect them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> I am assured by the Minister's remark

about  the  need for continued facilities in the  hospitals  for

specialised  treatment.   But in our visits  to  the  hospitals,

there was some concern expressed that too much emphasis would be

placed  on  the  centres,  and hospitals  like  the  New  Changi

Hospital  or the upcoming Tan Tock Seng Hospital would  give  up

these  traditional specialised facilities.  I hope the  Minister

will  look into making sure that everyone gets a fair  share  of

things.



<br>5.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of obesity, I understand that in some

schools,  school  children have been asked  to  forgo  food  and

drinks during recess time.  Instead of having a bowl of noodles,

they  have  to  exercise.  Apparently, some parents  are  a  bit

anxious  that  their lovely children are prevented  from  having

their  bowl of soup or noodles.  I do not know whether  this  is

the  right  way  to go about things.  Maybe that is  better  for

them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister

whether  there  is  a brain drain problem in  terms  of  foreign

recruited doctors and nurses.  Is there an contractual agreement

between ourselves and the foreign recruited doctors?  Because  I

am  worried  that after having a short stint in Singapore,  they

learn a lot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>



from our medical services and then leave somewhere for good.   I

am actually concerned about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, are there records to show that foreign recruited

doctors have left after a short stint of service in Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards obesity, I wonder whether the Minister will

consider sending  booklets on obesity  to hawkers and fast  food

operators to tell them what have they done to our young  people.

Twelve out of 100 is actually a very serious thing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The parents should not send them there!

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Okay, send the booklets to parents

also.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, a point of clarification

before  the Minister answers the question.  I think the  earlier

remark made was that we recruited 160 doctors in our recruitment

drive  overseas, of whom a substantial number were Singaporeans.

Will  the  Minister please clarify on the number of Singaporeans

who  qualified  as  doctors from overseas?   How  many  of  them

actually failed to gain admission to our local university in the

first place?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, first, on the point brought up by

Mr  Bernard  Chen that some of the hospitals are concerned  that

their  traditional  specialist areas may be jeopardised.   There

are two different types of acute hospitals.  One is the tertiary

hospitals  which would be mainly SGH and NUH, where  we  have  a

significant  number of specialties available in those  hospitals

plus  super  specialisation.  And  we  also  have  the  regional

hospitals which reach out to the broad general public.  The aim,

as has been spelt out in the 1993 White Paper on Health Care, is

that  in  view  of  our compact size and in view  of  our  small

manpower  and  patient pool, it is important for  us  to  ensure

that, on the one hand, we do not over provide; and, on the other

hand,  have  such a dispersion of specialties that each  of  the

departments  now  ends  up  with  a  sub-optimal  patient  load.

Therefore, the regional hospitals, like New Changi Hospital, Tan

Tock Seng Hospital and, Alexandra Hospital, will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>



continue  to  have general departments of medicine and  surgery,

and  they will also continue to have an ability to focus on one,

two or three specialties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not mean that they are going to stagnate there,

because  the  population profile would  change  over  time  and,

together with that, the change in the medical condition and  the

demand  for  medical  care.  For example,  heart.    New  Changi

Hospital (NCH), at the moment, does not have a heart department,

because in terms of the present supply of service, both SGH  and

NUH,  together with the private sector hospitals, are  adequate.

But  we  are  prepared to let the National  Heart  Centre  (NHC)

provide  some supporting services in NCH and allow NCH  also  to

develop  some  service up to a certain level of complexity,  ie,

check-ups, perhaps even some interventional work, but definitely

not  by-pass operation.  So we have to balance, on one hand, the

aspirations  of  the doctors and hospitals; and,  on  the  other

hand, we have to balance against the national interest, which is

how  to  make  sure that we do not unnecessarily duplicate  both

expertise and equipment which are very expensive.  So  it  is  a

continuing balancing game that we have to play.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Choo Wee Khiang asked about the brain drain, whether we

have  a contractual agreement and are we seeing a lot of foreign

doctors leaving.  Is he talking of bond-breakers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards contractual agreements, I believe most of the

doctors  are recruited here and offered contracts over a certain

number  of  years.  So there are normally contractual agreements

binding them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we worry about the brain drain? I think it is a

toss up.  If we are worried about the brain drain and we do  not

go  out to recruit foreign doctors, then we end up with an  ever

bigger  shortage here, which must impact on the quality of  care

and  result  in long waiting queues of patients.  Our experience

has  been that most of the foreign-trained doctors do sink their

roots  here after a few years, because the practice of  medicine

is a very personal thing.  After practising here for a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>



few  years,  they  develop close links with a certain  group  of

patients  and  it does not make sense to give up  that  goodwill

which  they  have built up over the years.  So many of  them  do

sink roots and settle down here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann has asked about the 160 doctors that we

recruited  last year.  Three-quarters of them are  Singaporeans.

That means 120 are Singaporeans.  As regards whether we know how

many of them were trained abroad because they could not get into

NUS, unfortunately, I do not have the information.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, can I make one clarification? Can the

Minister tell us whether the hospital doctors are now given  the

correct recognition and time to do research and teaching?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, I just like to ask the

Minister  how  many of the 160 doctors who were  recruited  were

from the approved list of medical schools.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, in response to Dr Lily Neo's

question,  whether  our senior doctors are  given  adequate  R&D

time,  unfortunately, since R&D has not been a  major  focus  in

previous years, we were unable to give protected time to many of

those  who  were  interested in research.  Our plan  now  is  to

recognise  that research is an important pillar of institutional

practice  and therefore we would ensure that funds are available

to  enable those who are really interested in research  to  have

enough protected time to conduct research and enough funding  to

employ  supporting  staff to help him or  her  in  the  research

project.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Cheng Bock asked whether the 160 doctors recruited

last  year  are  from the recognised medical schools.   The  new

schedule  was  effective end-1993.  So anyone  who  enrolled  in

those  medical schools before end-1993 will still qualify. Since

this  is  1998, and they were recruited in 1997, I  assume  that

they had enrolled in the medical schools under the old schedule,

before the new deadline took effect.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br>5.10 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, if we are so short of doctors,

would the Ministry then consider expanding the approved list  of

medical schools, so that we can have a bigger intake of doctors?

The  present  list is quite narrow.  Does the Minister  like  to

expand that list?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, as I explained last year, since the

list  was  drawn up on certain assumptions that, on the average,

we  are enrolling about 50 Singapore students under that list of

approved institutions, we should spend some time

observing what is the actual outcome.  Our preliminary  findings

are  that, in the first two years alone, since the new  schedule

took  effect,  the  approved medical schools have  already  been

taking  in about 50 students a year.  Our expectation  would  be

that in the coming years, the enrolment of Singapore students in

those  schools  is  likely  to pick  up.   And,  therefore,  the

enrolment  will  actually exceed what we have projected  in  our

manpower planning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we have already proceeded to increase the

intake in NUS; the 180 this year which will be increased to  200

this  year.  And if the need arises, we will be quite  happy  to

discuss  with  NUS on the possibility of increasing  the  intake

further.  But  let us spend some time to watch the trend  before

deciding what to do again.

<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David T. E. Lim (Aljunied):</b> Sir, may I ask a follow-up

question  on  the specialisation of hospitals?  The  New  Changi

Hospital  when  it  was  built, I think  it  had  provision  for

paediatric facilities.  As I understand it, these are not  going

to be used for the time being, but they would be concentrated at

the new Kandang Kerbau Hospital.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of paediatrics, I can understand if a child has

a hole in the heart that having a specialised team might provide

better  care.  But if a child falls down and breaks a  bone  and

needs  to  be  hospitalised, having a  hospital  nearer  to  the

community  may be more convenient to the parents.  I would  like

to ask the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>



Minister  whether  he  would consider allowing  some  paediatric

facilities  still at New Changi Hospital, because it will  serve

the catchment out in the eastern part of Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, I would like to seek clarification

from  the Minister.  Foreign-trained doctors actually come  from

the  recognised  institutions.  But I do not think  nurses  fall

under this category because we recruit nurses from all over  the

world.  I just wonder whether, as a result of recruiting so many

nurses from overseas, our service standards will be affected  or

impaired.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, Mr David Lim asked whether we could

consider allowing NCH to have a department of paediatrics.  As I

mentioned  just now, Singapore is an extremely compact  country.

On  the  PIE, from one end of Singapore to the other,  it  takes

about  45  minutes.  I think now with the road  expansion  works

that are going on, once they are completed, the travel time  may

be even shorter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern here is that, as I have stated, how do we make

sure  that  we  do not end up dissipating our limited  resources

with  a  balance?   When NCH was planned, it  was  very  clearly

pointed out to the hospital that the existing Toa Payoh Hospital

departments will be transferred to the New Changi Hospital,  and

that  the  development  of  new  departments  there,  especially

departments  of  specialties, will have to be  approved  by  the

Ministry.   This  is  because  if,  left  to  themselves,  every

hospital  will  want  to  have  the  whole  complete  range   of

specialties plus, if you have that piece of equipment, they will

say,  "I better have one too."  That is the surest formula to  a

high  cost type of healthcare system.  We have learnt  from  the

other  countries how to avoid that and how to ensure that  there

is  enough  central  control on development  while  giving  each

hospital maximum flexibility and autonomy to operate efficiently

within their areas of purview.



<br>5.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in terms of paediatrics, it is an on-going request

from NCH.  Our reply to NCH is, "Let the consolidation of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>



paediatrics in the new KK Hospital be completed first."  If need

be,  once  KK  Hospital has settled down, I am sure KK  Hospital

will be very happy to provide a satellite operation in NCH.   So

in due course that will be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for nurses, because of the large number of foreign

nurses  here, as I have stated just now, 12% are foreign nurses.

Has  the  large  number of foreign nurses here  jeopardised  our

service  standards?  I would like to assure Mr Choo  Wee  Khiang

that the Singapore Nursing Board takes a very cautious approach.

Before  we  embarked  on  a recruitment of  foreign  nurses,  we

consulted the professionals oin the Board and they came out with

their  conditions and standards.  Not only that, they also  went

to  the key countries of recruitment to get acquainted with  the

key  teaching institutions so that they understand what are  the

methodologies, the curriculum and, more importantly, the  actual

practice  of  teaching  what is claimed   in  that  nice  little

booklet  which  all  institutions give out.   So  we  have  gone

through the quality audits.  Not only that, when the nurses come

to  Singapore, we counsel them. The Singapore Nursing Board also

conducts a test on their competency and, quite often, this takes

the  form  of  a written test.  So there are a lot of  stringent

requirements  in place already to ensure that our high  standard

of medical care is not in any way compromised.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, I think what Mr David Lim wants is

an  assurance from the Minister that in the case of a paediatric

emergency, could the New Changi Hospital at least take  care  of

that patient for just that emergency period and later you can do

the transfer?  I think he must give the Singaporeans staying  in

that area the assurance that in such an emergency, a hospital of

that  size  must at least be able to take care of that  sort  of

emergency,  and not let the poor fellow run all the  way  to  KK

Hospital.  Am I right, Mr David Lim?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> May I add on a word or two first. I thank Dr

Tan  for speaking on my behalf.  I am not a doctor, so I do  not

know this matter as well as he does.  Actually, I take it from a

more practical point of view.  I must declare  my interest.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>



New  Changi  Hospital  is in my ward.    I  have  spoken  to  my

constituents and they had been looking forward to this.   It  is

so  much  more convenient for them. Although Singapore is  small

and  it takes 20 minutes to get from Simei, where the New Changi

Hospital is, down to KK Hospital by car, it takes much longer by

public  transport. It is much more difficult for  young  parents

who may have other toddlers to tag along to make that trip.   So

it  is  just  to  serve the community better  and  not  for  the

hospital  administrators, not so that the hospital can have  one

more  feather in its cap, but more for the benefit of the people

who live out in the east.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, let me respond to the two points.

Dr  Tan  was speaking on behalf of Mr David Lim.  I do not  know

whether  I  should reply to Dr Tan or Mr Lim.  Let me assure  Dr

Tan  that  all  emergency cases are stabilised in the  receiving

hospital  before they are transferred to the hospital  with  the

relevant expertise, whether it is paediatrics, a head injury  or

a heart condition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned to Mr David Lim, this will be done in

due course.  Give KK Hospital a chance to consolidate what it is

doing.   I  am sure that the CEO and the doctors of KK  Hospital

will be very happy to spread their wings.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in 1993, we set up

Medifund.   To  the  poor  people it is a  very  important  fund

because people who really cannot afford the medical fees will be

able  to  apply  for grants from this Medifund.  The  fund  also

ensures that no citizen in Singapore will be deprived of medical

care just because he cannot afford to pay for the medical fees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, there were over 40,000 applicants. In 1996, there

were  56,000  applicants.  Last year there were  around  50,000.

Funding  from Medifund came to about $10 million.  According  to

the statistics, more than 90% of the applications were approved.

But  I  understand that many citizens still do not know  of  the

existence of Medifund, or they do not know how to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>



go  about applying for the fund.  Many of them approached  their

MPs  for assistance.  Generally, all the PAP  MPs  know  how  to

assist them.  I am not sure about the Opposition Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, these people can apply directly to the hospitals.

They  can  also apply for Medifund through the CDC.  I hope  the

Government can step up the publicity on Medifund for the benefit

of the ordinary citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing I want to point out is that since 1993 the

Government has already injected $600 million capital grants into

Medifund.  Because the fund is financed from the interest earned

from  the  capital grant, the capital will not be used  up.   In

1993,  it  was $200 million, and from 1994 onwards it  was  $100

million per year, making a total of $600 million.  This year, no

grant  is provided because of financial difficultiesturmoil  and

economic slowdown.  I hope the Minister can give us an assurance

that  in  future years when the economy improves,  the  Medifund

will continue to be topped up.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, the Medical Endowment Fund or

Medifund  is  an  endowment fund set up in  1993.   The  initial

contribution  of $200 million was made by the Government,  after

which an additional $100 million was added to the endowment fund

by  the  Government  for each of the following  three  financial

years,  bringing the total endowment fund to $500  million.  The

purpose of the Medifund, Sir, is to assist needy Singaporeans to

pay for medical care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Medifund is the most obvious expression of the

promise  by the  Government that no Singaporean will be deprived

of healthcare for lack of financial means.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note from the latest annual report of the Ministry

of Health that there were about 58,000 applications for Medifund

assistance  and of which 99.4% were approved.  The total  amount

of  Medifund help given amounted to $12.4 million.  Unless I  am

wrong,  most  of  the applications for Medifund assistance  came

through  screenings carried out by hospital social workers.   If

true, some measure of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>



screening  would already have been carried out  by  the  medical

social worker and the figure of 0.6% of the applicants who  were

unsuccessful may be higher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to the Minister is whether medical social

workers  at hospitals screen potential applications before  they

apply  for Medifund assistance.  If so, whether there were  many

potential  applicants who were turned away at that  stage,  with

the result that there could be a  higher figure than the 0.6% as

listed in the annual report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question, Sir, is whether the Ministry will

consider  making the process of applying for Medifund assistance

more  transparent so that applicants can know  in  advance  what

criteria  apply and whether there are avenues available  for  an

appeal to be made in the event that he or she is unsuccessful.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, at the moment, the use of Medisave is

limited  to  payment  of  expenses  in  the  acute-care  general

hospitals.  The use of Medisave should be extended to bona  fide

MOH-approved nursing homes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like this House to consider the following

often mentioned factors:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) We are now expecting people to live longer, even beyond

80 years of age.  As such, there will be an increasing number of

patients  with  chronic  illnesses and most  of  them  would  be

requiring  mainly,  if not, only care in nursing  homes.   Using

Medisave  and  MediShield would certainly ease the heavy  burden

tremendously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Obviate the need for some patients opting for the more

expensive  hospital  beds.  The  general  preference   of   most

Singaporeans using Medisave instead of cash is indisputable  and

understandable.   Just  so that the bill  may  be  paid  through

Medisave, an acute care bed is wasted and at higher cost too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The general and even the community hospitals would have

lesser  problems  at discharging the less critical  cases.   The

patients and their families

would  be  happier  because there is, at  least,  some  sort  of

continuing care made available to them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the above considerations, may I urge the

Minister for Health to look into this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I continue with my next cut on affordability?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, carry on.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> A crucial dilemma which many of our people,

especially in their old age, may face in the future will be  the

effects of having insufficient funds to meet the cost of  health

care.   This  can  happen  in spite  of  the  Medisave  and  the

MediShield schemes which we have in place even as of now.   This

is due to the fact that people are going to be living longer and

healthcare   costs   are  undoubtedly  going   to   be   higher.

Furthermore,  we  do  not have in place the  kind  of  financial

support  needed  by the increasing numbers of  chronic  sick  in

those institutions where, at the moment, Medisave and MediShield

cannot be used.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this problem has to be looked into now and we must

come  up with the solutions in good time.  The Medifund, set  up

by  the  Government not too long ago, is one step in  the  right

direction.  However, further steps must be taken or we will need

huge  increases in Medifund and other subsidies, at the  expense

of  the next generation, to cater for the progressive demands of

good  healthcare  for all.  This can become a problem  so  large

that  the undue economic burdens placed upon the Government  and

the  future taxpayers become untenable.  Will we always have the

economic success to guarantee that no Singaporean will be denied

of  medical  care due to the lack of means?  Are we prepared  to

become a healthcare welfare state?  No.



<br>5.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just one episode of severe illness requiring intensive care

and  recuperative  stay in hospital can cost more  than  $10,000

even  at  current C-class bed charges.  For those  with  chronic

illnesses, substantial amounts of money may be needed for fairly

frequent long term hospital stays.  Sir, at the moment the total

amount of Medisave which our CPF



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>



members need to set aside is $20,000.  If these CPF members  are

also  covered by MediShield, they can claim a maximum of $20,000

per  policy  year and $80,000 per lifetime.  This means  we  can

have one category of people having, at best, access to $100,000.

We  have also to consider two other categories, those who cannot

accumulate  enough Medisave and those who are  already  retired,

both  of which not having that much access.  Now, if people  are

going  to be living maybe 20 years beyond their retirement  age,

the  very finite amount of $100,000 from their combined Medisave

and  MediShield,  for  future use, may not  be  enough  even  at

current  rates.   As  healthcare cost,  in  dollar  terms,  will

definitely  increase,  there will be  heavy  dependence  on  the

children's funds or the Medifund.  It is not good to leave  such

a legacy for our children and country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is having more Medisave the solution? I do not think so.

For  a  start, the majority of people would be reluctant to  put

more  money aside through compulsory savings.  Should  we  raise

the  MediShield coverage?  This is a possibility.   But,  it  is

likely   that   this   expenditure  may  just   overburden   the

subscribers.   It  is  unlikely that  any  simple  increases  in

payment will go down well with the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose that we consider MEDICARE as a further

counter  before  turning to Medifund for help.   The  difference

between  MediShield  and MEDICARE is that  the  latter  will  be

insurance  derived from a co-payment scheme with the  Government

and  it will be cost-index linked.  Perhaps such co-payments may

be  made  by the children on behalf of parents who are  near  or

past  retirement  age.  These features should make  this  health

insurance  more  acceptable to the  people  and  they  could  be

persuaded  to  take up this extra expenditure.   Sir,  the  main

point  here is for us to have enhanced health insurance for  our

people at affordable rates and to spare the use of Medifund  for

the truly deprived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making the public aware and more responsible for their own

healthcare will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>



be  the  key to successful implementation of healthcare planning

for  the future.  While the three `Ms' (Medisave, MediShield and

Medifund) can take care of almost all our needs, complacency and

allowing  things  to  remain  status  quo  cannot  guarantee  us

affordable healthcare in the longer term.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I agree with Dr

Lily  Neo.   What  she said is reasonable and she  has  a  valid

point.  She actually looks at the long-term point of view.   But

I am looking at what is immediately in front of us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, we are facing a regional financial and currency

crisis.  To  many  people, it is a very  sudden  and  hard  blow

because they really do not know what hit them.  In this economic

turmoil,  many countries around us have to tighten  their  belts

and  some  countries,  I  believe, have  told  their  government

departments to cut down on expenditure.   I know of one  country

in  Southeast Asia where even the Ministry of Health was ordered

to  cut down on expenditure.  It is an across-the-board cut  of,

say,  12% to 15%.  Under the circumstances, the quality of their

health care service will surely be affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, our Budget is a prudent one. But at the same

time, I hope that in the exercise of prudence in our Budget,  we

will  never,  never neglect the healthcare for our  people.   We

should  not  cut  down on our healthcare expenditure.   This  is

because,  crisis  or  no  crisis, nobody  wants  to  fall  sick.

However,  should somebody  fall sick at this time of crisis,  of

course, he hopes to be able to get the appropriate treatment  in

time.  At the same time, when he is receiving his treatment,  he

also  hopes that he can afford to pay for the medical  fees  and

expenses that follow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that our Singaporeans will not say, "Don't fall sick

in  Singapore.  It is more expensive to fall sick than to  die!"

I  hope the Minister for Health can assure that this is not  the

case.    During this turmoil, when we are tightening our  belts,

we  are  cutting  down on our expenses.  At the same  time,  our

Singaporeans, especially the lower-income people, can be assured

that their medical care and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>



medical  treatment will not be affected by this current turmoil.

I  hope  the  Government can step forward to assure  these  poor

Singaporeans that notwithstanding the turmoil, they can continue

to afford and enjoy good healthcare services in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, the point which I wanted to raise

concerns  the  standards of nursing care,  a  question  that  my

colleague, Mr Choo Wee Khiang, has already touched on.  However,

I  would  like to elaborate.  Before I do so, I would  just  say

that  the standard of healthcare overall in Singapore has  risen

over  the years and that this is due in no small measure to  the

dedication  of  the  doctors,  the nurses,  the  administrators;

indeed, all the people who work in this industry.  But it  is  a

manpower  intensive industry.  And because of this, we  do  need

people to get the job done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health has over the last few years brought

in  foreign nurses to meet the current shortage that we have  in

nursing staff.  And this has given rise to a number of concerns:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Some foreign nurses speak little or poor English. Although

they  may be able to read, their grasp of conversational English

is  poor.  This makes patient-nurse communication difficult,  at

best, and suspect from time to time.  The concern raised is that

miscommunication over critical issues, such as  medication,  may

result in harm to the patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Some nurses may not be exposed to the same level of

technology  in their home countries.  Here the concern  is  that

they  may not be using medical equipment properly, and may  make

mistakes in setting up the equipment or devices.  This may  lead

to erroneous test results, or to wrong treatment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Another concern, which may or may not be due only to the

employment of foreign nurses, relates to lost records.   I  have

heard  some  complaints of medical records  being  misplaced  or

lost.   For  example, patients have been told  that  their  test

records  are missing, and they have to redo the tests  all  over

again. This cost is not just in time to redo the tests, but also

the  trauma  of  the patient and the time lost in  treating  the

illness.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we welcome foreign talents to work in Singapore

because  they  create even more opportunities for  Singaporeans.

Each  job  they hold means that several other Singaporeans  will

also  have jobs.  And indeed we cannot have excellent hospitals,

world-class  hospitals, without nurses, and without  the  nurses

our  best doctors would not be performing surgery here but  they

will perform surgery in London or in Houston.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore not whether we should have foreign talents

or  not, but rather how we ensure that standards are not eroded.

I  would be grateful if the Minister would update this House  on

the  number  of  foreign nurses in Singapore, and  the  measures

which  the  Ministry  is  taking to ensure  that  standards  are

maintained, not only at the point in time where they bring  them

into Singapore but whether there is an ongoing system to monitor

their  performance and to ensure that they are effective and  up

to the mark.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to ask the Minister whether the

hospitals  keep  statistics of lost records,  how  serious  this

problem  is,  and  whether steps are being taken  to  invest  in

better record-keeping systems.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, I wish to

declare  that I am a doctor in private practice.  Over the  last

few  years,  the  Ministry of Health has spent much  effort  and

resources in building new hospitals and medical centres  to  its

credit.  However, what makes the medical centre or a hospital  a

good  one is not just the physical building or what machines  it

has,  but more importantly, these institutions should be  judged

by the standard and quality of healthcare provided.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time that the Ministry made an objective assessment

of  the  quality  and standard of health that is  given  to  all

Singaporeans who use public health institutions.  In the  front-line  we  have  our  polyclinics where very often,  doctors  and

nurses are overloaded with work.  It is time for the Ministry to

do  a  clinical  audit  of the outcome  and  standards  of  care

provided at our polyclinics.  Many of the lower income families,

less well-off Singaporeans, and our senior citizens use



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>



the  heavily  subsidised  services.  It  is  important  that  we

provide  an acceptable quality of care for these patients.   How

many  patients  with  high  blood  pressure  have  normal  blood

pressure  after  being  treated at the  polyclinics?   How  many

diabetic patients have well controlled blood sugar levels  after

being treated at the polyclinics?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good control of common medical ailments, like high blood

pressure and diabetes, will reduce the incidence of more serious

diseases, like stroke and heart diseases.  The Ministry can only

realise  its  objective of providing a high quality  of  medical

care if the large majority of patients with common ailments  are

well  managed.   Hence,  it is time for the  Ministry  to  do  a

clinical   audit   on  the  standards  of   care   provided   in

polyclinics.   It  can then identify areas  of  weaknesses,  for

example,  if there are insufficient medical staff, and  overcome

these problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the hospital level, patients who are seen at the

Accident  and  Emergency Department may have to  wait  for  long

periods  before being admitted to the hospitals.   My  residents

have  seen  me  to  complain about the long waiting  period  for

transfer  to  the  wards after being seen at  the  Accident  and

Emergency  Department.  Despite the serious illness  that  their

relatives  have  had, no beds could be found in  the  subsidised

ward  and they had to wait for several hours.  While waiting  at

the Emergency Department for a long duration, no definitive care

was administered.  Unfortunately, for two of my residents, their

relatives died shortly after admission to the hospital.  I think

this  is a major weakness in our hospital system which needs  to

be addressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several potential options which the Ministry may

want to consider:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First option: to admit subsidised patients who have serious

illnesses  and  require urgent attention to the first  available

bed, even though it may mean having a subsidised patient lodging

at a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>



paying  bed  and being charged at subsidised  rates.   This

should not only apply after office hours but throughout the day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second option: to have the ward medical team come to the

Emergency Department to review and treat patients while they are

waiting for transfer to the hospital ward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or perhaps a third option: to have a team of doctors at the

Emergency Department who are sufficiently well trained and whose

primary  role  is  to initiate treatment and  do  the  necessary

investigations  while the patient is awaiting admission  to  the

ward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should perhaps also be a classification system for

admission.   Patients  who  are  very  ill  and  require  urgent

attention  should  perhaps  be  classified  as  "priority   one"

patients,  and  these  patients must be  attended  to  within  a

stipulated  time-frame.   Patients  who  are  ill  and   require

hospital  admission  but do not require  attention  so  urgently

should   perhaps  be  classified  as  "priority  two"  patients.

Perhaps it is time to have ISO standards for delivery of medical

care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon admission to the hospital, again, there are other new

dilemmas.   For  example,  in Singapore General  Hospital  where

virtually  all the departments are very specialised  departments

and  there  is no real general medicine department, there  is  a

dilemma  for  the  doctor  at the A&E  department  as  to  which

department  to  admit  the  patient  to,  if  he  has  multiple-problems.   And  when  the patient with  multiple  problems  get

admitted to the ward, will the doctors be so focused with  their

own  specialty that they do not pay adequate attention to  other

specialties?   For example, if a patient with breathlessness  is

admitted  to the ward and has a heart problem but gets  admitted

to  the  Chest  Ward, will it be such that the  doctors  are  so

focused on the chest problems that the heart problems are missed

totally?  I think these and other issues have to be addressed by

the  Ministry.   Yes, it is good to have new hospitals  and  new

machines but I think, most importantly, we must have a high



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>



standard of medical care.  Only by delivering a good quality  of

medical  care,  can Singapore lay its claim to be  a  Centre  of

Medical Excellence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I continue, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br>5.45 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, in the last few years, the

Ministry  has  spent significant amounts of money in  developing

new   hospitals  and  specialist  centres.   However,  in   some

hospitals, the occupancy rate for paying beds is not high.   For

example,  I  have  had  the opportunity  to  visit  some  of  my

grassroots members who have been hospitalised in the Kent  Ridge

Wing of NUH and I was surprised that the place was rather quiet.

Not too long ago, it was publicised in the newspapers that there

were  plans  for building a hospital wing near NUH  where  Johns

Hopkins Hospital will be involved.  I am concerned that  we  may

be  building  more  than  is necessary.   Residents  have  given

feedback  that  it is not unusual to wait for long  periods  for

admission to subsidised ward.  But it is often not too difficult

to  get admission to paying wards.  Is there a misallocation  of

resources  resulting in insufficient subsidised  beds  andby  an

excess  of paying beds?  Our hospital facilities should be  used

efficiently   and  perhaps  the  redistribution  of   beds   and

allocation  of  resources will help to overcome  some  of  these

bottlenecks in our public healthcare system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As these medical institutions are built with public money,

it  is  important that we reassure the public that whether  they

are   subsidised   or  paying  patients,  they   will   not   be

disadvantaged   in  getting  access  into  our  public   medical

institutions.    Hence,  in  the  development  of   our   health

facilities, the Ministry must take into account the  demand  for

subsidised services.  In this economic downturn, it will not  be

unexpected that more Singaporeans will use subsidised healthcare

services.  If there is an increased demand, will the Ministry be

making adjustment in our healthcare facilities to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>



meet this increased demand?  If adjustments are being made,  can

the  Minister  let the House know what active measures  will  be

taken to meet this demand?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, first, let me address the

questions  raised by Mr Goh Choon Kang.  Mr Goh Choon  Kang  has

expressed  his happiness with the work and outreach of  Medifund

but  he  is concerned that there are no additional top-up grants

to  the endowment fund this year.  He would like the Ministry to

ensure  that  when the economy recovers in future  years,  there

will be top-ups to the endowment fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the decision not to top up the endowment fund this

year  was  actually taken after very serious consideration.   If

the need had arisen for top-ups, I think we would have scrounged

around  and argued very strongly for top-up.  The fact  is  that

Medifund  is  actually quite well endowed  now.   We  have  $600

million  and this gives us an annual income of about $21 million

and,  as  pointed out, the outlay of Medifund a  year  comes  to

about  $10  million.   So  that means we currently  have  enough

revenue  flows  to  more than meet the  needs  of  the  poor  in

Singapore.  And even with the economic downturn, I think we have

enough  of a cushion there.  But I would like to assure  Mr  Goh

Choon Kang that once the economy improves, we will of course put

in our bid for Medifund to be further topped up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann asked two questions. First, whether the

medical  social workers actually do brisk screening of  Medifund

applicants  and,  if  they  did,  would  the  success  rate  (he

mentioned  99.4%)  still  be correct, or  would  the  figure  be

actually  lower?   And  secondly,  he  asked  the  Ministry   to

publicise  more  widely to the public what are  the  avenues  of

appeal  for  those people who have applied for Medifund  support

but have been turned down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me answer the first point. Do medical social

workers  screen potential applicants?  To qualify for  Medifund,

there are some simple criteria.  Firstly, the patient must be  a

Singaporean.  Secondly, the patient must be either a B2 or class

C



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>



inpatient,  or  if  an  outpatient,  similarly,  he  must  be  a

subsidised  patient  or  someone who  is  using  the  polyclinic

services.  Thirdly, he has to show that he cannot afford to  pay

for  the  hospital  bills that have been levied  on  him.   Very

simple  criteria.   If  he  meets those  criteria,  he  is  then

referred to the Hospital Medifund Committee for assessment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is the one which I think may sometimes pose

a problem.  Can they afford to pay the hospital bills?  What the

medical  social workers would do then is to review the  Medisave

balances.   If  there is enough Medisave balance, the  point  is

that  they  should then use their Medisave balance first  before

appealing  for  Medifund.  In any case,  the  Hospital  Medifund

Committees  are  made  up  of  grassroots  leaders   and   being

grassroots  leaders,  and having very close  connection  to  the

people  on  the ground, the members tend to err on the  side  of

generosity which is why we have such a high success  rate.   Now

that  the CDCs are also involved, I think the outreach would  be

even better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we help to publicise the avenues of appeal? Sir,

as pointed out by Mr Goh Choon Kang, one common avenue of appeal

is  really the MPs.  And I have from time to time enquired of my

MP  colleagues  as  to whether their residents  are  facing  any

problems  in getting Medifund help.  I am quite happy to  report

that  no MP, including Mr Low Thia Khiang, has told me that  his

residents have had problems getting Medifund support.   Usually,

if  they  face any problems, they will go to the MP and  the  MP

will  make  an  appeal.  So far, the Committees have  been  very

supportive of the MP's' appeal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of publicising the avenues, we will continue to do

that at the hospital level.  Now that the CDCs are involved,  we

will  work  with the CDCs on how to further publicise  the  fact

that  Medifund is available and if they face any problems,  they

can  either  go to their own MP or grassroots organisations  for

support.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo talked about Medisave and the ability of

patients  to  afford the healthcare charges even with  Medifund,

MediShield  and  Medisave.  Sir, I will take her  two  questions

together.   First,  whether Medisave is  adequate  and,  second,

whether we can extend Medisave to nursing homes and other  long-term care services.  Sir, Medisave has been a very well thought-

out scheme, not just in terms of helping Singaporeans to have  a

savings  fund,  but also the contribution rate and  the  maximum

limit for Medisave account.  Studies have shown that the average

adult   aged   21  will  require  approximately   55   days   of

hospitalisation from the age of 21 to the end of his  life.   Of

course,  that is an average.  You are going to get the outliers.

In  any case, based on the 95th percentile of B2 hospital bills,

we  have  computed  that  the life-time expenditure  in  today's

dollars  would  amount  to only $27,000  if  he  uses  B2  class

facilities.   If  he  uses A, B1 or private sector  services,  I

think the figure would be much, much greater.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the key to affordability is that patients should use the

type  of service that they can best afford.  If they are in  the

lower  income group with low Medisave contributions, please  use

B2  or  C  class  ward.   It is for that  reason  that  we  have

implemented  a very rigorous financial counselling programme  at

the  hospitals so that patients who are going for A or B1  class

ward  are  told of what to expect in terms of the bill size  and

are  asked  to  rethink again.  If they do not  think  they  can

afford that bill size, then they can seek to downgrade to either

a B2 or C class ward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Medisave limit of $20,000 is adequate and the

MediShield  limit  of  $80,000, that is,  the  basic  MediShield

coverage, is more than adequate for a patient who uses B2 and  C

class  services even with a catastrophic illness.   It  is  more

than adequate.  But, again, of course, for those who tend to use

higher  class wards, the MediShield limit will not be  adequate.

In  which  case,  I  will  encourage such  patients  to  upgrade

themselves  to  a higher level of coverage by either  going  for

MediShield Plus which is available and should cover A and B1, or

seek private sector coverage.  You have the NTUC



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>



Income which provides a very comprehensive range of catastrophic

insurance packages as well as other insurance companies.  So  if

you  get the appropriate coverage, it would be enough.   But  if

you use a lower coverage to cover a higher cost service like  in

the private hospitals, then of course it would not be adequate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medicare. Sir, as I have explained, the higher level

coverage  is already available, and I would hesitate to  set  up

another  system under the Government when the private sector  is

already  providing the higher coverage for those  who  prefer  a

higher level of service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo is also very concerned about the elderly who require

long-term  care or those who require long-term  care.   I  agree

with  her that this is a real problem for the future, especially

with  the increasing number of elderly and the larger proportion

of  the  elderly amongst our population.  Sir, whilst there  are

some  elderly  who  do require long-term care, fortunately,  the

vast  majority  of elderly are well elderly and do  not  require

long-term care even till their last few days.  There are  people

who  remain very healthy right to the very end and then they die

within  a  very short period of time.  Studies have  also  shown

that  only  2%  to 3% of the elderly will require  institutional

long-term  care,  such as nursing homes or community  hospitals.

Unfortunately, any institutional care is costly.  Even  for  VWO

homes  that  are able to offer subsidised charges,  the  average

charges  of  between $600-$800 a month would mean a  very  heavy

burden to many families.

<br>6.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point is that even if we extend Medisave to long-term care, whatever Medisave funds they have will be quickly

depleted.  A person who now retires at the age of 55, if he  has

a lot of Medisave balances, he still needs to  retain $15,000 in

his  Medisave account.  If he goes into a nursing home and pays,

say,  $600  per month charges, that $15,000 would not  last  him

very long.   So that is not the solution.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to think of a different approach and it is towards

this   end  that  I  am  also  chairing  an  inter-Ministryerial

committee  on  health care for the elderly.  One of  the  things

that  we  are  looking at is how to come up with an  alternative

funding   mechanism  for  the  minority  who  require  long-term

institutional  care.   How do we, in the first  place,  help  to

avoid  long-term institutional care?  How do we  keep  the  sick

elderly  at  home where his medical outlays will  be  minimised?

That is really our focus, keep them at home, support them with a

lot  of  home-based services, so that we limit those who require

expensive  long-term institutional care to the minimum.   If  we

are  able  to do that, the scheme we come out with for financing

will  also  be easier  to resolve.  The committee is looking  at

that  now  and  I will announce the details when  the  study  is

completed in the coming months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Choo Wee Khiang also spoke about Medifund. He was

saying  that he hoped that the citizens of Singapore had  better

not  fall sick or they may die.  Sir, the first part is correct.

I  think all Singaporeans should always say, "I better not  fall

sick."  But it cannot be a prayer, because keeping yourself  fit

and  healthy is something which requires an active effort on the

part  of each and every one of us.  This is the message and  the

intent of our Healthy Lifestyle programme.  This is to encourage

Singaporeans to have a healthy lifestyle, to invest in their own

health so that they do not fall sick.  But if they do fall sick,

first  of  all, we have a health care system which will continue

to  give  them a high standard of care, even though our economic

growth may have slowed down this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The health budget, I am happy to inform him, has gone up,

despite  the  tight  budgetary constraints.  Our  health  budget

actually  went  up  by 7.7%, in terms of our  operating  budget.

With  this  increase, we would be more than able to  retain  the

current  subsidies  of 80% subsidy for a Class  C  patient,  65%

subsidy for B2, 50% for B2-plus, and 20% for Class B1.  For  the

polyclinics,  we  will  be able to retain  the  current  subsidy

target of 50%.  I can assure Mr Choo that the support programmes

are  being  maintained and will be in no  way  affected  by  the

downturn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr David Lim has asked about the standard of nursing. He

is  concerned  about  the  impact  of  foreign  nurses,  but  he

recognises that they are an important factor; in fact, they  are

indispensable  in our current context.  He has asked  about  the

current numbers.  What are the measures to ensure standards  are

maintained?   Do  we  have  an  on-going  system  of  monitoring

standards?  And, lastly, lost records.  Let me answer  them  one

by one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the number of foreign nurses, we have a total of

1,800  foreign nurses in Singapore.  Of these 1,800 nurses,  83%

are  working in the public sector. The vast majority are in  the

public  sector and they comprise about 17% of the  total  public

sector nurses.  Therefore, considering that today we have an  8%

shortage,  if  we did not have the foreign nurses,  can  Members

imagine  the hospitals running with a 25% shortfall  of  nurses.

Some services may be even decimated because of that.  There will

be  long  queues for operations and for admissions.  So  foreign

nurses have helped to relieve the shortage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we do face certain problems. Some of them do not

speak   proper   English  and  therefore  they   have   problems

communicating  with  some sector of the  population.   It  is  a

problem  which,  I  think,  the  hospitals  are  familiar  with.

Because even in Singapore, being a multi-racial society, we also

have  nurses who can speak English but may not be able to  speak

another  of the national languages, or dialects.  Then what  the

hospitals  try to do is to ensure that there is a  good  mix  so

that  there  is some mutual help that takes place  in  terms  of

helping to communicate with the patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was also concerned about the nurses not being exposed to

the  sort of high-tech equipment that we have. The hospitals are

aware that the foreign nurses come from societies with different

cultural  backgrounds,  different  languages  and  perhaps  even

different clinical practice.  Therefore, what the hospitals have

done  is  to set up orientation and in-house training programmes

for the new foreign nurses



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>



whenever  they  join  the hospitals.  And  because  the  foreign

nurses  are  recruited  in batches, it is  quite  easy  for  the

hospitals  to  conduct such training programmes.   The  in-house

training will also include orientation, in terms of use  of  the

sort of equipment that are available in the department that they

are being sent to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospitals also closely supervise and monitor their

performance   to  ensure  that  nursing  standards   are   being

maintained    The  feedback is that, from  time  to  time,  some

nurses  cannot fit in, and the hospitals have had no choice  but

to  come  to  some  mutual agreement on how to  terminate  their

service.  This is also being done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked about lost records. We do have lost medical

records  and I think it is inevitable with the large  number  of

patients   that   our  system  is  coping  with.    Fortunately,

improvements  have  been made.  The number of  lost  records  in

1990, for example, amounted to 1.7% of all patient load.  As  at

the  end of last year, they have dropped to 0.0003% in SGH,  ie,

almost  no  lost  records, to a high of 0.4% in  Tan  Tock  Seng

Hospital.  So improvements have been made but I think  more  can

be done in the other hospitals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they are looking at now is a programme to computerise

record  keeping.  This has already been looked into  for  X-rays

and  the  ordering  of  medical  tests.   It  has  already  been

introduced  in some of the hospitals and  they will move  on  to

the taking of clinical notes and patient diagnosis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Dr Michael Lim has talked about the clinical

outcome studies.  I will let Dr Aline Wong answer that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has talked about the A&E long waits. Sir, I agree with

him  that  some  patients have had to wait at  least  4-5  hours

before  being transferred to the relevant wards during the  peak

hours.   But  I  want to assure him that the hospitals  have  in

place  a rigorous triage system where patients with serious  and

emergency  conditions  are transferred, immediately  after  they

have  been  stabilised,  to the wards.  For  such  cases,  quite

often, the A&E doctors would even ask the ward doctors to come



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>



down to help in providing that preliminary treatment before they

are transferred to the wards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70-80% of those requiring admissions from the A&E

department do have to wait, but most have only to wait  a  short

while.  This is because, since the subsidised wards are all very

heavily  occupied, the bed management can be a bit of a problem,

ie, they have to maybe move patients around, or sometimes ensure

that patients who are being earmarked for discharge that day are

actually being discharged, even though the family members may be

hesitant  to take them home.  I am sure Dr Lim is familiar  with

this problem since he has worked in the public hospitals before.

In any case, we are looking into that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the facilities, he brought up the problem of

high occupancy rate in the B2 and C wards and asked what are  we

doing  about that.  Sir, the occupancy rates of the B2 and Class

C  wards  have  been  going up steadily  over  the  years.   For

example, for Class C, in 1992, the occupancy rate was only  75%.

But  last year, the occupancy rate has crept up to 93%, and  93%

means that it is full house.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class B2 is still manageable. It is very high but still

manageable, at about 87%.  The demand for Class B2 has increased

because,  as  I  have  stated just now, we are  doing  financial

counselling.  So more patients are now opting for B2 and C  than

they  would  have  otherwise.   Secondly,  we  are  also  having

significant numbers of long-stay elderly patients.  They  should

actually  be  transferred to a nursing home or  to  a  community

hospital, just like that step-down care capacity is not adequate

at  the  present  moment.   So they are being  lodged  by  their

families  in  the  hospitals.  Of course, we have  patients  who

should  be  discharged but whose families refuse to  bring  them

home.  These are things that we have to grapple with and we will

have to be more stringent in terms of discharging those who  are

well enough to be discharged regardless of whether the family is

ready  to take them or not.  Otherwise, patients will suffer  by

having to wait even longer in the A&E departments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now reviewing the occupancy levels in the

restructured hospitals and, if need be, after ensuring that  the

patients are being discharged properly, after helping them to be

admitted  into  nursing homes and all that.  If  the  demand  is

still  there, if the occupancy is still that high,  I  think  we

have no choice but to make available more B2 and Class C beds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in nursing homes and community hospitals

should  improve  because in the next three  years,  we  will  be

increasing the nursing home beds by over 2,000, ie, an  increase

of  45% and we will be increasing the community hospital beds by

74.  I think in the next two  years or so, we should be seeing a

significant improvement in the occupancy rates as well.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Sir, a very short response to Dr Michael

Lim's  concern  about  the quality of  care  in  our  Government

polyclinics and the issue of clinical audit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, oOver the years, many measures have been

introduced   to   ensure  quality  care  to  patients   in   our

polyclinics.  We have developed standardised clinical  protocols

for  use in the polyclinics for the management of patients  with

different conditions including diabetes and hypertension.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1994, we have established an annual audit programme

for  different medical conditions, including the common  chronic

illnesses  such  as  diabetes  and  hypertension.   These  audit

procedures   are  drawn  up  with  reference  to   international

guidelines.  Since 1994, we have had clinical audit.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Following what Minister Yeo said earlier on

the  alternative  minority institutional  care  scheme  for  the

elderly  and chronic sick, in fact, it was in my speech  earlier

that I was trying to give an answer to that group of people  who

did  not have enough Medisave and therefore, having this  scheme

where  there  is  a  co-payment between the Government  and  the

patient to help this group of people.  I hope the Minister  will

really look into it and maybe he could understand better what  I

was trying to say.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on preventive healthcare service. "Prevention is

beter  than  cure" is an adage all and sundry knows.   Promoting

preventive care as the way to go is accepted by the majority  of

healthcare providers.  Failure of preventive care will call  for

more  palliative treatment and laborious nursing  of  end  stage

progression  of illnesses  This is most unrewarding.   Not  only

does  it  eat  into people's well-being, but it also  eats  into

people's pockets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we in Singapore doing enough in this respect? The

answer  is "No".  Could it be that we are still very much caught

up in the stage of coping with curing illnesses and the priority

for preventive healthcare had to be compromised?  Sir, we really

have  to redouble our efforts in promoting preventive healthcare

if  our nation is to maintain our high healthcare standards  and

to contain our low healthcare costs well into the next century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Health Service does provide health screening and

some  preventive  care  for our school children.   It  has  been

rather   successful  in  this  area  and  this  is  commendable.

However, it is a very different story in the area of the general

workforce, the elderly and the womenfolk.  It is this area  that

we are concerned about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, only 13.6% of the Ministry of Health budget

is  allocated to Primary Health Care and Preventive Health Care.

There are only five people in the Public Health Department doing

promotional  work  on  preventive  care  for  the  elderly   and

womenfolk in the whole of Singapore.  Another five are  catering

for  the  needs  of  the whole mass of the workforce.   This  is

really inadequate for promoting healthy lifestyles to the  whole

country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest that we embark on a mass

public education programme on preventive healthcare.  There is a

need  to  promote the idea of personal responsibility for  one's

own  health  and  the  ways of attaining  and  maintaining  good

health.   Health screening tests, on a regular basis, should  be

made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>



available, especially to the poor and the elderly who  are  most

in  need  but  the most deprived.  We can conveniently  reach  a

target group making use of the numerous day care centres for the

elderly; we can organise mass programme at the community centres

and  we can increase awareness that such tests are available  at

the island-wide and well-scattered polyclinics.  We already have

a  very good network of helpers, like the grassroots leaders and

other caring residents who can help to reach out to the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also need to provide training for facilitators in

the  community who have the direct and continuing  contact  with

the primary target groups.  These facilitators may be the nurses

at the polyclinics, community leaders of their community centres

or  the  personnel officers in the various large companies.   We

need  a  more  consistent  island-wide  systematic  approach  to

promote different aspects of healthy living and preventive care.

These  activities  may  include items like  (a)  having  trained

personnel  going  around  perhaps on  a  monthly  basis  to  the

different  community centres or day care centres to  advise  the

elderly  and  the  womenfolk  , and  (b)  having  another  group

covering the community at work at their working places.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Community Development Councils, the community centres

and  the  corporate  establishments should  participate  in  the

logistics  and planning to reach out to the people.   Incentives

and  other  aids  should be given to them.  We should  help  the

private companies realise that such programmes will enable  them

to  have  healthier workers leading to enhanced productivity  as

well  as  providing their staff with essential health  screening

tests conveniently and at affordable prices.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): With the aging

population,  there  are  more and more  elderly  people  in  our

society.  Many  of these old people suffer from various  chronic

diseases,  such as senile dementia and other problems.  They are

unable  to look after themselves. Although they stay with  their

children,  more often than not, their children would be  working

outside and therefore unable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>



to  look  after  the  old folks.  The problem  is  getting  more

serious  nowadays, as the number of old people rises.   Although

there  are  home  nursing serviceshomes presently  available  to

cater  for these old folks, these serviceshomes are   run  on  a

private  commercial  basis.  Their  fees  are  high,  and  quite

beyond  the  reach of the lower middle income  groups.   Only  a

small  number  of  such  services  are  provided  by  charitable

organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government will provide inexpensive home nursing

care  for  these people so that they can stay in their home  and

need not go to the nursing home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the nursing homes run by the charitable

organisations,  I  understand  there  are  many  elderly  people

waiting  to be admitted.  I would like to know how many  elderly

people  are  on the waiting list and whether the Government  has

plans to increase the number of nursing homes.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, we

currently have very well established treatment centres,  but  we

are  less successful at integrating appropriately rehabilitative

patients into the society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few questions. I shall rush through them because

of  a  lack  of time.  First, there are no established  half-way

houses  for  the  mentally ill.  This is  very  important,  Sir,

because  this  is  a transitional period where they  will  learn

social skills and work skills.  A period of six to 12 months  is

very important for them to be adjusted and to feel supported  in

a home-like environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, in Singapore, some advocates have queried whether

the Ministry should lead in the development of a broad range  of

psycho-socio  rehabilitation programmes.   Let  me  clarify  for

Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike Woodbridge Hospital which administers medicine to

the   patients,  the  psycho-social  rehabilitation   programmes

actually look into the community resources and identify ways  to

maximise   the  resources  and  help  patients  lead  fulfilling

independent  lives.   At  this  point,  a  large  part  of  this

initiative comes from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>



the  community  and the query is: is this a good  strategy  that

there is very little supervision from the Ministry of Health?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the VWOs are very frustrated by the efforts in

setting  up community mental health services because  when  they

write  to HDB for void decks, their reply is always, "Sorry,  it

is not suitable."  When they re-suggest new void decks for their

applications, again it comes back to them and say, "Sorry, it is

not suitable." Can the Government help by listing the void decks

to the VWOs as to which is more suitable in the first place?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, some neighbourhoods and residents do not like the

idea  of  VWOs setting up mental services in their neighbourhood

because  property sales will go down,  and their property  value

will  also go down.  Is this still true?  How can the Government

help to correct this social stigma?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, I shall be as brief as I can,

although I have a lot to say.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Home Nursing Foundation, if Members remember, was

started by Dr Toh Chin Chye many, many years ago.  It has a good

mission  and  that was to take care of the sick at home,  and  I

think  they have done a very good job.  But I am just  wondering

whether we should look at the Home Nursing Foundation again  and

see whether we could expand its modalities of care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, I think the Home Nursing Foundation takes

care  of the recently discharged hospital cases by dealing  with

simple nursing and perhaps some counselling.  But I am wondering

whether  we could expand this modality of care.  Because  if  we

watch our population pattern, we are getting older, and diseases

like diabetes and hypertension are more common, and disabilities

will set in, especially when they reach the age of 65 and above.

We know all these are coming. So what do we do?  I would propose

that at least we must have some proactive programmes on the part

of the Home Nursing Foundation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has just mentioned about preventive care. I

agree  with him, and I have always asked this House to put  more

money  into the primary health care portion rather than  put  so

much  money into hospital care.  But, unfortunately, I lost  the

battle.  The Government is putting up huge hospitals.  But  this

expansion of the modalities of care would involve actually going

to  the homes.  How do we manage diabetic patients at home?  How

do   we  manage  hypertensive  patients  at  home?   These   are

challenges that I would pose to the Home Nursing Foundation: how

are they going to have programmes to handle all these?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do this, I would propose that the Home Nursing

Foundation should actually go along with the allied health  care

services that are provided by some societies,  like the diabetic

society, cardiac society. Or the rheumatic society.  Of  course,

these societies will come in and they can work out programmes as

to  how  to  manage patients, maximising related to the  various

societies'  expertise so that there will be a good  exchange  of

information and management skills.  To be effective, we actually

need  a  proper, if possible, standalone building, for the  Home

Nursing Foundation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Dr Tan, you are making a very

important point.  But do you want a reply?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Okay, I will summarise my speech. Most

important, they must give funding.  If they do not have funding,

the  Home Nursing Foundation will not be effective and the  CDCs

will  be  very  happy  to  work  along  with  the  Home  Nursing

Foundation to achieve what I want to say.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, my question is very

simple.   According to my understanding, the Ministry of  Health

is  planning  to register  now going about with the registration

of  acupuncturists.  May I ask the Minister to update the  House

on the for a progress reportprogress?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Sir, I have only about five minutes. I

really do not know how I could manage to answer one by one in  a

satisfactory  manner.  But if I can, I would like  to  give  the

last speaker the first response.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On acupuncture, the Ministry of Health has adopted a phased

approach  to the regulation of the Traditional Chinese  Medicine

Practices  (TCMP), ie, first, we have a phase of self-regulation

by  the  TCM  community  initially, and  followed  by  statutory

regulation  at a later stage.  MyThe Ministry of Health  intends

to  register  acupuncturists in  the  year  2000.   This  is  in

accordance   with  the  recommendation  of  the   Committee   on

Traditional Chinese Medicine.  At present, there are about 1,070

acupuncturists  practising  in Singapore.   Many  of  them  have

practised  for  a  long time and many practise  on  a  part-time

basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect the interest of the public and to raise the

standard  of practice of acupuncturists, my Ministry's  approach

is  to  ensure that applications for registration should meet  a

uniform, acceptable standard of competency.  To this end, a  set

of  training  requirements and a common  qualifying  examination

will  be  established to ascertain whether applicants  meet  the

prescribed standard.  Those who pass will be registered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member may well be aware, there is now a

standardised  6-year part-time diploma course on TCM,  which  is

offered  by  the  major  local  TCM training  institutions.  The

acupuncture  training  offered  by  this  course  will  be   the

benchmark training requirement for eligibility to sit the common

qualifying examination.  New graduates from this course will  be

deemed  to have met the training requirement in acupuncture  and

will be eligible to sit for the qualifying examination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the transitional period, however, we will give

consideration to existing acupuncturists who possess  sufficient

training and experience.  Each application for registration will

be  assessed.  Those  who  possess  suitable  qualification  and

experience will be exempted from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>



acupuncture common qualifying examination, either in part or  in

full.     For those who do not possess sufficient experience  or

training,  they  will be required to attend  upgrading  training

courses and to sit for the common qualifying examination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will encourage a local professional TCM body to

organise and administer the qualifying examination with the help

of  foreign TCM experts in setting the questions and the passing

standards.   We will also encourage the major local TCM  schools

to run the upgrading courses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above framework for registration of acupunturists

will  ensure  a  uniform and upgraded standard  of  practice  of

acupunture in Singapore.



<br>6.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me move on to Dr Lily Neo's point. I think I

cannot  agree with her more that we should put a great  deal  of

emphasis  on preventive care.  Are we doing enough?   She  said,

no.   I beg to differ with her.  We try to do as much as we can.

We would try to do more.  But it is a matter of judgment at this

point whether within the resources we have, we are doing enough.

In  fact, we are doing a lot, and I really I would like to  find

out  from  her  wherehow  she gotets the figures  of  only  five

people  within  the  Primary  Health  Department  in  MOH  doing

preventive health work for the elderly, and only five  to  cater

to the entire workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must emphasise that when you work with the community, it

is  not  just the number of MOH officers that matters.  We  work

with   the   community  organisations.   We  work  through   the

professional  organisations.   We  work  through   the   women's

organisations.   And  it is through this outreach  that  we  can

reach  all  sectors of the population.  But  I  agree  with  her

entirely that preventive healthcare is a very good strategy that

will  raise the health of our nation and reduce healthcare  cost

in the long run.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked about home nurses. In fact, the

Home  Nursing Foundation has been in existence for more than  20

years.   It has been doing very good work.  Last year alone,  it

had carried out 45,000 visits to homes to do home nursing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>



for  patients.  This is a charitable organisation.  It is not  a

commercial organisation.  And patients are charged according  to

their affordability to pay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the waiting list, yes, we are right now short of

nursing  home  beds.   In the past six years,  the  Ministry  of

Health  has worked with the voluntary organisations and we  have

built  quite  a number of nursing homes that have increased  our

capacity  by a great deal.  In the last six years, we had  built

eight  VWO  nursing  homes.  At the At present,  we  have  4,700

nursing home beds.  Another 11 nursing home projects are in  the

pipeline.  With the completion of these projects, they will  add

another 2,100 beds and the total number of beds by then would be

sufficient to meet our needs by the year 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang talked about the significance of the

psychosocial -socio programmes.  I understand what she means and

I thank her also for sending me some reading materials.  I think

the  concrete expression of this approach would lie in so-called

half-way houses.  There are at the moment a few half-way houses,

one  run  by the Ministry of Health and a few run by VWOs.   The

Ministry  of  Health  does work with them.  There  are  visiting

psychiatrists  who  work  as honorary ordinary  cconsultants  to

these  half-way  houses.  So tThey provide the  professional  or

medical cover.  They also give professional consultancy to these

homes.   So it is not entirely true that our Ministry  does  not

supervise their work, or has no inputs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with her that we need to work more in this

direction to provide for the number of mental patients  we  have

in  our  midst  and who, after they have been stabilised,  after

they  have  gone through this steady state, need  some  kind  of

rehabilitation  in  order  for  them  to  be  reintegrated  into

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for social stigma, I am afraid iit is very unfortunate

that  in our society there is still quite a bit of social stigma

attached to mental illness.  That is why my Ministry has  put  a

great  deal  of  emphasis on mental health education  in  public

education to raise public awareness and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>



also to educate the public on the facts about mental health  and

how  early detection and management, and so on,  would help  the

patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Dr Tan Cheng Bock talkeds about the need for an

enlarged  role for the Home Nursing Foundation.   I  also  agree

with him.  I can see that the Home Nursing Foundation can play a

much  more proactive role in the community.  It is doing a very,

very  good job.  But I think it can still extend its reach  much

more  through  partnership  with community-based  organisations,

including the CDCs.  And if Dr Tan Cheng Bock, being a member of

the  CDC, would like to work within the Home Nursing Foundation,

the Ministry of Health would be fully behind him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some 1 1/2 years ago, the Government mooted the idea of

having  a  large scale National Exhibition as part of  a  larger

exercise  on  National Education to inform, educate  and  remind

Singaporeans  about  our history, our  roots,  and  on  how  our

country came about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While National Education is taught in schools, the National

Education  exhibition was meant to educate the  general  public,

the  young, the middle-aged and the old, across all sections  of

our  society.  This subject of National Education exhibition was

raised last year at the Committee of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>



Supply  debate on MITA, but no decision was reached as  to  when

the Government will hold the exhibition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the light of recent developments in the region and

the  impending social unrest that may unfold in our neighbouring

countries,  I think it makes it even more pressing now  to  have

this  National Education exhibition.  Singaporeans  need  to  be

made  more aware of our unique position in the region, the  need

for sensitivity as regards race, language, religion and culture,

and the challenges that will face us in the years ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I therefore ask the Minister when will this exhibition

be  held,  and if it would be held after all, and  if  he  would

elaborate on the details of this exhibition?

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, the thrust of our

National  Education  programme has been to  create  a  sense  of

awareness  among our young about how this country of  ours  came

into being.  I understand that schools and tertiary institutions

have  already  embarked on a variety of programmes and  projects

with their students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also concerned about the need to introduce NE to

the  general  population.  In this regard,  could  the  Minister

enlighten  us on the efforts thus far taken by his  Ministry  to

bring the message home to the general population?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this effort is all the more important during this very

difficult time.  I echo the sentiments of my Chairman, Mr  Chew.

During the recent debate on the Budget statement, I spoke  about

the  need  for  Government  to do  little  things  to  calm  the

financial jitters of the average Singaporean.  Now is  the  time

perhaps  for us to consider big things to reinforce the  message

of  unity  among our population.  We have heard of the  need  to

rally  Singaporeans so that as a nation, we can  ride  out  this

economic  storm which is blowing our way.  We do  not  know  how

this  storm will develop.  Will it become a typhoon or  will  it

just fizzle out into a tropical thunderstorm?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not know and we cannot take any chances. Hence, I

would  urge  the  Minister to consider  ways  in  which  we  can

reinforce  our sense of rootedness to Singapore.   What  can  be

done to placate our anxieties and yet strengthen our cohesion as

a people?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder, Sir, if the time is not right for us to also

consider roping in the efforts of

private groups in this endeavour.  Could we not mobilise  groups

at  the  ground  such  as  those affiliated  with  the  People's

Association, arts groups, media, and other concerned individuals

to   work  together  on  programmes  and  activities  that  will

strengthen our sense of belonging and cohesion?  Private  groups

are  well  placed to reach out to a wide audience through  their

varied and fresh perspectives, diverse fora and activities.  Let

us  not  restrict our efforts such that we end up  inadvertently

writing  off  some groups in our country.  To encourage  private

groups,  we  may want to consider putting aside some  funds  for

them  to conduct activities related to National Education.   Let

us  tap  all available resources to build a nation with a strong

sense  of self.  This is a time for us to re-double our  efforts

to  ensure  that  the small man in the street,  small  community

groups  and  other  concerned individuals are involved  in,  and

contribute to nation building.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, the Programme Advisory Committee

(PAC)  and the Advisory Committee on Chinese Dramas and  Variety

Shows  (ACCESS) have recently submitted their reports  and  made

numerous observations and recommendations to further improve our

TV  programmes.  I am sure MITA will seriously look at how  best

to implement some of these recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise to seek clarification from the Minister over

the  longer term objectives of TCS and TV12 in Singapore.  There

has been some concern that there appears a growing imbalance  of

programming in favour of entertainment over current  affairs  on

air  in these stations.  Most glaringly, viewers have found that

the  recent  SilkAir MI185 tragedy was more  widely  covered  by

foreign stations than our own TV stations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are aware that our domestic television stations are

driven by commercial interest as they have to remain viable  and

yet  play  a nation-building role, and it is not easy.  However,

in  view  of the scarcity of resources in a small country,  like

Singapore,  it appears that increasingly with competition  posed

by  cable  TV (SCV), there may be a duplication of resources  if

TCS  adopts a strategy to keep up with the type of entertainment

programmes  that SCV also caters for.  Furthermore, it  will  be

beneficial for Singaporeans who wish to take a greater  interest

in current and national issues to be able to access specifically

to  programmes  that  cater to them more specifically  in  these

aspects.  So it must be in the national interest, therefore,  to

optimise  our  limited  resources by channelling  less  of  TCS'

resources  towards entertainment and perhaps leaving SCV  to  do

the  entertainment programmes, and more resources made available

to TCS towards nation-building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of this, I would like to ask the Minister if

MITA has plans to really review the focus and the directions  of

TCS  and  TV12, so as to reduce the potential drain in resources

from  the duplicative nature of the present state of competition

posed by SCV to these stations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, before I proceed, I need a

clarification  from you.  I see some Members addressing  you  as

the  "Chairman", some as "Deputy Chairman".  For the benefit  of

the younger Members of this House, would you please say which is

the correct form?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Whether the cat is black or white, it still

catches the rat.  But, anyway, the correct form is "Chairman".

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Thank you, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have to admit, and other Members will admit,

that  the  quality of the TCS programmes has improved.   Viewers

now  have greater opportunity of also switching to Cable Vision.

This  imposes  on  our station a greater responsibility.   I  am

concerned  specially with the news and current  affairs  because

Cable  Vision has got far better inputs and many members of  the

public, I know, sometimes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>



prefer  to  watch  these  programmes.  Only  when  it  comes  to

Singapore, they want to watch our station.  I think this is sad.

We should try to improve the standard.  I am not being critical.

I  think it is in the interest of Singapore that our station  is

watched by everybody because CNN and other stations cannot carry

the  message  of  nation-building which  my  friend,  Dr  Yaacob

Ibrahim,  has emphasised, our station can.  In this  respect,  I

would urge the Minister to take an interest in this area and  to

improve on it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, take the example of parliamentary reports. It is

shown 15 minutes after the News.  I think it is rather late.  We

should  have it a bit earlier so that school children will  know

what  is happening.  For the last few days, Parliament has  been

sitting  for  hours, yet in 15 minutes, I think in  fairness  to

TCS,  you  cannot convey the message.  I know the  Minister  may

reply,  "Oh,  there is no audience."  I think that  is  not  the

question.   The audience can be built up.  Even if the  audience

is not there, the people who are going to watch are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>



important people in the society, and for their interest I  think

we  should  try to enlarge, reorganise the programme,  and  also

change the time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is 6.45 pm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the Committee

and took the Chair of the House.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to

report that the Committee of Supply has made further progress on

the  Main  and  Development Estimates  for  the  financial  year

1998/1999,  and  ask leave to sit again on Monday,  16th  March,

1998.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it.
