<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>LOCAL GOVERNMENT BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Recommittal read.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>Committee</b></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 81-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment proposed - [26th July,1957] - In page 107,

line 18, to leave out "nor, except in special

circumstances, the period". - [Mr John Ede].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the words proposed

to be left out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Chairman, if I may

borrow  a cricket metaphor, I feel rather like  an

overnight not-out batsman who has to get  his  eye

in  before attacking the bowling of the  Hon. the

Financial Secretary, and I regret that it will  be

necessary  to  recapitulate, to some  extent,  the

arguments  on this clause 81 which I expounded  on

Friday afternoon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government looked, pardonably, a little

bewildered at the gloomy prognostications  of  the

Financial  Secretary  as a reaction  to  my  quite

simple proposition. Let me make it as brief and as

clear  as possible. We want clause 81 to  read  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every sum borrowed under section 78 of this

Ordinance shall be redeemed within such period not

exceeding  sixty years as the City  Council,  with

the  sanction  of  the Governor  in  Council,  may

determine: Provided always that such period  shall

not  exceed  the  estimated  useful  life  of  the

purpose for which the money has been raised."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2364</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, we agree that 60 years is the

outside  limit  for  the  redemption  of  any  sum

borrowed  by  the City Council. We  further  agree

that  if  the  estimated life of the  purpose  for

which  the  money  is borrowed  is  less  than  60

years - and I quoted, as an example, 40 years for an

extension  to  our power-station - then  40  years

should  be  the  outside limit for the  period  of

redemption. The Hon. the Financial Secretary spent

most  of  his speech establishing these points  on

which  we  already were agreed and on which  there

was no argument.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where we disagree is on the further proviso,

namely,  that the period of redemption should  not

exceed the period of the loan raised under section

79. I gave the House one example. I stated that if

the  City Council wished to raise a loan on,  say,

$10  million  to  extend  the  power-station,  the

period  of the loan being 10 years, the period  of

the  estimated useful life of the extension  being

40  years, then the period of redemption should be

related  to  the  period of the  estimated  useful

life,  namely, 40 years, and not to the period  of

the  loan, namely, 10 years. Because in this  case

repayment  from  your electricity revenue  account

will  be  at the rate of $250,000 per year  spread

over  40  years,  instead of $1 million  per  year

spread  over  10 years, a saving of  $750,000  per

year.  And  a saving of $750,000 per year  in  the

electricity account could mean a reduction in  the

unit price of electricity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went on to argue that it was the declared

policy  of the Government to encourage the setting

up  of  more  industries in the  colony  and  that

cheaper   power   would  be   a   very   important

contributory factor. Two months ago I pointed  out

to  the Minister for Commerce and Industry, in the

income  tax  debate, that the right  hand  of  his

Ministry  did not know what the left hand  of  the

Treasury  was doing. Since pointing out that  many

businessmen  prospecting  in  Singapore  had  been

discouraged  and indeed disgusted  at  being  sent

Income   Tax  Assessment  Forms  under,  I  think,

section  12 (4) of the Income Tax Ordinance  after

spending five days in the colony, instead of being

welcomed to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2365</b></font><br><br>



this island and treated as visitors under, I think

it is, section 13 (3) of the Ordinance, many fresh

cases of this ridiculous persecution have come  to

our   knowledge.  I  shall  be  filing  a  further

question  on this matter in the very near  future.

This  is one factor by which the encouragement  of

fresh industry is being strangled before birth.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> On a

point  of  order,  Sir. May I ask,  Mr  Chairman,

whether reference to the activities of the  Income

Tax  Department  is relevant to this  question  of

funding a loan?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I understood the hon. Member to be

mentioning   that  topic  only  in   passing,   to

illustrate  the point being made.  It  is  not  of

course open for debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Thank you, Sir. The point, in our view,

is entirely relevant. I was pointing out that this

is  one factor by which the encouragement of fresh

industry is being strangled before birth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is the question of cheaper

power  which  will be thwarted if  the  Government

does  not accept this amendment. You and  I,  Sir,

and  every citizen and every existing industry  in

Singapore  are  paying more for electricity  today

than  we  need, because of this policy of relating

the  period of redemption of electricity loans  to

the  period of the loans, instead of to the period

of  the estimated useful life of the power station

for  which  the  loans have been  raised.  But  it

should  be  remembered that the only occasions  on

which the City Council have applied for loans were

applied  in  order to raise loans for electricity,

or for water, and for very few purposes other than

these.  The Financial Secretary's only  answer  to

our  plea  for  greater financial flexibility  is:

firstly,  a  recital  of  words  like  "prudence",

"caution",      "foresight",      "possibilities",

"probabilities", "imponderabalia"  of  all  kinds,

and so on; and, secondly, the proposition that  we

should not give the City Council carte blanche  in

this  matter; and, thirdly, that it might  not  be

easy to raise loans in future. Our answer to this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2366</b></font><br><br>



argument  is  as  follows:  Firstly,  we  are  not

proposing to give the City Council carte  blanche.

Clauses 78, 79, and 81 are hedged around with  the

necessity  for  obtaining  the  sanction  of   the

Governor  in Council, so the necessary  safeguards

are  there. Secondly, if in 10 or 20 or 30  years'

time  Singapore cannot raise loans, then it  means

that  Singapore is sunk anyway; and  I  refuse  to

share the Financial Secretary's pessimism on that.

Thirdly,  the  best  way to  ensure  that  we  are

financially flourishing in 10 years'  time  is  to

increase our industrial potential today,  and  one

of the factors to attract new industries is a more

flexible financial policy in matters such  as  the

one before us today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last point: The amendment to clause 81 has

been     advocated    by    the    City    Council

representatives,  and  their  submission  to   the

Select  Committee can be found in col. 156 of  the

Report as quoted by the Attorney-General:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With regard to clause 83, the City Council in

its Report No. 4 stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Under the provisions of the present Municipal

Ordinance  any  sums borrowed  must  be  redeemed

within  the period sanctioned for the raising  of

the money, i.e., the redemption period is related

to  the  borrowing  period  rather  than  to  the

estimated  useful life of the purpose  for  which

the money is utilised.'"



<br><br>Sir,  I will not quote the whole passage, but only

the last sentence which states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'It is hoped that the Governor in Council will

consider sympathetically any representations which

may  be made in the future for a redemption period

longer than the borrowing period.'"



<br><br>Once  again, let me emphasise that this submission

was  made by Labour Front Councillors and Liberal-Socialist  Councillors in equal  numbers.  I  hope

that  once again the Labour Front Members opposite

are not going to repudiate the recommendations  of

their own Party.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr

Chairman,  Sir,  the Hon. the Financial  Secretary

dealt very fully with this matter in his speech on

Friday  afternoon, and, in rising  to  oppose  the

amendment,  I wish only to supplement his  remarks

on  one point, which point, it seems to me, is the

only one on which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2367</b></font><br><br>



there is major disagreement between the hon. mover

of  the  amendment and the Government. I refer  of

course  to  the  fact that if  this  amendment  is

carried, the City Council will be in a position to

fund loans over a period equivalent to the life of

the  physical  assets to which they  are  related,

rather  than  to  the  period  from  issuance   to

redemption as has hitherto been the case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should like to say that, in spite of what

the  Member for Serangoon and the Member for Telok

Ayer   have  said  in  the  last  few  days,  this

nominated Member's vote cannot be counted upon  by

the  Government. But in this instance I am  wholly

on  their  side.  In the past,  it  has  been  the

practice  in the City Council - and a good practice,

too - to  fund  any  loan in such  a  way  that  the

sinking  fund at the time of repayment  was  in  a

position to take care of all outstandings,  either

by  putting money in there or by buying up  script

as  it  came on the market. To my way of thinking,

any  departure from this practice would be  unwise

in  spite  of the very cogent arguments which  the

Member for Tanglin has put forward this morning in

respect  of the future of industry, and  the  fact

that  electricity  would be made  cheaper  to  the

consuming  public. Mr David Marshall, the  former

Member for Cairnhill, once said in this House that

every  Member of it, with the exception of myself,

is  a  Socialist, but I would appeal, Sir, to this

wholly   Socialist  Assembly  for  a  conservative

approach to this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most powerful point made by the Hon. the

Financial  Secretary was that, if  loans  had  not

been  fully  funded at redemption date,  the  City

Council  would be obliged to convert or  to  raise

money  by new loans, and he said it might be  very

difficult for them to do so. He did not say  where

it  would  be raised, but whether it was in  local

markets  or in foreign markets, I agree absolutely

that  it  might be difficult to do so. The  future

for  long-term  borrowing in this country  is  not

very  bright. Now to this the Member  for  Tanglin

has said that if a time should arrive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2368</b></font><br><br>



when  Singapore  would be unable to  raise  loans,

Singapore might as well pack up, or words to  that

effect.  The  fact is that such  a  situation  has

already  arisen. To my knowledge, the Municipality

and  the City Council have been continuously going

to  the public for loans from 1951 to 1956 and, in

respect  of  the last two loans, it is well  known

that the public were very poor investors. In fact,

had  it not been for certain central institutions,

quasi-governmental, coming to the rescue, some  of

them would have flopped.



<br><br>10.15 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, a large measure of support for these

loans has been given by banks, but with the advent

in   the   near   future  of  a  central   banking

institution or institutions, such support  can  no

longer be counted on. Besides, I think, as I  have

said  once  before  in  this  House,  support  for

government  loans  by banks is  inflationary.  The

root  of  the  trouble,  Sir,  lies  in  creeping,

somewhat accelerated recently, inflation  and  the

ever-diminishing purchasing power of  money.  "The

Economist" of 20th July in a leading article which

I recommend to all Socialists says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inflation is like sin. Everybody is against it,

but it goes on."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present low levels of gilt-edged securities

in   the   London  market  clearly  indicate   the

pessimistic attitude of the public to  the  future

of  Government  stocks. This  is  partly  due,  of

course,  to  political  fears  and  the  fear   of

devaluation   of   the  pound   by   the   British

Government.  Sir,  I  am not  making  a  political

speech  even  in  the widest  sense  of  the  word

"political",  but the Labour Party in  England  in

its  plans for nationalisation is talking  of  the

intention to permit Labour's new national  pension

fund  to  be  invested in equities. Inflation,  in

fact, has worn the gilt off gilt-edged. Members of

this  House doubtless know that the current  price

of  3½ per cent War Loan is £67. This of  course

is  in  irredeemable stock. But there  is  another

3½  per  cent  Government  loan - admittedly   the

redemption  date  is 1999, so that  on  the  Stock

Exchange  it  is known as the "Eternity  Loan" - but

even so its price is only £71.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2369</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the public are not so keen on Government and

Municipal  bonds and the long-term  borrowings  at

fixed   rates  of  interest  by  Governments   and

Municipalities  is coming to be  regarded  by  the

public - and  I  quote  from a well-known  financial

journal - as   "nothing  short   of   an   organised

swindle".  Unless a brake can be put on  inflation

and  faith in Government bonds restored, more  and

more  people in every country will tend to  invest

in equities in order to preserve their capital; in

other  words,  they hope that the  assets  of  the

relative companies will appreciate in value as the

currency  depreciates. When all is said and  done,

any  government  or municipal bond  is  merely  an

undertaking  to repay at a fixed future  time  the

amount originally borrowed; in other words, a  sum

certain  in  money whose purchasing power  in  the

meantime is quite certain to be vastly diminished.

Unfortunately the outlook for halting inflation is

pretty bleak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore oppose this amendment and urge that,

in terms of the existing section, the City Council

continue to fund loans within the period for which

money  has  been raised. One has to  remember  too

that  the  moneys are not lying idle as  they  are

doubtless  being employed by the City  Council  in

the  ways permitted in subsequent sections of  the

Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir,  I rise to meet a few of the points mentioned

by the Hon. Mr Sutherland. Mr Sutherland and the

Hon. the Financial Secretary are always looking at

the problem from the point of view of bankers.  It

is  a useful and a correct way of looking at these

financial problems. But I think at the present day

their  equilibrium has been upset by this creeping

inflation,   as   has  been   described   by   Mr

Sutherland, and like all good men, when they  lose

their equilibrium, they tend to fall backwards and

sit tight instead of moving with the times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a new problem is with us today and we have

to  face  it in a new light. With all this closing

down  of factories in Singapore - and some more  are

closing down - we have to take steps to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2370</b></font><br><br>



encourage  industry and I think one  of  the  best

ways  to  encourage people to carry on in industry

is   the  cheapening  of  power  for  the  use  of

industrial  units  for industries  which  want  to

start  again.  Our trouble is that  we  have  been

paying for posterity. We are now making short-term

loans confined to the term of the loan rather than

to  the usefulness of the project, and by doing so

we  bring  up  the  cost of  the  project - the  $60

million which has been thrown into the new  power-station - and  this now has to be  repaid  within  a

short time by us instead of repayment being spread

over  the  term  of the project's  usefulness  and

shared by posterity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inflation should make us build more now, because

whatever we build now is going to be paid  for  in

less  valuable money. And whatever we pay  now  is

much less than what we shall have to pay in 10  or

20 years' time. That, to my mind, is a very cogent

point  for saying that we must carry on and  build

what  we  can and spread out our payments,  rather

than within the term limited by this section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the question of the difficulty of raising

loans  arises. Every country after it has  got  on

its  own  feet  will  have  many  people  who  are

frightened  of  the course that  the  nation  will

take.  To  a certain extent, that will affect  the

case of obtaining loans. Now that we are going  to

achieve self-government and independence, we shall

have  to  look  for  means of  financing  our  own

projects.   There  is,  for  instance,   all   the

money - millions and millions - coming in every  month

into  the provident funds. Why should not that  be

diverted  and  used for financing  the  industrial

schemes of the City Council? Then again a  lot  of

money is being sent abroad that should be invested

locally - I  refer  to  life assurance  premiums.  I

think  part  of those premiums could  be  invested

locally,  and  they should be  made  to  help  the

public services of this country.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Chairman, the Member for Tanglin

has put up good arguments why latitude



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2371</b></font><br><br>



should  be given to the City Council to  fund  its

loans  over  the period of the life of the  asset,

but he has taken the provision in this clause in a

very  pessimistic light. The words which he  seeks

to    omit    are:   "nor,   except   in   special

circumstances,  the  period".  When  the   special

circumstances are there, I am sure the Governor in

Council  would give sanction for the extension  of

the  redemption period. The provision of these few

words in the clause is made because the credit  of

the  city  depends on the credit of the Government

and  of the country, and therefore it is up to the

Financial  Secretary, or whoever may be in  charge

of  the treasury of the country, to correlate  all

the  financial  undertakings of the City  Council,

the  Government and so on, which are required  for

the  public  sector, and to see that there  is  no

overlapping. Otherwise what might happen  is  that

the  City  Council may have three issues of  loans

over  a  period of three years for the same asset,

the life of which may be 40 years; then during the

40  years you have to fund all these three  yearly

loans, and if you cannot fund it at that time, you

will  have  to  go out to the market  to  get  the

balance, which means that you will have to  do  it

in  a  big  way. So to prevent all this happening,

that  power is provided for in the clause, but  it

does not follow that the Governor in Council would

refuse   to  give  that  power  when  the  special

circumstances are there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar, in a sweeping

statement,  referred  to  the  closing   down   of

factories. I refuse to admit that there  has  been

such  a  vast  scale closing down of factories  as

suggested  or  implied in his sweeping  statement.

There has been some closing down of factories, but

to  a greater extent there has been an opening  up

of  new  factories.  If the hon.  Member  has  any

information on this, I will be glad to receive it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also criticised the Hon. Mr

Sutherland  about his fear of the creeping  danger

of  inflation.  Sir, let me make this  plain:  the

creeping  danger  of inflation is world-wide,  but

there  is  a  bigger  creeping  danger  today   in

Singapore, and that is irresponsible



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2372</b></font><br><br>



politics.   That   can   do   us    a    lot    of

harm - irresponsible statements by  politicians  who

do   not  care  whether  they  are  damaging   the

country's  economy and credit in the eyes  of  the

world.  It  can not only stop people  from  coming

here  and opening industries, but it can also stop

our  credit from working on the London market  and

other  foreign markets. We should be very  careful

of  that. We should never make sweeping statements

which  may  be  quoted the world  over  and  be  a

pointer to those who wish to come here and  invest

money,  because that will prevent them from  doing

so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past the people of Singapore have,

comparatively speaking, been living on  a  bed  of

roses. They have had nothing to worry about in the

economic  set-up. We have had our entrepot  trade,

but  now  with the growing population the time  is

coming  when  we  will  have  to  fight  for   our

survival,  and  that is why it is  important  that

because   of   this   fight  we   should   prevent

irresponsible statements.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

I  have a great regard for the financial knowledge

and  ability of the Hon. the Financial  Secretary,

an  ex-officio  Member of this Assembly,  but  his

utterances the other day would have had a very bad

effect  for  Singapore  on  the  financial  market

overseas.  Sir, what is the credit  of  Singapore?

Have  we  any  vast lands and resources,  any  big

reserves? I can say almost Nil.



<br><br>10.30 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to depend on our wits, how to make money

through   entrepôt  trade.  We  have   no   credit

whatsoever  as far as resources are concerned.  We

can mortgage nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, in order to maintain industry and to

make  the  existence of the people easier,  it  is

necessary  to  bring down the cost  of  water  and

power. That is the point made by the mover of  the

amendment - if the life of the project is 30  or  40

years, why float a loan for 10 years and have  its

redemption  paid up within ten years  and  put  up

your  charges  to  that extent? Suppose  the  loan

redemption is spread out over many years, the cost

of  the  power will be cheaper. That goes  without

saying. In other words, if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2373</b></font><br><br>



you  have a short-term loan and you want to redeem

it early, say 10 years, the cost is higher because

you  have  to  pay into the sinking fund  for  the

redemption  of  the  loan.  That  is  very  simple

arithmetic. And that is why the mover has time and

again emphasised the necessity of taking away this

proviso.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Mr Sutherland did have an

optimistic outlook for the colony. As a banker, he

is in the driver's seat, but there is a well-known

saying  that  the banker is the first to  withdraw

the  umbrella even before the first sign of  rain.

Credit  in  many countries is being cut  and  even

here we are feeling the cutting off of the credit.

That  is a fact, that the merchants are suffering.

As   democracy   progresses  and  Singapore   gets

internal   self-government   and   independence - of

course, we are going to get it some day, I hope it

will  not  be  in the very distant future - then  we

will have to depend more on our resources than  on

the  United Kingdom or any other country. And what

can   we  depend  on,  unless  we  cut  our  cloth

according  to our needs? That is the only  remedy,

and here is one remedy suggested - that if the loans

are spread out, the cost will be cheaper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I meant the other day, and I always mean,

about  nominated and ex-officio Members  is  this:

let  them not frustrate democracy and throttle the

elected  Members'  votes by voting  on  the  other

side.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Chairman, I must assert my right as a

nominated  Member  to take a  full  part  in  this

Assembly. In fact, I have sworn an oath to do  so,

and  I  cannot  possibly under pressure  from  the

Member for Telok Ayer abandon my oath or say  that

I  will not frustrate him. When he is wrong I will

of course do so. But if he is in the right, I will

support him. I merely rise to make this point, Mr

Chairman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to make one or two comments on

the   speeches  we  have  had  from  the  Liberal-Socialists on this question of loans - whether  they

should  be  paid  off as quickly as  possible,  or

whether  they  should be paid  off  as  slowly  as

possible. The Member for Paya



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2374</b></font><br><br>



Lebar  said that we had new problems and  that  we

must  face  them with new ideas. I am afraid  that

that is what the Liberal-Socialists are not doing.

This  idea of a long-term loan is an old one which

is  tending  to get out of date. As the  hon.  Mr

Sutherland  pointed out, the whole trend  nowadays

is  otherwise.  The remark that we sometimes  hear

around  Singapore  "A dollar  saved  is  50  cents

wasted" is one that is often in people's minds and

undoubtedly  has an effect on the  willingness  of

the  people to put their money aside for this sort

of  investment. Savings take place largely in  the

insurance type of saving - contractual saving  where

you  pay  so much per month or per year in  return

for  certain guaranteed benefits. And that  aspect

is one which the hon. Member is overlooking. Quite

apart  from  whether you can get the money  for  a

long-term  loan, I personally feel  it  is  highly

desirable  that we should, as far as  we  possibly

could,  in  both  public and private  investments,

make  our  capital investment out  of  revenue  or

profits,  and  not  out of loan money,  committing

ourselves far into the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole tempo of industrial economic growth is

changing  in  the  world today.  The  turnover  of

equipment is changing; there is need to revise our

ideas  as  new  methods  of producing  wealth  are

developed; and to tie ourselves up with  extremely

long-term loans seems to me to be out of date.  It

is a very limiting factor on economic growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin is proposing to cheapen

costs  by spreading the load over a longer  period

of  years.  That  is  one  way  of  doing  it.  An

alternative  way is to spread your  costs  over  a

larger  number  of  consumers. As  the  number  of

people making use of the services expands, so  the

proportion of the costs which are accounted for by

overheads is reduced, and costs can come down. You

can  also cheapen your costs by higher efficiency,

and that is of course the most desirable thing  of

all - productivity  should  be  maximum,  efficiency

should  be maximum, and then the rate of costs  is

of minor importance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir, I am no economist, no financial wizard. I  am

going to speak



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2375</b></font><br><br>



from the point of view of the man in the street. I

am  going to be charged for the services rendered,

and  I  am of the opinion that they should  be  as

cheap  as  possible. I am not going  to  say  that

financial matters are not going to affect me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I have heard arguments from the hon. Mr

Sutherland as well as Members of the Labour Front.

They  seem to speak on one theme, and that is,  we

must not make the people who have money invest  in

our   projects  and  then  make  them  lose  their

money - for  every dollar, collect 50 cents.  "Every

dollar  saved  means  50 cents  wasted."  Now,  of

course,  that  is contrary to their principles  of

Socialism. If a few rich men must lose their money

and  if  benefit  can  be given  to  everybody  in

Singapore,  then I am all for it, and anybody  who

is  trying to protect them is not one who  is  for

the  people  but  really one  who  is  for  vested

interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the argument is again advanced about

inflation - that you will have less value  for  your

money.  They  have said that if you are  going  to

prevent inflation, the most important thing is  to

step  up production. But how are you going to step

up  production,  Sir,  if  you  do  not  have  the

necessary means of helping to step it up?  If  you

do  not  provide efficient and cheap  services  to

encourage  people  to  come  along  and   increase

production?  Well,  there  are  two  courses  open

today.  One course is to hold your hands and  say,

"Let  us watch, keep our money, and see how things

go."  In that way, money will also go down because

there will surely be inflation. The other way  is,

"Well, there may be inflation, but let us try  and

see  how we can stop it." We can step up industry.

At  least  we are trying to do something  to  stop

inflation and not just hold our hands. The  second

course  is  definitely  preferable  to  the  first

course  of  holding our hands,  sitting  down  and

saying,  "We  can  do  nothing.  We  will  not  do

anything."



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Just one word, Sir. The

Member  for  Serangoon seems to have misunderstood

the Socialistic principles of the Labour Front. He

says that if rich men lose money and the people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2376</b></font><br><br>



benefit,  he  is all for it. First  of  all,  Sir,

looking  at the way things are moving, I doubt  if

rich  men  will invest in Singapore for long,  and

therefore we will have to look to the poor men  to

invest  their  savings  in the  City  Council  and

Government loans in the future. It is the men  and

women  of Singapore, the workers, who must  invest

and  we  do  not  want  them to  lose  their  life

savings,  whether  or  not  that  is  contrary  to

Socialistic principles, as the hon. Member thinks.

But  there is one thing Sir, and that is,  whether

it  is  the  poor  men or the  rich  men,  if  you

consciously  evolve a policy so  that  the  person

investing  his money loses it after  a  period  of

years,  you are cheating, and we do not stand  for

such cheating. If we want to make the rich men pay

for the benefit of Singapore, there are other ways

of  doing it, Sir. You can nationalise, you can do

a lot of things, but not cheating in this fashion.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Sir,

before  I  deal with the main body of  the  points

which  have  been raised today, I should  like  to

touch briefly on one point - I was castigated by the

hon.  Member for Tanglin on Friday for introducing

once  more  the  question of 60-year  loans.  This

point   was   however  at  issue  in  the   Select

Committee. If reference is made to col. 158 of the

Official Report (No. 6) of the proceedings of  the

Select  Committee, it will be seen that  the  hon.

Member was then a strong advocate of funding  over

a  period  in excess of 60 years. I quote  him  as

saying:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Mr Chairman, what I would like to see is

that the period can be extended beyond 60 years if

the  estimated useful life of the project  extends

beyond 60 years, so that the generations to follow

do  bear a fair share of the cost. If that is  not

the meaning then I have no alternative but to vote

against the whole clause [clause 81]."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that, at that particular stage of

the  proceedings, Mr Chairman, there were  people

who  were  Members of this Assembly who  did  feel

most  strongly that the loan should be funded over

a  period in excess of 60 years, and I merely made

the  remarks  which I did on Friday, to  emphasise

that  the  Government's idea  on  that  particular

point was quite contrary to that expressed by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2377</b></font><br><br>



the  hon.  Member of the Opposition in the  Select

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in connection with the points which have

been  raised  today,  I must thank  the  hon.  Mr

Sutherland  for  his support. He speaks  with  far

more  authority in these matters than I do, and  I

hope that hon. Members will pay due regard to  the

remarks which he made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the effect in terms of

reduction  of costs to the consumer of  funding  a

loan  over  the period of the useful  life  rather

than the period of repayment, the hon. Member  for

Tanglin   did   quote  certain  figures,   and   I

appreciate that, in quoting those figures, he  was

endeavouring to simplify the matter and to make  a

simple  illustration for Members of the  Assembly.

But  I  think, if I may say so, that he overlooked

the  effect of compound interest in these matters.

I  have gone into the matter rather carefully, and

on  the  periods which he quoted, I think that  he

rather tended to exaggerate the effect in terms of

sinking fund contributions and savings as a result

of reduced sinking fund contributions, but that is

a minor point.



<br><br>10.45 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the illustration which he gave,

the  effect  in terms of savings in  sinking  fund

contributions    on    the     cost     of     the

product - electricity was the case he quoted - I think

it  is  difficult to say what the effect  of  this

reduced  charge  would  be  on  the  cost  to  the

consumer.  It  depends so  much  on  the  cost  of

production,  the particular purpose of  the  whole

electricity asset for which the loan was  floated,

and  many  other  factors.  In  considering  these

matters, I have endeavoured, on the basis  of  the

Annual  Report by the City Treasurer, to  make  an

estimate  of what the effect would be on the  cost

of  the  electricity to the consumer  if  all  the

loans  which  have been raised for the electricity

undertaking were funded on the basis of the useful

life  rather  than the period for  repayment.  The

result  of  my  calculations  must  inevitably  be

exceedingly rough, because, first of all, they are

based  on statistics given in the City Treasurer's

Annual Report for 1956 (which is available



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2378</b></font><br><br>



to all Members who wish to see it) and on  a

purely arbitrary estimate of my own of the life of

the electricity undertaking. I would say that,  in

working this out, I have tried to be fair  and  if

there was any doubt in my mind about the length of

the   life  of  any  particular  portion  of   the

undertaking  I  have given the  advantage  to  the

Opposition. For these reasons, I hesitate to quote

these  calculations, but, for what they are worth,

I  will give them. It might be that, if the  loans

floated  for the electrical undertaking  had  been

funded  over the period of the useful life of  the

undertaking, the cost of a unit of electricity now

would be reduced by a fraction of a cent. That  is

all  I  can  say.  I  cannot go into  any  greater

detail,  but it is open to Members, if they  like,

to  examine the City Treasurer's Annual Report and

try   and   work  out  similar  calculations   for

themselves.  I  cannot say,  of  course,  to  what

extent the saving would be passed on the consumer,

because  you  will appreciate, Mr Chairman,  that

the cost of the average unit of electricity is the

cost  of producing that unit, whether it is  power

for  industry,  or power for the  refrigerator  at

one's  own  home or a fan or merely  for  electric

light; and these charges vary. It is difficult  to

say to what extent this saving would be passed  on

to  the  consumer.  It might indeed  be  that  the

saving was merely utilised to stabilise prices  at

a  time  when prices and costs of production  were

rising very considerably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was accused not only on Friday but again

today of being unnecessarily gloomy, in so far  as

I  suggested that the City Council might  possibly

have difficulty in floating loans in the future. I

think  perhaps the hon. Member for Tanglin implied

that  I  had been rather more categorical  in  the

matter  than  indeed I was. He said  that  if  the

position  was  going  to be  such  that  the  City

Council  would have difficulty - I think he went  so

far  as  to say that it could not float  loans  in

future - then we might as well give up the ghost and

abandon  hope  altogether. Of course,  I  did  not

suggest  that at all. I merely said,  as  will  be

seen  from the Hansard which will be available  to

Members, that I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2379</b></font><br><br>



thought  that the indications were that  the  City

Council  might  conceivably  have  difficulty   in

floating  a  loan  when  they  wanted  it  at  any

particular point in time in the future. I gave  my

reasons   fairly   fully  for  this   feeling   of

uncertainty,  and  I do not wish  to  repeat  them

unnecessarily and take up the time of  the  House.

But I think it is an important point and perhaps I

should   amplify   my   remarks   to   avoid   any

misunderstanding on the matter in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the City Council has at the moment an

outstanding  debt of approximately  $250  million,

all  but  $25 million of which has been raised  in

Singapore since the war. Sir, we already  know  of

large development commitments for which loan money

will  be  required  in the immediate  future.  The

population of Singapore is growing at an  alarming

rate,  and  as it grows, so the demands on  public

utility  services will be increased. The  pressure

on  the City Council to expand their services will

be increased. And all these demands will result in

demands for additional loan money. I cannot say at

the  moment  how these demands in the future  will

compare  with  the very heavy demands  which  have

been  made in the past, but I think it is safe  to

say  that they will be fairly substantial.  It  is

not  going  to  be easy to obtain this  money,  no

matter over what periods the demand is spread. The

amount  available for capital development is,  and

will be, limited. The needs of expanding trade, on

which  Singapore's prosperity depends and will  in

the  future also depend, despite all we hear about

industrial  expansion - these  needs  must  be  met.

Again  the  needs of industry which we  hope  will

grow  must  also  be  met. All this  will  require

capital.  There  will  be competition  from  other

borrowers,  for  example,  the  Government,  whose

needs are as great and as pressing as those of the

City  Council; and the investing public  in  their

widest  sense, that is, including all  the  bodies

which   contribute  to  Municipal  and  Government

loans, will be fairly sated as far as City Council

and Government loans are concerned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2380</b></font><br><br>



If  to  this  need  for  what   I   call

developmental  capital we add the  need  for  loan

redemption  capital, then the borrowing  situation

will  be correspondingly complicated. I will  deal

with  that point in greater detail later.  I  feel

that any particular generation of taxpayers in the

future  would be very much aggrieved to find  that

they   could  not  obtain  the  social  and  other

services  which  they demanded  because  any  loan

money which was available at that particular  time

was  required  to  pay off their grandfather's  or

their father's debts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I doubt, Sir, if it is generally realised what

the  financial  consequences of funding  over  the

useful life of an asset might be, and this is very

important.  Let us take the case of a $20  million

loan at five per cent, repayable over a period  of

20  years, for a purpose the useful life of  which

is  40  years. Contributions are made to a sinking

fund  which,  with compound interest, will  enable

the  loan to be paid off in 40 years - that is what,

I think, the hon. Member wishes. When the due date

for  repayment  arrives after 20 years,  that  is,

when  the $20 million must be repaid, the  sum  of

the  sinking fund will amount to $6 million, which

means that it will be $14 million short of the sum

required for repayment of the loan: Now this money

will  have to be found from other sources, either,

as  Mr Sutherland suggested, conversion - which has

not  been  very  successful in the recent  past - or

floating new money, which is very difficult.  Sir,

since  1948 the City Council has borrowed in  each

year except one - 1950. Fortunately these loans  are

being  funded  in such a way that  funds  will  be

available  for  their repayment in due  date.  But

suppose  funding in all cases had been  done  over

the useful life of the asset. In the case of water-works,  for  example, perhaps  60  years.  In  the

1970's  all these loans will be due for repayment.

At  the same time, the City Council will no  doubt

require  funds for new development,  as  will  the

Government. Would it be able to obtain them,  with

perhaps   over  $100  million  required  for   the

redemption  of  old loans? I doubt it.  That  will

give



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2381</b></font><br><br>



hon. Members some idea of the position which might

possibly  arise in the future if the City Council,

as  it would no doubt wish to do, funded all loans

over the useful life of the project instead of the

period of the repayment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, lastly in this particular connection,

we  are looking very far ahead, but perhaps let us

not look so far ahead. Let us look no further than

the  present. Does the hon. Member think that  the

City  Council  could  easily raise  the  funds  it

requires  for development at the present time?  If

the  City  Council were to float a loan  tomorrow,

would  he subscribe from his private fortune,  and

would   he   advise  the  organisation  which   he

represents  to  do  the same? I  can  assure  you,

without  in any way spreading alarm or despondency

but  merely facing facts - in this connection  I  do

not  think that anything said here will  have  any

effect  on the credit of the City Council  or  the

Government  overseas, because  what  we  say  here

matters very little to the financiers of the world

who  calculate  the odds as far as the  credit  of

countries  or cities like Singapore is  concerned - that  if  the City Council were to go on the  loan

market   tomorrow,  it  would  find  the  greatest

difficulty in raising funds which it requires, and

next year when the Government will also be on  the

market  for loan money, the matter would  be  even

more different. Sir, when I spoke on Friday I  did

mention  the  happy situation of local governments

at   home   which  could  count  with   reasonable

certainty on access to the London market;  but  at

the  present  time,  even these  local  government

authorities in the United Kingdom are  having  the

greatest  difficulty in finding  the  money  which

they require for development projects even on  the

London market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my speech on Friday I said the conclusion was

reached  that it would be unwise to give the  City

Council  carte  blanche in the matter  of  funding

loans, and I was immediately taken to task by  the

hon.  Member  for Tanglin. Indeed I was  taken  to

task again today. He said the City Council did not

have  carte  blanche because the sanction  of  the

Governor in Council was required for any policy it

might suggest in any particular case, as is indeed

the case; and of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2382</b></font><br><br>



course,  the  power is given to  the  Governor  in

Council under clauses, clause 79, for example,  to

fix  the terms on which loans will be granted. But

I  think that the hon. Member has missed my point,

that  is,  that if his amendment is accepted,  the

City  Council will, in effect, have carte blanche.

The  general policy of funding loans will be  laid

down  in  the  clause  and  the  sanction  of  the

Governor   in   Council,  or   their   heirs   and

successors, will be a formality in the absence  of

any  special  circumstances which might  make  the

following of the general policy undesirable. It is

easy to imagine the pressure which will be brought

to  bear  on  the City Council to have  all  loans

funded  over the period of the useful life of  the

purpose. This pressure will be transmitted  to  an

elected  Cabinet. It is to avoid the  consequences

of this pressure and to render the position of the

City  Council  or  the Governor  in  Council  less

difficult,  as  well  as  to  lay  down  what   is

considered  to  be a prudent policy,  that  it  is

desired to prescribe in the law what normal policy

will be; and that, Sir, is all that clause 81 does

do.  It merely says that, normally, loans will  be

funded within the period of repayment. It does not

exclude  the possibility of funding over a  longer

period.  I made that clear on Friday. In fact,  it

goes  on  to say that such funding will be allowed

in  certain  circumstances.  The  only  limitation

which is placed on that extended power is that  it

shall  in  no case exceed the useful  life  or  60

years,  whichever is the lesser. The clause,  Sir,

merely indicates, as a guide to politicians and as

a  reassurance to potential subscribers, what  the

policy will be, and that it will be a prudent one.

I  do not think in the circumstances that it would

be wise to change it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also endeavoured to give some idea of the

circumstances  in which this power to  extend  the

period would be used. I was careful to say that in

all    probability   it   would   be   used   when

circumstances  in the loan market were  such  that

funds  could only be obtained at reasonable  rates

on  short-term.  This,  I think  I  can  say  with

confidence,  meets the wishes of the officials  of

the  City Council at the present time. After  all,

they are responsible for this policy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2383</b></font><br><br>



of  funding  loans  and for operating  the  public

utilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, at the risk of being accused once

more  of being what I might say characteristically

and  occupationally pessimistic, I  would  suggest

that, at this time of great constitutional change,

with  its attendant uncertainty about the  future,

we  should  ignore  vote-catching  suggestions  by

politicians   who   have   not   yet    shouldered

responsibility or had the experience of  being  in

power, with pre-election promises as bed-fellows - a

most uncomfortable experience, since they seem  to

be  all  feet and knees and elbows - and  adhere  to

safe  and  prudent policies. A law can readily  be

changed if the object of the change is relaxation.

It   is  more  difficult  to  undo  the  financial

consequences of a hasty and shortsighted decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I reaffirm that the Government rejects the

amendment.



<br><br>11.00 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I have not

by  the Hon. the Financial Secretary, that between

a loan which is to be paid off within 10 years and

a  loan which is to be paid off in 40 or 60 years,

the cost of reduction in charges will be just by a

fraction.   Ten  years,  1  to  4  or   1   to   6

difference - how  can that be only a fraction?  What

the other side of the House is trying to emphasise

is this. [Interruption]. Why do you not get up and

talk, instead of-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member should

remember to address the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, Sir. I do not like to be

disturbed at the same time, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our argument is that the cost of power or water

should  be brought down to such an extent as  will

reduce  the  cost of living of the working  class,

and  will  also encourage industry.  That  is  our

argument - to  help the workers and industry,  which

will be most beneficial to the colony.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2384</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Financial Secretary has said, Sir,

that out of $250,000,000 of loans existing of  the

Municipality,  $25,000,000 had been  collected  in

Singapore, subject to correction of course-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> If I may explain, Sir, I said that at

the present date, of $250,000,000 all but

$25,000,000 had been obtained since the war.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Thank you for that information

but  I  said  the  main  worry  of  the  Financial

Secretary is this, that in the present position or

in  the  future it will be most difficult for  the

City  Council to get loans floated in this  market

and  you have got to go overseas - to the banker  or

the  financier. The financier will first like  his

own  safety by giving only short-term loans  at  a

reasonable interest of course, the maximum he  can

get with good security and to get the money safely

back to reinvest again. Now here the Government is

looking  to  the  financier's interests  only,  or

possibly  it  is that the Singapore  City  Council

will  not have much credit left in the future  and

it  will not be able to raise a longer-term  loan.

If  it is to safeguard their own overseas investor

to  get  the money redeemed as early as  possible,

well, and if that is the idea, let him say so.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I should like to answer

some  of  the points which have been made  by  the

Members   of   the  Government.  If   it   is   an

occupational  disease of the  Hon. the  Financial

Secretary  to be a pessimist, I have no  doubt  he

feels  it  is  an  occupational  disease  of   the

Opposition  to be optimists, and we feel  that  we

should  look at the more optimistic side  of  this

question.  He  did  suggest,  Sir,  that   I   was

simplifying matters in the example I gave  of  the

power  station being extended for a period  of  40

years, and in fact I did say that on Friday; I had

deliberately left out the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2385</b></font><br><br>



question  of payment of interest because it  would

have complicated the whole issue in trying to  put

it  as simply as possible before the House.  I  do

admit that this is certainly the case, but it  has

brought  out, I think, from the Hon. the Financial

Secretary the calculation that in fact a  fraction

of  a  cent on the unit price of electricity would

have been saved if this principle had been adopted

previously and which we seek in our amendment. One

assumes  that  it was only a fraction  of  a  cent

spread over every consumer, but if this saving was

used  as  a  reduction of the price of electricity

for purposes of industrial power, then that saving

would, I think, make a very great difference. Even

the  saving of half a cent, when spread over  five

years  in  the  calculations of  an  industrialist

intending to set up a factory in this area,  would

involve   an   amount   which   would   be   quite

considerable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which the Hon. the Financial

Secretary made was that possibly this fraction  of

a  cent,  as  he  put it, could only  be  used  in

stabilising prices when the costs were rising. But

that  in  itself  would be an  advantage  if  that

happened to be the position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Minister for Communications and

Works,  who does not very much like loans  at  all

apparently, suggested that the way of meeting  the

thing  was  to  spread the loan by increasing  the

number  of  consumers. And of course that  is  the

point:  we will increase the number of the biggest

consumers,  namely the industrialists  with  their

factories,  if the cost of power is reduced.  Sir,

all  we have said is that any cheapening of  power

or  water  can be one factor in helping industrial

expansion at a time when we desperately  need  it.

We  do  not say that if this amendment is accepted

we  can  then look forward to a glorious millenium

ahead  of  us.  That of course  will  be  a  gross

exaggeration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret, Sir, that the Hon. Minister for

Commerce  and  Industry has suggested  that  there

were  irresponsible statements being made on  this

side  of  the  House.  We have  put  forward  this

amendment in full responsibility and have made  no

irresponsible  statements on this matter.  We  put

them   forward  as  a  contribution   to   greater

flexibility in our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2386</b></font><br><br>



financial  and industrial future. Sir,  I  do  not

think  the  Government - or  a  certain  number   of

Members  of the Government - still realise that  the

City  Council cannot just go out and  float  loans

without  authority. There is the safeguard  there,

the safeguard in clause 78:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The City Council may, with the sanction of the

Governor in Council, borrow such sums or any  part

of such sums as may be required..."



<br><br>There is clause 79:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where the City Council is authorised to borrow

money  it  may,  subject to  the  consent  of  the

Governor in Council raise the money..."



<br><br>by various ways. Finally, clause 81:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every sum borrowed under section 78 of this

Ordinance shall be redeemed within such period not

exceeding  sixty years as the City  Council,  with

the  sanction  of  the Governor  in  Council,  may

determine".



<br><br>All  we are asking in this amendment is that there

should  be  greater flexibility written  into  the

Bill  itself in the interests of the country as  a

whole but with the safeguards still remaining.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I do not want to answer

the  hon.  Member for Tanglin because I think  all

the  points  which he has made again have  already

come  out  in  the debate, except to say  that  my

statement  about irresponsible politicians  if  he

takes  to fit him, he is welcome to it. I did  not

direct  my  statement at any particular Member  in

this  House but to general irresponsible  politics

in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it has come out, Sir, in the debate that

there  is a little bit of misunderstanding of  the

word redemption. Now redemption normally would  be

taken  to mean repayment but it is not really  so.

Repayment period is the number of years for  which

you  have floated a loan and you have to repay the

loan in those years:



Whether the Government wants to play ball with the

capitalists  and ignore Socialist  principles,  or

whether  Government looks after the  interests  of

the  rich men who are going to contribute  to  the

loan,  has nothing to do with the matter in  hand.

Any Government or City Council which has issued  a

loan  for a number of years has to repay that loan

within  those  number  of years.  It  is  a  legal

contract which is given out in the prospectus



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2387</b></font><br><br>



and  when  the investor buys the loan or debenture

he  expects  to  get repaid within the  number  of

years that is promised to him. So that has nothing

to  do  with  the  redemption. Redemption  is  the

number  of years on which you fund your loan.  The

repayment  period  may be 20  years  but  you  can

redeem your loan over 40 years. So by the time you

come to the 20 years you have to find the money to

repay that loan but your sinking fund is not up to

the  full  value, it is only up to half  value  or

less    probably,    according   to    complicated

calculations  of  compound  interest  and  so  on.

Therefore when you come to the 20 years  you  find

that you are vastly short of the money you have to

pay and you have to get that money either by again

going  on  to  the  market or through  some  other

method.  Therefore I just want to  make  it  clear

that  it  is  not that the Government  is  looking

after  only the interests of the rich men  because

any Government or City Council which has issued  a

loan  for a number of years will have to repay  it

in  that period. It is a legal contract and  there

is  no  escape from it. It is only the  matter  of

redeeming,  the funding of the loan, that  we  are

discussing now.

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, the purpose of this amendment is to try to remove from the Bill some of the confusion

which  the  Government has caused by its illogical

policy  of tinkering with the limits of  the  City

and District boundaries. It has firstly brought  a

rural area into a primarily urban area by bringing

in  parts of Pasir Panjang and Ulu Pandan  to  the

City; secondly, pushed a primarily urban area into

a  rural area by expelling part of Katong  into  a

District  Council;  and  thirdly,  divided  up   a

homogeneous rural area, Braddell Road, into two by

pushing  one section to the North of the road  out

to   the  District  Council  while  retaining  the

section to the South in the City Council. There is

neither rhyme nor reason nor consistency in  these

moves,  and the attempt to fix the rates  to  suit

these manoeuvrings is equally Gilbertian.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us turn to the clauses concerning the fixing

of  rates.  There is firstly clause 108 (3)  which

reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No such rate as is specified in subsection (1)

of  this section shall exceed in the aggregate  in

one year thirty per centum of the annual value  of

the property rated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that in the case of a District Council

such  rate shall not, without the sanction of  the

Minister  in  writing, exceed in the aggregate  in

one year fifteen per centum of the annual value of

buildings and five per centum of the annual  value

of land."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the City Council will have an

unfettered ceiling as before of 30 per  cent.  The

District Councils will have a similar ceiling  but

they  may  not go beyond 15 per cent or  five  per

cent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2390</b></font><br><br>



without  the  special sanction of the Minister  in

writing.  Clause  108 (4) gives local  authorities

powers  to vary these rates in different parts  of

their own areas. In other words, a rural area with

no  services  can  be  rated  lower  than  a  more

urbanised area in the rural area with some or  all

of  the  Municipal services such  as  water,  gas,

electricity,  roads, street  lighting  and  so  on

which  increase the annual value of the  property.

In  other  words, in this sub-clause (4) you  have

differential  rating  already  provided  for.   It

appears,  however, from clause 109 that the  local

authorities  are not to be trusted  and  that  the

Minister wishes to step in and use his powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand under clause 109 (1) (a) the

Minister can insist that the rates of a new  rural

area coming within the City Council limits are  to

be paid at the previous rates, that is 20 per cent

or below. As this area Ulu Pandan-Pasir Panjang is

largely rural, and as restrictions will be  placed

on  an  essentially attap house area  when  it  is

brought  within the City Council, we are  prepared

to  accept this pegging of the rates solely on the

grounds  that  it is a form of protection  to  the

have-nots,  although  we do  not  really  see  the

fundamental reason for it, or that it is  in  fact

really necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the other hand, under clause 109 (1) (b),

the  one  to which we refer now, the Minister  can

insist  on  the rates of an area banished  to  the

District Councils being pegged at 30 per  cent  or

whatever  the City Council may have fixed  in  the

past.  In  this  category you  have  two  have-not

areas. You have the people of Katong which will be

downgraded  to  a  District Council  and,  as  the

Government  freely  admitted in Select  Committee,

will  have  the  status of a rural board  with  no

powers over its finances, with no staff, no powers

to  create its own posts, and yet will be made  to

pay 30 per cent. And you have the farmers north of

Braddell  Road who are to be separated from  their

own  community south of the road and  pushed  into

the District Council whose rates



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2391</b></font><br><br>



can  also be interfered with by the Minister. This

attempt at meddling with the rates when the  whole

matter  can  perfectly be well left  to  the  good

sense  of the local authorities and their  elected

representatives under their own powers  in  clause

108 (3) and (4) is going to cause a great deal  of

dissatisfaction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the people in Joo Chiat Road, who are shortly

to  find  themselves in the rural District Council

of  Changi,  are  going  to  have  a  considerable

grievance if the Minister pegs their rates  at  30

per cent on a par with their former friends in say

Tanjong  Katong  Road, who will  still  enjoy  the

administration of the City Council. I am surprised

that  the  Hon.  Minister for Health  has  allowed

himself to be a party to this kind of thing in his

own constituency. If this splitting of Katong into

two  is  to be tolerated, then at least the Changi

half  should be given the consolation  of  knowing

that  their  own  elected representatives  on  the

District Council can have a say in what the  rates

should be under clause 108 (3) and (4), and not be

dictated to by the Minister under clause  109  (1)

(b).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equal grievances are likely to arise in the Ulu

Pandan area. The newcomers into the City will have

their   rates   pegged  down  to   their   present

percentage whereas the many farmers already living

in  rural  area districts within the City  Council

boundaries  may be made to pay higher  rates.  And

that gives you another form of discrimination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come back to the fundamental point. Rating

should not be based on boundary lines which are of

an imaginary nature drawn across the map by master

planners.  Rating depends on the annual  value  of

the property which is itself based on the services

and amenities which a local authority can provide.

And  if  you have a local authority with no powers

over finance, officers or staff, you cannot charge

30  per  cent rates. If you wish to be consistent,

therefore,  you  must  leave  rating  to  a  local

authority to work out over the whole of its  area,

and  incidentally  you must provide  the  District

Councils    with   assessment   departments    and

assessment  officers and assessment committees  so

that the rating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2392</b></font><br><br>



is  done fairly. The interference implied by  this

clause 109, particularly as it will be covered and

can  be covered in clause 108, is undesirable  and

we oppose it.



<br><br>11.30 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Chairman, there is nothing

inconsistent between clause 108 (3)  and  (4)  and

clause  109  (1) (b). Clause 108 (3),  Sir,  is  a

general  rating provision whereas clause  109  (1)

(b)  is  a special rating provision. Under  clause

108  (3) the ceiling rate is not applicable  to  a

part  of  the local authority area only;  it  must

apply  to  the whole local authority area.  It  is

only  after  the ceiling rate has been fixed  that

the local authority can impose differential rating

in different parts of the area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explanation of clause 108 (3) and clause 109

(1)  (b)  is, I think, quite simple. Both  clauses

are  necessary.  A local authority,  say  the  new

Katong  District Council, applies to the  Minister

under clause 108 (3) to raise the ceiling rate  in

its  area from 15 per cent to say 20 per cent. The

Minister refuses to allow the imposition  of  this

increased  rate throughout the whole of that  area

but  that  does not prevent him at the  same  time

from ordering, under clause 109 (1) (b), that  the

new  area or part thereof within the limits of the

Katong District Council should be rated at 20  per

cent  or  even 30 per cent, because of the greater

public  services which will be continued  in  that

area.  I  think the Member for Tanglin  was  wrong

when  he  said  that  the services  of  the  local

authority - the services which shall be provided  in

the  Katong  area - will be diminished  or  will  be

reduced or will be less. That will not be so, Sir.

The  intention is that all the services  that  are

provided  for in the Katong area will continue  to

be  provided. The Minister may order that a higher

rate there should be imposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanglin in passing mentioned

that  there  are  certain rural areas  within  the

present limits of the City which are paying 30 per

cent. Under the existing Municipal Ordinance there

is  no  differential rating within  the  Municipal

areas;  it  is 30 per cent throughout.  But  under

this  new Bill we have made provisions, by  virtue

of clause 108 (4), by which it is possible for the

new City



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2393</b></font><br><br>



Council  to  impose  a lower rating  in  the  less

developed  parts  of  the  City  area.  That  will

dispose  of his argument that the new rural  areas

which are being brought into the City area will be

paying lower rates, and he agrees that these areas

should  be pegged at lower rates. I would  say  to

him  that it is now also possible for those  rural

areas  within the present parts of the City to  be

pegged at the same rates as the rural areas  which

are to be brought in if the City Council now wants

to   do  so.  For  these  reasons  I  oppose   the

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, the Hon. the Chief

Secretary  has  just  stated that  in  Katong  the

public services that are enjoyed in that area will

not be diminished but will continue to be provided

as  at  present. How will this be done, we  should

like  to  know,  when  it  is  admitted  that  the

services in the District Councils will be  pursued

and  followed  on Rural Board standards  and  that

there will be no officers in the District Councils

responsible to the District Councils but they will

be responsible to the Government itself?



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, for a

transitional period the Minister may direct, under

the transitional provisions, that the City Council

will  continue  to administer the area  of  Katong

which   is  to  be  transferred  to  the  District

Council,  and I think the Minister mentioned  this

in his speech last week in this Assembly. Sir, you

will  also remember that four or five of the  most

essential  services in any District  Council  area

will still be administered by the City Council  on

an  island-wide basis; whether Katong is inside or

outside  the  City  area,  services  like   water,

sewerage, electricity and gas will continue to  be

administered by the City Council on an island-wide

basis.  There will therefore be no diminishing  of

such  services in any part of any District Council

area  in  this respect; so also with the fire  and

ambulance  accident  services,  which  will   also

remain island-wide services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Katong part of the present City

area  is taken over and administered by the Katong

District  Council  after its transitional  period,

the District



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2394</b></font><br><br>



Council  will administer those services which  are

not island-wide services. And what are these? They

are  scavenging  and conservancy, maintenance  and

construction   of  roads,  drains,  licensing   of

various  trades, health, looking after  nuisances,

etc. - but  these  are services  which  are  already

being  carried out as well in the rural  areas  by

the  Rural  Board  as  in the  City  by  the  City

Council.  The staff of the Rural Board is  now  in

the  process of being divided up and spread  among

the  three District Councils which in future  will

take  the place of the Rural Board. These District

Councils  will have their staff. To say that  they

will  have  no staff, no offices, is not  correct.

They  will  have their staff except,  as  we  have

said,  that  for an interim, initial  period,  the

staff  will be Government servants. But the  staff

will  be there. You will have the same Rural Board

staff,   augmented  if  necessary   by   increased

strength  or even transfer from the City  Council.

And  these services will go on being provided.  To

say that they will not be provided and that it  is

not  possible to see how the District Councils are

going   to  be  provided  with  services  is   not

relevant, I think, Sir, and the argument  is  weak

because  these  District Councils  will  certainly

have  staff.  They  will have their  estimates  of

revenue and expenditure; they will have their  own

offices,  Sir. I  can say that priority  will  be

given  to building these offices. So I cannot  see

why the Member for Tanglin is harping on this lack

of  services,  staff and office  buildings.  These

services  will still be provided by  the  District

Councils  when they take over the Katong  part  of

the  present  City  area  after  the  transitional

period.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, the Government has had to

admit what it does not like to admit, namely that,

as  a  result  of moving Katong into the  District

Council,   the  area  of  Katong   will   not   be

administered by the District Council because it is

not  ready for that to be undertaken, but that the

City  Council will administer Katong for  what  is

now said to be six to eight months and not, as the

Minister said in Select Committee,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2395</b></font><br><br>



for  three  or four years. And that is  the  whole

point, that the public services that are given  to

Katong  will not be properly administered so  long

as you have your elected representatives of Katong

sitting  in  the District Council while  the  City

Council  will  carry  out the administration.  The

elected  representatives of Katong  will  have  no

control  over the services which are going  to  be

provided  by  another body. Why should  not  these

elected representatives sit on the City Council so

long  as  the City Council is going to  administer

them?  The  whole thing is completely upside  down

and  an insult, and the reason simply is that  the

Government is putting into action a Bill on  which

it  has not given sufficient thought and to  which

it has not given time to make a proper job of this

whole  thing. It cannot be said that the  area  of

Katong  is  going  to get the  services  which  it

should  get,  because the elected  representatives

will not be there to see that it gets them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore we feel very strongly that there is no

point to this clause 109 and certainly not to sub-clause (1) (b), that the matter is perfectly  well

covered  by  clause 108; and because there  is  no

proper  control  over Katong by  its  own  elected

representatives   it   should   be   the   elected

representatives in the District Council who should

have  a say in what the differential rating should

be,  and  it should not be altered by the Minister

exacting  rates  if it is not getting  the  public

services.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Chairman, I thought under this

amendment  we were discussing rating and  not  the

question  of why the Katong area, or the  district

which  is to be handed over to the Katong District

Council,   should  be  administered  during   this

transitional  period  by  the  City   Council.   I

thought,  Sir,  that this would be  discussed  and

debated  when we come to the amendment  which  the

Member  for Tanglin has given notice of, and  that

is  the  amendment on transitional provisions.  We

can  debate  it  there but we are  now  discussing

rating  and I still say that both clauses 108  (3)

and  109  (1)  (b) are not inconsistent  with  one

another.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2396</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> I would just like to say that rates and

services are of course very closely related.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 109 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 143-



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I beg to move an

amendment,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 143, line 3, after "authority", to

insert: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;", provided that the provisions of this

subsection  may  apply to private  streets  of  a

width  less  than thirty-six feet  if  the  local

authority in special circumstances thinks fit".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, in moving this amendment to clause 143, and in order to explain our intentions, it

will  be  necessary to elucidate the  meaning  not

only  of this clause but also that of clauses 144,

145  and  146 as they are related. I will  try  to

express these seemingly complicated clauses in  as

simple language as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are dealing, Sir, with private streets and the

problems of having them made up as public  streets

to  the  advantage of the owners or occupiers  and

the  general public. Clause 143, the one to  which

the amendment before us refers, concerns the power

of  a  local authority to require a private street

to   be  made  up  according  to  local  authority

specifications  and the cost  of  it  met  by  the

frontagers  in proportion to the extent  of  their

frontages.  The first sub-clauses do  not  specify

any particular width of street but sub-clause (14)

states  that in the case of a street  36  feet  in

width  or  more the frontagers, or a  majority  of

them, can demand that the street, having been duly

made up, be taken over as a public street, and the

local  authority cannot refuse to do so. In  other

words,  in  this  clause the  frontagers,  if  the

majority  of them agree, must take the  initiative

if  they  want  their street to be made  a  public

street  provided - and this is the point - the  street

is not less than 36 feet in width.



<br><br>11.45 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 144 is different. In this clause if a

private street of any width has been made up to

the proper specifications the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2397</b></font><br><br>



local authority, and not the frontagers, can  take

the  initiative and notify that unless  objections

are lodged within a month it will declare it to be

a public street.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 145 refers to private streets that are

less  than  36  feet in width but  require  to  be

widened before they can be made up and declared  a

public   street.   Under  the  present   Municipal

Ordinance in such cases, the City Council  has  to

obtain the approval of the Governor in Council  to

acquire  the  necessary  land,  and  it   may   be

buildings,  in  order to widen  the  streets;  and

under  the present Ordinance, by acquiring let  us

say eight feet of land on each side of the 20-foot

road  reserve in order to make the road up  to  36

feet  in width, the City Council has itself to  be

the  frontager for the entire extent of the street

in  question. In other words, the City Council has

not  only to pay the owners compensation  for  the

land purchased, but also to pay for the making  up

of  the entire road. The result has been that  the

City  has not squandered the ratepayers' money  on

such  double  payment  but  has  concentrated   on

declaring and maintaining as public streets  those

which are already 36 feet wide, while streets less

than  this  width  have remained  in  a  state  of

extreme disrepair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this section has been improved on in the

new  Bill in two respects. First of all, the local

authority  has  not to apply to  the  Governor  in

Council  for permission to deal with the  widening

of streets; and secondly in the new proviso, after

the local authority has purchased land to widen  a

street to not less than 36 feet in width and  paid

the  purchase  price to the owners,  these  owners

must  now  pay  for the making up  of  the  street

before  it  is taken over as a public  street.  In

other  words,  what they gain on the  swings  they

lose on the roundabouts, but at the end of it they

have a properly made up public street.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 146 is a minor one and we may give it

passing  notice. The local authority  may  require

owners  on  a  private street to  make  reasonable

repairs to put it in a more satisfactory state. In

other words, a street less than 36 feet wide which

the local authority is not intending to take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2398</b></font><br><br>



over as a public street can be patched up to lower

standards or specifications than are required  for

public streets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such then, Mr Chairman, is the meaning in brief

of  these  four clauses, and unless we  understand

their meaning we cannot understand the purpose  of

our  amendment.  The  point is  this,  that  while

clause  143 (except in sub-clause (14) ) and clause

144  do  not expressly say so, the local authority

has  always taken the line that it will  not  take

the  initiative under sub-clause (1) of clause 143

or  under sub-clause (1) of clause 144 to  have  a

private  Street  made up or to  declare  a  public

Street  unless  it  is  36  feet  wide.  This   is

tantamount  to the position that a private  street

less than 36 feet wide is doomed for ever to be  a

bumpy,  dusty, unmade-up street unless  the  local

authority  decides to act under  clause  145,  and

this it will only do if it wishes to turn a narrow

public street into a useful public thoroughfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Sir, is what we oppose. We take the view

that cul-de-sacs or lorongs less than 36 feet wide

which trail off into nowhere in particular should,

in  course  of  time, be made up and  turned  into

public  streets, and that the owners, having  paid

to  have  them made up, should have the  right  to

demand  that  they be turned into  public  streets

just as much as any other owners can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also take the view that too much of a fetish

is being made of the need for all streets to be at

least 36 feet wide. Thirty-six feet implies a need

for say a carriageway of 20 feet and eight feet of

land   on   either  side  for  drains.   This   is

extravagant and unnecessary in the case  of  short

streets  which are not thoroughfares and on  which

traffic  is  not  fast-moving.  Thirty  feet,   or

possibly  28 feet, is sufficient for such streets,

in our view. This will allow something like an 18-foot carriageway, perhaps a four-foot footpath and

two four-foot box-drains, which will mean a saving

in the use of land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two streets with a limited number of houses on

them,  which are not through roads, have  recently

been made up and are shortly to be declared public

streets  in  my constituency. One is Sarkies  Road

and the other Lewis Road, both off Bukit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2399</b></font><br><br>



Timah  Road,  the latter being well known  to  the

Member  for Seletar. Now I maintain - and I hope  he

will support me - that to make up these streets  to

a  full  36  feet was unnecessary because  of  the

limited traffic on them, and needlessly expensive,

firstly  to the owners who would have to foot  the

bill,  and secondly to the City Council which  has

to maintain them in perpetuity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we wish to emphasise through this amendment

is  the  fact that a local authority - and this  may

apply  with particular force to District  Councils

which  now come within the scope of these  clauses

(and  I  think that is a most important  point) - is

not  bound  to  limit the making up of  a  private

street to one that is 36 feet wide, and if streets

of  lesser  width are made up the  owners  have  a

right  to  demand  that they  be  declared  public

streets. It is extravagant in land and extravagant

in  money to insist on 36-foot wide streets  while

they are unnecessary, and this applies not only to

all  lorongs where the road reserve is say 30 feet

in  width,  but it should apply to even  some  new

roads.  This is a matter which the Minister should

take up with the Singapore Improvement Trust which

is the planning authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take for example a new housing estate. It

would  be reasonable to have the main road through

the  estate  leading to the main road  outside  as

wide as you like even of 40 feet, as it will carry

most of the traffic and in course of time probably

a bus service; but we see no reason why the feeder

roads or the link roads, each leading to say 16 or

20  houses and ending in a cul-de-sac, should  not

be say 30 feet in width, and why the owners should

not  demand to have these roads declared as public

streets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have spoken at some length on this issue

and  it  boils  down to this. Let us have  written

into the Bill the recognition that private streets

of  less  than  36 feet in width  are  in  certain

circumstances acceptable streets, that they can be

made up and that the owners have a right to demand

their declaration as public streets. Unless we  do

this some streets will remain a disgrace for ever.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2400</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, we sympathise with the sentiments

expressed  in the speech made by the  hon.  Member

for  Tanglin  but we feel that adequate  provision

has  already been made under clause 144 (1)  which

states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If any street, not being a public street, is

levelled, channelled and drained and either paved,

metalled  or  flagged to the satisfaction  of  the

local  authority,  it may, if it  thinks  fit,  by

writing under its common seal, declare that at the

expiration of one month from the date thereof  the

said street shall become a public street."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had the same doubts as the hon. Member for

Tanglin and I discussed this matter with the  Hon.

Minister,  and I am assured that if any street  is

less  than 36 feet wide it can still be taken over

at  the  discretion of the local authority.  Those

are  the  private streets which were mentioned  by

the  hon. Member as cul-de-sacs. I feel, Sir, that

clause  144  (1) is the real answer  to  the  hon.

Member's query.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say this, Sir, that there is no use

assuming  many things which in fact  will  not  be

wrong.  In  very  many of these  cases  the  local

authority,  I am sure, will give due consideration

in  taking  over those private streets  which  are

less than 36 feet wide.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I think the Hon. Assistant

Minister  is  labouring under this  fallacy,  that

clause 143 is in fact covered by clause 144. I  do

not  think  that  we can agree with  him  on  this

point.  Under clause 144 (1), which has just  been

read  out,  the  initiative  of  having  a  street

declared  a  public street must be  taken  by  the

local authority. Now it is in clause 143 (14) that

provided  that a street is 36 feet in width,  then

when  it  is  made up the owners or occupiers  can

demand that the street be made a public street and

the local authority cannot resist that demand;  it

must  carry it out and have the street declared  a

public  street. The initiative in clause 143  lies

with the owners or occupiers who have gone to  the

expense  of having the street made up, but  clause

144  is quite different. It states that the  local

authority must take the initiative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our point, Sir, is quite clear. I did go into

some detail into the difference between these four

clauses  in  order to establish it. Our  point  is

quite clear. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2401</b></font><br><br>



want,  under clause 143 where the initiative  lies

with  the  owner or occupier having  made  up  his

street  to get it made into a public street,  that

that  shall  also  apply  in  cases  where  it  is

reasonable, such as cul-de-sacs and lorongs and so

on, where the owners or occupiers, having made  up

a  street  less than 36 feet in width  can  demand

their  right that this street be declared a public

street.  There is a fundamental difference between

these two clauses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The hon. Member, Mr Chairman, who

has been very fond of alleging inconsistencies  on

the  side  of  the Government, has  showed  us  an

inconsistency    here,    where    the     elected

representatives  of  the people  on  the  District

Councils  and the City Council are to be  deprived

of  their  initiative as to whether  a  particular

street  should or should not be made  public.  The

power  is  to  be  taken  away  from  the  elected

representatives  and  given  to  a   few   private

individuals,  and  perhaps  even  to  one   single

capitalist.  Surely this is a terrible  attack  on

the  principles of democracy which  have  been  so

ably   expounded   earlier,   that   the   elected

representatives  should have all  the  powers  and

none  go  to  anybody  else.  Here  we  have   the

initiative as to whether a street should be public

or private taken away from the local authority and

given  to  the  residents, the frontagers  on  the

street.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I must say that this is a

most  extraordinary statement by the Hon. Minister

for  Communications  and Works.  This  clause  144

concerns the making up of public streets which the

frontagers  have  themselves paid  for.  Therefore

under this sub-clause they have the right, as they

have  had  for a very long time, to ask the  local

authority - the  elected representatives  who  carry

out  the work of the local authority - they have the

right to ask, and not merely to ask, to demand -



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> To demand!



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> - that their street should be made up.

And  that has been in existence for many years.  I

do  not  see  the  point at all of the  Minister's

remarks.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2402</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I am not an Englishman but it

seems  that  the amendment states  in  very  clear

English:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"provided that the provisions of this subsection

may  apply to private streets of a width less than

thirty-six feet if the local authority in  special

circumstances thinks fit".



<br><br>I  repeat  "if  the  local  authority  in  special

circumstances thinks fit".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Sir, leaves the power entirely with the

local authority. We are not taking any power  from

the  local authority but giving them a discretion,

and  that discretion has been added in order  that

unnecessary expenses may be saved. When we make up

roads we always think about the use of such roads.

Will  it  be a main thoroughfare serving thousands

of  vehicles,  or  will it be just  a  small  road

serving probably a couple of hundred cars, or will

it  be just a small little lane serving a few cars

and  plenty of bicycles and pedestrians? I  think,

Sir,  the question of cost must be related to use,

and  this  clause  here gives the local  authority

just  that discretion. If in the circumstances  it

thinks that the use will not justify the cost then

that  local  authority can say, "We  will  have  a

narrow road"; but if it thinks that the use is  so

much  greater and we must make adequate provision,

it  can  under this provision, say no. And  having

given  that extra power of discretion to the local

authority,  I  do not see there is  anything  that

anyone  can object to. It is not subtracting  from

the local authorities but adding to them.



<br><br>12.00 noon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Member for

Tanglin  for  whose knowledge of local  government

working  and the keen study he has given  to  this

Bill  I  have a healthy respect, has given a  very

fine,  simple explanation of the different clauses

relating to the making up and repair of roads. But

I  think he is labouring a little bit too much  on

this  difference between clauses 143 and  144.  If

you   will  see,  Sir,  his  amendment   is   only

permissive,  and  if it is only  permissive  there

does  not  seem any point in making the amendment.

If  under clause 144 a local authority has decided

that  it  will only take over private streets  not

less than 36 feet wide, if you put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2403</b></font><br><br>



this amendment in clause 143 and say that provided

that  the  provisions of this clause may apply  to

streets   less  than  36  feet  wide,  the   local

authority  has  already decided it will  not  take

over  anything under 36 feet wide. So there is  no

point  in putting this permissive clause  here.  A

new  local  authority  may however  decide  it  is

prepared  to  change the policy of its predecessor

and  perhaps accept roads which may well  be  less

than  36  feet  wide.  It is  left  to  the  local

authority to say. It is a discretion, Sir. I think

the Member has been critical of the in-roads being

made  by  the Government or the Minister into  the

powers  and  functions  of local  authorities.  He

would appear to contradict himself in wanting  the

Government to reduce the discretionary  powers  of

the local authority. I think a new local authority

if it wants to take over streets less than 36 feet

wide can do so. And even under clause 143, without

the  amendment, if the owners write to  the  local

authority  to  take over the street,  although  it

knows the street to be less than 36 feet wide  and

the  Bill  is quite clear on it, yet if the  local

authority  has  changed its policy it  will  still

entertain  that application, Sir, and take  action

on its own initiative under clause 144.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I just want

to  ask  the  Hon. the Acting Chief Secretary  one

question. Under this clause whether power is given

to  a local authority to take over a street if  it

is under 36 feet. What I want to ask is -



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Point of clarification, Sir. May I

ask  the  hon. Member which clause he is referring

to?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> The clause in question, Sir, and

the explanation given just now by the Acting Chief

Secretary.  What  I want to ask is  this.  If  the

frontagers of a street which is less than 36  feet

wide  level  the  street up and have  it  properly

done, have they the right to demand from the local

authority  to  declare that  street  as  a  public

street? That is the question.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2404</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, the proviso

proposed by the hon. Member is very clear. It says

that while the residents there have the right to

demand, yet the discretion lies with the City

Council. Here we have the hon. Member for Telok

Ayer asking whether the residents have the right

to demand and to have that demand acceded to!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point brought out by the hon. Member for

Tanglin  is  that in the case of  clause  144  the

initiative  lies  with the City Council  but  with

this  proviso,  he hopes that if  the  proviso  is

accepted  the initiative will therefore  lie  with

the residents. They will therefore have a right to

demand  whereas  it  is still  left  to  the  City

Council  to  exercise its own  discretion.  Surely

under  clause  144 the residents at any  time  can

demand   by   themselves  or  through  their   own

representatives to have a street in that area less

than  36  feet wide to be considered by  the  City

Council to be taken over as a public street?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I do not want to take this

point  too  far but there is another  problem,  of

course,  related to this other business, and  that

is  that  in  these days the Singapore Improvement

Trust is the planning authority with regard to the

width  of streets and the authority is not in  the

hands  of the local authority at all. Nevertheless

the  S.I.T. has  built streets  in  some  of  its

housing  estates - Tiong Bahru, for  example - which

are  less  than 36 feet wide, and it has exercised

its  right I think under this clause 143 that  the

City Council take them over as public streets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point we are getting at is that the tendency

has been that our planners regard 36 feet width as

essential for any type of street, and through this

amendment  we  seek  to  establish  that  this  is

absurd. As I have illustrated in a number of cases

there are possibilities in new housing estates and

in old lorongs which lead to only a certain number

of  houses, in which in our view a width  of  less

than  36  feet  would  be entirely  desirable  and

entirely  adequate.  And I think  it  is  somewhat

important in this growing Island of Singapore that

we  should  not  waste land unnecessarily  or  the

expense



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2405</b></font><br><br>



of   making  up  roads  where  there  is  no  real

necessity  for streets 36 feet wide. That  is  the

point  I make, that there is now this fetish  that

everything  must  be 36 feet in width  regardless;

and  our  intention is, as I said, to have written

into  the Bill a recognition that private  streets

of  less  than  36 feet in width  are  in  certain

circumstances acceptable streets. And that is  not

the position at present.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> It is very difficult for me to

understand  why  Government  should  object  to  a

permissive  provision  to  be  incorporated   into

clause  143.  The Minister for Communications  and

Works  completely went off the point by mentioning

demand.   There  is  no  demand;   there   is   no

possibility of demand. It is a provision  to  show

to   the  officials  who  will  be  in  charge  of

administering  the  planning and  taking  over  of

streets that such a thing is allowed under  clause

143.  I  think  it  is  very  important  that  the

officials should be reminded that there  is  power

because  I  have come across many cases where  the

answer  is, "Oh, this section says you cannot;  no

street  under 36 feet wide can be taken over,  and

that  is the end of it." When you are dealing with

officials, many of them will not be concerned with

the  interpretation of clauses 143, 145  and  146,

and  I  cannot possibly understand why  Government

should object to this permissive provision to make

the  clause  clearer to be incorporated  into  the

clause.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the

Government  is  not  objecting to  any  permissive

clause. We are trying to explain that under clause

143  it  is  obligatory on the  part  of  a  local

authority to take over any public street  that  is

36  feet  wide  or more; and under clause  144  it

looks after streets less than 36 feet wide - it is a

permissive clause.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I would like to

touch on the point about the Singapore Improvement

Trust  which  the  hon.  Member  for  Tanglin  has

mentioned.  It  is  true that the  S.I.T. as  the

planning authority requires a street to be made up

to  36  feet  wide  but  the  S.I.T. is  not  the

authority to say whether that street should remain

a private street or a public street.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 152, line 17: after "notice", to insert:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;", provided that the requirements of this

subsection shall also apply in respect of Crown

Land other than forest and nature reserves".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 154 (1) states as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where the local authority is satisfied that any

grass,  hedge,  tree or other vegetation  whether

growing  or  not  is in an inflammable  state  or

likely to be dangerous to life or property or  to

cause an obstruction or in any way physically  or

visually  to impede traffic, the local  authority

may  by  notice in writing require the  owner  or

occupier of the land on which the same is growing

or  lying  to  remove  the  same  within  a  time

specified in the notice."



<br><br>Sir, we consider that it is desirable that this

should be applied also to Crown



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2407</b></font><br><br>



land  which  is in the same inflammable  state  or

likely to be dangerous to life or property.  There

are  examples of pieces of Crown land  in  what  I

might   call  "built-up"  areas  where  you   find

property in this kind of state and it seems to  us

that  when  the  ordinary  owner  or  occupier  is

required  to  clear his own land that this  should

also  apply to Government land as well.  In  fact,

the  Government  should set a good  example  in  a

matter of this kind but often that is not the case

and only this afternoon on coming to this Assembly

I  noticed a particularly notorious piece of Crown

land  close  to  a  school which remains  and  has

remained for a long time in an inflammable  state,

so that a fire could be caused and it could affect

the school. So, Sir, we think that it is desirable

and  indeed useful that the responsibility  should

be  put  on  the local authority to bring  to  the

notice  of  Government that there  are  pieces  of

Crown land in an unfit state. I raised this matter

in Select Committee and, during the debate on this

matter at that time, the Attorney-General promised

that  this  would  be  a  matter  into  which  the

Government  would  look further  and  he  gave  an

undertaking  that the matter would  be  considered

and  for  this  reason I withdrew my amendment  at

that  time.  Subsequently, the Minister  was  kind

enough  to  write  to  me to point  out  that  the

amendment could not be accepted because this could

hardly be made to apply to forest reserves.  Also,

we  have  been only too glad to include the  words

"other  than forest and nature reserves"  in  this

amendment, so that we feel quite certain that  the

Government  will  now accept the amendment  as  it

stands.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. P. Shanks):</b> Mr

Chairman,   Sir,   as  was  promised   in   Select

Committee,  this question has been considered  and

it has been decided that this amendment, even with

the  insertion of the words relating to forest and

nature  reserves, cannot be accepted. It would  be

wrong for the Crown to be bound in this way by the

insertion  of  these  words and  indeed  it  would

derogate  from  the  powers of this  Assembly.  If

there are cases, where it seems the Crown has been

perhaps slow



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2408</b></font><br><br>



in  putting  right land which requires  attention,

such as the example the hon. Member mentioned just

now, I am quite sure that if particulars are given

to  the Minister for Local Government he will look

into the matter and see what can be done about it.

It  is,  I am informed, usually a matter where  no

great  difficulty arises and that the  Crown  does

abide  by the provisions of clauses of this nature

even  though  it  is,  as I say,  constitutionally

improper  to  provide expressly in such  a  clause

that  the Crown should be bound thereby. For those

reasons,  the  Government  does  not  accept   the

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, if a fire were to break

out on a piece of Crown land on which there was  a

large amount of lallang and other vegetation which

had  not been kept clean and if there was to be  a

loss  of  life as a result of that fire  and  when

notification could quite easily have been made  by

the  local  authority  who have  inspectors  going

round  to inspect the property of ordinary private

citizens, would the Attorney-General not  consider

that this position could very well be obviated  by

accepting  this  amendment - I  think,  without  any

derogation to the Crown?



<br><br><!-- Mr Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanks:</b> No, Sir. I do not consider that the

acceptance  of  this amendment  would  affect  the

position in that way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I think we

must  first  agree that it is essential  that  any

grass,  hedge,  tree,  etc, that  is  inflammable

should  be removed, and anything that is going  to

obstruct  traffic should be put  straight.  It  is

clear   the   Government  thinks  this   is   very

important.  I agree that it is very important.  If

it  is  so, then it should apply to all cases.  In

the  case of Crown land which is under the control

of the Crown, the Crown is the owner of that piece

of  land.  The  owner of Crown land  must  set  an

example to the other private owners. They must set

a good example. If we put in a law whereby we say,

"This  will apply only to the ordinary people  and

the  Crown  will  be exempted," I suppose  we  are

going back to a time when you have a lot of privileges



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2409</b></font><br><br>



attached  to  the  Crown.  This   is   a

democratic  country. We want the  people  to  know

that what we ask them to do, we are prepared to do

it  ourselves. If we ourselves are not prepared to

undertake such things, then we must not ask people

to  undertake them. There can only be one  set  of

laws  for all people in this country, if  this  is

going  to  be called a democratic country.  In  my

experience,  I  have  always  found  that  private

owners  are  all  very careful  about  their  land

because  they are afraid that sanitary  and  other

inspectors  might  issue them with  a  summons  to

bring them to court and fine them. Furthermore,  I

was  informed  that in the case of  an  owner  who

persists in not clearing the lallang, and  so  on,

Government  may  take action  to  clear  them  and

charge  the cost of it to that owner. Now, in  the

case of Crown land, I think it should be the same.

The  Crown should, in all cases, cut down lallang,

and  all  that. I know that there is  a  piece  of

property  along  Upper  Serangoon  Road  full   of

lallang. Complaints came to me and I wrote  in  to

the   authorities  concerned  pointing   out   the

existence  of lallang. I think that no action  has

been  taken for a long time. The Crown  cannot  be

prosecuted.  Nobody is going to prosecute  himself

and  that state of affairs will remain until  such

time when a fire really breaks out and sweeps away

many  houses. The Government will then sit up  and

say,   "It  is  regrettable."  But  I  think  that

prevention  is always better than cure.  Now  that

piece   of   land  concerns  one  of   the   local

authorities  and if the local authorities  do  not

have  this  proviso for people to point out  their

own  faults, then, in the case of Government, they

will  just take no notice whatsoever. I  think  we

should try to remove our faults, if there are any,

before  we  start trying to remove the  faults  of

other  people.  Let  the  Government  set  a  good

example.  If the Government cannot undertake  that

job itself, then it should not expect the citizens

of Singapore to do the same.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> If it is the

Government policy that the Government is  exempted

from this clause,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2410</b></font><br><br>



may  I  ask whose responsibility will it be should

there   be  a  fire  arising  out  of  inflammable

vegetation   on  Government  or  on   Crown   land

adjoining private property, resulting in  loss  of

life and property?



<br><br><!-- Mr Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanks:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I do not want it

to  be thought that I have implied that Government

is  exempted  from this clause. What  I  want  the

House  to  understand is that it is not  necessary

and  indeed it would be improper to put into  this

clause   words  purporting  to  bind  the   Crown.

Government is aware of the need for it  itself  to

set  a  good  example in these matters. Government

does  not  seek any exemption from this clause  in

the  sense  that it wishes to avoid responsibility

for  cutting  lallang  and grass  on  Crown  land.

Government does, and will continue to,  cut  grass

and lallang on Crown land where it considers there

is any danger of fire and it will do it not at the

expense of the local authority in whose area  that

land  lies  but at its own expense.  There  is  no

question of any exemption at all nor is there  any

need,  at any rate in law, to put into a  Bill  of

this nature an expression intended to indicate  to

the  Government that it should set a good example.

What  I  said is that it would be constitutionally

wrong   to   make   this,   legally   unnecessary,

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Chairman, I move,

302   of  this  Ordinance  shall  apply  to   such

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to rectify an omission, Sir. The words

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 154, as amended, ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 159-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2411</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 159 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I wish to vote against

this  clause and consider that this clause  should

be left out of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position, Sir, is that this clause is not

being  operated today and clause 159 (1) reads  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The owner and occupier of any premises abutting

upon  any private street to which they have access

or  the  right of access from such premises  shall

cause  such  portion  of  the  street  as  fronts,

adjoins  or abuts on his premises and  up  to  the

centre  thereof,  including the  footways,  to  be

properly swept and cleansed and watered so far  as

is  reasonably  practicable and  the  dust,  dirt,

ashes,  rubbish  and  filth of  every  sort  found

thereon to be collected and removed."



<br><br>As  I  say, Sir, this clause is not being operated

today  and owners on private streets are not being

penalised  for not cleaning their frontages  right

to  the  middle of the road. Indeed, to insist  on

this  would  be  to start endless  quarrels  among

neighbours  and  people would be  pushing  rubbish

from one side of the street to the other. That  is

obviously an undesirable situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the City Council representatives from both

Parties,  when they made their representations  to

Government,  asked that Government  should  change

this particular clause. They stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This clause is a reproduction of section 130 of

the  Municipal Ordinance and as has  been  pointed

out  on  previous  occasions, the  clause  in  its

existing form is unworkable and should be entirely

recast  so  as  to enable the local  authority  to

charge  a  special rate or levy on private  street

frontagers for street cleansing."



<br><br>Sir,  this  matter  has been brought  up  for  the

attention of Government, and I myself, by moving a

similar amendment in Select Committee, brought  it

to the Government's attention again but Government

has  not  faced  up to this problem  and  has  not

introduced  amendments to  this  clause  which  is

regarded  as unworkable. Therefore, as  Government

proposes  to do nothing about it, it  is  best  to

omit  the clause altogether rather than bring  the

law into contempt by non-enforcement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2412</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Stewart:</b> Mr Chairman, it would seem

nevertheless  that under sub-clause  (4)  of  this

clause,  a  simple  scheme should  be  worked  out

administratively  to  clean  private  streets  and

charge  the owners a fee. Sir, it does not  appear

to  be so much a question of legislation requiring

an   amendment  as  finding  a  practical  way  of

enforcing the existing provisions. It may be  that

the  clause, as it stands, is a bit difficult  but

that  does  not mean that it should not remain  in

the  Bill. If this clause is not to stand part  of

the  Bill, then the result will probably  be  that

these private street owners cannot be compelled to

keep  them  so. Although it is true that the  local

authority  has  so  far  not  been  taking  action

against  these owners to compel them to  keep  the

streets  clean, I would suggest, Sir,  under  sub-clause  (4),  that  some simple  scheme  could  be

worked out administratively. It will be a question

of  trying  to find a simple scheme to  work  this

clause. For this reason, Sir, we would like to see

this clause kept in the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, my hon. Friend has, of

course, drawn our attention to sub-clause  (4).  I

would  invite  him to read it just a  little  more

closely. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The local authority may contract with any owner

or occupier as aforesaid for sweeping and cleaning

such  street  and for collecting and removing  the

dust...".



<br><br>Therefore,  it is not obligatory and the  position

arises - this  is  the practical point - that  if  any

owner or occupier does not desire to enter into  a

contract with the local authority, or say three or

four out of a street in which there are ten owners

or  occupiers  say  they will  not  enter  into  a

contract  with  the  local  authority,  the  local

authority is not going to half-clean a street  and

it  is not going to clean a street where there are

people who are not going to enter into a contract.

That  is the problem, and it is one which has been

pointed out to Govvernment and Government has  not

faced  up to it. So long as the position  is  that

the  local authority may contract but there is  no

obligation  on  either  side,  then  the  position

remains unsatisfactory as it is today. We on  this

side,  of  course, quite agree  that  to  have  no

clause  at  all regarding the cleaning of  private

streets



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2413</b></font><br><br>



would be undesirable but it is our duty as Members

of  the  Opposition  to point  out  that,  in  its

present  form,  this  clause  is  unworkable   and

requires amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Stewart:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I doubt

whether there would be any owner of a house  in  a

private street not accepting the offer of a  local

authority to keep that street clean on payment  of

a small fee. I am sure that private owners, rather

than  do  things  themselves, would  jump  at  the

opportunity  of  the local authority  offering  to

contract to keep the streets clean. I am glad that

the  Member for Tanglin realises that this  clause

had better remain in this Bill rather than to have

no clause at all. As I say, Sir, it still gives an

opportunity  to  the  local authority  to  find  a

scheme - it may be that it has not been able to find

a   proper  scheme  and  I  know  that  the  local

authority has been trying to form schemes - and they

should  carry on to find some scheme.  I  think  a

scheme  can  be worked out in some of the  smaller

private streets. It is not for want of trying, and

I feel, Sir, that this clause should remain in the

Bill rather than have no clause at all. It rightly

puts  the onus on the owners or occupiers  because

private  streets are not maintained by  the  local

authority but it does allow the local authority to

contract with them to sweep and clean the streets.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, would my hon. Friend

accept  my  assurance that there  are  cases,  and

numbers of cases, where owners or occupiers refuse

to  enter into a contract with the local authority

under  sub-clause (4)? Because that is a fact,  we

feel  that this clause requires amendment  and  we

feel  it  unfortunate that Government has declined

to consider how it should be amended.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

I  am one of those occupier/owners of a house that

abuts  a  private  road and I  would  welcome  any

contract with the City Council for the cleaning of

at  least  half portion of that road  abutting  my

house. Perhaps if the Member for Tanglin will look

at  sub-clause (3), he will see that it  reads  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any person to whom such notice is given who

fails to comply with it shall, on conviction,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2414</b></font><br><br>



be liable without further notice  to  a

fine  not  exceeding twenty-five dollars for  each

day...".



<br><br>That is a very serious fine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...during which such non-compliance continues,

and  the local authority may itself cause the work

to  be  done and the owner shall pay to the  local

authority the cost and expense thereof."



<br><br>Going on to sub-clause (5), Sir, it reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The amount due by the contracting persons to the

local authority may be recovered as though it were

a tax leviable under this Ordinance."



<br><br>So,  if the local authority has the power not only

to  fine but also to carry out the work and charge

the  owner  for it, the owner will  be  very  much

inclined   on  reasonable  terms  to  accept   any

contract with the local authority. I for one  will

do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I wish to point out to the hon.

Member  that my copy says the fine does not exceed

twenty dollars as against twenty-five dollars.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> It is twenty dollars, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, the only point I want to make is

that  the Liberal-Socialists and the Labour  Front

representatives  of  the  City  Council  did  make

representations to the Select Committee that  this

clause was unworkable and I do not think that they

were making a frivolous representation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 159 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 168-



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 161, line 8, to leave out "cinematograph"

and insert "cinema,".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think this is an amendment which was

overlooked  at the Committee stage. It appears  in

the original gazetted Bill as well as in this Bill

on page 161:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where any public-house, eating-house,

refreshment     room,    theatre,    cinematograph

exhibition or place of public entertainment has no

urinal or water-closet belonging...".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2415</b></font><br><br>



If you refer to the present Municipal Ordinance on

page 97, section 142 (1), you will find that there

is    a   comma   between   "cinematograph"    and

"exhibition". I think the reason why we have  gone

wrong  is  that  "cinematograph exhibition"  is  a

known  term, whereas "cinematograph" in the  sense

that  we use it today to mean "cinema" is what  is

in  fact  intended. So in inserting the  comma,  I

suggest  that we should also add the word "cinema"

instead of the old-fashioned "cinematograph".



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> We accept the amendment, Sir.

<br><br>Sir, clause 169 (1) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every person intending to erect any building

shall submit to the local authority such plans and

specifications,  if any, of the proposed  building

prepared  in accordance with the building  by-laws

made  under  this Ordinance. When such  plans  and

specifications  are in accordance  with  such  by-laws,  they may be approved by the local authority

for the purposes of this Part of this Ordinance."



<br><br>Now,   Sir,   we  consider  it  a  very  important

principle   that  once  building  plans   are   in

compliance  with by-laws and with other  laws,  it

should not be discretionary on the local authority

to  approve them but obligatory. The reference  to

subsections (2) and (3) of this clause  and  other

laws, as given in my second amendment "or with any

other written law for the time being in force", is

of course where specialised



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2416</b></font><br><br>



types  of buildings are concerned. As was  pointed

out   in   the  Select  Committee  debate,  petrol

stations  must comply with legislation  concerning

the  storage of dangerous petroleum and  obviously

therefore building plans must comply with the  law

in  connection  with  that  as  well  as  ordinary

building by-laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what we feel is this: it is of great

importance that we should make things as  easy  as

possible  for the applicant who wishes  to  build,

that he should in fact be encouraged to build  and

that as few obstacles as possible should be put in

his  way.  The new sub-clause (18) has really  the

same force as the amendment. The sub-clause reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the local authority does not within two

calendar  months after the date of the  submission

of  any plans under subsection (1) of this section

or  of  the date of the resubmission of such plans

amended  in  pursuance of subsection (3)  of  this

section,  as the case may be, approve such  plans,

such  plans shall be deemed to be approved  unless

the   local   authority  shall   have   previously

disapproved the same:



<br><br>Interference or delay by the local authority, once

all  laws  and  by-laws have been  complied  with,

should   not   be  permitted  and   instances   of

interference  for  political or  personal  reasons

could  occur if this clause is left as  it  stands

with  the word "may": that although building plans

are in compliance with by-laws and other laws,  it

is  not obligatory on the local authority to pass.

We think that this is an important point, Sir, and

we  hope  that  the Government will  approve  this

amendment.

to whom they belong, to be forfeited and disposed

of  in  such manner as a Magistrate's Court deems

fit:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that any perishable articles likely to

decay  so taken into custody and removed  may  be

disposed of forthwith:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided also that if any abandoned articles so

taken  into  custody  and  detained,  other  than

under sub-section (3) of this section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11) A report shall be made to the Magistrate's

such manner as the Court deems fit:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that if the Court directs the sale of

such  articles the proceeds shall be paid to  the

appropriate local authority fund.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, the amendment which Government

proposes is intended to restrict the powers of the

Police to take into custody only articles for sale

which  have been abandoned by hawkers. The  Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar  suggested,  when  moving  the

recommittal  of  this clause,  that  it  would  be

desirable  for receipts to be issued for  articles

seized by the Police in order to prevent abuse



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2418</b></font><br><br>



or  allegations  of abuse by the Police  of  their

powers  of  seizure and the disposal  of  articles

seized.  Government  in this  amendment  has  gone

beyond the suggestion which would be difficult  to

implement  in practice. It would, for example,  be

difficult to give receipts with full details  such

as  7½ katies of meat or 5¼ katies of fish  or

7,560  beads or buttons. In view of the provisions

of sub-clause (4), Government has now decided that

only  when  articles are abandoned,  may  they  be

taken into custody. Even then, when the owners are

prepared  to  disclose their  identity,  they  may

claim   these   articles  other  than  perishables

already disposed of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 214, as amended, ordered to stand part of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 216-



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 197, line 40, after "Minister", to insert

"after consultation with each local authority".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, this clause relates to slaughter-houses and the licensing thereof. Clause 215 in

point of fact is the clause which allows the local

authority to license slaughter-houses and also  to

provide  places  for  slaughter-houses.  It  is  a

matter  entirely within the purlieu of  the  local

authority. Clause 216 (1) states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If at any time it appears to the Minister that

there  is  a  sufficient number of fit and  proper

places to be used as slaughter-houses provided  by

any of the local authorities, the Minister may  by

order direct that from and after a day to be named

in  such  order no animals intended to be used  as

human food shall be slaughtered at any place other

than  one  of the slaughter-houses so provided  as

aforesaid...".



<br><br>This  matter  was  discussed and  debated  in  the

Select  Committee and I pointed out that,  as  the

local authority was in charge of slaughter-houses,

it was only proper that the Minister should act in

consultation with the local authority  in  respect

of  clause 216. I would remind my hon. friend  the

Minister  for Local Government that in column  267

of the Minutes of Evidence, it is clearly recorded

that Government indicated that they would make the

amendment. That will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2419</b></font><br><br>



found,  Sir, in your own words after a  Government

comment  and yet despite that, this amendment  has

not been moved by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is just one other point. We did discuss at

that  time  that  the wording  of  this  amendment

should  be  "after consultation  with  each  local

authority".  I did overlook this when  tabling  my

amendment  as "the local authority". I have,  Sir,

altered it to "after consultation with each  local

authority".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 220, line 39, to leave out from "(1)" to

the  end  of  line 6 in page 221, and insert  the

following sub-clauses:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No person other than the owner or occupier of

an   agricultural  holding  shall,  without   the

previous permission of the local authority  open,

dig or otherwise construct or permit or allow  to

be opened, dug or otherwise constructed any well,

tank or reservoir the water in which is likely to

be  used  for drinking or domestic purposes.  Any

well  within  the curtilage of any dwelling-house

shall  be  deemed to be likely  to  be  used  for

drinking or for domestic purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) If the owner or occupier of an agricultural

holding  opens, digs or otherwise  constructs  or

permits  or allows to be opened, dug, constructed

or   otherwise  constructed  any  well,  tank  or

reservoir,  he shall report the opening,  digging

or  construction of the well, tank or  reservoir,

as  the case may be, within one month thereof  to

the local authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Any person who commits a breach of

shall,  on  conviction, be liable to a  fine  not

exceeding two hundred dollars.".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2420</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by this amendment, the present sub-clauses

(1) and (2) are in the new sub-clause (1). The new

sub-clause  (2) is a new provision to  enable  the

owner  or  occupier of an agricultural holding  to

open   or  dig  wells  without  previously  having

obtained written permission of the local authority

but  he  is  nevertheless required  afterwards  to

report having done so within a month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the reconstruction of this clause, as

suggested   by  the  Member  for  Tanjong   Pagar,

Government  considers that the provisions  of  the

printed  sub-clause (1) are too  restrictive  upon

the  farmers for whom pipe water supplies are  not

available.  However, the safeguards of  sub-clause

(4)  are retained and if for any reason such wells

are a danger to health or dangerous in other ways,

they are liable to be closed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the new sub-clause (3), this

follows the present sub-clause (3) except that  it

now  has  cross-references to new sub-clauses  (1)

and (2).



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I would

like  to  ask  the  Minister for Local  Government

their  water supply if there are no wells. I  know

of many cases where the land is not being made use

of  for  planting. There is no pipe water reaching

out to such places and if the people there are not

allowed to dig wells for drinking purposes,  where

can they obtain their water from?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, the answer is

that  such person should make application  to  the

local authority for permission to dig a well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 284-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 284

stand part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, this is one of the

illustrations  where the ideas  of  Government  on

local government are as the shifting sands. Clause

285  of  the present Municipal Ordinance to  which

this clause refers reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Registrar of Vehicles may grant a licence to

act-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) as a driver or conductor of a hackney

carriage...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) as the rider of a trisha...".



<br><br>The  Bill as placed before us originally left  out

the  granting of licences to drivers  so  that  it

became in clause 285 of the original Bill:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No person shall act as a conductor of a public

service vehicle or as a trisha rider...".



<br><br>And  in Select Committee, the Government moved  an

amendment to leave out "the conductor" so that  it

now reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No person shall act as a trisha rider save under

and  in  accordance with a licence issued  by  the

Registrar of Vehicles.".



<br><br>So that, bit by bit, this clause has been whittled

down and more licensing has been given over to the

Police  but the local authority now and  then  may

still license trisha riders whilst the Police  are

to  license drivers and conductors. This does  not

seem  to  be  an improvement on the situation.  It

does  not  seem  to us to be logical:  the  Police

should  take  over all duties or none  at  all.  A

trisha  is  after all a public service vehicle  as

you  will find if you refer to the definitions  on

pages 72 and 73:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' "public service vehicle" means a vehicle used

or kept for use for the carriage of passengers

for hire or reward...'



and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' "trisha" means a three-wheeled pedal cycle

constructed  or  adapted for the  carriage  of

persons of goods.'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2422</b></font><br><br>



So  that it seems to us that there is no point  in

cutting   out  conductors,  cutting  out  drivers,

unless  you  go  the whole way and hand  over  the

licensing of trisha riders to the Police as  well.

So  let  us have a clear-cut division between  the

two:  the  registration and licensing of  vehicles

being  in  the hands of the Registrar of Vehicles,

that  is  to  say,  the local authority,  and  the

registration of drivers of all kinds being in  the

hands of the Police.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> This is a very minor matter, Mr

Chairman,  and the Government is quite willing  to

accept  this amendment. I should just say for  the

record  that the only question about it is whether

the  Police  will in fact be able to  handle  this

additional work at short notice. The original idea

was  to leave it alone until later on and to  give

it to them when we were sure that they were ready.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member is very hard to satisfy. If we do

not  do  what  he  wants,  he  says  that  we  are

dictatorial and steam-rolling. If we  do  what  he

wants,  he says that we are as the shifting sands.

Whatever we do, we are wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, we have tried to meet him and say,

"Well,  we  will include the amendment now,  which

could have been made no doubt at a more convenient

time  in  the future." I should just add  for  the

record  that though we are giving these powers  to

the  Police now, I am not yet certain that in fact

the   Police   will  be  able  to  exercise   them

immediately. They may have to wait for  some  time

under the transitional provisions of clause 323.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 287

stand part of the Bill,"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2423</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, while we are grateful to

the Government for agreeing that clause 284 should

not   form  part  of  the  Bill,  albeit  somewhat

grudgingly,  we feel that, logically, this  should

now  also apply to clause 287. Quite clearly  this

clause, in which the trisha rider is unfit to  act

as  a rider, should now fall within the purlieu of

the  Police to deal with him and it should not  be

the Registrar of Vehicles who should have anything

to do with deciding on the unfitness of a rider to

ride.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The Government accepts this amendment

which is consequential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and disagreed to.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 293-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 293 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, our purpose in moving that

this clause does not stand part of the Bill is  to

draw attention to anomalies which arose before and

now arise more, now that these clauses 284 and 287

do not stand part of the Bill. The clause reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Subject to the provisions of this Ordinance, the

Registrar  of Vehicles may, in any case  where  an

offence  has been committed against this Ordinance

or any by-law made thereunder or where particulars

of  a  conviction and any sentence passed  thereon

have  been sent to the City Council by a Court  in

accordance  with the provisions of section  83  of

the  Road Traffic Ordinance, cancel or suspend for

such period as he thinks fit any licence issued by

him under the provisions of this Ordinance."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it is quite clear, Sir, that this clause does

not stand four square with such a clause as clause

286.  Clause 286 prescribes the rates of  hire  or

fares,  and  it also prescribes that if  a  driver

attempts  to charge a higher rate than he  should,

then  he  is  to  be penalised. The penalty  comes

under  clause 293 - "Cancellation and suspension  of

licences". The Registrar of Vehicles,  as  I  have

read  out, "may cancel or suspend for such  period

as he thinks fit any licence issued by him". As  a

result of the changes in clause 284 in particular,

the   only  licences  now  to  be  issued  by  the

Registrar of Vehicles



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2424</b></font><br><br>



are  the  licences  registering vehicles  and  not

drivers. Therefore, the Registrar of Vehicles  can

only  cancel  the vehicle's licence.  If  a  taxi-driver  comes up before the Registrar of  Vehicles

for  having committed an offence under clause 286,

all  that the Registrar of Vehicles can do  is  to

cancel  or  suspend the taxi licence and  not  his

driving  licence, and that, of course,  would  not

necessarily  fall on the taxi-driver  but  on  the

owner  of  the taxi. Here is a clear case  of  the

need  for  amendments to this clause, and  we  are

voting  against it. As it stands, this  clause  is

not satisfactory.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I rather think, Mr Chairman, that

the  hon.  Member has not quite got the  point  of

this clause. If he will look at sub-clause (4)  of

clause 286 to which he referred, he will see  that

to  attempt to take more than the prescribed fares

is  an offence; and that, of course, is covered by

clause  316  which also lays down  that  where  no

particular  penalty  is  specified,  an   offender

shall,  on conviction, be liable to a fine of  not

more than $200.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the hon. Member will look further at clause

286  (3),  he  will  see that  where  there  is  a

dispute,  the  Registrar  of  Vehicles,  in  fact,

arbitrates and says, "This is the way  I  see  it,

and  my  decision is final." He can, if he  thinks

fit, issue a certificate which shall be admissible

in  evidence.  If I understand that  rightly,  the

Registrar's certificate then goes to the Court  in

which the offender is tried and will be admissible

in   evidence  to  secure  a  conviction  of   the

offending taxi-driver and get him fined  not  more

than  $200. I cannot quite see why the hon. Member

wishes  to have an addition to the power  to  take

away his licence, since he is already subject to a

fine. Perhaps he might like to clarify it further.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I do not think my friend

the  Minister  for Communications  and  Works  has

quite  got  it right. There is in this clause  293

provision  for the cancellation and suspension  of

licences,  and  it  is common  practice  that  the

Registrar  of  Vehicles to date has  cancelled  or

suspended licences for such offences as are  cited

in clause 286, so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2425</b></font><br><br>



that  not  necessarily is a fine  imposed  on  the

offender but, as it states in this clause:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Registrar of Vehicles may, in any case where

an   offence  has  been  committed  against   this

Ordinance or any by-law made thereunder  or  where

particulars  of  a  conviction  and  any  sentence

passed  thereon have been sent to the City Council

by  a  Court in accordance with the provisions  of

section  83 of the Road Traffic Ordinance,  cancel

or  suspend for such period as he thinks  fit  any

licence issued by him...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the point is there, that this power

has been used, and used quite valuably, to keep up

the  high  standard of driving and other forms  of

conduct  of  taxi-drivers,  and  cancellation   or

suspension  of  the driver's licence  has  been  a

matter  for  the  Registrar of Vehicles.  Now,  of

course,  it should quite properly be the  duty  of

the  police  to cancel or suspend, but  I  do  not

think  that this clause is quite four square  with

what  both we on this side and the Minister  would

like to see.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I think I can clear this up a little

further,  Mr Chairman. The broad principle  which

everyone accepts is that the Registrar of Vehicles

deals  with  the  vehicle side  of  the  business - whether  the tyres are properly blown up, and  the

strength of the chassis and things like that.  The

persons who operate the vehicles are dealt with by

the  police. We have now finally included  trishas

in  the police duties as well. So far so good.  It

follows, of course, that where a vehicle is  being

dealt  with,  then the Registrar  who  issues  the

licence  should  have  the power  to  suspend  the

licence, if that is the appropriate thing  to  do.

Similarly,  when  the police are  dealing  with  a

person,  they issue the licence, and it  obviously

goes to the police to take away his licence if  he

shows   himself  unfit  to  have  it.  The  police

functions are being put through the legal  sausage

machine - you  might call that the layman's  way  of

putting it - and they will come out in due course in

the  Road  Traffic Ordinance. I hope we will  meet

the points of significance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this particular case, I do not think there is

any   difficulty.  Clause  293  provides  for  the

Registrar  to  take  away licences  which  he  has

issued,  and it refers specifically of  course  to

Registrar  operates  to issue licences  to  public

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 293 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 323-



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 245, to leave out lines 31 to 40, and

lines 1 to 12 in page 246.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sub-clause (2) of clause 323 entitled

"Transitional provisions" reads as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Notwithstanding any other provisions of this

Ordinance or the repeal of the Municipal Ordinance

the  Minister  may,  in his discretion,  by  order

published  in  the  Gazette and  subject  to  such

directions as the Minister may from time  to  time

give  to the City Council, authorise, empower  and

direct the City Council or any of its employees to

continue  to  have,  exercise  and  perform   such

functions, duties, powers (including the powers to

levy  rates  and to charge fees), discretions  and

authorities  or  any  of  them  had  exercised  or

performed  by  the  City Council  or  any  of  its

employees  under the provisions of  the  Municipal

Ordinance and may likewise authorise, empower  and

direct the City Council or any of its employees to

refrain  from  exercising such functions,  duties,

powers, discretions and authorities or any of them

or such functions, duties, powers, discretions and

authorities  or  any  of  them  as  are  by   this

Ordinance conferred or imposed on the City Council

or  any of its employees, and the Minister may  by

such  or  any subsequent order define the area  to

which  any  such order relates and such  area  may

include  any area which was not immediately  prior

to  the  date  of  the coming  into  operation  of

section 3 of this Ordinance a part of the City."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this clause 323 has inevitably reared its

ugly  head at various stages during the debate  in

Committee  because it concerns  other  clauses  so

directly. Briefly, it is because when the area  of

Katong goes out to the District Council, the local

administration in the District Council will not be

ready  to  carry out those services to  which  the

people of Katong have been entitled and which they

have enjoyed for many decades. It is a question of

direction  and ordering by the Minister  that  the

City  Council shall carry out all the  duties  and

functions in this area, and the administration  of

the area at the local government level,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2427</b></font><br><br>



so  long  as the Minister pleases. We have pointed

out  at various times during this debate that  the

intentions of the Government on this question have

been somewhat muddled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, in the Select Committee the

Minister made it quite clear that he would need to

carry  out this business for four years.  Then  he

corrected himself and made it three years. Now the

official  version  from the Chief  Secretary  this

morning was that it would be for only about 6 to 8

months.  But whatever the period, it  is,  in  our

view,  entirely farcical. You try to expel  Katong

from  the city, and then recognise that you cannot

do it and have to provide for the city services to

continue  as  before. At the same time,  you  make

provision  that  the  elected  representatives  of

Katong should sit on the District Council but have

no  say  whatever regarding the administration  of

the  area  that they represent; because,  how  can

they  possibly help in the administration of their

own area, the area for which they are responsible,

if  they  are  sitting  in  the  District  Council

without local authority? It does mean that  Katong

is  for  a period - whether it be for six months  or

three years, it is not material - being turned  into

a   kind   of   no-man's-land   with   no   proper

representation at all. We consider  that  this  is

not  a  fine start for local government  districts

which  we  thought was the intention  behind  this

Bill and the introduction of District Councils.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the transitional

provisions  as provided for in clause  323  are  a

vital  part  of this Bill, and this  clause  is  a

vital  clause and the Government must  oppose  any

attempt  to  amend it. The transitional provisions

are  necessary, and without them we  cannot  carry

out  the  present  intention to have  a  new  City

Council and District Councils in December 1957 and

March 1958 respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have already argued at length the reasons

why  the boundaries of the local government  areas

and   the  electoral  divisions  should   not   be

subjected  to further advertisements  calling  for

further



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2428</b></font><br><br>



representations from the public, and consideration

of those representations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the present Bill was drafted, it was

foreseen  that  transitional provisions  would  be

required as it may not be possible to achieve  the

main  purpose of the Bill, that is, to  create  at

the   same   time   for   the   local   government

administration  of Singapore, a new  City  Council

and  District  Councils which  would  replace  the

Rural  Board,  if the establishment of  these  new

local authorities had to be expedited. A number of

major  factors  were involved:  for  example,  the

length  of time it would take for the Bill  to  be

passed,  and  how soon administrative arrangements

could  be set up, involving, as it did, terms  and

conditions of service arising out of the  transfer

of staff and so forth between the City Council and

the  Government. Sir, one factor hinges  upon  the

other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill was given its First Reading on the

29th  of August, 1956, and we are today, the  29th

of  July, 1957, still considering this Bill in the

Committee stage of the whole Assembly. Sir, it  is

true that in the Explanatory Note it was stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Transitional provisions have been included to

enable the Rural Board to continue to perform  its

present  functions in the Rural  Board  area  and,

pending the constitution of the District Councils,

to administer those parts of the present City area

which  are  to  be  merged into the  new  District

Council areas."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once this Bill becomes law, Sir, every effort

will  be made by the Government towards that  end.

The   probability   is  that  these   transitional

provisions may not be required at all in the  case

of  the  western boundaries of the new  city  area

which  will  be made up of the rural  areas  which

will  be  brought into the city. I  am  told  that

these  transitional provisions may not be required

and  that it is possible for the new City  Council

to administer that area when it is created. And if

we  are  not  able to achieve the  same  thing  in

regard  to  Katong, it will not  be  for  want  of

trying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin mentioned that the

Minister  said in the Select Committee  that  this

transitional period may take four years. I do  not

think  that  is  correct, Sir. I  think  what  the

Minister  said was that, for an interim period  of

four years, these District Councils will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2429</b></font><br><br>



be  run on the lines of the Rural Board as long as

they   are  dependent,  to  a  large  extent,   on

Government   funds.  He  also  said   that   these

transitional provisions, in so far as Katong is to

be  administered by the City Council  pending  the

creation of District Councils, may be from six  to

eight months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the circumstances, since we may not be

able  to let the Rural Board look after the Katong

area   during   the  transitional  period   before

District   Council  elections   and   before   the

establishment  of District Councils,  we  have  to

fall  back on the expedient also provided  for  in

the  transitional provisions of letting  the  City

Council  carry  on  temporarily  local  government

administration in the areas of Katong which are to

be included in the District Council areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanglin has, I think, been

inclined  to  be unduly gloomy in his appreciation

of  the  situation. It is not  that  we  fear  any

confusion or any administrative chaos - this was the

term   which  I  think  he  used  in  the   Select

Committee.   Far   from  it.  These   transitional

provisions  are  necessary because the  Government

has not been able to bring about the desired take-over  of  these  particular  areas  in  time,  and

because  we are now going to expedite the creation

of the City Council and the District Councils; and

that,  I  think, is what the public  of  Singapore

wants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is so easy once the Bill is passed to

delay   the   City  Council  elections   and   the

establishment of a new City Council, and similarly

of  the  District  Councils, by  saying  that  the

mechanics   of   the  administrative   change-over

require  a  lot  of time and reorganisation.  This

change-over  does require time and reorganisation,

Sir,  but  by  making  use of  these  transitional

expedients, we can achieve our objective of having

a new City Council in December.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what we are trying to do involves big

changes and is a challenge to us in these exciting

times.   If  we  want  these  changes   in   local

government  to take place at a faster pace,  these

transitional  provisions  are  the  best  in   the

circumstances, in that they will cause hardly  any

dislocation  in the provision of local  government

services and enable the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2430</b></font><br><br>



change-over in the administration to be undertaken

smoothly. Sir, in what way will the residents  of

Katong  suffer  by introducing these  transitional

provisions,  whether it is in or out of  the  city

area?   As  I  pointed  out  this  morning,   Sir,

essential  services like water, electricity,  gas,

sewerage,  fire services, ambulance  and  accident

services, are all island-wide services provided by

the  City Council. Other services like scavenging,

conservancy, construction and maintenance of roads

and  drains, licensing of trades and so forth, can

be  taken  over later on by the District Councils,

without  any  lowering  of  standards,  when   the

staffing   and  administrative  arrangements   are

completed. I think I pointed out this morning that

these   District  Councils  will  be   given   the

necessary  staff.  In fact, arrangements  are  now

being  made  to  proceed with finding  what  staff

should  be allocated to each District Council.  In

the  meantime,  Sir, what is wrong with  the  City

Council  continuing to provide these services  if,

by  this means, we can have a new City Council  in

December?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin said it looks funny that

elected members of the District Council should  be

sitting  on the Council as representatives  of  an

area  which  is  being administered  by  the  City

Council. I would like to point out that there will

be  no  simultaneous  elections  to  the  District

Councils   and   the   City  Council.   For   this

transitional  period  there  will  be  no  elected

District Council representatives. Naturally,  Sir,

the  Minister will see to it that the City Council

does  not  suffer financial loss over the carrying

out  of  directions made in his order under  these

transitional provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that in introducing these big and

bold    changes,   goodwill,   co-operation    and

understanding are required, and I suggest that the

new  City Council, whatever its composition,  will

in  the  transitional period, in the interests  of

local  government  in  Singapore,  carry  on   the

administration  of  Katong  as  directed  by   the

Minister. Then again, Sir, there is always  access

to  the  Minister to whom representations  can  be

made  during this transitional period. This indeed

is  what  is  happening even now. The Minister,  I

know,  receives  a  lot  of  representations  from

members of the public regarding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2431</b></font><br><br>



matters  concerning  local  government  and  these

representations  are brought  to  the  notice  and

attention of the local authorities concerned. Even

Legislative  Assemblymen also make representations

on behalf of their constituents to the Minister in

the   matter  of  local  government,   and   these

representations  are  similarly  brought  to   the

notice and attention of local authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I suggest that the stress being laid on this

lack  of  representation in the short transitional

period - it  might even be less than six  months  if

you  count the transitional period from  the  time

the  City  Council and the District  Councils  are

established - is disproportionate to the  importance

of  the  objective aimed at and the  use  of  the

transitional  provisions  during  this  relatively

short interim period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Minister for Communications and

Works,   in  passing,  briefly  mentioned  another

reason why these transitional provisions cannot be

deleted. They are required not only because of the

changes in areas on which we have been arguing for

so  many  days, but also because the take-over  of

certain functions by the Government from the  City

Council,  and  vice versa, cannot be ready  before

the  end  of the year. Take for instance,  as  the

Minister for Communications and Works pointed out,

licensing  by the Police of drivers and conductors

of  public service vehicles and trisha riders. The

Minister  may order the City Council to  carry  on

until the appropriate amending legislation to  the

Road  Traffic Ordinance and new rules  prescribing

the  procedure  of licensing are made.  There  are

also  other  similar  functions  for  which  these

transitional provisions are required. Sir,  I  see

there   is   nothing   inconsistent   with   these

transitional provisions which we are putting  into

the  Bill and I see nothing inconsistent  in  that

for a few months of the transitional period Katong

will  be  administered by the  City  Council.  For

those reasons, I oppose the amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2432</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> There is one small point I would like

to  raise  in connection with this, Mr  Chairman.

The  transitional period seems to be  particularly

necessary  because we ourselves in  Singapore  are

passing through a transitional period - not  merely

a  transition  between the  Rural  Board  and  the

District  Councils, or an old City Council  and  a

new  City  Council, but a transition from colonial

status to self-government and from then onwards to

union  with  our  brothers in  the  Federation  of

Malaya.  Now this is an admirable course on  which

we have embarked and on which we are getting along

very  rapidly, but it does necessarily  involve  a

great  many  changes. The machine  which  operated

under colonial Government has had to be adapted to

new  situations and changes, and that is operating

in   two  ways.  In  one  of  them  we  have   had

Malayanisation - which is still going  on - and  which

has   removed  a  number  of  competent,   trained

officers  whose  services were  valuable.  It  has

consequently reduced for the time being -
