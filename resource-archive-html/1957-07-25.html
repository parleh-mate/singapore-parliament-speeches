<div align="center"><b>(Governor's Assent to Bill passed)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have received a message from His

Excellency  the  Governor dated  23rd  July,  1957,

informing me that His Excellency has, in accordance

with  the  provisions  of Section  62  (2)  of  the

Singapore  Colony Order in Council, 1955,  assented

to the following Bill:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Architects (Amendment) Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2207</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>NEW FRANCHISE TO MALAYAN</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>AIRWAYS LIMITED</b></div>



<br><br><!--Mr Lee Kuan Yew-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b>  asked  the  Minister for Communications  and Works what is the  position  of

the  new franchise to be granted to Malayan Airways

Limited;  when can the House expect that its  terms

and  conditions  will be communicated  to  it;  and

whether  the Government will initiate a  debate  in

the Assembly in respect thereof.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The position as to a new

franchise is at present somewhat uncertain. We have

been  unable as yet to reach a conclusion regarding

the  new  franchise and have already had to  extend

the old franchise up to 31st



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2208</b></font><br><br>



July,  1957 in order to continue negotiations about

the   future  structure  and  services  of  Malayan

Airways.  It  has now become clear that  a  further

extension will be necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might explain that early this year we had

reached  a  point  at which the signing  of  a  new

agreement  and  the  holding of  a  debate  in  the

Assembly in connection therewith appeared imminent.

Since  then, however, a situation has arisen  which

has  made it necessary to review the action already

taken  and  to study new factors, and new proposals

made  thereon,  which  affect  the  new  agreement.

Negotiations are still proceeding in the  light  of

these  new  proposals. For this  reason,  and  also

because  the  matter involves five  Governments  as

well  as the airline operators, I am unable  to  go

into detail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can, however, properly say that the new factors

and the new proposals to which I have referred have

raised  issues of sufficient importance to  warrant

the  holding  of personal discussions  between  the

five  Governments and the airline  operators  at  a

high  level,  and hon. Members will doubtless  have

read  in  the local Press that these took place  in

Singapore  on  15th and 16th July. They  have  been

adjourned till about 9th or 10th August. If by that

date   the   negotiations   can   be   successfully

completed - and I most sincerely hope that they  will

be - certain  other action will remain  to  be  taken

both by the Government and by the airline operators

in   connection  with  the  structure  of  the  new

company.  It  is  generally agreed that  the  whole

operation  will  require a further three-and-a-half

or  four  months to complete. Action  is  therefore

being  taken to extend the present agreement for  a

yet further period up to 30th November, 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the House that we are pressing on

with the utmost urgency and as soon as possible the

House  will have an opportunity of debating matters

connected  with  the  new agreement  before  it  is

signed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2, as amended, ordered to stand part of

insert-   ":

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that no alteration shall be

made in the boundaries of the electoral

divisions of any local government area

unless and until the proposed alteration

has been notified in four successive

Gazettes and contemporaneously

advertised once every week for four

consecutive weeks in one English,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2210</b></font><br><br>



one  Chinese,  one Malay and  one  Tamil

newspaper circulating in the Colony with

an  invitation to all persons  affected,

by   such  alteration  and  who   object

thereto  to make their objections  known

in writing to the Minister in order that

the same may be duly considered by him:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And provided also that the provisions of this section shall apply in respect

of  the  alterations  in  the  electoral

divisions   of  the  City   from   those

existing  under the Municipal  Elections

Ordinance, 1948:



<pre>

Ord. 26       And  provided also that the provisions

of 1948.    of this  section shall  apply in respect

            of the new  electoral divisions  of  the

            District Councils.".

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, there are three parts to the amendment which I have just read out. The original

clause  as it stands states quite clearly  that  as

far  as  the  boundaries of electoral divisions  in

local  government areas are concerned the  Minister

has  complete and unfettered authority to fix  them

as he thinks fit, and subsequently to alter them as

he thinks fit. The clause as it stands at the moment

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Minister may, from time to time, by

notification published in the Gazette  specify  the

names and boundaries of the electoral divisions  of

any local government area for purposes of elections

under this Ordinance."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the first part of our amendment is exactly

parallel to the proviso to clauses 5 and 15 of  the

Local  Government Bill in respect of the limits  of

the  City  and  District  Council  boundaries.   It

requires  that  when any alterations  are  made  in

future   to   the  electoral  division  boundaries,

notification must be made in the Gazette  for  four

consecutive  weeks and in newspapers  in  the  four

main languages. In countering our arguments on this

point  last week, the Hon. the Chief Secretary  was

not  in  his  most  thoughtful frame  of  mind.  He

said - and  I hope I do not misrepresent him  in  his

absence - that  this  matter was not  raised  in  the

Select Committee as being one of importance and why

therefore  should it be raised now? The  answer  is

simple. We had formed the impression that as an All-Party  Committee  was to be  set  up  to  work  out

Legislative Assembly electoral boundaries, the same

principle would be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2211</b></font><br><br>



applied  by  the  Government in  respect  of  local

government boundaries. As we are now faced  with  a

virtual fait accompli by the strict application  of

this clause 8, it is only right and proper that  at

this  stage  we  should move an amendment  to  draw

attention  to,  and  if possible  prevent,  a  fait

accompli.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the whole point of recommitting clauses

or  whole Bills to a Committee of this Assembly  is

that  there should be second thoughts on  important

legislation.  The  Hon. the  Minister   is   still

bringing   in   fresh  amendments  to   the   Local

Government Bill, matters which have been overlooked

or left out. Is he to be criticised for introducing

amendments  at the eleventh hour? Or is  he  to  be

commended  for noticing them in time? We  have  had

second  thoughts on this particular clause,  as  we

are  entitled  to  have them,  and  we  find  these

amendments to be most vital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Secretary went on to say that

electoral division boundaries were not important to

the man-in-the-street and that so long as he got  a

vote he did not mind where he voted. I am surprised

at  my  Hon.  Friend  taking such  a  light-hearted

attitude  in this matter which strikes at the  root

of all democratic principles. Political Parties and

Independent   Members  and  individual  responsible

citizens  and  the  Press are  there  to  see  that

electoral division boundaries are delineated  on  a

completely impartial basis, and they represent  the

man-in-the-street  who may not  always  himself  be

articulate.  In  the United Kingdom an  independent

commission  was set up four or five  years  ago  to

delineate  new constituencies required by  shifting

populations  and the growth of new  towns  for  the

last  general elections in that country.  This  was

done  so that neither Conservatives nor Labour  nor

Liberal  could  say  that the boundaries  had  been

rigged. When the Hon. the Chief Secretary tried  to

make  light  of the whole problem we on  this  side

have  been  forced  to  the  conclusion  that   the

Government has a guilty conscience in this  matter.

The louder they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2212</b></font><br><br>



cry, "We never even thought of fixing the

boundaries to suit our political convenience!", the

less convincing their protestations are. That may

be unfortunate but it is inevitable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said last week, if the Government does not

accept the principle that the delineation of

electoral divisions should be subject to public

scrutiny and objections if necessary, then it lays

itself open to the charge of political manipulation

even if it is innocent, and that goes for any other

government of the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go back to the first proviso in which lies

the  principle that alterations in future  must  be

gazetted  and  advertised in  four  languages.  The

Government,  if  it  is  wise,  will  accept   this

principle  with no difficulty whatever  because  it

affects the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second and third provisos follow from the

first. If the principle is accepted then it follows

that   it  must  be  applied  in  respect  of   the

alterations  which are now being  made,  which  are

most   extensive  because  this  great  new   local

government  machinery is coming into operation  for

the  first  time. A huge new electorate of  largely

non-English-speaking  people  is  now  to  be  made

interested  in playing its part in local government

administration through its elected representatives.

The present six wards of the City Council are to be

changed to at least 32. The District Council  areas

are  to  have between them eventually at  least  48

divisions  or  wards.  Are these  great  democratic

changes   to  be  thrust  on  the  people   in   an

undemocratic way, or are the people to  be  invited

to  comment on these changes through their Chinese,

Tamil, Malay or English newspapers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must begin, as we mean to go on, following

proper principles. Government must not only be

democratic but to be seen to be democratic. Now the

Government, if it accepts the principle in the

first proviso, need have no difficulty whatever in

accepting the third proviso in respect of the

District Councils because, as the Minister has told

us, these elections cannot be held until



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2213</b></font><br><br>



March 1958 and therefore there is plenty of time to

publish the boundaries and call for objections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only doubt arising is the second proviso and

whether  gazetting  and  advertising  the  proposed

boundaries of the City Council for objections  will

have  caused the holding of elections to be delayed

beyond  December this year. There are, Sir, several

answers to this. Firstly, the Government must never

ward   off   or   ignore  criticism,  or   threaten

postponement  of  elections as  a  reason  for  not

accepting amendments. If the amendments are  sound,

but may cause delay, then delay must be accepted by

all  parties  or  a  way found  round  that  delay.

Secondly, the Hon. the Chief Secretary himself said

that minor changes could still be made. If that  is

so,  the public have a right to express their views

as to these changes. Thirdly, changes in boundaries

do  not affect the compiling of the list of voters,

which is the biggest task. The electorate itself is

the  primary compilation; fitting them  within  the

boundaries   is   secondary.   Fourthly,   if   the

Government feels that gazetting and advertising  in

the  newspapers  for four consecutive  weeks  would

severely   upset  its  programme  of   a   December

election,  we on this side would be quite  prepared

to  accept an amendment to this particular  proviso

to the effect that the boundaries be gazetted, say,

twice  and advertised four times within two  weeks,

with a further week for objections to be sent in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of a time-table would this mean?

Gazetting  on  Saturday, 3rd  August  to  the  10th

August,  and the last day for objections  say  17th

August.  This will not only give time to  the  All-Party  Committee to study the boundaries  but  give

Independents and individuals the chance to  express

their   views.  We  have  no  doubt  that  if   the

Government wants to do this it can do it and  still

hold December elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, if we want to have clean elections we must start off in a clean way, with no

suggestions  or  implications of Government  having

manipulated   the  divisions  to   suit   its   own

interests.  If  the Government refuses  to  accept

this   amendment   suspicions   will   be   aroused

inevitably, and corruption - which we all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2214</b></font><br><br>



profess to want to see removed - will not be removed.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Chairman, I have an

amendment to make to the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment to the Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The amendment is in order. Please

proceed.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I beg to

move two amendments. The first is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the first proviso, to leave

out "Provided that no" and insert "(2) And no".



<br><br>The second amendment is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the first proviso, after "him" to

leave out all words to the end and insert "provided

that  the  provisions of this subsection shall  not

apply in respect of the first ordinary elections of

Councillors to the City Council or to any  District

Council   held   under  the  provisions   of   this

Ordinance.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, the first amendment is consequential to the second amendment and I shall

therefore  take them both together and explain  the

second  amendment. Government agrees  in  principle

with  the  first proviso given in the amendment  by

the  hon.  Member  for Tanglin. There  are  similar

provisions  in  clauses  5  and  15  of  the  Local

Government  Bill. It is not agreed,  however,  that

the  present  procedure envisaged should  apply  in

respect of the first ordinary elections under  this

Ordinance.  That is why I am moving this amendment.

At  this stage if boundaries are to be altered, all

the work which has been done in the preparation  of

registers  for  electoral  divisions  showing   the

polling  districts will have been  wasted  and  the

registers will have to be scrapped. As it is,  Sir,

more  than half of the registers have been  printed

by  the Printing Office. Elections would have to be

postponed several months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last sitting of the Assembly the Hon. the

Chief  Secretary explained that the boundaries  for

City  electoral  divisions had  been  drawn  up  by

officials without any direction. In spite  of  what

the  hon. Member for Tanglin has just said, Sir,  I

repeat once again that that is so. I should like to

draw  the  attention of this House to the statement

made by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2215</b></font><br><br>



the  hon. Member for Serangoon wherein not only did

he  cast  an aspersion on the Government in  power,

but  also on our civil service. Thank God, Sir,  we

have  a  first-class civil service which  is  above

board,  a  civil service which cannot be influenced

by the machinations of any political Party, even by

the Party in power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, Sir, for the information of Members

of  this  Assembly I circulated the Report  of  the

Committee  which delineated the boundaries  of  the

City  Council. A perusal of that Report, Sir,  will

apprise  Members  of  the  basis  upon  which   the

electoral divisions were delineated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above reasons, Sir, I have to repeat once

again that any alteration in the present boundaries

as  drawn up by the official Committee will involve

delay  in the holding of elections. Sir, I  beg  to

move.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The original amendment is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 17, line 14, after "Ordinance", to insert

the three provisos as appear in the Order Paper;



<br><br>since  when an amendment to the original  amendment

has been moved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;firstly, to leave out the words "Provided that

no" at the beginning of the first proviso and there

to  insert  "(2) No", converting the first  proviso

into a subclause of the clause;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the second amendment to the amendment is after

"him" at the end of the first proviso to leave  out

all  the words to the end and insert "Provided that

the  provisions of this subsection shall not  apply

in  respect  of  the  first ordinary  elections  of

Councillors to the City Council or to any  District

Council   held   under  the  provisions   of   this

Ordinance.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Question is, "That the words 'Provided

that no' proposed to be left out, be left out."  In

the debate, hon. Members will be permitted to touch

on the second amendment to the amendment.



<br><br>10.30 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, we welcome on this side

the  fact  that  the principle that alterations  in

electoral division



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2216</b></font><br><br>



boundaries   should  be  gazetted  and   objections

invited from the people of Singapore. But once  you

have accepted that principle you must apply it from

the start. Take the second part of the amendment to

the amendment - I see no reason whatever in the first

place why this principle should not be accepted  in

respect of the District Councils. I mentioned  that

a  few moments ago. You have much more time in  the

case  of  the  District Councils. Therefore  having

accepted  the  principle  in  the  first  instance,

accept  it  without hesitation in  respect  of  the

District Councils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We then come to the problem - we admit it is a

problem - of  the  City  Council  electoral  division

boundaries  and the need to hold the  elections  as

soon  as  possible.  In  this  regard  it  must  be

remembered, as the Hon. the Minister has just said,

that  the Report of the Committee which has  worked

out  the  delineation of these boundaries has  only

been  placed  in the hands of Members this  morning

and  I  presume supplied to the Press this morning.

Why could this not have been done before? Why could

not  some  machinery, say the All-Party  Committee,

have  been  put  into operation to  consider  these

boundaries  at  least two or three  weeks  ago?  It

would  have  been quite possible to do  this.  Then

possibly there would have been no need to move this

part  of  the  amendment, as I call it  the  second

proviso.  We would have accepted the fact that  the

public and the All-Party Committee were being given

a chance to consider these new boundaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no, we are faced with this Report today, on

the  very  day  in  which we have  to  debate  this

important question. It could have been given to  us

earlier.  I  do not know why it was not.  Will  the

Hon. the   Minister  therefore  not  accept   our

suggestion that if he cannot agree to four weeks of

gazetting  and  advertising in  the  newspapers  in

respect  of changes in the City Council boundaries,

he  will  agree to reducing the length of  time  of

gazetting in order that this important principle is

accepted,  which  in fact Government  has  accepted

through accepting my first proviso?

<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart (Acting Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Chief Secretary (Mr S. T. Stewart):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, in support of my friend and

colleague,  the  Minister for Local  Government,  I

have  to  say  that  the  Statistics  and  Printing

Departments   are  well  on  with   preparing   the

electoral  rolls  for  the City  Council  elections

based  on the City Council boundaries specified  in

the  Local  Government Bill and  on  the  electoral

divisions  drawn up by the official Committee.  Any

change  in the boundaries must of course delay  the

final certification of the electoral registers, and

if  the  changes are major ones the effect will  be

more  serious.  For  example,  Sir,  if  Katong  is

restored to the City it will materially affect  the

total number of voters in the City Council area  as

it  contains  a large number of voters - I  remember,

Sir, roughly well over 25,000 voters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The electoral divisions have been based on the

assumption  that there will be a total  of  505,000

names  on the rolls altogether and the 32 divisions

have been designed to divide this number as equally

as  possible.  If the total number is increased  it

will probably be that all 32 divisions will have to

be  revised. If divisions adjoining the boundary of

the  City  Council  are altered there  will  almost

certainly be repercussions throughout. Even a minor

change  of  two  electoral  divisions - let  us   say

Cairnhill   and   its  Western   neighbour,   River

Valley - must cause some delay, and the length of the

delay  will depend on the number of alterations  to

be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the first proviso given in the amendment of

the  Member for Tanglin is made applicable  to  the

City  and District Council electoral divisions,  as

suggested in the second and third provisos  of  the

amendment,  it will initially mean a  delay  of  at

least  four  to five weeks. If you read  the  first

amendment, Sir, there will be an initial  delay  of

four  weeks and if the Minister is to consider  the

representations made it may mean another  delay  of

one week or perhaps even more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, if any major change takes place, it will

involve  a  further delay of three or four  months,

for the following reasons: (1) We have to rearrange

the cards



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2218</b></font><br><br>



into new divisions and this will require, according

to  those who have to carry out this work, about 10

weeks;  (2)  to  reproduce, collate  and  bind  the

registers  will  require  another  ten  weeks;  (3)

assuming that a large part of these two territories

overlap,  at least 15 to 17 weeks will be required.

If  Katong is put back into the City and the  rural

area  included in the Western part of the City area

is taken out again, the recasting of the boundaries

of  all  District  Council areas will  have  to  be

undertaken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hon. colleague said in this Assembly - I think

it was at the April or May sitting, Sir - that it was

intended  to  hold  District Council  elections  in

March  1958 if City Council elections are  held  in

December  1957. One of the reasons,  Sir,  is  that

there  cannot be simultaneous preparation of  every

phase  in  the drawing up of new District and  City

Council registers because the sorting machines  and

so  forth  can only be concentrated on one  set  of

registers  at  a  time.  Therefore,  Sir,  if  City

Council elections have to be postponed to April/May

1958  then District Council elections will have  to

be postponed to June/July, or even August, 1958.  I

do not know whether we want that. I do not think we

want  that,  Sir. I think the people  of  Singapore

want  to see the new City and District Councils  in

being as quickly as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot afford any delay if elections are to be

held  in December. Since the electoral rolls should

be  published by the latter half of August in order

to  hold elections in December, the tentative time-table to which Government is working, based on  the

periods allowed for in the Bill, is as follows: (1)

listing,    printing,   collating,   binding    and

publication  of draft registers to be completed  by

20th  August,  1957; (2) allowing  for  claims  and

objections to be completed from 21st August to 18th

September,   1957;  adjudication  of   claims   and

objections   to  be  completed  by  19th   October;

listing,  printing,  collating  and  insertion   of

amendments for claims and objections in  the  draft

registers  and certification of final registers  by

31st October. Thus a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2219</b></font><br><br>



writ  of elections can be issued any time from  1st

November, 1957 onwards and if it is found  possible

to  publish draft registers before 20th  August  so

much the better, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the reasons which I have given, I oppose

the  second and third provisos of the hon. Member's

amendment.  We want to try and hold to  this  time-table. We want to have these City Council elections

in  December and the District Council elections  in

March. I repeat again, Sir: the public of Singapore

want these new Councils. For those reasons, Sir,  I

support the amendment moved by my hon. colleague.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir,  the last speaker has only one point to  offer

and  that is, "We do not want to delay City Council

elections."  But  let me ask this House,  Sir,  how

long  has  Government  delayed  them?  Has  it  not

delayed them for at least one year? Did we not hear

in  this  Assembly last year that it was  going  to

postpone  the  City Council elections?  I  remember

when  the  new Government took office  it  said  it

wanted  to hold elections at a very early date  but

there have since been two postponements. I think  I

am  right;  there have two postponements  of  these

elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has the Government been doing during these

two  years? I would like very much to know. Has  it

been working on the matter? Has it been trying hard

to make early elections possible? It is always good

to  say  that people want early elections. We  want

them  early  too, but it is a very different  thing

not  to  put it into practice. There was plenty  of

time  on  the hands of Government in the  last  two

years  and  more, yet today we are confronted  with

the  reason,  "We  do not want delays."  Government

could  have  made  them  earlier  but  it  has  not

attempted to make it earlier. [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Another little point that the

Government  put  up  is, "We  have  had  everything

printed.  Delay will cost money; it  will  delay  a

great deal more." I have already said



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2220</b></font><br><br>



that these delays could have been averted if it had

started earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another one more point to consider. It

would  be better to have an election which is  said

by  all to be fair, to be democratic, than to  have

one thrust down your throat just because Government

says,  "We cannot delay." Now that is like tempting

you  by  saying, "If you want it this way you  must

have  it  my way. If you want to have elections  in

December then you must carry out elections  on  the

lines  we propose. If you do not carry out  on  the

lines  we  propose then there will be no elections,

and if there is going to be delay the blame will be

on   you."  That  is  absolutely  unfair.  That  is

absolutely undemocratic. That amounts to  coercion,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now how much will it cost the people of

Singapore  to change a little bit of this printing?

Cost   and   labour  should  not  be   taken   into

consideration. The more important consideration  is

whether  it is democratic, whether it is viewed  by

all  to  be  fair. Since the Government,  Sir,  has

accepted the first proviso, I see no reason why the

third proviso should not have been accepted. People

living  in  the City are important. They  can  have

objections. They must be notified of changes. But I

personally  feel that people living  in  the  rural

areas  are  also  as important,  and  that  if  one

measure is given to the City people then it  should

also be given to people in the Districts. This will

not  be  done  if the amendment of the Minister  is

accepted  to  strike  off  the  second  and   third

provisos,  the  reason  for  opposing  the   second

proviso  being  that  if  you  are  going  to  have

alterations now to your City Council divisions  you

will not be able to have elections in December. Let

me  quote,  Sir, from a note which I received  this

morning  about the electoral divisions in the  City

proposed by the Government Committee. I happen also

to  have  a  copy  of the Constituency  Delineation

Commission of the Federation of Malaya, and I shall

also quote one or two extracts from that.



<br><br>10.45 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Report of the Committee to delimit the

Electoral  Divisions  of  the  City  and   District

Councils, I would like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2221</b></font><br><br>



to read from Annex B, paragraph 1 (a). Under the

heading, "Densely populated Divisions with

unusually high voter strength", the reason is given

as:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ratio of voter strengths to population is

high in all these areas and is due in some cases to

the fact that many suburban and rural dwellers have

registered their addresses in these divisions..."



<br><br>It  seems then, Sir, that the system is very faulty

and  the  Committee which deliberated on  this  and

used  the existing facilities would be led to wrong

conclusions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 3 of the statement shown under the

heading, "23. Telok Ayer (TA)", sub-heading "TA.1",

the  "Population as at the Numbering  stage  April,

1957"  is given as 3,260; and the "Electors  as  at

April,  1957" is given as 4,062. Sir, when a  check

is made on the number of people living in a certain

area,  you  find that there are 3,260 people;  your

electoral roll, however, shows that there are 4,062

people  in  that  area. There must then  have  been

ghosts  in the area! Let us call them ghost voters!

They  do  not live there; they live elsewhere,  but

invariably they turn up for voting. Now this  is  a

terribly   bad   system,  Sir,  of  compiling   our

electoral  rolls. You put it to any man and  if  he

can say that it is logical to have 4,000 odd voters

when  there are only 3,000 odd people living there,

then  something must be wrong. I would like to draw

your  attention further, Sir, to the fact that  the

3,000  odd  people  are  men,  women  and  children

combined, whereas the 4,000 odd voters are all over

21.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> A point of information, Sir.

Would the hon. Member be good enough to tell us

what particular page he is quoting from?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I was quoting from the

statement  showing number of seats, population  and

number of electors within the City area.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is at page 5 of Annex "A".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Under "23...TA.l".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2222</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think hon. Members will find it

on page 5.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> It seems to me, Sir, that if

a  thing like this happens and is going to exist in

our electoral rolls, it cannot be considered to  be

democratic.  How can we say it is if I happened  to

be  living in one district and am one of the  3,260

people yet when it comes to voting I may be swamped

by  people  who  are not living in that  area?  The

person  who  is elected may not be elected  by  the

people  living there but may be elected  by  people

living in other districts. This system of compiling

the  electoral roll will tend to make people change

their  addresses just for the purpose of elections.

If I happened to be controlling a labour union. Sir-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Perhaps the hon. Member

would  like to explain how his complaint about  the

compilation of electoral rolls has any relevance to

electoral divisions?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Certainly, Sir. In fact under

clause 8 the Minister may by notification published

in  the  Gazette  make  up  all  these  rolls,  and

Government has already intimated that it  is  going

to  do  that in accordance with the recommendations

of  the Committee set up by the Government for  the

purpose  of compiling the rolls. Furthermore,  Sir,

this is the first election and Government says that

it  is not going to accept any objection; therefore

I  am speaking against Govermnent's decision of not

accepting or not hearing objections.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Clause 8 refers to electoral

divisions  and I think the hon. Member's  complaint

is  against the roll of electors. I should like  to

find out what connection there is.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I am grateful for your

pointing  out  this,  Sir,  but  I  would  say  the

divisions  will have no meaning unless  the  people

listed  are  living inside there and the  divisions

are made in such a way that there will be that many

people in that division. It has that bearing,  Sir.

Will you allow me to continue?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2223</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please continue until I get a

little more puzzled!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I hope you will not, Sir. On

this  point, Sir, if we give power to the  Minister

under this clause without it being amended then all

these  things will come about, all the ghost voters

will  come in every time. Furthermore, Sir,  if  no

objection  is to be allowed in this first election,

then  we will be going against the principle agreed

to  by  all  and also adopted by the Federation  of

Malaya, that,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"in view of the very great distances involved in

some  of the more sparsely settled portions of  the

country,  it  would not be regarded as unreasonable

if  in some instances a rural constituency were  to

contain as little as half of the inhabitants in the

more  popular urban constituencies returning single

members."



<br><br>Again on this point, Sir, you will find if you look

at  the  recommendations which  the  Government  is

going  to  gazette and push through to the  people,

the  population  of areas in more  rural  districts

like Tanglin-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy)</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is wrong to remain standing when

the hon. Member has the floor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I am referring, Sir, to the

top  of page 3 of Annex "A". The number of electors

would  be  18,695  for  Tanglin  which  is  a   big

sprawling  area,  whereas we have a  small  compact

area  like Kreta Ayer with 16,954. Here,  Sir,  you

have  one  large  population in a  big  rural  area

returning one member, and there you have a  smaller

population in a compact area. If you look  further,

Sir, you will find that some of these areas have as

low  as  11,000 electors. There again, Sir, I  find

that  the Committee has not been carrying  out  its

work  on the principles agreed. At our last sitting

we heard the Chief Secretary say that the divisions

were  drawn  up  on  the  line  of  similarity   of

interests  and  that main roads or  waterways  were

used as the division lines. But in Whampoa you find

the area goes over Upper Serangoon Road, which is a

main street; there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2224</b></font><br><br>



is again deviation from the accepted principles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Government will not accept the amendment

proposed by my colleague, Sir, I think it  will  be

trying  to push through something which is  unfair,

all  because we want to hold elections in December.

This  is  not going to help the people of Singapore

realise that democracy is at work. I certainly feel

that a little time to look into the whole matter so

that  everybody will be satisfied, will go  a  long

way to make the people of Singapore realise that we

are  now  an elected Government and not a  colonial

one  which  is going to ram everything  down  their

throat whether they like it or not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Sir, we all agree

with  the  Hon. the Chief Secretary  that  we  want

elections in December, but we do not agree with the

price  that we are paying today. We do not want  to

be  faced  with a fait accompli, with  a  statement

that  you  cannot change anything now, cannot  make

any  amendments in this Assembly, because  half  of

the lists have been printed and the delineation has

been completed. This shows that Government has  had

all  this information in its hands very, very  many

months ago and either it wilfully chose to hide  it

from  us  in  order  to  rush  things  through  the

Assembly today, or it has been thoughtless  or  has

not  spent any time in thinking of this side of the

House  or  of the people of Singapore  as  a  whole

whether we should be given a say in the drawing  up

of this new division of districts.



<br><br>11.00 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me, Sir, that instead of sitting down

and  doing  their  work,  Ministers  and  Assistant

Ministers have been flying all over the world. They

appointed  a Committee of officials and told  them,

"You  go on. We shall accept what you find, and  we

shall  push it down the throat of the Assembly  and

the people of Singapore." That is what we object to

today and I, being one of the most mild men, one of

the  mildest  men in this House, was really  roused

this  morning  to find that the Government  is  now

trying  to  hide  the mistakes and  the  blundering

throughout its years of office



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2225</b></font><br><br>



by  pushing this Bill through and giving the excuse

that anything you do now - making even the slightest

amendment - is going to put back elections for two or

three  months.  We  cannot  accept  such  acts  and

statements  without a challenge, and we shall  tell

the  people of Singapore that we shall never accept

such  a ramming down our throats as our leader  has

described.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What better evidence of this is there than the

throwing  by  the  Government into  our  face  this

morning  of  this  document,  the  Report  of   the

Committee  Appointed to Delimit Electoral Divisions

of  the City and District Councils? I would like to

know  how long Government had this document in  its

hands and why should it be given to us now when  we

have  no  time  to study, when we have  to  hold  a

debate and still read this Report? Is it fair to us

that this document should be given to us now? If it

had  been  given to us a month ago, it  would  have

saved  a  lot  of  accusations and  we  might  have

accepted  quite  a  number  of  things  which   are

proposed. As it is, Sir, I support the hon.  Member

for   Tanglin   and  I  must  vote  against   these

amendments to the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir,  the Government has thought fit to give a very

convenient  excuse  that  any  change  now  in  the

divisions  will cause a delay in the  City  Council

elections. The life of the present City Council has

been  extended on two or three occasions; what harm

will  it do to have a further delay of one  or  two

months  if it is in the interests of the people  of

Singapore? Every year the Government puts it to the

Assembly  that we must extend the life of the  City

Council  because  we are not yet prepared  to  hold

elections. Then all of a sudden, as the Member  for

Paya Lebar has said, this Report is pushed on to us

to  accept,  without giving us  a  chance  of  even

glancing at it, not to say of study. Are we  rubber

stamps  that we must accept whatever the Government

pushes on to us? If we are to be rubber stamps  why

bring  all  of  us here? There is no  purpose;  the

Government  itself can run the country. There  will

be  no  use having elected representatives in  this

House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2226</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose fault is it then that this Report has been

pushed on to us today? Whose fault is it that there

will  be  delay? Rather than say that  all  Parties

should  accept the responsibility I should say  the

Government should accept the responsibility for all

this  delay.  If this Report had been prepared  and

circulated to us much earlier, we could have had  a

chance  of studying it. But we come today  to  this

House and, as the Member for Paya Lebar said, while

we  are going through the debate it is pushed  down

our  throat. Should there be any change, the  Chief

Secretary  said, there will have to be  alterations

to all the divisions; and printing of the registers

has  already  begun. Why should they  be  put  into

print  before the Government come and tell us  what

it  has  done?  Why  should it  unnecessarily  give

orders  and instructions to have them printed?  Was

Government  certain  that  this  Report  would   be

accepted or must be accepted? It should have let us

have  this  Report  earlier  for  discussion,   for

debate, so that we would know where we stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the Report as it is tabled today I find

little  can  be made out of it. What  is  there  in

figures   only?   Where  are  the  boundaries?   In

submitting  this Report, could not  the  Government

give  the  boundaries of each division so  that  we

could go further into the matter? Only figures  and

more figures are quoted. What can figures show  us?

Nothing;  they  bring  us  nowhere.  I  think   the

Government  should  be more careful  in  submitting

such figures and not push them on us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will certainly support the amendment moved by

the Member for Tanglin and oppose the amendment  to

the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, even a

mild  man  is  no longer mild! Yet  when  I  looked

through the Report it was the same mild man who was

a  member of the Select Committee and never thought

of the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the allegations about this Report, that we

are  ramming it down the throats of the  public  of

Singapore, can only be made by people who refuse to

understand. The proper, the true situation or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2227</b></font><br><br>



position  as  it  faces us today is  this.  At  the

sitting  of the Assembly last week it was suggested

that  there had been manipulations on the  part  of

the  Government in so far as the delineation of the

City Council electoral divisions are concerned.  We

pointed  out  at that sitting that this delineation

was  carried out by an official Committee,  and  to

prove  that it was so we tendered a Report to  each

Member  of  the  Assembly so that they  could  have

something in their hands to prove at a later  stage

that  what  the  Government  proposed  to  do  were

recommended  in  the  Report.  This  Committee  was

appoined in June, only last month, because at  that

time the Select Committee was still considering the

Local  Government  Bill. Therefore  any  suggestion

that  we  are ramming this down the throat  of  any

Member  of  the  Opposition or the public  is  most

unfair.  We  put this Report in the  possession  of

hon.  Members so that they can have evidence  at  a

later  stage. When the Minister announces in  the

Gazette that the City Council area shall be divided

into such and such electoral divisions, it can then

be  seen  by all Members of the Opposition and  the

public that what the Minister proposes to do is  as

stated in this Report.

from the other side of the House!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, the hon. Member

for  Tanglin  started off in an  apologetic  manner

trying  to justify having second thoughts. Sir,  we

on  this side of the House are very sympathetic. We

understand  hon.  Members having  second  thoughts,

especially  hon. Members belonging to the  Liberal-Socialist  Party, who are well known for having  no

thoughts  at  all,  and who cannot  make  up  their

minds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if, as the hon. Member requests, reference

is  made  to an all-Party Committee, how will  that

give the people of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2228</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  a  chance  to raise  objections  to  the

electoral divisions? How will that give a chance to

the people of Singapore to express their views? The

all-Party Committee - three or four members - will  sit

down  and  demarcate the boundaries; but this  will

still not give the people of Singapore a chance  to

express  their views or to make objections  to  the

proposed boundaries, as proposed by the hon. Member

in his amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member did say that if there has to be

delay,  then  it must be accepted by  all  Parties.

Yet. Sir, reading through the Press a few days ago.

I  came  across this article with big headlines  on

the front page of the Free Press of 18th June:



<div align="center">"TOP COUNCILLORS THREATEN THEY WILL ALL RESIGN</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We can't take it,' they say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior members of the Singapore City Council are

threatening to resign their seats if the Government

does  not  fulfil its promise to hold elections  in

December.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the Councillors said this morning they

were    'fed   up'   with   Government's   repeated

postponements of elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last elections to the Council were in

December 1953.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of senior members have been Councillors

for  the past six years without a new mandate.  One

of  them,  Mr Chan Kum Chee, claims they  shoulder

the major part of the Council's work."



<br><br>And  it goes on to say that Mr Chan Kum Chee  says

that  he and his colleagues shoulder the major part

of the Council's work and that there is a threat by

Councillors to resign if Government does  not  have

these elections in December 1957. Sir, probably the

members  of the Liberal-Socialist Party  could  not

make  up their minds amongst themselves as to  what

it  should  be. Here is a leading Liberal-Socialist

member  of  the Singapore City Council  threatening

that  he and his colleagues will resign if they  do

not  have  an  election in December, and  here  are

members  of  the  same Party in this  Assembly  who

cannot  make  up their minds, who want to  postpone

elections.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> We wanted it last year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2229</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, it is a well-known fact

that the Liberal-Socialist Party cannot make up its

mind. That is known all over Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Friend the Hon. the Chief Secretary has given

a  time-table to show how closely the  periods  are

fitted in so that elections can be held in December

this   year.  The  hon.  Member  for  Tanglin   has

suggested  another time-table, but then he  is  not

responsible for making the arrangements  for  these

elections; he can suggest any time-table  he  likes

but whether it is workable or not is a factor which

my  Friend the Hon. the Chief Secretary has got  to

consider and if he says it is not workable  then  I

think  the House should accept his word because  it

is he who has to make the arrangements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the last sitting of this Assembly, when

my  Friend  the Hon. Minister for Local Government,

Lands  and Housing moved the adoption of the Report

of  the  Select  Committee on this Bill,  the  hon.

Member for Serangoon had the - would "audacity" be  a

parliamentary word, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Hon. Minister must first use

the word.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> The hon. Member had the

audacity   to  suggest  that  the  Government   was

involved in machinations, on "fixing" of boundaries

to  suit its own purpose. He even went so far as to

accuse the civil servants (incidentally one of  the

Members  of  the delimitation Committee  is  not  a

civil  servant) that they had worked to a directive

of  the Government and had been biased, and  so  on

and  so  forth. Sir, that is why today the Minister

has  handed over to hon. Members this Report of the

Committee   appointed  to  delimit  the   electoral

divisions, to prove that these accusations  against

the  Government  are  without  foundation.  And  if

anybody  reads this Report he will find in  certain

paragraphs  the basis on which this  Committee  has

made  its recommendations. I will just read  a  few

lines:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2230</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In reaching its recommendation for these

boundaries,  as shown on the attached map,  it  has

employed the following basic considerations:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The desirability of striking a proper balance

between  the  population and the voter strength  in

each division...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Feature boundaries such as roads and rivers,

instead  of arbitrary boundaries, have been adopted

in all cases...[with certain few exceptions].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Account has been taken throughout of

community interests and affinities, for example, at

Queenstown, Bukit Merah, Tiong Bahru, etc...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now these were the principles on which the

Committee  delineated the boundaries and based  its

Report  and recommendations. There is no indication

in the Report that the Committee had a directive to

fix the boundaries according to what would suit the

Labour  Front Coalition Government. The Members  of

the  Committee, Sir, who signed the Report are  the

Chief   Statistician,  Mr  E.  J.  Phillips;   the

Planning Adviser, Singapore Improvement Trust,  Mr

D.    H.    Komlosy;    the    Survey    Department

representative,  Mr  M.  George;  and  the  Deputy

Secretary, Ministry of Local Government, Lands  and

Housing, Mr P. H. Meadows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Sir, the hon. Member sitting next to

the  hon.  Member  for Tanjong Pagar  has  probably

tried a little to borrow his powers of oratory  and

was trying to simulate his example, but there is  a

saying in India, Sir, that the fox tries to imitate

the  lion  but  does not succeed. For unfortunately

the  hon.  Member for Serangoon was not  convincing

enough; he cannot talk convincingly enough like the

hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar can sometimes.



<br><br>11.15 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member for Serangoon asked how long

had  the Government delayed this Bill? The fact  is

that  it  was  referred to the Select Committee  in

September  1956. That Committee kept the  Bill  for

nine  months and made its Report in June 1957.  Now

if   the  Select  Committee  took  nine  months  to

consider  this  Bill, which is a  very  complicated

piece of legislation, how much longer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2231</b></font><br><br>



would  it  take for the Attorney-General  to  draft

this  complicated piece of legislation,  especially

as  it  is not all a matter of drafting by his  own

self but of having to consult the City Council  and

various other Departments which are involved  under

this  Bill, for it should be noticed that this Bill

does involve many Departments. The City Council  is

of  course  the primary body involved; on  planning

powers  and so on the S.I.T. is involved;  and  the

police  are  involved  on the  hawker  and  traffic

angles. All of them had to be consulted and all the

information-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Hon. Minister is probably

confusing   the  two  Bills.  One  is   the   Local

Government Bill, the Report on which was  presented

on  19th  June 1957; we are dealing with the  Local

Government Elections Bill the Report of  which  was

presented on 18th January, 1957.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I am sorry, Sir. My point was

this,  that one is related to the other and  unless

we  have  the Local Government Bill we cannot  have

this Local Government Elections Bill passed in this

House. Hon. Members will remember that in fact this

Bill  was  got ready by the Select Committee  early

but  because  the other and major Bill,  the  Local

Government  Bill,  was held up in Select  Committee

this Bill could not be got to the House. Since both

Bills   are  related,  it  is  important   that   a

complicated piece of legislation like that proposed

in  the  other  Bill,  the Local  Government  Bill,

should be given full consideration before it  comes

to us and should not be rushed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we are doing all we can to hold the

elections  in December, bearing in mind  the  sword

which  is  hanging over our heads of  the  Liberal-Socialist City Councillors, who threaten to  resign

if   we   postpone  the  elections  from  December.

Perhaps, Sir, the suggestion that elections can  be

postponed  beyond December made by the  Member  for

Tanglin may have a thought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2232</b></font><br><br>



behind it - that if these elections are postponed the

Liberal-Socialists can hold sway longer in the City

Council.  I  do  not know whether that  thought  is

behind the suggestion. I am not in the habit,  Sir,

of making accusations without justification, as the

hon.  Member for Serangoon is. I am just suggesting

that  the wish may be father to the thought - to  his

proposal to delay the elections. It is possible.  I

do not say that that is so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member for Paya Lebar, who normally

is   a  meek  and  mild  man,  who  does  not  hurl

accusations  like  the  hon. Member  for  Serangoon

does,  today  came  out in full force  against  the

Government. He said, Sir, that it would have  saved

a   lot  of  accusations  if  the  Government   had

published this Report a couple of months  back.  He

does  not  realise that Government is rushing  this

thing  through  as  fast  as  possible,  that   the

Minister is spending sleepless nights studying  the

Bill   and  that  all  the  officials  are  working

overtime to get this thing through so that  we  can

have elections quicker. He does not realise that we

have  not  held up this Report for two  months  and

that  it  was given to hon. Members to counter  the

accusations hurled by the Member for Serangoon, who

tried  to imitate the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar

but  evidently  could  not imitate  his  oratorical

powers.  The hon. Member for Serangoon at the  last

sitting   tried   to  accuse  the   Government   of

machinations  and  so  on, of "fixing"  boundaries.

That  is why this Report has been given out to show

to  the  hon. Member and the public at  large  that

these accusations are false and without foundation.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, the Minister for Commerce

and Industry made the suggestion - he said it was not

an accusation - that possibly the reason for all this

debate today is that the Liberal-Socialists want to

remain  in  office in the City Council. We  do  not

want  to  delay the City Council elections provided

principles   are  observed,  and   what   we   most

emphatically want to do is to have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2233</b></font><br><br>



genera1   elections  earlier  to  put  the  present

Government out of office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also considers that I was being apologetic in having second thoughts and that the

Liberal-Socialists cannot make up  their  minds.  I

find  his  argument amusing. The Government  itself

has had second thoughts by accepting the first part

of  our amendment and the principle that goes  with

it.   The  Liberal-Socialists  have  made  up   the

Government's   mind   for   it.   I   welcome   the

Government's second thoughts which endorse our  own

second thoughts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to get back to facts. The Hon. the Chief

Secretary  a  little  time ago confessed  that  the

printers  were  now  well on  with  making  up  the

registers. That being so, it is quite obvious  that

the  delineation  of the electoral  boundaries  was

completed some considerable time ago. Why therefore

was  this  Report not made public earlier  so  that

representations could be made? The  fact  that  the

registers  have been made up - I think  the  Minister

for  Local Government, Lands and Housing said  they

were   half-completed - means  that  the  delineation

itself was completed a long time ago, otherwise the

registers  could not have been half  printed  which

means  presumably  that 16  of  the  divisions  are

already complete and printed. Sir, I spoke on  this

same principle in the Select Committee on the Local

Government  Bill when clause 5 was  considered,  on

16th  May.  The  amendment  which  I  tabled  which

included   a  similar  proviso  to  that   we   are

discussing  now, was in the hands of the Government

a  fortnight earlier. Therefore the Government knew

perfectly well what was the argument on this matter

regarding the publication of boundaries for  public

objection. Sir, to say that the Government has  not

had time is an argument which we cannot support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to us, Sir, that the Government is

determined  to  push  these new boundaries  through

without any consideration for any objections  which

may  be  made.  It  has nevertheless  accepted  the

principle  and  then  gone on to  flout  that  very

principle.  It  accepts the  principle  for  future

elections  but  will not accept it for  the  coming

elections. In other words, it accepts the principle

but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2234</b></font><br><br>



writes  it down on a post-dated cheque, which  only

shows  its  bankruptcy  of  democratic  ideas   and

democratic principles.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, if I

understand  the hon. Member for Tanglin  right,  he

said  that  he  had given notice of this  amendment

about a fortnight ago and as this Report would have

been  in the hands of the Minister by then he could

have  gazetted the delineations. Is that  what  the

hon. Member said?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, no; what I said was that I

filed an amendment to clauses 5 and 15 of the Local

Government  Bill  at least a fortnight  before  the

clauses   were  actually  debated  in  the   Select

Committee  on 16th May. I said that that  amendment

was similar to the one we have listed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It is exactly because there

have  been  amendments to clauses 5 and 15  of  the

Local Government Bill that the first proviso of the

amendment  before  this Committee  is  accepted  by

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some doubt has been cast on the statement of

the  Hon. the  Chief Secretary, that  because  the

Statistics  Department  has  now  about  half   the

electoral  rolls  in the machines almost  completed

the   hon.  Member  is  led  to  believe  that  the

Government  must  have decided on this  delineation

months and months ago. Sir, the sorting out of  the

voters  into  their various electoral divisions  is

done by machine - all set, nice and proper, from  the

information  gathered.  That  information  is  then

conveyed to the Committee. All the facts are there.

Once  the Committee had decided to recommend  which

particular  mukim  should go  to  which  particular

electoral division, it takes one lot and  feeds  it

to the machines.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I just want to add that the

machines are not Labour Front machines!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir, there are two aspects to this problem which we

have been debating today. The first is the question

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2235</b></font><br><br>



the  procedure which the Government has thought fit

to  adopt. The second is the question of the merits

of  the charge made by the Liberal-Socialist  Party

against the Government that it has been fixing  the

boundary lines to the advantage of the Labour Front

Coalition Parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first charge, that the procedure has not

been,  to  say the least, proper, no one  can  deny

that  the  position of the Minister responsible  is

indefensible.  He had ample opportunity  to  inform

all  the other political Parties of what was  going

on. He could not only have cleared his Ministry and

the  Committee, but everyone else of any allegation

of  bias. For some reason or other he has not  done

that   and   therefore   he   has   to   bear   the

responsibility for this unnecessarily  long  debate

on this very short point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the merits of the boundary lines I would

like to ask the Liberal-Socialist Party to remember

this: for the first time 500,000 people or more are

going  to vote, many of them for the first time  in

their lives, and no Party, however clairvoyant, can

predict which way the voters are going to vote. The

Progressive  Party was responsible for  the  Rendel

Constitution  and  they  worked  out  the  boundary

lines.  They lost because over 200,000 voters  went

to the polls for the first time and threw them out.

So  even  assuming that the Labour Front  has  been

rigging   these  boundary  lines,   there   is   no

guarantee -  in  fact I am more  than  certain  that

there is no guarantee - that over 500,000 voters  who

are going to vote for the first time in their lives

may  not  vote in a manner expected either  by  the

Labour  Front, or the Coalition Parties  or  indeed

the Liberal-Socialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Or the P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Be that as it may. Therefore, I

say  the  problem  before us is  this.  If  we  are

sticklers   for  procedure  and  are  prepared   to

postpone elections for one or two months to go



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2236</b></font><br><br>



through this procedure, then by all means let us go

through  with it. All it means is that the Minister

can hear objections after proper notifications have

been made, then he rejects the objections and we go

through with it. We just go through the drill.  But

if  we  do not want delay and we are satisfied,  as

indeed  my  Party is, that there cannot be,  it  is

impossible,  to  rig  things because  nobody  knows

which  way the voting is going to go, then we  just

leave it be and go on with it in December.

             date to be fixed by the Governor.".

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is necessary, Sir, to rectify an omission to

provide  for  casual elections. Under  the  present

Municipal  Elections Ordinance  a  casual  election

shall  be held within one month of a casual vacancy

occurring.   One   month,  we   believe,   is   too

restrictive  and does not allow of sufficient  time

for  the issue of a writ to nomination day and from

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Chairman, before I

move the amendment standing in my name I would like

to seek your guidance regarding the Standing Orders

of the Assembly on the recommittal of a Bill. I

refer to Standing Order 54 (1), which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If any Member desires to delete or amend any

provision  contained in a Bill as reported  from  a

Committee of the whole Assembly or to introduce any

new  provision therein he may at any time before  a

Member rises to move the third reading of the Bill,

move that the Bill be recommitted...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point I have in mind here is that this

particular  amendment - the first amendment  standing

in   my  name -  is  really  consequential  to   the

introduction of new clauses in respect of  District

Council  finances and other allied matters,  and  I

think  it would be for the convenience of the House

if we could take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2239</b></font><br><br>



those  three  new  clauses more  or  less  together

rather  than  take  a debate on what  is  really  a

consequential  amendment. In other  words,  if  the

Government  will accept the new clauses which  will

be  debated after the other amendments,  then  this

proviso  to  the  definition of  appropriate  local

authority  funds  could be deleted by  recommitting

clause 3 at that stage.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can the hon. Member indicate which

new clauses he refers to?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Yes, Sir. The clause actually affected

is  the  clause  concerned  with  District  Council

finances  and  funds;  if it  is  approved  by  the

Government then this proviso under clause 3 will of

course  not be necessary. It does seem to  me  that

the  questions  of the District Council  employees,

posts  and funds could more conveniently  be  taken

together  if I do not move this amendment  at  this

stage; this proviso could be cleared up later after

this debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the hon. Member then suggest

that  the  new  clauses  "Appointment  of  District

Council Employees" and "List of Posts" appearing on

page 104 of the Order Paper are related to the  new

clause   "District  Council  Fund",  and   may   be

conveniently  debated together? Is  that  what  the

hon. Member says?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, what I mean is that they

are  to  some extent interrelated. Those three  new

clauses  are  all on District Council  matters  and

what we consider to be omissions by Government.  If

we are to take this very minor proviso to clause  3

now,  it  does mean in effect that we will have  to

debate  the  question whether or not  to  have  the

clause on the District Council funds.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The procedure is quite clear. The

hon. Member may proceed with his amendment, that is

the deletion of the proviso appearing at the top of

page  70  of  the  Report,  and  in  debating  that

amendment hon. Members will be at liberty to debate

the  merits or demerits of the introduction of the

new clause entitled "District Council Fund", notice

of  which  has been given in page 104 of the  Order

Paper. As to the other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2240</b></font><br><br>



two  new  clauses  I would prefer  not  to  make  a

decision until the debate proceeds.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I fear that I have not

made  myself quite clear. What I wanted to  enquire

from  the  Chair and to seek your guidance  on  was

whether  if  I  do  not  move this  amendment,  the

deletion of this proviso, on page 70 at all at this

stage,  and we debate the three new clauses in  due

course  at  the end of the amendments on  the  main

clause 3, and come to District Council funds  last,

if  the  Government  approves  of  this  particular

clause, then the proviso in question before us  now

will have to be deleted; and my suggestion, Sir, is

that  under Standing Order 54 (1) we could recommit

the  Bill  on  clause 3 in order at that  stage  to

delete  the  proviso. I hope  I  have  made  myself

clear.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I take it then that the hon. Member

is not at the moment ready to go on with the debate

on the new clause. If that is so then of course the

procedure  suggested by the hon.  Member  is  quite

correct. He need not move the amendment standing in

his  name  at  this stage. He may apply  under  the

relevant Standing Order and, as pointed out, if his

new  clause is accepted, he may ask for  a  further

recommittal of the Bill before the Third Reading.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Thank you very much, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I take it that the hon. Member is

not moving amendment (a) to clause 3, which is-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 70, to leave out lines 1 to 3.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> I am not, Sir. Amendment (b), I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 71, after line 23, to insert:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"member of a local authority" means a City

Councillor  or  a  District  Councillor,  or  the

Chairman  of  a  District Council or  the  Deputy

Chairman  of a District Council, as the case  may

be;'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point in moving this amendment - indeed I

moved it in Select Committee - was to clear up what I

felt  was  an inconsistency in this Bill. Sir,  you

will find that in the first few clauses of the Bill

continual   references  to  City  Councillors   and

District Councillors. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2241</b></font><br><br>



might  mention  clauses 8 and  9,  where  the  word

"Councillor"  figures right through those  clauses.

Now  it  is  only  when we get to clause  20  after

passing  through the section dealing with  District

Councils where we find the term District Council is

used,  that  we read in sub-clause (1), "No  person

elected  or  nominated to be a member  of  a  local

authority shall act in such office..."; so that  here

instead of using the term "Councillor" we change to

the term "member of a local authority".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we go further to clause 25 (3), we will find

the  two terms mixed up. In line 6 at the beginning

of sub-clause (3):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The date on which the seat of a member of a

local authority shall, unless in this Ordinance  it

is  otherwise  provided, be deemed  to  be  vacated

shall be-...".



<br><br>And then we come to line 17 of sub-clause (3) (C):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"in the case of a councillor ceasing to possess a

qualification or becoming disqualified,...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I think there is no doubt that here a "member

of a local authority" and a "councillor" is one and

the  same  thing and yet we are using two different

terms for one and the same person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made this point in Select Committee and you

will  read in column 9 of the Official Report  (No.

1)  that the Hon. the Attorney-General said at that

time:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...we do recognise there are inconsistencies

and  I  did say we are grateful to the hon.  Member

for drawing the attention of the Committee to them.

If  we can leave the matter there, I will give that

undertaking and the final result will, I think,  be

that  the  inconsistencies which are bothering  the

hon. Member will be removed."



<br><br>In  those  circumstances I begged leave to withdraw

the  amendment. But nothing in fact has  been  done

and   we  still  have  this  anomaly  of  the  term

"councillor" in one part of the Bill and "member of

a  local authority" in another, an anomaly in  fact

even  in  one  single clause which I  have  already

quoted.   Therefore  it  seems  to  me  that   this

amendment  is necessary, that "member  of  a  local

authority"  means a City Councillor or  a  District

Councillor   because   that   will   avoid   making

amendments  right through the Bill because  of  the

interchange of these two terms.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2242</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart (Acting Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Chief Secretary (Mr S. T. Stewart):</b> Mr Chairman, the hon. Member for Tanglin mentioned

about the Hon. the Attorney-General undertaking  to

see  that  any inconsistencies would be  rectified,

and  he quoted column 9 of the Official Report (No.

1) dated 16th May, 1957. I would also like to quote

from column 9 the words which you said, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I explain further? Perhaps if after the Hon.

the Attorney-General has considered the whole point

he  considers that a definition of this  nature  is

not  necessary, it is still open to the Member  for

Tanglin  to  move  his  amendment  at  the   Report

stage...".



<br><br>Sir,   after  consideration  we  feel   that   this

amendment  is not necessary. There is  no  need  to

amend as suggested by the Member for Tanglin. There

are certain general clauses which are applicable to

all  local  authorities, Sir, and in  such  general

clauses  the  description which is mostly  used  is

"member  of  a local authority", as in clauses  21,

22, 23 (1), (2), (3), and (5), 24, 25 (1), (3), 27,

28  and 45, and there is no need to define a member

of  a local authority, Sir, because local authority

is  already  defined as being a City Council  or  a

District Council as the case may be. So a member of

a  local authority means a member of a City Council

or  a District Council as the case may be, which is

the  same  as saying a member of a local  authority

means a City Councillor or a District Councillor as

the case may be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, certain specific clauses

which  refer  either to the City Council  or  to  a

District   Council,   in   which   Councillor    is

specifically  used  as referring  to  such  persons

specifically. And in the definition of  the  Member

for  Tanglin,  he includes Chairman of  a  District

Council  and the Deputy Chairman. I would  like  to

point  out,  Sir, clause 17, where the Chairman  is

already deemed to be a Councillor. There is no need

to  mention him again in the definition of  "member

of  a local authority", and again, Sir, with regard

to  the  Deputy  Chairman, I think the  Member  for

Tanglin  has perhaps overlooked the fact  that  the

Deputy Chairman is not a Councillor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those reasons, Sir, we feel that the amendment is not necessary.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2243</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, perhaps the Hon. the Chief

Secretary will explain the reason why in clause  25

(3),  line  6, there is mention of "a member  of  a

local authority" and in the same clause, sub-clause

(3)  (c)  a  little way down the page, there  is  a

change  to the term "councillor". Perhaps there  is

some specific meaning which has escaped this House?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member is referring to

clause 25 (3) at page 86.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. P. Shanks):</b> Mr

Chairman, in that one case I would agree  with  the

hon. Member that the word "member" would be better.

That  is, so far as I can find, the only case where

a change appears to be desirable.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, then I would like to know

whether the Government will accept my amendment  or

whether it will continue the inconsistency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.



<br><br>12.00 noon.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 72, line 24, after "messuages" to insert

", houses".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a minor amendment which is intended to

help  clean up the Bill as I had hoped the previous

amendment  would do, and I see no inconsistency  in

moving  this amendment just to make things a little

clearer   than  they  are  at  present.  "Premises"

includes  houses,  buildings, lands,  tenements - the

word  "houses"  by being inserted there  underlines

what is a common term in various parts of the Bill,

in  particular with reference to annual value,  and

therefore  it seems convenient to have  these  four

terms  together under the definition of "premises".

If you would turn, Sir, to page 69, line 33, on the

same  clause, you will find that the words  "house,

building, land or tenement" used - "the annual  value

of such house, building,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2244</b></font><br><br>



land or tenement". If you turn to clause 111 on

page 121 regarding valuation, you will read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A local authority shall cause to be prepared a

list, which shall be known as 'the Valuation List',

of all houses, buildings, lands and tenements...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I agree, Sir, that you can say that in the

definition  of  "building"  on  page  70  there  is

included the term "house", but "building" there  is

used  more in the sense of a structure than in that

of  a dwelling house, and you have a definition  of

"house" on page 71 which includes a dwelling-house,

warehouse,  office, counting-house,  shop,  school,

and   any  other  building  in  which  persons  are

employed,  that  is  to say a place  of  habitation

rather  than a structure. I therefore think  it  is

convenient - I agree it is not absolutely  essential

but   it  is  convenient - to  have  under  the  term

"premises"  the  word "houses"  included.  I  would

point  out  that in the Select Committee  stage  an

amendment was accepted by which the term "tenement"

was  included  and  that is  in  exactly  the  same

position.  You  will find tenements included  under

the   term  "dwelling-house"  and  you  will   find

dwelling-house included under the term "house", and

you   will  find  house  included  under  the  term

"building".  But my point is this: for cleaning  up

the  Bill  and making it as clear as possible  from

the point of view of annual values and ratings,  it

is convenient to have the word "houses" included in

the definition of "premises".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Sir, we

accept this amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3, as amended, ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5-



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 74, line 18, after "him", to insert

", provided that the provisions of this section  shall

also  apply  in respect of the alterations  in  the

limits  of the City described in the First Schedule

to  this  Ordinance from those existing  under  the

Municipal Ordinance".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2245</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment to the clause is to some extent

parallel  to that which we debated under the  Local

Government Elections Bill earlier this morning, but

much larger issues are involved in this clause than

in  respect  of the other Bill. The principle  that

notification should be gazetted not only for future

minor alterations but the present major alterations

is  an  important matter when you are  making  such

vast  changes  in the limits of the  City  and  the

Districts as are proposed in the First Schedule  to

this Bill. You do not have to go into the merits or

demerits of particular cases but you have  a  large

part  of Katong, Siglap and Geylang Serai-Ulu Bedok

going out into the district areas. A large part  of

this area is thoroughly urbanised. You have on  the

other  hand a largely rural area - Pasir Panjang  and

Ulu Pandan - being brought into the City Council area

from  the  rural  areas. You have a  third  anomaly

which cuts across the other two, of a change in the

Braddell  Road area, where an entirely  rural  area

which  has been in the City Council area  for  many

years is being divided into two, one part going out

into  the Districts and the other remaining in  the

City.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you have three different types of anomalies

striking  against the normal principle of extension

of  City  Council  boundaries. When  a  rural  area

becomes  urbanised it is normal to bring it  within

the   area   of  the  City  Council;  whereas   the

Government, for some reason best known  to  itself,

wants to go in the opposite direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now whether or not these changes are acceptable

is  a matter in which the people should have a say,

and  in which they have not had sufficient say.  It

is  true, of course, that the Schedules were to  be

found  at  the  back of this very complicated  Bill

when  it was first gazetted some time ago,  but  it

was   only  of  course  available  in  the  English

language (and I shall shortly point out that it  is

somewhat stretching the English language trying  to

follow a surveyor's idea of where a boundary lies).

But there was no notification whatever in the other

three main languages - Chinese, Malay and Tamil -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2246</b></font><br><br>



although for the first time those are to be  spoken

languages  in  the  City Council and  the  District

Councils



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier on the other Bill, I raised

this  point on 16th May and the Government has  had

plenty  of time. It has had two months in which  to

make the necessary gazetting or to inform people as

to  what these new boundaries are in four languages

and  with  the assistance of a map. And I  may  say

that the description of the boundaries is extremely

complicated  to follow and there has  been  no  map

published with the Bill, only with the White Paper;

so that the public has not had sufficient access to

the facts regarding the Government's intentions. As

I  say,  I raised the point in the Select Committee

meeting on 16th May and I would also refer  you  to

the present Municipal Ordinance, section 362, where

the same or similar provision is made:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No alteration shall be made in the limits of the

Municipality under section 5 or in the water limits

under  section  59  or  in any  area  mentioned  in

section   399,   unless  and  until  the   proposed

alteration  has  been notified in  four  successive

Gazettes  and  contemporaneously  advertised   once

every  week  for  four  consecutive  weeks  in  one

English and one vernacular paper, if any...".



<br><br>This  more  or less follows the main part  of  this

clause  5. My point is this: I question whether  in

fact  notification should not have been given under

section  362  of  the present Municipal  Ordinance.

Legally  perhaps the lawyers will argue  that  that

would not have been possible but even if the letter

of the law could not have been observed, the spirit

of  the law is there, and because the future  Local

Government  Ordinance  is to  succeed  the  present

Municipal  Ordinance  it would  be  only  right  in

principle that the Government should have published

and  notified  by Gazette and in the newspapers  of

four  languages  what it intended to  do,  for  the

convenience of the people so that they  could  make

their objections if they desired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to refer you to the First

Schedule at the back of the Bill, page 246, and  to

suggest  to you that as this is all that  has  been

placed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2247</b></font><br><br>



before  the  public,  it  is  inadequate  and   the

Government  has not carried it out,  as  it  should

have carried it out, adequately. The first Schedule

starts:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All that part of the Island of Singapore bounded

approximately as follows: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commencing at a point where the production

southwards  of the western boundary of  Clementi

Road  across West Coast Road meets the  southern

coast  of  the Island of Singapore approximately

50  yards  south-west of the junction  of  Pasir

Panjang,  West  Coast  and Clementi  Roads,  the

boundary  runs  generally northwards  along  the

aforesaid production of the western boundary  of

Clementi  Road  and its continuation  along  the

western  boundary of Clementi Road  to  a  point

approximately  220  yards  north  of  7�  mile

stone,  Clementi Road where it meets the  south-eastern   boundary  of  Clementi  Road   Housing

Estate;  thence along the aforesaid southeastern

boundary  of Clementi Road Housing Estate  on  a

bearing of approximately 247� for a distance  of

1,310 feet to the eastern boundary of West Coast

Road; thence along the eastern boundary of  West

Coast  Road by successive lines of bearings  and

distances approximately as under: -

<pre>

              Bearing          Distance

           340� 38' 00"        177 feet

           342� 18' 00"        487 feet

</pre>

and  so  on. Now, I suggest to you, Sir, that  that

may  be  the route the surveyor takes,  but  it  is

easier for people to understand if you say that the

boundary  follows Clementi Road until its  junction

with  Ulu  Pandan  Road and then  proceeds  up  Ulu

Pandan  Road  until its junction with Holland  Road

and  then proceeds down Holland Road until  it  has

reached  its junction with Bukit Timah Road,  which

is  roughly  but not exactly what this boundary  in

point of fact is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But within what I dare say is a terminological

exactitude  we find that the boundary does  not  in

fact  go  down  Clementi  Road  which  any  logical

boundary you think would do, but it makes a  sudden

jump  round a housing estate built by the Singapore

Improvement  Trust  and where  I  think  the  Malay

Regiment is housed. Now why it should suddenly make

a  jump and take in a little housing estate  as  it

proceeds  down the road is best known to  the  Hon.

the   Minister  for  Local  Government,  Lands  and

Housing.  But the point I am making is  this,  that

the Government has not,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2248</b></font><br><br>



whatever  the  Government  may  like  to   say   by

publishing this rigmarole at the back of  the  Bill

several  months ago, made it clear  to  the  public

what  its intentions are. And as I say, with  these

vast  changes  in  the City Council  limits,  which

affect  Katong, Ulu Pandan, Pasir Panjang, Braddell

Road,  and Siglap and so on, it should notify under

clause  5 in respect of these first changes  as  it

proposes should be done in the future.



<br><br>12.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said before on the other Bill, we should

start  as we mean to go on. That would be a  proper

democratic  way  of  doing  things.  And   if   the

Government  again claims that we do  not  have  the

time,  then  I have only to point out that  it  had

just  as  much time, and even more time, to publish

and gazette these changes than it has for the other

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 74, line 18, after "him", to insert ",

provided that the provisions of this section shall

also apply in respect of the alterations in the

limits of the City described in the First Schedule

to this Ordinance from those existing under the

Municipal Ordinance".- [Mr John Ede].



<br><br>2.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart (Acting Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Chief Secretary (Mr S. T. Stewart):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the merits and demerits of the

boundaries   of  the  First  Schedule   have   been

discussed  at  length in Select Committee  and  was

touched upon by the Minister in his speech in  this

Assembly  last  week. I think we  can  discuss  the

question of boundaries more in detail when we  come

to  the  First Schedule, Sir. The argument here  is

that the boundaries in the First Schedule should be

subjected  to the procedure laid down in clause  5.

It  has  already been pointed out,  Sir,  that  the

McNeice  Report  and  the  Government  White  Paper

showing boundaries were published some time ago and

that  an  opportunity to submit representations  to

the  Select Committee was given. What I  said  this

morning. Sir, about the effect on the City  Council

and   District  Councils  elections   on   changing

boundaries  now also holds good in discussing  this

clause.  If  this amendment is accepted,  then  the

City  Council elections cannot be held in December.

There   is   already  considerable  dissatisfaction

because  of  the delay in holding the City  Council

elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we have a new Bill repealing the existing

Municipal   Ordinance   and   reorganizing    local

government in Singapore. New local authorities  are

being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2250</b></font><br><br>



created  with jurisdiction over new areas and  this

Bill  incorporating  the new areas  is  before  the

representatives of the people in this Assembly  for

approval. I would like to quote, Sir, the words  of

the then Attorney-General (Mr C. H. Butterfield)

at column 20, Report No. 1:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As the hon. Member can see from the provisos to

both  clauses 5 and 15, the Government accepts  the

principle  that changes in the limits of  the  City

and of the districts should be advertised, and that

the procedure described in these clauses should  be

followed.  But this particular change in boundaries

made  by  this Bill is, in our view, on a different

footing  altogether - the  changes  in  the  existing

boundaries are incorporated in a Bill presented  to

the Legislative Assembly and will be dealt with  by

the  Assembly. For that reason, and  also  for  the

reason that we must take some definite step towards

holding  City  Council elections in the  reasonably

near  future, we cannot accept the amendment  which

the hon. Member has moved to clause 5."



<br><br>Then,  Sir, I would like to quote the words of  the

Member  for Tanglin (Mr Ede) at column 17,  Report

No. 1:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Sir, but there is one rather important

point  which perhaps I can make, and that is  this:

that  I  would wish, of course, to move  a  similar

amendment  under  clause  15  on  district  council

limits,  which is similar to clause 5,  bearing  in

mind  that  the  Government has now  introduced  an

amendment  to  its own First Schedule  before  this

Select  Committee, an amendment which has not  been

given  any airing whatever for the benefit  of  the

public.  The  Government may say,  "Well,  we  have

published  this  Bill  which  includes  the   First

Schedule and let out what these new areas will  be.

The public have had a chance to air their views and

to  appear before this Select Committee to say what

they  feel.'  But  that will not  be  the  case  in

respect of the amendments which are proposed by the

Government  on page 30 onwards of the Revised  List

of Amendments circulated on 15th April, 1957. These

amendments  propose  changes  to  be  made  in  the

district areas which are unknown to anyone  outside

this Committee so far as I am aware."



<br><br>Sir,  the Member for Tanglin said that there is  an

amendment to the First Schedule in Select Committee

which  was  not  given an airing whatever  for  the

benefit of the public. In fact, Sir, there are  two

amendments but what are these amendments? They  are

mere rectification of errors in the description  of

the  boundaries and nothing more. No  boundary  has

been  altered. They are just errors in  description

and we are rectifying the errors.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2251</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned the amendments to the Second

Schedule made by Government in Select Committee for

similar  reasons.  Except for two  amendments,  the

other  amendments  are  also  corrections  in   the

description   with   no  actual   change   in   the

boundaries. Of the two amendments, one is  actually

a  minor  one  which I am sure nobody will  quarrel

about  and the reasons are given in column  353  of

Report No. 13:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reasons for the first amendment as suggested

by  the Chief Statistician is that, as will be seen

from   the  Plan  B,  the  present  proposed  local

government  boundary  cuts  along  the   land   now

occupied by the Royal Malayan Navy. It follows  the

electoral  division boundary between Sembawang  and

Bukit Panjang..."-



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the hon. Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I just wanted to know

whether we were taking clause 15 or clause  5.  The

amendments  to which the hon. Member was referring,

I  think,  come  within the Second  Schedule  under

clause 15.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, I was only making these remarks

in  connection with the remarks of the hon.  Member

at  column 17 of Report No. 1, but I will refer  to

them later in clause 15.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the hon. Member in referring to the

First Schedule said that the manner in which it was

described   was  very  difficult  for   people   to

understand.  Sir, there is nothing wrong  with  the

manner  in which the First Schedule had been  drawn

up.   In  fact,  it  is  a  recognised  method   of

description   and   it  is  only   describing   the

boundaries; these boundaries are shown in the  maps

attached  to  Report No. 13. Even the Schedules  in

the   Local   Government  Bill,  when   they   were

introduced in this Assembly, Sir, merely  described

the boundaries which appeared in the McNeice Report

and the White Paper on Local Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2252</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the facts, I submit that there is

no  need  to  advertise  these  boundaries  in  the

newspapers  as would be required if this  amendment

is  accepted  and for those reasons, Sir,  which  I

have given, I oppose the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, as in the case of clause 8

of  the Local Government Elections Ordinance, so in

this clause, a principle is involved. The principle

is that, when changes are made in the limits of the

city  area or the district area, the Minister shall

gazette   and  advertise  in  newspapers  so   that

objections  may  be lodged. As I pointed  out  this

morning,  that is a principle which has a precedent

in  the present Municipal Ordinance in section  362

and although it may be a legal fact that you cannot

apply  that in this particular case, as I said,  it

is  the spirit of the law and not the letter of the

law that counts. The Government at the time had the

precedent  to gazette and advertise in  the  manner

which  has  been  done  for many  years  under  the

present Municipa1 Ordinance but apparently they had

not  the  intention. Indeed I would say  that  they

have   been   extremely  casual  with  the   future

electorate in the City Council area in this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would refer you, Sir, to the original clause 5

on page 8 of the Bill which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No alteration shall be made in the limits of the

City  under  subsection (1) of section  4  of  this

Ordinance  unless and until the proposed alteration

has  been notified in four successive Gazettes  and

contemporaneously advertised once  every  week  for

four  consecutive  weeks in  one  English  and  one

vernacular newspaper circulating in the City..."



<br><br>It was only when I moved an amendment in the Select

Committee,  pointing out that with the introduction

of four languages for prospective candidates to the

City   Council   advertising  in   one   vernacular

newspaper  was insufficient, that an amendment  was

accepted  by the Government that it should  be  one

Chinese,  one Malay and one Indian and  not  merely

one  vernacular newspaper, presumably  selected  at

random.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2253</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we can see that sufficient thought has not

been   given  to  this  matter  by  the  Government

although   they  have  had  sufficient   time   and

certainly  sufficient  warning  to  carry  out  the

purpose  and the spirit of the amendment  which  we

propose today.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Chairman, on the point of the

purpose  and the spirit, I may mention  that  these

amendments were made in Select Committee  and  they

are still in Select Committee. I think - I am new to

this  Assembly - if I am correct, we cannot  disclose

anything which is still in Select Committee to  the

public.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, that was not my point. My

point  was  that  the Government  had  before  them

section  362 of the Municipal Ordinance which  they

could have followed in the spirit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Chairman, I hate to suggest that

some of the Members of the Opposition are embarking

on  a  filibuster  in connection  with  this  Bill.

Really I feel we cannot go on-I suppose we can  but

it  is undesirable that we should-discussing a  lot

of points that have already been made this morning.

The  point  is  really  very  simple:  whether  the

boundaries  proposed  are  all  right.  No  serious

argument  has been produced to show that  they  are

not all right. There has been no questioning of the

boundaries as such. As someone said, "On principle,

let  us have as much delay as possible." The Member

for  Serangoon  (Mr Lim Choon  Mong)  appeared  to

welcome the chance of having some delay and he  was

vigorously  supported by the Member for  Queenstown

(Mr  Lee Choon Eng). The delay was no harm at  all

in his opinion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is obvious that if you are going to

reopen  the  question of boundaries for  objections

either there will be objections in which case there

will  be delay, or else there will be no objections

in which case the exercise is meaningless. There is

no   reason   to  suppose  that  there   would   be

objections, since substantially everyone has  known

for a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2254</b></font><br><br>



very  long  time  what the proposed  changes  were:

whether  they follow Clementi Road on a  surveyor's

description  is  a  very minor point.  The  general

scheme  of what was going to happen has been  known

for  a very long time indeed and I really feel that

we ought to get on with our business, Mr Chairman,

and  not  involve ourselves either in delay  during

this  debate  or in delay further on  by  accepting

this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, it seems to me that the

Hon. the  Minister  for Communications  and  Works

wants  to gag the Opposition. He stated that  there

has been no objection to the boundaries and that we

thought  that  the boundaries are all  right.  Sir,

that is a complete misconception. They are not  all

right. I made the point this morning that it  would

be  preferable not to go into the pros and cons and

the  merits and demerits of Katong going  into  the

District  Council or staying in the city  area  and

that  was  echoed by my friend the Hon. the  Chief

Secretary  only a few minutes ago. We do object  to

the  boundaries as they stand at the moment, and  I

am  quite prepared to launch into the case for  the

boundaries  being  left as they are  at  this  very

moment  if my hon. Friend wishes, but our intention

was that we should discuss this particular point on

the amendments to the First and Second Schedules.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, there is

just one principle involved: must we or must we not

let  the electorate know whether they are going  to

be  in  the city area or outside the city  area?  I

think  on  this  point there can  be  no  argument.

Clause 5 of this Bill states clearly that it is the

Government's  view that they must  be  notified  by

four   successive  Gazettes  and  contemporaneously

advertised  once  every week for  four  consecutive

weeks  in English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil in  the

newspapers. This principle has been agreed by  all.

The  Government has put it forward. We  agree  with

that  principle  but the point  is  this:  if  this

principle is introduced, is it going to be observed

only when it suits the Government or if a principle

is involved



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2255</b></font><br><br>



and  agreed upon, then it must be agreed  upon  and

put into practice every time? I think to exclude it

for  the  first  time, Sir, does  not  convey  that

spirit.  In  accordance with  the  amendment  here,

there is nothing wrong about it. The principle just

calls  upon  the  Government  to  carry  out   that

principle which it is preaching not only for coming

changes  but also for present changes. I think  the

people have a right to know and have a right to put

their views before the Government. The principle is

there: everybody accepts it. Why it is not put into

practice is in the words of the Government, "Do not

cause  delay." But whose fault is it when it  comes

to  a  matter  of delay? Is it because  the  people

delayed in conveying their views to the Government?

Has  the Government given them the chance to  voice

their opposition to this? The Government has not up

to this point. The Government has not put them into

Gazettes or published them. There are two different

phases in accordance with this view: one is to  put

this  Bill  to this House and make it law  and  the

other is the Delineation Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we have come to this stage, Sir. The

Government  today is trying to tell  us,  "Now,  we

have  passed  this  Bill.  You  shall  accept   our

recommendation."  Could not  these  recommendations

have  been put forward by the Delineation Committee

at  an earlier date? Could not this committee  have

been  appointed  at an earlier date  and  then  the

proposed  boundaries made known to  the  people  so

that  they could be gazetted before it is too late?

We  are  not  in  any way agreed on postponing  the

elections.  The  postponement of the  elections  is

mainly  due  to the inefficiency of the  Government

and  if  the Government had thought about it during

the  time  when  it  expressed  vociferously  about

holding City Council elections in 1955 and in 1956,

it  should  have  had  a thought  about  these  new

boundaries, appointed a committee earlier  and  let

the people know earlier through the newspapers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2256</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, I am really fed

up listening to the inefficiency of the Government

-



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> So are we.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> - and the people not being informed of

the changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I invite the attention of hon. Members

to the Report of the Committee on Local Government?

Full  opportunity was given to all members  of  the

public  to  put  their views to this  Committee  in

regard to matters affecting local government and  I

can see from this Report at Appendix C that quite a

number  of  people  had submitted  representations.

Moreover  this  Committee  had  representives  from

various political Parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again. Sir, when this Bill was referred to a

Select  Committee,  as you are aware,  we  made  it

specifically  clear  that any  individual  or  body

could make representation to the Government. We can

see  these facts on paper and they cannot be denied

by  any  hon.  Member. If any hon. Member  were  to

suggest that these are all matters hidden from  the

people, I can only say that that is "double talk".



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member must

know that "double talk" is unparliamentary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I was trying to explain how-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the hon. Member please

withdraw that expression?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> As you please, Sir. I was only trying

to  emphasise that these matters were really in the

hands  of  the people for quite a long time  and  I

think,  Sir,  to say that the people did  not  know

anything  about  these  matters  is  insulting  the

intelligence of the people of Singapore. They  were

very  well aware and if they had any idea of making

representations  to the Committee they  would  have

done  so.  In  the  absence of any representations,

Sir,  we  believe  that the people  are  completely

behind  the Government in their views. Furthermore,

according to the amendment suggested by the hon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2257</b></font><br><br>



Member,  at least for the first ordinary  elections

to  the City and District Councils, if the Minister

were  to  ask  representations from individuals  in

writing,  probably a discussion of this kind  would

not be taking place. In other words, the Members of

this Assembly would not have had an opportunity  of

debating  the  merits and demerits of  the  aspects

involved  in the local government affairs.  I  feel

that  we  have given the opportunity for  all  hon.

Members to discuss the merits and demerits  of  not

only  the various boundaries of electoral divisions

but also the Schedules as suggested in this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote, Sir, a statement made by

the  then  Attorney-General (Mr C. H. Butterfield)

from the Official Report of the Select Committee on

Local Government Bill No. 1 at column 20:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government maintains its stand for the very

good  reason  that these changes are being  brought

before  the  representatives of the people  in  the

Legislative  Assembly - a  far  better  method   than

advertising  in  the newspapers  (which  would,  of

course,  be  followed  where changes  in  the  City

limits are made at a later stage)."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Attorney-General said this on behalf of

the  Government.  I  feel, Sir, that,  although  we

agree  in  principle that changes in boundaries  of

local  government  should be published  for  public

representations, we must make a start and  a  start

cannot  be  made by asking the people to say  about

the   boundaries   and  other   matters   connected

therewith  for the first elections. The  Government

boldly   and   with   determination,   after    due

consideration, fixed the boundaries to expedite the

elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been talk in this Assembly that we

have  been trying to do things in our own way,  not

caring  for the views of the Opposition.  I  think,

Sir,  we  must  admit that we cannot always  accept

cock-eyed views which can be regarded seriously  by

Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think I heard the hon. Member say

"cock-eyed".  If that is correct, I  will  ask  the

hon. Member to withdraw that word.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2258</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> I withdraw it. We can only appreciate

and take into consideration the views of the people

which  are desirable in the interest of the  people

as  a  whole. I believe, Sir, that the Government's

stand  is  very  clear.  I  do  feel  that  it   is

democratic  and, if we are to agree with  the  hon.

Member,  I feel that democracy will be moving  very

slowly  whereas, with the Government's  stand  now,

democracy will be running a bit faster.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I think the remarks of the

Member for Seletar have gone slightly askew - if that

is a parliamentary word. He stated just now that we

implied  that no representations had been  made  to

the   Select   Committee   regarding   changes   in

boundaries.  I  would refer him  quite  briefly  to

pages  358 and 359 of the Minutes of Evidence where

he  will find that City Council representatives who

appeared  before the Select Committee and  included

Members  of  the Labour Front in the  City  Council

objected  to the new boundaries. I should  like  to

know  why  the  Labour  Front Coalition  Government

repudiates its own City Council representatives.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I would like to clarify that

point.  I said: no individual member of the public.

The City Council as a body had made representations

and,  of course, as the hon. Member knows, we  have

considered them but what I meant was that no member

of   the  public  made  either  written  or  verbal

representations to the Select Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Probably because their views

will  be  put  aside  and  not  considered  by  the

Government!



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, as a matter of fact, we had

members  of  the  City Council as  Members  of  the

Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the words proposed to be

inserted, be there inserted."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment accordingly disagreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6-



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 74, line 25: to leave out "thirty-two"

and insert "forty-eight".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by this amendment, we desire to increase the

number  of the City Councillors from 32 to 48.  The

number at present proposed by the Government is 32.

If one leaves out the mayor, from the point of view

that  he  is  the first gentleman of the  City  who

should  be above the general run of committee  work

and  is  as it were on a pinnacle of his own,  that

will  leave 31 active members dealing with the day-to-day  affairs. With the mayor at  its  head,  you

have  only 31 as opposed to the present 27  members

of  the City Council. This increase of four is,  of

course,  quite insufficient when compared with  the

enormously  enlarged electorate with which  we  are

now faced. It is so long ago since the City Council

elections  were held and I do not know whether  any

of us remember just how many there were on the City

Council  electorate three years ago but  it  was  a

very insignificant number compared with the 500,000

with  which  we are faced in the coming  elections.

From  the  Report of the Committee which  has  been

thrust



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2260</b></font><br><br>



before us only this morning, we find on page 1 that

the average voter strength of a division or ward is

15,761  and  on page 2 of Annex "A"  you  have  the

breakdown of the 505,276 expected electors and  the

numbers apportioned; against that, is 32 wards. You

will  find that in Telok Ayer for example, you have

no  less than 21,078 electors and below it you have

12,124  electors in Pasir Panjang. But the average,

as I have already stated, in this Report is 15,761.

Now,  that  in itself as an average is higher  than

the  average of the present - I think it is  about - 16

divisions  of  the Assembly constituencies  roughly

within  the city area, the other nine being in  the

districts  and, as in the future we are  of  course

going   to  double  the  representatives  in   this

Assembly,  that  figure will be even  more  reduced

subject  of course to the increase through our  new

citizenship  laws  which are to  come  into  effect

shortly. Whichever way you look at it, it is  quite

clear  of  course that the wards - if I may  so  call

them  to  separate them from the divisions  in  the

Assembly - are going to have many more electors  than

the   divisions.   That  is   a   wrong   principle

altogether.  That  position  of  course  is   quite

inevitable because the qualifications for  electors

for  the local government elections are much  lower

and quite different from those that we are going to

have for the electorate for the Assembly elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Local Government Elections Bill

reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Subject to the provisions of section 6 of this

Ordinance, any person who-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) was not less than twenty-one years of

age...and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) has been ordinarily resident in the Island

for a period of not less than five years; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) is a citizen of the United Kingdom and

Colonies    by   virtue   of   the    British

Nationality Act, 1948, or was born in any  of

the  States  or territories now  included  in

the  Federation of Malaya or  the  Colony  of

Sarawak or the Colony of North Borneo or  the

State  of  Brunei who was ordinarily resident

in  Singapore on the first day  of  April  in

any year,



<br><br>shall  be  entitled to have his  name  entered  and

retained in the register of electors...".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2261</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>So  that as a result of approving clause 5 and  the

considerably lower qualifications required for  the

local government electorate, we find ourselves with

500,000  people to deal with. Now,  in  the  United

Kingdom, the normal number of electors in a ward is

never larger than 10,000. In fact, it is very often

considerably  less,  and 48  members  of  the  City

Council  would therefore work out very  roughly  to

the  500,000  electorate at 10,000 per  ward  which

would  be  a very much more satisfactory number  in

every  kind  of way because it must be  remembered,

Sir,  that the elected representatives must  be  as

close  to the people as possible and that  most  of

the  needs  of  the  man in the  street  are  local

government needs, not the needs of the Legislature.

What the man in the street is interested in is more

water,  better drainage, a solution to his problems

regarding  unauthorised buildings, building  plans,

hawkers,  electricity, and so  on,  and  these,  as

Members  of  the House very well know, are  matters

which  our  own  constituents  bring  to  us   more

frequently than any other problems and they are not

really  the  problems which elected representatives

of  the Assembly should have to deal with - I have no

doubt we deal with them willingly - but they are  the

problems  that  should  go  to  the  elected   City

Councillor  who can deal with them more effectively

for  the  very reason that it is for  him  to  make

local government operate. Therefore, it seems to us

essential  that we should increase  the  number  of

City  Councillors  to 48 which  would  make  a  far

better  proportion  to  the  electorate  than   the

present  proposal. In fact, when the Minister  last

week   said   that  there  was  danger   or   over-representation at the local government level, I  am

afraid I cannot agree with him. The very reverse is

in   fact   true.   There  is  danger   of   under-representation  because of the huge  electorate  of

half a million people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to have been the idea in the

Minister's  mind - I  suppose  in  the  mind  of  the

Government - that   there   should   not   be    more

councillors  in  local government  than  there  are

Members of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2262</b></font><br><br>



the  Assembly. "Oh, there are only going to  be  51

Members  of  this  House and  therefore  we  cannot

possibly have as many as 48 in the City Council and

members  of  the District Councils as well.  Better

keep  it  down  to 32." Now, that  I  think  is  an

erroneous  approach to the whole  problem.  In  the

United  Kingdom, there are roughly 630  Members  of

Parliament  while there are of course thousands  of

City  Councillors and County Councillors  at  local

government level. The argument does not hold water.

But  that is one side and an important side of  our

reasons for moving an amendment to the number 32.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is connected with the needed

improvement  of  the  committee  system  of   local

government  by  having more  members  of  the  City

Council.  It  has  to  be  remembered  that   local

government  is  carried on very  much  by  standing

committees and not by the monthly meetings  of  the

entire  City Council. The basis of local government

is  just that. At the moment with 27 members of the

City  Council and an increase only to 31,  you  are

going  to  have  your standing committees  far  too

small  to carry out the work as efficiently  as  it

could  be  carried  out. For example,  the  present

Health Committee of the City Council, with its  six

councillors and I think a quorum of three,  has  an

enormous    number    of    subjects    to     deal

with - departments, if I may call them  so:  hawkers,

markets,  infant  welfare clinics, city  cleansing,

veterinary  departments,  anti-malarial   measures,

standpipes, infectious diseases, etc. A whole  host

of problems is dealt with by six people and because

they  are  dealt with only by six people, the  City

Council are unable to delegate powers or feel  that

they  should not delegate powers to make  decisions

to  such a small committee which probably does  not

sufficiently represent the various four Parties  in

the  City Council. Perhaps I would do well to quote

from  the representations made by the City  Council

representatives themselves to the Select  Committee

on  this point which would be found on page 361  of

the  Minutes of Evidence, at column 34, towards the

bottom:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2263</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It [the Council] feels that the least number

that  could carry out efficiently the work of  the

Council,  bearing  in mind that the  City  Council

works on a Committee system, is 48. The reason why

the Council feels that it should be 48 is that  we

have   now  in  the  City  Council  nine  Standing

Committees.  At  the  moment,  we  have  on   each

Standing  Committee six members with a  quorum  of

three.  In  any expanding city, such as  Singapore

(where the City Council is closely associated with the  daily wants and needs of the people) the City

Council,  if  it  wants  to discharge  its  duties

efficiently  and  promptly,  will  have  to   take

decisions  quickly  and  the  only  way  in  which

decisions can be taken quickly is for the  Council

to  delegate  completely some of its authority  to

the   Standing  Committees.  At  the  moment,  the

Council is very jealous of its overall powers  and

is  most unwilling to delegate any of these powers

to  Standing  Committees. I  can  appreciate  that

position, Sir, because the quorum of the  Standing

Committees is so painfully small - it is three.  How

can one reasonably expect to delegate authority to

such a Committee? Now if we have a Committee of at

least 10 or 12 or 13 persons, I think there  is  a

greater likelihood of the Council being willing to

delegate  its authority to this Committee.  It  is

with  that  end in view, hoping to get  efficiency

and quick service, that we advocate a City Council

of 48."-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Could not the Member for

Tanglin attribute sufficient diligence on the  part

of  Members of this House to have read that  Select

Committee Report?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not think that that is a very

fair  remark. I think the hon. Member  was  drawing

attention  to  a paragraph and if he did  not  read

that paragraph, the purport of his speech would  be

lost. Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Thank you, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If we have a Council of 48, there will be more

delegation of authority to these Committees and the

work of the Council, as such, will be reduced to  a

very  large  extent.  Most  of  the  work  will  be

completed  in  the  Committee room,  and  decisions

taken  by  the  Committees will be acted  upon  the

following day, whereas the present policy is  this:

that  even  though, say, the Health  Committee  may

meet on the first possible day in the month,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2264</b></font><br><br>



its decisions cannot be acted upon until, maybe,

30 days later. Having to wait for decisions to be

confirmed by the full Council often means a waste

of time and money."



<br><br>That is the point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the only reason why we think an

enlarged Council would lead to great efficiency.

It is with that end in view that we suggested 48."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Minister - I think it was in his speech

last week - said that he was quite satisfied that the

City  Council  was  running  efficiently  with  the

present  number of members. Now, that is a question

that he asked at this stage in the Select Committee

and  the  answer is in column 38, page 363  of  the

Minutes of Evidence. It is quite brief, even if the

Member for Tanjong Pagar has already read it:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will not say that the Council is not run

efficiently, but I would say the Council would  run

much more efficiently if the Council would delegate

more of its authority to the Committees. We can get

the  work  done much more quickly and, I think,  as

time   goes  by,  it  will  become  more  and  more

imperative that decisions should be acted  on  more

and more promptly."



<br><br>Surely,  that  is  the  feeling  very  often  among

members  of the public that decisions of  the  City

Council  are  held up for a very much  longer  time

than  they need be. What appear to the City Council

as   trivial  matters  are  nevertheless  important

matters affecting their daily lives and if  we  can

speed up our administration at the local government

level, we shall be doing the people a good turn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those then, Sir, are the main reasons and the two

very   strong   reasons  why  we  feel   that   the

representation on the City Council  at  32  is  not

enough. Firstly, as I said, the electorate has been

increased  by an enormous amount to half a  million

people  and, secondly, the work of the City Council

can  be  improved by the quicker disposal of  minor

points in administration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Chairman, with great timidity in

this  jungle  of  local government  administration,  I

would  like to draw attention to one or two remarks

of the Member for Tanglin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He referred to the City Council dealing with day-to-day affairs and said that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2265</b></font><br><br>



the  increase - of  four  by  his  account - or  five

actually,  which would make it 32,  was  inadequate

and  that  standing committees were too  small  for

their  onerous  duties. I  have  in  my  hands  the

minutes  of the proceedings of the ordinary meeting

of  the  City Council on Friday, 31st May. Here  is

one of the earth-shaking decisions which had to  be

taken   by   the  Health  Committee  to  which   he

especially  referred and which then was brought  to

the whole City Council:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Approved unanimously, subject to compliance with

all Municipal requirements, an application from the

licensee  of  a Milk Bar and Confectionery  on  the

ground  floor  of  No.  91  East  Coast  Road,  for

permission  to sell hot drinks in addition  to  the

articles  he  now  sells and that  the  licence  he

endorsed accordingly."



<br><br>This  most  difficult decision first  occupied  the

time  of the Health Committee and then had to  come

before  the  whole City Council,  if  I  understand

their procedure aright.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other vital decisions were:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vehicles and Traffic Committee agreed

unanimously  that "No Right Turn" sign  be  erected

instead of a "No Entry" sign.



<br><br>Elsewhere, we have:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Guan Kong, licensee of Stall No. 1 Hot and Cold Drinks, Esplanade, was given leave to go

to  China  for  five  months and  his  nominee  was

allowed to operate instead of him.



<br><br>In another case,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Assistant Assessor had 6 days excess leave

deducted    from   his   future   vacation    leave

entitlement.



<br><br>These  are the sort of decisions and problems  with

which  these  overworked  City  Councillors  burden

themselves. If these things really have to be taken

by  the  City  Council at that level of  detail,  I

should  have  thought  the fewer  Councillors,  the

better  and  then  they will get decisions  through

quickly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I can now quote from the Hill Report on

the  reform of local government in this matter. Dr

Hill said in paragraph 375, on page 95:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A total of eighteen elected members is not

quite  enough  although large councils  should  be

avoided in the interests of efficiency. There  are

twenty-seven  members  of  the  City  Council   at

present,...and  a total of twenty-seven  is  quite

large enough."



<br><br>He went on to say at paragraph 377:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2266</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The tendency in Singapore is to refer too many

questions to special committees and to spend too

much time in committee procedure. It should be

remembered that committee meetings take up a

tremendous amount of time of important and highly

paid officials and that the bulk of the time spent

in committee could be avoided if the details of

administration are left to the officers and the

committees, concentrated on policy."



<br><br>He goes on further at paragraph 379:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the highest standards of efficiency in

administration  with the consequential  economy  in

public money are to be attained, the members of the

council  must  play  their part  by  first  of  all

'letting  the managers manage', secondly, by  self-challenging  every  urge for information  with  the

question 'Is it really necessary?', and finally, to

refuse  to refer questions to sub-committees  as  a

temporary  evasion of the task of  arriving  at  an

immediate  decision. In nine cases out of  ten  the

ultimate  decision of the committee, after  a  sub-committee  has spent a lot of time on  the  subject

will  be  the  same as that which would  have  been

given when the case was first raised."



<br><br>Finally, at paragraph 398:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Without attempting to be critical I am sure no

one except an outsider could see just how much time

is  being  spent on doing work which is  not  worth

doing  but  which  has  become  routine,  how  many

operations could be streamlined, and the number  of

outmoded  systems which no one has the  courage  to

drop.   I   have   not  looked  for  these   things

particularly but many have almost jumped up to meet

me during my investigations."



<br><br>Mr  Chairman, I feel myself that those  quotations

from the actual minutes of' the proceedings of  the

City   Council  coupled  with  the  very  pertinent

remarks   of   a  very  able  expert,   Dr   Hill,

effectively dispose of the argument that  the  City

Council ought to be larger in order to conduct  its

business more efficiently.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, the Member for

Tanglin gave two reasons why he thought the  number

should be increased from 32 to 48 and the first one

is  a startling one in that because of the lowering

of  the qualifications the electorate has increased

and  therefore,  more elected representatives  have

become necessary. I take it that it is the practice

of   his   Party   councillors  whenever   somebody

approaches them for help to find out first  whether

they are on the electoral register. If the argument

had been that the population of Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2267</b></font><br><br>



had  increased  and  the  work  had  increased  and

therefore  we  need more councillors,  there  might

have been some substance in it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second argument that it will expedite

the  work  by  delegation of authority to  standing

committees,  may I point out that  the  Member  for

Tanglin who was a leading member of the Progressive

Party  recommended  in the Rendel  Report  only  25

elected seats for the whole island and now  we  are

going  to have no less than 32 in the City Council,

12  times  three District Councils (36) ,  making  a

total  of 68. So what is all this complaint  about?

One  has  a  sneaking  feeling  that  probably  the

Liberal-Socialist Party fancies  that  its  chances

would improve by fielding more candidates. Fielding

a  candidate  is  always an expensive  process  for

parties  not  so well endowed with wealthy  patrons

and  therefore if one increases the seats there are

to contest, mathematically one increases the number

of  chances of success in the elections but on  the

merits of the case whether we should have 32 or 48,

we  say let us start with 32 and let us see whether

it works. We are quite confident that it will work.

There is no reason why it should not work. There is

no merit at all in this claim for 48.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, there are one or two

points  which I would like to answer.  First,  with

regard  to  what the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  has

said that you do not need a large number of members

of  the City Council to carry out the work of  that

City  Council, nevertheless, it has been found from

the experience in the United Kingdom from which  we

take   our  Local  Government  Bill  in  our  local

government   practice  that  a  large   number   of

councillors  is  a satisfactory way of  associating

people  with local government and, in my  own  home

town  with a population of 60,000, there is a  City

Council  of no less than 50 persons, so that  when

we  advocate  48 for a City Council  of  about  one

million  and  an electorate of half  a  million - one

million  is perhaps slightly over the estimate,  it

may be a little less; it is not very much less than

that - then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2268</b></font><br><br>



it  seems  to me that we are not very much  out  of

line in putting forward 48 for this now huge city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the remarks of the Minister for

Communications  and Works, he  quoted  one  or  two

minor decisions of the Health Committee such as the

permission  to  sell hot drinks which  having  been

made  on the first or second day of the month  then

had  to be confirmed by the ordinary meeting of the

City  Council  at  the  end of  the  month  and  he

suggested that that was unnecessary. I quite  agree

with  him and that is the point of delegating  more

powers  but  of  course not all  decisions  of  the

Health  Committee  are  as simple  and  obvious  as

asking for permission to sell hot drinks. There are

very  many more important decisions that the Health

Committee  has  to  make each  month  and,  at  the

moment,  these  have to be referred  to  the  whole

Council  for  ratification  because  such  a  small

number  of the City Council altogether are involved

in  coming to decisions. You have a quorum of  only

three  persons.  Is  it desirous  that  you  should

delegate  to  the Health Committee very  many  more

powers than you do now so long as you have a  small

standing  committee to deal with  these  questions?

That  is  the  point. The quorum of  three  is  not

sufficient to represent the City Council make-up of

parties  and independent members, whether they  are

Liberal-Socialists  or Labour  Front-U.M.N.O.-M.C.A.

or P.A.P. If you want to get a cross-section of the

City   Council   represented   on   your   standing

committee,  with an increase in your  quorum,  then

you  can  delegate  powers because  you  will  have

decisions being made by a proper representation  of

the  people but the City Council feels now - and very

rightly  feels - that important decisions  cannot  be

left  to  a  small number of people to  tackle  and

therefore  their recommendations that are  made  at

the beginning of the month have to be ratified by

the full meeting of the City Council at the end  of

the  month; therefore, resulting in a delay of  two

or  three  weeks.  As I say, if you  had  a  larger

committee  sitting on these problems - the important

problems,  not the problems of selling  hot  drinks

but the important policy problems - then those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2269</b></font><br><br>



problems could be dealt with straightaway  and  put

into practice the very next day and not be held  up

for a considerable time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir,  I  think  that the instances  quoted  by  the

Minister   for  Communications  and  Works   rather

strengthens the case for an increased number to  48

instead of 32. They bring out very clearly that due

to the lack in the number of elected members in the

City Council, we had very small quorums. Therefore,

the  Council  itself  was  not  prepared  to  leave

decisions in the hands of the quorum. Sir, you have

members of Committees, as we have had experience in

this  House, absenting themselves about twelve  out

of  thirteen times. You must have a big quorum then

if  hon.  Members even of this House do not  assume

the  responsibility to attend Select Committee when

they have been chosen, causing some of these Select

Committee meetings to be postponed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Member for Tanjong Pagar is always

in  the  habit of attributing improper motives:  in

this case, not to hon. Members of this House but to

a  Party  simply because we have changed our  stand

from 25 to 48, but circumstances change.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of clarification,

Sir. The original proposal by the Progressive Party

to  which the Liberal-Socialists are the heirs  and

successors was 25 for the whole island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Twenty-four.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Twenty-four. Worse still!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Still the point is that times

do  change and working conditions do change and  we

do  find that the idea of democracy in going out to

the  people results in much more work. I  think  we

are  justified in asking for more members  now.  If

every  member appointed to committees would  attend

meetings,  then I think that there  would  be  less

justification  but as things stand at  the  present

moment,  we are fully justified in asking for  more

members.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2270</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I just want to clear up one point. I

am  afraid hon. Members have misunderstood  what  I

was  saying.  I am not suggesting that  the  Health

Committee  should  have the sole  and  unrestricted

power  to decide whether Mr X sells hot drinks  or

not  but  they  should not concern themselves  with

that  sort of work at all. They should leave it  to

their   much  more  qualified  officials  to  judge

whether  he is a proper person; and the  same  with

the  whole  mass of other detailed work which  they

undertake at present and which, to my mind,  should

be  left  to their officers and not to be taken  by

the Councillors themselves at all. In every way, it

appears  to  be undesirable that they  should  take

this sort of detailed case and argue the merits  or

demerits of one man against another in the way they

do at present.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> There is a trifling matter

worthy  of making some observation on this lack  of

quorum for standing committees. I was just counting

the  number  of heads in this House  who  are  also

members of the City Council. I am counting not less

than  five: two on the Government Benches and three

in  the Opposition including one Liberal-Socialist.

So, I think a contributory factor is that all these

heavily    overworked   politicians   are   finding

themselves  incapable  of  discharging  their  dual

duties.  So  on the point raised by the Member  for

Tanglin  and  by the Member for Paya  Lebar,  I  am

quite  sure you could set a good example by  asking

our new Member for Cairnhill (Mr Soh Ghee Soon) to

concentrate  on  either one or  the  other  of  his

duties, and the work will get on.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, we have not yet had any

coherent  reasons from the Government why  they  do

not agree with the increase to 48. I would like  to

point  out  that  the proposal of  48  was  put  by

representatives  of  the City  Council  before  the

Select Committee on which sat Members of the Labour

Front.  Why  is it that the Labour Front  does  not

give  support to proposals of members  of  its  own

Party?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2271</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, in reply

to  the  Member for Tanglin, I have here a verbatim

report  of  a  City Council meeting held  in  those

"glorious"  days  when the Rendel Constitution  was

being  tailored  to  suit the needs  of  a  certain

political party. You perhaps may remember, Sir, the

"glorious"  meeting  when we  discussed  about  the

aldermen  principle.  In  that  meeting,  Sir,  the

President's remarks were:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next point, as I see it, is the question, of

having  agreed  that there should be  24  electoral

divisions,  it is agreed that there  should  be  32

members of the Council."



<br><br>Then the President says later on after some debate:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, 24 seats. Well, shall I take a count on

that? Those in favour of 32 seats, please indicate?

Those  in  favour of 24? So that is  32  seats  are

favoured by 21 members and 24 seats are favoured by

two members."



<br><br>The  voting  was in this fashion and that  is  that

most of the Councillors agreed that there should be

24 divisions and there should be 24 seats but there

should  also  be  eight  aldermen  elected - and  the

Progressive Party councillors were the majority  in

that  City Council who favoured 24 divisions for  a

whole city and island-wide Council!



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, second thoughts apparently

are not acceptable to the Minister for Commerce and

Industry, not even if they come from members of his

own Party. I would like to point out once more that

on  the  21st of January, 1957, the leader  of  the

Labour  Front in the City Council came  before  the

Select Committee and advocated that there should be

48  members of the City Council and they have still

to  have a proper answer front the Government as to

why  they do not agree with their own City  Council

leader  and  also why they wish to keep the  number

down to 32.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Chairman, I am afraid it

is  for the same reason why the Member for Tanglin,

the  Liberal-Socialist Member in Select  Committee,

turned down the proposal of the City Councillors to

sell refrigerators and electrical appliances.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I do not understand that

argument and I still do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2272</b></font><br><br>



not  hear  arguments against what my colleague  has

said.  I  would very much like Government  to  give

reasons.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I would like to tell the hon.

Member the reasons why we feel that 48 members  are

not necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, in the proposed Ordinance, Katong is

divorced  from the city. Secondly, it is  envisaged

that   the  public  utilities  services   will   be

undertaken  by one authority and not  by  the  City

Council  as at present. Thirdly, from the  evidence

we have heard from the City Councillors themselves,

we felt that they are running the city affairs most

efficiently  with  18  elected  plus  9   nominated

members.  We  felt  that  while  replacing  the   9

nominated  members,  we are  increasing  the  total

number of City Councillors to 32 and that the  City

Council  would be able to run efficiently  with  32

members in the new Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the word "thirty-two"

proposed to be left out, be left out."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment accordingly negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2273</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15-



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 80, line 27, after "him" to insert

", provided that the provisions of this section  shall

also  apply  in respect of the alterations  in  the

limits  of the City and Districts described in  the

First   and  Second  Schedules  to  this  Ordinance

respectively   from   those  existing   under   the

Municipal Ordinance and from those described in the

Local Government Ordinance, 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, this is the same point on which we had considerable discussion already today:

principles  are principles and they  apply  to  the

District  Council limits as much  as  to  the  City

Council limits. The arguments, in the main, are  of

course  the same as we already had previously  this

morning and this afternoon and I do not propose  to

go over them all again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> But in this particular case, there is

all  the  more  need  for  this  amendment  because

changes  in  boundaries have been made  since  this

Bill  was gazetted. Amendments were moved in Select

Committee by the Government which they referred  to

as  minor trivial amendments of no consequence. One

of  them, it is true, is a small matter to which  I

need  not  refer  but the second amendment  of  the

Government  in  a  boundary is one  I  should  have

thought was of some significance. It is the  moving

of  a whole village from one District into another:

Nee  Soon  Village from the Bukit Panjang  District

into the Serangoon District. Now, I do not wish  to

argue  the  merits or otherwise, whether  Nee  Soon

Village  should  be  in  one  District  or  another

District, but the principle remains that in  Select

Committee, the Government moved this amendment that

a  village  should be changed from one District  to

another which I should have thought would have been

of  considerable importance to the  inhabitants  of

that village themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as will be known to Members of this House,

under the Powers and Privileges Ordinance, anything

that  is  decided in Select Committee  may  not  be

discussed  or  mentioned outside that committee  to

any person whatever, even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2274</b></font><br><br>



other  Members of this House, and it  is  therefore

not  possible  to  obtain the views  of  people  on

amendments that are moved in Select Committee. Now,

the  Bill, as amended by the Select Committee,  was

only  reported to the Assembly a fortnight ago.  It

was  only  available presumably to members  of  the

public  in  this large voluminous form a  fortnight

ago  and so again in this case we feel that  it  is

all  the  more necessary that the changes  proposed

which   are   completely   new   to   the   people,

particularly to the people of Nee Soon,  should  be

gazetted and advertised in the ordinary way  as  is

proposed for future alterations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our view is that it is not a small matter to move

one  village  from one District to  another.  There

must have been very good reasons initially why  Nee

Soon  Village was put in the Bukit Panjang District

and there may be very good reasons why it has since

been moved but the voices of the people of Nee Soon

should  be  heard  if they wish to make  themselves

heard  and that opportunity should be given in  the

normal way. It is not sufficient, in our view, that

these changes should be notified purely through the

publication of a huge Bill as it is not likely that

many residents in Nee Soon Village would be able to

read  a  voluminous report of this kind. It should,

of  course,  be published in the Chinese newspapers

and  in the Malay and Tamil newspapers so that  the

people there can understand what is going on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, like the Member

for  Tanglin, I do not wish to repeat the arguments

and  viewpoints which this House has already  heard

in   connection  with  the  Member  for   Tanglin's

amendment to clause 5, resulting in it being thrown

out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned in connection with this amendment,

similar to clause 15, two amendments to the  Second

Schedule. I am glad to see that he agrees that  one

of the amendments is a minor one which nobody would

quarrel about. He speaks at greater length  on  the

second amendment. It is true that it is not a  very

minor  amendment. On the other hand, it  is  not  a

very  major  amendment but the point is  that  this

proposed change was unknown to anyone except



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2275</b></font><br><br>



the  Select  Committee. I would like to  point  out

that this second amendment is the direct result  of

the   representation  of  the  Rural  Board   which

represents  the  people  of  the  rural  areas   in

Singapore.  They  made  representations  that  this

amendment   should  be  made  and  the   Government

accepted  that amendment and so we had  the  Second

Schedule amended to follow the representations made

by the people of the Rural Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those reasons, Sir, I do not wish to repeat

what has been said when we discussed clause 5,  and

I oppose the amendment of the Member for Tanglin.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, Government

always  say  that they do not like second  thoughts

and  I  suppose these second thoughts  coming  from

them  would  be  acceptable when  they  transfer  a

village from one District to another. This is  very

unconvincing. Government seems also to want to  put

for  our consumption that it is very democratic and

sympathetic and that it would listen to  the  views

of  the  people.  Here, you have  the  Rural  Board

coming  to make representations to them and saying,

"We  want  Nee Soon Village in this other  District

and  not in the other," and they have agreed.  Yes,

in  this instance, Sir, they seem to agree and they

seem  to  make the best of it by beating drums  and

crowing  about it but what about the City Council?

The  City Council is another body - an elected  body,

in this instance. They have made representations to

the  Government. Has the Government said,  "We  are

sympathetic towards it. We will consider your views

put  forward  to us?" No, Sir. In the other  case,

the  Government said, "Your views must  be  chucked

aside.  Your  views are not good  enough."  In  one

instance,   it   is  a  Board  appointed   by   the

Government. In the other instance, it is a  Council

with  many  members elected by the people.  If  you

weigh  the  views of the people and you think  that

democracy  must  work, this is  an  instance,  Sir,

where it will come under the wings of dictatorship;

you  may have your views heard but if you have this

type  of  democratic principles  applied,  it  will

never work.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2276</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am tired of all the views put forward by the

Government  about  delays. The  Government  has  one

single  idea in its mind and that is to steamroller

everything  in  accordance  with  its  wishes.  The

principle  that the people should have a  voice  in

their  affairs is clearly stated in the two clauses

5  and 15. In the case of clause 5, the excuse  is,

"Please  do  not delay." Of course, the  delay  had

always  been  the  fault  of  Government.  In  this

instance,  Sir,  we  are  not  going  to  hold  the

District Council elections in December. I hope that

the Government will not change its mind again. I do

not think that the electoral rolls are already made

up.  I  do  not think that the boundaries are  also

made  up. I hope certainly that Government  is  not

going  to  appoint another committee and  then  put

forth  everything cut and dried before us and  say,

"Accept  or  you will not have your elections."  If

what I have been thinking is correct, there is time

for  Government to allow the people to have a voice

as to whether they want to be in one District or in

another.  Four successive Gazettes and  publication

in  the  papers will only take another four  weeks.

All in all, it should not take more than two months

to  consider  all  that.  The  difference  in  time

between  the  City Council election and  the  rural

District Council election will be round about 4  or

5  months. You have ample time to do that.  Let  us

see  that Government get on with the work  so  that

these  people can at least perceive that Government

is   going  to  adhere  to  the  principle  it  has

declared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge this Government not to crow when every

time  the  Opposition puts up an amendment  and  is

defeated, it says, "Look, your amendment  has  been

defeated." Let the Government remember that we  are

here to voice the opinion of the people. Whether we

are  defeated or not, it does not matter.  We  have

our  duty to perform to our constituents.  Let  the

Government  remember, Sir, that  they  are  not  in

absolute  majority.  Let the Government  know  that

they  have  three official votes and four nominated

votes. Let them not crow, Sir, that every time they

win-

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY ON SINGAPORE IMPROVEMENT TRUST</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>RENTALS</b></div>



<br><br>4.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

early  this  year, the Government  tabled  a  White

Paper on the subsidy of housing. It is a policy  of

the  Government and I congratulate  them  for  that

policy.  But much earlier than this year,  most  of

the  Members sitting on the Government Benches made

promises  during their election campaigns that,  if

elected,  they  would try to reduce  the  rents  of

S.I.T. houses. I can speak with some authority  on

this  because  at that time I was a member  of  the

Labour  Front and it was a platform of  the  Labour

Front  to  reduce  rentals  on  S.I.T. houses,  if

elected.  Apart  from myself  who  also  made  that

promise, I think members of other Parties made  the

same promise also because at that time when it  was

election time all sorts of promises were made,  not

caring whether they could be carried out or not. If

my   memory  is  correct,  at  one  of  the  P.A.P.

meetings,  the P.A.P. even quoted figures  to  show

how  such rents could be reduced by granting  loans

to the S.I.T. without interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has the Government done so far apart from

introducing that White



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2278</b></font><br><br>



Paper? I do not see anything. The only benefit that

can  be  seen  so far is the abolition  of  service

charges on the old S.I.T. houses. How much did that

amount to: a matter of a dollar, two dollars or  to

five  dollars? Would that relieve the  poor  tenant

very  much, a matter of reduction from one to  five

dollars? I doubt whether that would give relief  to

the tenant very much.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks to me now, Sir, that all those who made

promises  at the time of election are not any  more

interested.  "Why  bother?  I  have  already   been

elected  and  I  am  now  in  this  Assembly."  But

promises  will be made again when the next  general

election comes round again next year or earlier.  I

will quote, Sir, paragraph 13 of the White Paper:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is clear that considerable subsidisation will

have to be undertaken. Sites, particularly in urban

areas,  are becoming more difficult and  costly  to

acquire  and  prepare for building. Buildings  will

have  to  be  of solid and substantial  design  and

construction if sites, particularly those in  urban

areas,  are to be developed with the maximum degree

of  efficiency, having regard to locality,  density

of  population  and other planning  considerations.

The  economic  rents  of  these  buildings,  having

regard  to  the cost of acquisition and preparation

of  sites and to the cost of construction, will  in

most  cases  exceed the rents which are within  the

capacity  to pay of the sections of the public  for

whom  the houses are built. The difference  between

the   economic  rent  and  the  rents   which   the

prospective tenants can pay will have to be met  by

subsidy."



<br><br>Now,  Sir, this paragraph 13 clearly indicates that

Government  is  prepared to  reduce  the  rents  of

houses  which are to be built to a level  which  is

within the pocket of the common man. At the sitting

when  the  White  Paper was tabled, the  Government

announced  that  only new houses  built  after  the

introduction of that White Paper would be benefited

and that that privilege would not be granted to the

old  houses because the old houses were built at  a

higher  interest or so. Why, Sir, should  there  be

discrimination between the old houses and  the  new

houses?  Are  they not all S.I.T. properties?  Why

should one section of the S.I.T. tenants benefit by

the  White Paper and another section of the  S.I.T.

tenants  be  charged  at a higher  rental?  I  will

quote, Sir, an answer that was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2279</b></font><br><br>



given  to  me  by the Minister in his reply  to  my

question  regarding  Singapore  Improvement   Trust

Flats  in  Albert/Prinsep/Short Streets: Government

Subsidy. I asked the Minister for Local Government,

Lands  and Housing if he will give complete figures

pertaining to the Singapore Improvement Trust flats

in  Albert/Prinsep/Short Streets showing  how  the

amount of Government subsidy in respect thereof  is

calculated and the answer I got was:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The method of subsidy by Government on S.I.T.

housing is outlined in the Government White  Paper,

No.  Cmd. 6 of 1957. The subsidy is not related  to

any  particular  scheme but is in fact  the  amount

required  to  make  up the annual  deficit  in  the

Trust's   Housing  Account.  It  is  not   possible

therefore  to  give  any exact calculation  of  the

subsidy  in  respect  of the Albert  Street/Prinsep

Street/Short Street scheme for which there  can  be

in any case no complete figures until the buildings

are completed. The approximate figure of $30 to $40

given in oral answer to a question by Mr Lim Choon

Mong   at  the  last  meeting  of  the  Legislative

Assembly  as the subsidy for the $35/30  p.m. two-room flat is the best estimate which can be given."



<br><br>Now  then, the Minister himself is not sure of  the

amount  of subsidy that would be granted to  S.I.T.

houses whether they be new houses or old houses. He

himself  is not certain what the amount of  subsidy

would  be.  Now,  are the Prinsep Street  or  Short

Street  houses  not  completed yet?  He  says  that

unless they are completed, he is not able to give a

correct  figure. They have been completed long  ago

and  complaints  of grievances  have  come  to  the

knowledge  of the Minister through some Members  of

this Assembly. Why has he not looked into them?  He

has  no reply other than to say that the method  of

subsidy  is  contained in No. Cmd. 6 of 1957.  Well

that  Paper is here and I think everyone  has  read

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this year, Sir, the City Council and the

Government   have   shirked  their   responsibility

towards  this housing subsidy and the reason  given

by these two organisations is that the S.I.T. is  a

statutory   body  which  is  of   no   concern   to

Government.   During   my  application   for   this

adjournment speech, I included



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2280</b></font><br><br>



the  allocation  of S.I.T. houses, but  you,  Sir,

have ruled me out that it does not come within  the

purview  of the Ministry. For all purposes,  it  is

most convenient for the Minister to say that he has

got no control -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is out of

order  in referring to a matter in which he himself

had been ruled out of order by the Speaker. Will he

please confine his remarks to Government subsidy on

S.I.T. rentals?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Yes, Sir. I am just passing a

remark that the Minister is always trying to  shirk

his  responsibility by saying that it does not come

within his control at all. I am just only making  a

passing  remark  on  that and not  in  fact  making

reference to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we have an elected Government, not a

colonial  Government. At the time when  the  S.I.T.

was managed by a Board of Trustees, it was under  a

colonial  Government.  Today,  out  of  those  nine

Benches on the opposite side, five are elected, one

is nominated and three are ex-officio Members which

clearly  indicate  that  there  is  a  majority  of

elected  Ministers  in  the  Government.  Can  this

elected  Government  now shirk its  responsibility?

Can  this  elected Government which  made  promises

during   the   election   campaign   shirk    their

responsibility in that they have got nothing to  do

with housing subsidy? I doubt they are prepared  to

do so because election is coming very near - a matter

of  another  year - and  the election  campaign  will

start  in  a matter of a few months. Did Government

not  also make a promise that they would set  up  a

Housing  Authority  which  would  come  under   the

control of the Minister for Local Government?  When

we  have  that Housing Authority, then the Minister

will  say, "Ah, this is within my Ministry  and  my

portfolio.  I  will  look into it."  For  how  many

months have the Government promised to set up  that

Housing  Authority? So far, nothing has been  heard

about  it  except the Malayanisation of the  S.I.T.

and the protest by the employees of the S.I.T. When

can  this Housing Authority be set up? We have  yet

to see it. These promises here and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2281</b></font><br><br>



there come in when election time comes round. I  am

quite  sure  that  by the time  the  life  of  this

Assembly expires, the Housing Authority will  still

be  in  thin air. I doubt there will be  a  Housing

Authority.   The   Government  should   set   their

machinery straightaway and then set up this Housing

Authority with the subsidy that the Government  are

prepared to offer to old and new tenants of  S.I.T.

houses,  not  to  discriminate  one  section   from

another,  but to all S.I.T. tenants who  pay  their

rents   to  the  S.I.T. or  to  this  new  Housing

Authority.



<br><br>4.11 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, in my Oral and Written Answers to the

Questions  in  the  Assembly during  the  last  few

months,  I have been at some pains to explain  that

the  Government  subsidy  policy  is  contained  in

Sessional  Paper  No. Cmd. 6 of 1957.  The  subsidy

which  Government provides is not  related  to  any

particular scheme for housing whether in Queenstown

or  Kallang or in Albert Street or anywhere in  the

island  but  it  is operative over  all  the  Trust

housing estates. The total subsidy is in effect the

amount  required to make up the annual  deficit  in

the  Trust Housing Account as embodied in the White

Paper  and  I  will now, Sir, proceed to  read  the

relevant paragraph. The Member for Queenstown  read

paragraph  13.  I  think  it  should  be  read   in

conjunction  with  paragraph  19.  This   is   what

paragraph 19 has to say, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This Housing Account will contain, on the Income

side,  the  proceeds  of  rents  from  all  housing

erected by the Trust and by the Authority, that is,

rent   from  pre-war  properties  which  arc  still

subject to rent control, from the properties  which

have  been  built since the war, and from  all  the

properties  which will be built in connection  with

slum clearance and other schemes in the future.  On

the   same   side  of  the  account   will   appear

contributions   from   tenants   in   respect    of

conservancy  and  service charges and  income  from

miscellaneous sources. On the Expenditure side will

appear  the  cost of administration of the  Housing

Authority,  the  cost of designing and  supervising

the  erection  of new buildings, and  the  cost  of

managing the housing estates. On this side  of  the

account also will appear contributions to the  City

Council  in  respect  of  rates  (rents  on  public

housing  include  rates),  payments  to  the   City

Council in respect of conservancy and service

charges,    maintenance   of   buildings,    annual

contributions to a Repairs Fund. Lastly, payment of

interest  and repayment of principal on  all  loans

from the Government for housing."



<br><br>So,  Sir, if the Member for Queenstown were to read

paragraph 14 in conjunction with paragraph 19, I am

sure  he will understand what is the policy of  the

Government on subsidy of S.I.T. rentals.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are

one   or  two  remarks  made  by  the  Member   for

Queenstown which might be misleading to this House.

One is that the S.I.T. is controlled by the elected

Government.  Sir,  there is still  in  existence  a

Board   of  Trustees  and  the  only  control   the

Government  has on the S.I.T. is in regard  to  the

new  buildings of the S.I.T. The houses  that  they

are  now  putting  up are covered by  this  housing

subsidy policy laid down by the Government. In  all

other respects, the Board of Trustees of the S.I.T.

take their own decisions even as regards the fixing

of  rents of shops. Government decides the rents of

the new houses bearing in mind two things: the type

of  accommodation provided and the ability  of  the

tenant,  who is going to occupy that accommodation,

to  pay.  That is laid down in the housing  subsidy

policy  in Paper No. Cmd. 6 of 1957. Therefore,  it

is  not  right  for  the hon. Member  to  say  that

because  we have an elected Government to ask  what

the  elected Government has done about  the  rents,

and  so on. But one thing is clear and that is when

the  Labour Front went out for elections  in  April

1955,  there  was a promise that we  would  try  to

reduce   the  rate  of  interest  charged  by   the

Government to the S.I.T. for putting up the houses.

Now, I believe that the rate of interest charged at

that   time - I  am  not  the  Minister   for   Local

Government;  but  I do remember certain  things - was

round about 4 per cent and the promise that we made

to  the  electorate was that we would try to reduce

it  to 2 per cent. A reduction of the interest rate

by  about  2 per cent would have probably  given  a

reduction in the rental by about $8 or so,  whereas

now  (if  you see the new houses that are built  in

Short  Street and Albert Street) according  to  the

new  housing subsidy policy, the reduction  in  the

rentals



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2283</b></font><br><br>



is  far  greater. Normally the economic  rent  for

that type of house, according to the present cost,

would  be somewhere in the region of about $60  to

$70  and the Government has fixed the rents at $35

for  newcomers and $30 for people who are  cleared

out  from  slum areas. Therefore, the  subsidy  is

between  $30  and $40 per house. My contention  is

that  you  could  never  have  achieved  such  low

rentals  if  we  had  just  reduced  the  rate  of

interest by 2 per cent or even if we had abolished

the  rate  of interest entirely. It is because  of

this bold subsidy policy that the tenants of those

houses   are   going  to  enjoy  a  much   greater

reduction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I want to make is that the

decision  to  waive conservancy and other  charges

has  resulted  in  a reduction of  $10  on  Manila

Street flats.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2284</b></font><br><br>



In some cases, it is $2; in some it is $5, but in

the case of Manila fiats, if I am not mistaken, it

is $10.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Sir,

it is with some reluctance and trepidation that  I

enter into what is largely a political debate but,

for  the  purposes of the record, I would like  to

draw  the attention of the hon. Member to the fact

that  as is stated in paragraphs 9 and 10  of  the

White  Paper, S.I.T. houses are in fact subsidised

at the present time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.



<br><br><div align="right">Adjourned accordingly at</div>
