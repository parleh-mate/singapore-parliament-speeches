<div align="center"><b>CIVIL LAW (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>10.06 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. P. Shanks):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise  to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill relates to the assessment of damages

awardable where death is caused by some wrongful act or

negligence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 12 of the Civil Law Ordinance provides for

damages  to be proportional to the loss resulting  from

the  death so that at present if the person killed  has

been  sufficiently provident to provide for  his  widow

and children by insuring his life, the amount



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1927</b></font><br><br>



payable  under  that insurance is deductible  from  the

amount  the  Court assesses as being the worth  of  the

deceased.  Such  damage is not a  punitive  penalty  of

negligence but the result is the curious position  that

it   is   cheaper  to  kill  the  provident  than   the

improvident;  or, putting it in another way,  the  wise

precaution of the provident man in insuring himself for

the  benefit of his widow or children may be of no real

benefit to them; they may not benefit from the premiums

he  has  already  paid. That this was  inequitable  was

recognized in the Federation some three years ago,  and

in  England as long as fifty years ago. It is,  both  I

and  the Bar Committee think, time that Singapore  gave

recognition  to  the providence of  insurance  in  this

respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendment proposed by clause 2 (b) of this

Bill  provides  for dependants to be  able  to  recover

funeral  expenses which they themselves incurred  where

they  are parties to the action for their recovery.  At

present,  such expenses are only recoverable where  the

action  is brought on behalf of the estate. This  is  a

further  amendment  that  has  already  been  made  law

elsewhere and is, I think, a desirable change  to  make

in our law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.10 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Sir, we welcome this

Bill but I am amazed to hear from the Hon. the Attorney-General that this legislation has been in existence for

three  years in the Federation and for fifty  years  in

the  United Kingdom. May I ask why this Government  has

been sleeping over this during the last 3½ years?



<br><br><!-- Mr Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanks:</b> It is not the Government that has been

sleeping, Sir, but I am quite sure that the hon. Member

would  not  wish  any government to  rush  wildly  into

alterations   merely  because  they  have   been   made

elsewhere. These things do need careful consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1928</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill.-[Mr Shanks].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.



<br><br>10.11 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,

"That clause 2 stand part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I have only one comment to make

on the reply given by the Hon. the Attorney-General.

Does any Government -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We are now on clause 2 and if the

hon. Member has any comment to make on clause 2, he can

make it.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, I would like to make this

comment. Clause 2 (b) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"damages may be awarded in respect of funeral

expenses of the deceased person if such expenses have

been incurred by the parties for whose benefit the

action is brought.".



<br><br>What I want to say is this. These benefits have been

delayed by the Government for 3½ years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read the Third time

and passed.

<div align="center"><b>COUNCIL (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>10.14 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang (Assistant Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Mr Tan Theng Chiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1929</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the proposals to change the franchise to

provide for Singapore citizenship, the purpose of  this

amending Bill is to seek a change in the qualifications

of  voters of the Southern Islands Local Council  which

it  is  proposed  will  now  be  Singapore  citizenship

together with residence in an electoral division of the

Southern Islands since the 1st day of February in  each

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under existing law, a resident must reside in an

electoral division for five years before he is eligible

to become a voter. A ketua, on the other hand, is still

required  under the amended subsection 5 (c) to  reside

in  the  electoral division in which he seeks  election

for  five years before he is eligible to be a candidate

for  election to the Local Council as a ketua as it  is

considered that candidates standing for these elections

should be persons who should have knowledge of and  who

can   speak   with  authority  on  the  local   affairs

concerning their respective areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if this amendment is passed, it will also enable

the Legislative Assembly electoral registers to be used

for  the  purpose of elections to the Southern  Islands

Local Council and thus avoid the necessity of having to

prepare separate registers for this purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. -[Mr Tan Theng Chiang].

amendment; read the Third time and passed.

Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1930</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>10.17 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have  His  Excellency's recommendation and  consent  to

proceed  with  this Bill. I therefore move,  "That  the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As pointed out in the Explanatory Statement, this Bill

arises  out  of  the  constitutional  changes  in   the

Federation   of  Malaya.  The  office  of   the   Chief

Secretary,  Federation of Malaya, no longer exists  and

the  properties formerly vested in him have been vested

in  the Federal Lands Commissioner by the Federal Lands

Commissioner  Ordinance,  1957.  So  too  the  rights,

powers and liabilities formerly vested in or imposed on

the    Chief   Secretary   by   the   Chief   Secretary

(Incorporation) Ordinance, 1949, of the  Federation  of

Malaya  have been vested in and imposed on the  Federal

Lands Commissioner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is complementary to the Federal Lands

Commissioner  Ordinance,  1957,  and  is  designed   to

incorporate  the  Federal  Lands  Commissioner  of  the

Federation  of Malaya in Singapore and to  provide  for

the  transfer to that corporation of all the properties

formerly  vested in the Chief Secretary, Federation  of

Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of minor amendments to the Bill of which I

have  given  notice, Sir, will be moved by  me  at  the

Committee stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. -[Dato Abdul Hamid].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.

<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this is a very simple Bill and, as it says in the

Explanatory Statement, a member of a local authority

is, by the amendment, disqualified from continuing to

be a member of the local authority if he stands as a

candidate for election to the Legislative Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, local authority Councillors cannot

continue to be members of that local authority once

they are elected to the Legislative Assembly, which is

the law at present, and local authority Councillors

who seek election to the Legislative Assembly and are

nominated are also disallowed from continuing to be

members of that local



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1933</b></font><br><br>



authority. In effect, therefore, Sir, local  authority

Councillors  must  make  up their  minds  one  way  or

another   on   nomination  day  for  the   Legislative

Assembly, whether they wish to continue as members  of

the  local  authority  or  to  seek  election  to  the

Legislative Assembly. They cannot keep their  feet  in

the  local  authority  in reserve  in  case  they  are

unsuccessful  in  the  elections  to  the  Legislative

Assembly. However, Sir, there is nothing to prevent an

unsuccessful  candidate from standing for  re-election

to the local authority at the time of a by-election to

that local authority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this Bill is simple. It has been

briefly  stated in the Explanatory Statement  appended

to  the  Bill  which  has been in the  hands  of  hon.

Members.  The  Bill  seeks  to  make  what  might   be

described  as  a technical amendment to the  Singapore

Traction   Ordinance.  Part  XIII  of  the   Municipal

Ordinance  contains  provisions  relating  to   public

service  vehicles. These provisions do  not,  however,

apply  to the public service vehicles of the Singapore

Traction Company. The operations of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1934</b></font><br><br>



these  S.T.C. vehicles  are regulated  by  provisions

contained  in quite a separate Ordinance - the Singapore

Traction  Ordinance  (Chapter 111),  and  section  52,

subsection  (2)  of  the Singapore Traction  Ordinance

specifically provides as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The provisions of Part XIII of the Municipal

Ordinance  relating to hackneyed carriages  and  carts

shall not apply to cars as defined by this Ordinance."



<br><br>Sir,  the  House  will  know that  Part  XIII  of  the

Municipal  Ordinance has been repealed, and  has  been

replaced   by   Part  XII  of  the  Local   Government

Ordinance, 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Part XII subsequently re-enacts the provisions

relating   to   public  service  vehicles   previously

contained in the Municipal Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wording of section 52, subsection (2) of the

Singapore  Traction  Ordinance  has  therefore  become

obsolete,  and  in  order to remove any  doubts  which

might   arise,  it  is  now  proposed  to  amend   the

subsection by substituting an up-to-date wording.  All

that  the  amending Bill seeks to do is to  substitute

for  the  words "Part XIII of the Municipal Ordinance"

the words "Part XII of the Local Government Ordinance,

1957".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one other section in the Local

Government  Ordinance, 1957, which might be  construed

as  being  in  conflict  with the  provisions  of  the

Singapore  Traction  Ordinance.  It  is  section  131.

Section  131  of the Local Government Ordinance,  Sir,

empowers the local authority to levy taxes on vehicles

kept  or habitually used within the area of the  local

authority.   Section  132  of  the  Local   Government

Ordinance, however, provides that this power cannot be

exercised in respect of whatever vehicles are licensed

or registered or exempt from licensing or registration

under the provisions of the Road Traffic Ordinance. It

will  be  noted  that exemptions  must  be  under  the

provisions  of the Road Traffic Ordinance.  Now,  Sir,

the  vehicles  of the Singapore Traction  Company  are

exempt  from the licensing and registration under  the

provisions of the Road Traffic Ordinance; but such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1935</b></font><br><br>



exemptions  do not arise under the provisions  of  that

Ordinance.  It arises rather by virtue of  the  special

exemption  contained in section 52, subsection  (1)  of

the Singapore Traction Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible, therefore, for an argument to be

advanced that since the exemption of S.T.C. vehicles is

not under the provisions of the Road Traffic Ordinance,

a  strict  interpretation of section 131 of  the  Local

Government Ordinance would empower a local authority to

levy  taxes  on such vehicles. In order to  remove  any

doubts  on  this clause, Sir, it is proposed  that  the

amendment  to  section  52,  subsection  (2)   of   the

Singapore  Traction  Ordinance, should  also  expressly

provide   for  the  exemption  of  Singapore   Traction

vehicles  from  the provisions of section  131  of  the

Local Government Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.34 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

although  the  Minister  for Communications  and  Works

reminded  us that this amendment is merely a  technical

amendment,  I wish to ask the Minister why he  did  not

take  the  opportunity  to amend  the  many  privileges

conferred on the Singapore Traction Company during  the

life of the previous government. I am sure the Minister

will  agree  with  me  that the  public - the  masses  in

Singapore - always have such a feeling that the Singapore

Traction   Company  is  something  like  a   government

enterprise, or a semi-government enterprise, because it

has  so  many privileges when compared to other private

bus companies. So, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am afraid

the  hon. Member is straying much too far away from the

Bill.  It  is  merely a Bill to amend section  52.  The

principle whether or not the Singapore Traction Company

should continue, I think, does not arise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I was just making a point

about  the privileges enjoyed by the Singapore Traction

Company. I would say to the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1936</b></font><br><br>



that  it  is  time to move this amendment. I  wish  the

Minister would move an amendment to cut as much  as  he

could  the privileges enjoyed by the Singapore Traction

Company.



<br><br>10.36 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I do not want to take up too much of the

House's  time in discussing the policy on the Singapore

Traction  Company, but I wish to stress,  as  you  have

stressed, Sir, that the questions raised by  the  Hon.

Member for Changi are completely irrelevant. But  there

may  be  an opportunity later on to do so when the  new

Government   discusses  the  policy  of  transport   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>10.41 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang (Acting Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Financial Secretary (Mr Oon Khye Kiang):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Entertainments Duty Ordinance was first

enacted in 1950 and came into force in October of  that

year.  It is proposed to amend certain sections of  the

Ordinance in the light of eight years' experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been found that the definition of "proprietor"

in section 2 of the Ordinance has proved inadequate for

the  purpose  of charging principals in the  Courts  in

respect  of  the  breach of the law,  as  it  is  often

difficult   to   ascertain  who  the  manager   of   an

entertainment   is.  Under  the  Public  Entertainments

Ordinance, it is incumbent on any person who  organises

a  public entertainment to obtain a police licence, and

it  is proposed that such licensee should also be  held

responsible  in  respect  of any  offence  against  the

Entertainments  Duty  Ordinance,  and  any  rules  made

thereunder. The proprietor is so defined as to  include

the licensee of a public entertainment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1938</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second major amendment relates to section 4 of

the  Ordinance. It will be recalled that at the meeting

held on the 18th December, 1951, the former Legislative

Council passed a resolution under section 4 (1) of  the

Ordinance   levying  half-duty  in  respect   of   live

entertainment.  It  is  proposed  to  incorporate  this

provision in the proposed amendment in clause 3.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In section 2 of the Ordinance, entertainment is

defined  as  including  "any  exhibition,  performance,

amusement,  games  or  sport,  to  which  persons   are

admitted on payment". Since the enactment of the  above

resolution,  the  various  Singapore  amusement  parks,

known  as the "Worlds", have paid full duty in  respect

of  admission  charges. Whilst  an  amusement  park  is

certainly an entertainment as defined in section  2  of

the Ordinance, there is some doubt whether it might not

be   held   to  be  included  among  those   forms   of

entertainment  which, by virtue of the proviso  to  the

resolution referring to live entertainment, are charged

duty  at  half-rate. It was certainly not the intention

that the amusement parks should pay only half-duty, and

the  opportunity  is  therefore taken  to  clarify  the

position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the open-air cinemas has been under

examination.  At the moment, there are 22 such  cinemas

operating  in  the rural areas and three in  the  city.

They  cater  mainly  for persons in  the  lower  income



group,  such as farmers, fishermen, manual workers  and

students. The popular prices are 50 cents, 30 cents and

20  cents,  on  which duty leviable is respectively  15

cents,  10  cents and 5 cents. The operator is  usually

left  with a nett of 15 cents to 35 cents to  meet  his

overhead  expenditure,  which may  come  to  $3,000  or

$3,500  per month. The open-air cinemas do not  receive

income from advertisements as do the other big cinemas.

They are subject to the vagaries of the weather. On the



other   hand,   they  are  meeting   the   demand   for

entertainment  which  will  not  be  supplied  by   the

ordinary  cinema  operator.  In  that  sense  they  are

providing a social amenity to the community.  They  are

in  most  cases working under difficult conditions  and

often suffer losses. It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1939</b></font><br><br>



therefore  thought that there is a case for relief  in

this   instance,  and  the  Government  has  therefore

decided  to  grant relief to the extent  of  remitting

half-duty  in  respect of these  open-air  cinemas.  I

propose, Sir, to move an amendment to section 4 of the

Ordinance  in Committee. A notice to this  effect  has

been given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dance, as such, is not liable to entertainment duty,

but  it  is however necessary to ensure that,  if  the

proprietor of a restaurant or ballroom charges  a  fee

for  admission, and thereafter stages a floor show  or

several floor shows lasting for more than half an hour

in  the  aggregate, duty should be  charged  upon  the

admission  fee.  The proposed amendment  in  clause  4

relating to section 10 of the Ordinance is designed to

this end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, not all officers of the Customs Department

have   authority  to  inspect  places  connected  with

entertainments where tickets are surreptitiously  sold

in advance for entertainments to be held later. Senior

officers  of  Customs are permitted  to  inspect  only

"places  of entertainment" or "places ordinarily  used

as  places  of entertainment". All other  places  even

though  they  are  connected with  entertainments  are

immune    from    inspection.   In    addition,    the

Entertainments Duty Ordinance requires  such  officers

to   inspect   places  of  entertainment   while   the

entertainment is in progress, thus making it difficult

to detect offences which are usually committed shortly

before  the  performance.  As  it  is  imperative   to

associate  the  junior  Customs  officers   in   these

inspections,  the proposed amendment in  clause  5  is

designed to enable an officer of Customs to enter  and

inspect   at  all  reasonable  times  any   place   of

entertainment, any place ordinarily used as a place of

entertainment,   as  well  as  any  other   place   he

reasonably   suspects   to  be   connected   with   an

entertainment. Similarly it is proposed in  clause  7,

which  amends section 15 of the Ordinance,  to  extend

the  powers  given to a senior Customs officer  to  an

"officer   of  Customs"  in  respect  of  seizure   of

documents.  The inspection of places of  entertainment

necessitates   almost  simultaneous  checks   at   the

admission gates (usually two or more) the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1940</b></font><br><br>



box  office as well as the manager's office from where

documents  relating  to  the  entertainment   can   be

obtained.  Revenue officers of the Customs  Department

should  therefore  be  given  powers  to  seize   such

documents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 amends section 22 of the Ordinance by

extending the authority given to a "senior officer  of

Customs"  to  an "officer of Customs"  in  respect  of

search.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 14 (2) of the Ordinance makes it mandatory for

an arrested person to be taken to a police station. As

this  subsection now stands, taking such person  to  a

customs station would constitute an unlawful act.  The

proposed  amendment in clause 6 will make  section  14

(2) of the Ordinance fall in line with section 31 (2)

of  the  Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, where an  arrested

person may be taken either to a police station or to a

customs  station,  and  with section  87  (2)  of  the

Customs   Ordinance   which  also  makes   alternative

provision for the custody of arrested persons  in  the

hands of a proper officer of Customs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 introduces two new sections - 17A and 17B.

Section  17A provides for the compounding of  offences

so  as  to save the time of the Courts from having  to

deal with purely technical and minor offences. Section

17B  enables  senior  officers of Customs  to  conduct

prosecutions under the Entertainments Duty Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 introduces a new section 19A making attempts

and  abetments  of offences punishable with  the  same

punishment  as offences. This new section  will  bring

the  Ordinance in line with section 111 of the Customs

Ordinance  and  section  33  of  the  Dangerous  Drugs

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang (Acting Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Financial Secretary (Mr Oon Khye Kiang):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I have the Governor's recommendation

to proceed with the motion; I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of $735,672

shall be supplied to the Government under the heads  of

expenditure  and  for  the services  specified  in  the

Schedule  contained in Sessional Paper No.  Cmd.  8  of

1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Schedule consists of a list of six

applications  for supplementary provision amounting  to

$735,672. The reasons for these supplementary votes are

given in detail in the Sessional Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two items which involve a substantial sum

of  money. One of them refers to a revision of salaries

of   the   midwives.  The  Singapore  Midwives'   Union

originally  claimed in early 1956 that  these  midwives

should be on the same salary scale as that of qualified

nurses;  but  this  claim  could  not  be  accepted  by

Government  and  had to be submitted to arbitration  in

March



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1942</b></font><br><br>



1957,  in  accordance  with the  Arbitration  Agreement

executed  between the Official and Staff  Side  of  the

Civil  Service  Joint  Council. In  November  1957  the

Tribunal made an award that midwives should be given  a

substantial  increase  to  their  salaries,  the  exact

amount  of  which  was  to  be negotiated  between  the

Government and the Union and to be effective  from  1st

February, 1957. As no agreement could be reached  after

six  months'  negotiation, the Tribunal was  reconvened

and  fixed  the  salary  on the timescale  of  $168-8A-200/bar/220-10A-270 in December, 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This salary scale was actually Government's last

offer  to  the Union. The Government and the Union  had

conscientiously  sought to reach a settlement  of  this

dispute  during  negotiation. It was  not  possible  to

agree  to  pay the midwives at a rate higher than  that

designed  for  them and similar grades in  the  general

revision  of  Civil Service salaries.  Any  substantial

departure would disrupt the overall salary structure of

the public service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new salary scale gives a very substantial

increase  from  10  per cent to 27 per  cent  over  the

midwives'   existing   salaries.   It   compares   very

favourably  with that paid by the City Council  and  to

other  grades of Government servant, and compares  more

than  favourably  with the salaries  which  prospective

midwives  could command from commercial  or  industrial

employers.  The  additional annually  recurrent  costs,

assuming  that all the posts are filled, of  paying  at

the  new  rate, would be $92,000. There is, again,  the

additional  cost  of  payment of  arrears  and  Central

Provident   Fund   contributions  at   the   new   rate

retrospectively  from 1st February,  1957.  Altogether,

$202,000 will be required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other big item is the revote of $499,867 to meet

the  cost to be borne by Government in connection  with

the  Constitution  Exposition  at  Kallang.  Under  the

authority  given  by the Assembly, a warrant  has  been

issued  to  cover  the  expenditure  which  has   beefs

incurred.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $20,000 for Head 4 stand part of the

Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may we enquire

just  what area this railing will enclose? I  ask  this

because I think Members are aware that at the river end

of  this building there is hardly space to manoeuvre  a

vehicle  between  the P.W.D. garage and  the  storeroom

which  contains  the  air-conditioning  plant  of  this

building. If we are to take the middle line between the

outward  ends of the two buildings, it is very unlikely

that any vehicles can pass at all. I am just interested

in the geometrical configurations that will be involved

in the railing of this Building.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a Member of the

Assembly,  at least, I would like to know what  portion

would  be  enclosed, and how it would be  enclosed.  It

would have been much better if a sketch plan could have

been laid before this House so that we could understand

the position.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the Financial Secretary will

inform  the House that the railings are meant to follow

the present road dividers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, if I understand the

significance  of  that  remark  from  the  Chair,   Mr

Speaker,  I  take it that there will be no railings  at

the  river-side  of this Building. I believe  that  the

object of delimiting the precincts of this House is  to

invest  the sacred grounds, of which the railings  will

form  the  boundary, with some kind of legal  sanctity.

If, in fact, there is going to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1944</b></font><br><br>



be  an  open gap at one end, then the whole purpose  of

the railing will be defeated.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair:</b> Sir, I can only say something from

memory. If I remember correctly, the fencing will  come

on  to the road divider, on the Victoria Memorial  Hall

and  the Civil District Court sides and then go on  the

same  side of the wall of the Assembly building on  the

other  side.  We  do  not  expect  there  will  be  any

difficulty  with traffic arrangements.  I  believe  the

hon. Member is a Member of the House Committee, and  he

will  have  got  a  copy  of  the  proceedings  of  the

Committee's deliberations. That is all I can tell  from

memory,  Sir, I hope it is right, and the  hon.  Member

may  be  able to verify from the Minutes which  he  has

received.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, we have natural railings round

the  Assembly in the form of big buildings  surrounding

us. I do not know why this $20,000 should be spent.  If

it   is  necessary  to  get  a  vote  of  $20,000,  the

Government  should at least have put up a  sketch  plan

showing what they want to do.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Assembly

has   appointed  a  House  Committee,  and  the   House

Committee  has  gone into this question  and  has  made

recommendations.  I am sure the hon.  Member  does  not

suggest   that  the  Members  of  the  House  Committee

appointed  by  this Assembly have not  done  their  job

properly.  Moreover, Sir, I went into the  C.P.A.  Room

just  now  and found that the hon. Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar is a Member of the House Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, we know there is a House

Committee.  Has  the  House  Committee's  Report   been

submitted  to the Members of this Assembly? If  it  has

not, how are we to know what is being done?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I would like to speak on this question

again. The question of security by fencing the Assembly

was  discussed in the House Committee, and we felt that

there  should  be railings fixed. It is  done  in  many

countries. We have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1945</b></font><br><br>



had  so  many difficulties in the past, because  nobody

understood the precincts of the Assembly, and the House

Committee   Members  thought  it  was   a   very   good

suggestion. The vote is not the actual cost of  putting

up  the  railings. It has been proposed  that  the  old

railings which surrounded the Girl Guides' Home will be

used and repainted. So this $20,000 is not the cost  of

putting  up  the new railings. It is the  old  railings

which  are to be erected there and painted. I  am  sure

that  if  railings  are  erected outside  the  Assembly

House, the Assembly will look better and dignified.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Tanjong Pagar may be

informed that there is a road divider on the river side

as well.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, there is only one more point.

The Government is spending a lot of money, and there is



another  $20,000 more. But will the Government  promise

to  circulate  to  Members the  Minutes  of  the  House

Committee and also to give us a sketch plan?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, may I clarify that it is not

entirely   a  Government  measure?  It  is  a   measure

recommended by the House Committee of this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I have been pressing all the

time,  and  there is no satisfactory reply forthcoming.

What  I  want  is  a  sketch plan.  Can  the  Financial

Secretary,  who  is bringing up this  vote  of  $20,000

before  us, give a sketch plan to the Members  of  this

House?



<br><br><!-- Mr Oon Khye Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Oon Khye Kiang:</b> Sir, I will arrange for a sketch

plan  to be submitted to Members of this Assembly. With

regard to the point raised by the hon. Member for Telok

Ayer,  this proposal has been very closely examined  by

the  Treasury, and the Treasury is satisfied that  this

$20,000  is  the  minimum that can  be  spent  on  this

project.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> As a Member of the House Committee, I will

certainly inform the next meeting of the desire of  the

hon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1946</b></font><br><br>



Member, and I will recommend that a copy of the sketch

plan be circulated to all Members of this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Sir Ewen Fergusson -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sir Ewen Fergusson:</b> Sir, I think it was stated that

the   railings  were  coming  from  the  Girl   Guides'

Association. I am not quite certain of that. Do we have

to  get permission from the Girl Guides' Association to

remove their railings?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, the railings were made by the Public

Works  Department.  We  thought probably  the  railings

there  would  be of help. After all, the  Girl  Guides'

Association  is  a small institution,  and  we  thought

there is no need for it to have strong railings.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I do not know, Sir, whether the

Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Nair)  knows

the  Girl  Guides well. I do not. But the other  day  I

heard some very unpleasant incident which happened to a

dancer - a  very  attractive  young  lady - who   was   not

properly enclosed!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $20,000 for Head 4 ordered to stand part of

the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 11-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,300 for Head 11 ordered to stand part of

the Schedule.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 20-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $900 for Head 20 ordered to stand part of

the Schedule.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 49-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $202,000 for Head 49 ordered to stand part

of the Schedule.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 57-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $15,000 for Head 57 stand part of the

Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I am in favour of increasing

the general revenue of the Colony by selling new stamps

at  the  appropriate time. But I would like to  enquire

from  the  Minister concerned what the motif  in  these

stamps  will be, not from a purely philatelic  interest

in the matter, but purely from the point of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1947</b></font><br><br>



view of the politician who has been associated with the

constitutional  discussions.  We  do   not   want   the

constitutional  progress,  which  is  a  limited   one,

presented  in  such a way that it is  the  end  of  the

political road along which we wish to travel. It should

rather try to convey to the minds of the people of this

island  that  this is a stepping stone to  further  and

greater political progress. Therefore, the motif in the

series of 10, 12, 20, 25, 30 and 50 cents stamps should

bear  a  relation  to:  (1) the limited  constitutional

progress we have acquired; (2) the ambition and  desire

of  the people to be free; and (3) if the Government is

able  to think of it, the ways and means by which  such

ambition and desire can ultimately be fulfilled.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, the motif is not flesh but a

stone lion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I am not interested in making

a   repartee   to  that.  The  Chief  Minister   is   a

particularly  unhappy man at this  moment  because  his

counterpart in the Federation has resigned  and  he  is

still  holding  on. I think he is feeling  a  sense  of

guilt.  But  I would like to ask the Minister  who  has

been  responsible, if not the present incumbent of  the

post,  then  his  predecessor who has been  so  quietly

ousted  while the people of Singapore are revelling  at

the  Singapore  Constitution Exposition in  order  that

they  may not notice that he has been relegated to  the

Back  benches  of the Government to which  he  did  not

belong - to explain what the motif is. The point  I  want

to  make  is  that the purpose of the new  Constitution

should be explained to the people, in these new stamps.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas (Nominated):</b> I should like, Sir, to

speak  as one who has a great interest in artistic  and

cultural  matters. The stone lion which is featured  on

the  new  stamps  is appropriately called  "Singa".  He

derives  through  Indonesia,  probably  from  a   Hindu

origin.  But  he  also has what is to my  eye  markedly

Chinese  characteristics. In other words,  he  has  the

qualities of all the major Asian cultures which are met

with   in   Singapore.  He  is  also  a  very  charming

personality. He has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1948</b></font><br><br>



one paw upraised in goodwill, as though he is going to

shake hands with you, and a smile on his face; and he

looks a most happy and charming animal. I am sure he

will be a credit to Singapore, as representing a happy

fusion of different Asian cultures all in this one

territory.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> There are a series of six sets of

stamps, Sir. As I see from the note accompanying the

vote, there will be 10, 12, 20, 25, 30 and 50 cents

stamps. Surely we are not going to be entertained with

stone lions on all the six stamps?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I take responsibility for this lion, Sir,

since he was engendered in the days when I occupied the

Ministry. To the best of my recollection, he appears on

all the stamps with the same background but with a

change of colour. The background is what we call the

civic centre of Singapore. It is subject to

finalisation by the expert draftsmen who produce

stamps. The general principle is that you see the civic

centre of Singapore - the Assembly House, the Courts of

Justice, the City Council, and, I expect, a little bit

of the Victoria Memorial Hall as well.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, the hon. Member for Tanjong

Pagar suggested that there should be a stepping stone

now. What better stepping stone can there be than the

stone image of the Singapore lion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> It is interesting indeed that

from the stamps debate we have now been led to quite an

important political issue, and that is whether the

Lennox-Boyd Constitution is a stepping stone or should

it be advertised now, especially as the exhibition is

going on? The P.A.P. are very hearty supporters of the

Singapore Constitution Exposition in which they are

taking part, and they have extended an invitation to

even all the Mayors in the Federation to come to

Singapore to enjoy the Singapore Constitution

Exposition. That shows how much support the P.A.P. have

given to the Lennox-Boyd Constitution. At least to me

this constitution is not a stepping stone but a

stumbling block to building the unity of Malaya,

Singapore and the Borneo territory.

and   thereafter   an  additional   20   cents   of

entertainments duty for every increase of 50  cents

or  part  thereof  in  the  payment  for  admission

inclusive of Entertainments Duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members will recollect that in moving a

proposed   amendment   to   section   4   of    the

Entertainments Duty Ordinance early this morning, I

referred  to  a  resolution passed  by  the  former

Legislative  Council in 1951 under  section  4  (1)

levying half-duty in respect of live entertainment.

As  this provision has now been incorporated in the

substantive law, it will be necessary  to  move  an

amended resolution to refer to only the other types

of  entertainment on which the full existing  rates

of  duty are payable. The opportunity is also taken

to  clarify  the position of the liability  of  the

"Worlds" to full duty. There is no change at all to

the  existing rates. This resolution will come into

operation on the same date as the Ordinance. Sir, I

beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> I rise to second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, there are two points

arising   from   this  motion  on  which   I   seek

clarification. First, how much revenue is  expected

to  result  from this amendment; and  second,  what

other  forms  of  entertainment  or  amusement  are

intended to be covered by this new Schedule besides

amusement   parks?   The   purpose   of   exempting

entertainment  duty on cheap live entertainment  is

well  understood. I can understand  the  Government

wishing to go behind that raison d'etre and  trying

to bring the amusement parks within the province of

the  Entertainments Duty Ordinance. But  I  am  not

able to understand what other forms of amusement or

entertainment that could conceivably be  cheap  and

could  be  under  a dollar, and yet  be  worthy  of

putting a tax on.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, one point I would like to

raise   is   this.  The  Government,   because   of

unnecessary heavy expenditure, has indirectly taxed

the  public  in  one  way or  the  other  to  raise

revenue.  Instead of lightening the burden  of  the

poor  masses,  one excuse or another  is  given  to

raise taxes. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1951</b></font><br><br>



burden on the poor taxpayers is increasing. It is  not

right that if the amount of money to be raised is very

big  the  poor should be made to pay more.  Sir,  they

will  say  that  this  will  be  collected  from   the

admission  fees. But if the taxation is lower,  will

not the poor masses pay less for their entertainment?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the time for

general  election  approaches,  politicians   have   a

tendency  to  forget  or  understand  what  is   being

introduced  in this House. They try to make  political

capital  out of every move that the Government  makes.

On  the Second Reading of the Bill, it was pointed out



that  the purpose of amending the Entertainments  Duty

Ordinance is just to tighten up the Ordinance  to  see

that  the loopholes are properly blocked. There is  no

change  whatsoever  in the rate of entertainment  duty

that  is  to be levied under this motion, as has  been

levied   for  many  years.  But  there  is  just   one

significant  change. In the case of open-air  cinemas,

the entertainment tax is now reduced to half; that  is

to  say,  the operators of open-air cinemas  need  not

have  to  pay  the  same rates of tax  as  first-class

cinemas  and  other covered cinemas. In  the  case  of

amusement   parks,  they  have  already  been   paying

entertainment  duty, and the amendment  is  to  ensure

that they have to pay the full entertainment duty  and

not half.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Can I speak on that, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member has spoken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly pursuant to the provisions of

subsection (1) of section 4 of the Entertainments Duty

<div align="center"><h4><div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY</b></div></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>ELECTIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>11.26 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I have His Excellency the Governor's consent  to

proceed with this Bill. I beg to move, "That the  Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill follows closely the Local Government

Elections  (Amendment)  Ordinance,  1959,  which   was

debated  and passed by this House at its last sitting.

Except  for  one or two new clauses to which  I  shall

refer  later,  most of the clauses in  this  Bill  are

identical with those of the Local Government Elections

(Amendment) Ordinance, and I need not refer to them at

any  length  beyond stating that this Bill  implements

the  same recommendations of the Elias Commission with

the   object   of   eliminating  malpractices   during

elections. It provides for the preparation of combined

registers,  and  introduces  similar  provisions   for

compulsory  voting  and  the imposition  of  sanctions

against electors who fail to record their votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the other Ordinance, this Bill also makes a

number  of  amendments of an administrative character,

such as removing requirements for the publication



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1953</b></font><br><br>



in  newspapers of various election notices,  extension

of time for preparing the claims list from four to ten

days, and also provision for regulating the display of

posters  and  banners by candidates in respect  of  an

election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One new clause which is not included in the Local

Government  Ordinance is clause 3. Section  5  of  the

Singapore  Colony  (Electoral  Provisions)  Order   in

Council,  1958,  lays  down  the  qualifications   for

membership  of  the  first  Assembly  under  the   new

Constitution.  Subsection  (1)  (a)  of  that  section

states  that  the  candidate for election  must  be  a

citizen of Singapore who-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is of or above such age and

possesses  such  residence qualifications  as  may  be

prescribed  by  or  under  the  Singapore  Legislative

Assembly Elections Ordinance."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of this Bill now makes provision for the

age  and residence qualifications. The qualifying  age

is   put  at  21  years  or  upwards  on  the  day  of

nomination.   No  residence  qualification   will   be

required  for  persons born in Malaya, but  for  those

born    outside   Malaya,   a   Singapore    residence

qualification of eight out of ten years  is  required.

Residence  in  Singapore on the day of nomination  for

election  is made a further stipulation. I next  refer

to clause 7, which provides that persons who have been

deprived of their Singapore citizenship shall not vote

at  elections. This removes any doubt arising from the

fact  that under the existing provisions of the parent

Ordinance  persons registered as citizens  during  the

initial  registration  period were  entitled  to  have

their  names  included  in  the  Legislative  Assembly

electoral rolls for the forthcoming election by virtue

of such registration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 has also been drafted so as to provide that

before   the   Legislative  electoral  registers   are

certified, the Registration Officer shall from time to

time  expunge from the registers the names of  persons

deprived  of  their citizenship, notwithstanding  that

the claims and objections period has expired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 similarly provides that before

certification of revised registers, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1954</b></font><br><br>



Registration Officer shall from time to time on  being

informed   by  the  Registrar  of  Citizens  similarly

expunge names of persons deprived of their citizenship

during the period when revision of the registers takes

place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another clause, Sir, which I would like to mention

is   clause  15.  Clause  15  (b)  follows  a  similar

amendment  made  to  the  Local  Government  Elections

(Amendment)  Ordinance, 1959. Section 37 (2)  of  that

Ordinance goes further than the corresponding  Section

37 (2) of the Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance

in that the words - I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"or who, by reason of circumstances existing on the

day   of  the  election  is  not,  by  virtue  of  the

provisions  of  section  5 or  6  of  this  Ordinance,

entitled to have his name entered or retained  in  any

register of electors,"-



<br><br>are not included in section 37

(2)  of  the Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance.

It is therefore proposed by clause 15 to amend section

37  of  the  parent Ordinance in order to  bring  this

provision into line with the similar provision in  the

Local Government Elections Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17, Sir, provides for compulsory voting and

the  provisions  in that clause are similar  to  those

already  approved  in  the Local Government  Elections

Ordinance   with  the  exception  of  one   additional

provision,  that is subsection (3) of the new  section

41A.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The easiest, quickest and cheapest way in which to

prepare  a  list  of  those who did  not  vote  at  an

election, as required in subsection (2), is to use the

marked  copies  of the registers used at  the  polling

stations.  But  as  the Ordinance stands  at  present,

these marked copies have to be sealed by the Presiding

Officer immediately after the poll - section 46 (1)  of

the  Ordinance  refers - and they have to  be  counter-sealed by the Returning Officer immediately after  the

declaration   of  the  results  of  the  election   in

accordance   with  the  requirement  of   section   47

subsection  (9) of the Ordinance. The purpose  of  the

amendment in the new subsection (3) of section 41A  is

to  enable the Returning Officer to have access to the

marked  copies of the registers by breaking the  seals

affixed  by  the  Presiding  Officer  to  the  package

containing these marked



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1955</b></font><br><br>



copies, for the purpose of inspecting them with a  view

to  the  preparation of the lists of those who did  not

vote, as provided for in subsection (2) of section 41A.

The  reason  why  marked copies of  the  registers  are



sealed up with the other documents used at the poll  is

solely  for  the purpose of enabling a scrutiny  to  be

made  as  a result of an election petition. The secrecy

of  the ballot will not be violated in any way if these

marked copies of the registers are not sealed up.  They

give  no  indication of how any individual has in  fact

voted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendments I have just explained show the

important aspects of this Bill in so far as they differ

from  the  provisions of the Local Government Elections

(Amendment) Ordinance, 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Committee stage of the Bill I shall be moving

several  amendments of which I have given notice.  Some

of  these amendments are mainly of a drafting nature or

made  for  clarification purposes. I will  explain  the

reasons  for the other amendments, Sir, when  they  are

moved in Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would only like to conclude, Sir, by saying that

the  primary  object of this Bill is  to  ensure  clean

elections,  but the House and the public  must  realise

that  enacting  legislation  of  this  kind  will   not

necessarily  by itself solve this problem. Whether  the

law  is  obeyed or not depends basically on the respect

in  which  that  law  is held by  the  public,  and  in

particular  by  that  section of the  public  which  is

especially affected by these provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it becomes necessary to enforce any of the

provisions  of this law, the police will of  course  be

completely  impartial. But I hope that  in  discharging

this  difficult task, they will receive full assistance

and  co-operation from all political parties  and  from

members  of  the  public.  Action  by  the  police  and

subsequently  by  the courts can only be  remedial  and

cannot  in  itself  prevent the  disease.  Whether  the

forthcoming elections to the new Assembly will be  free

of malpractices will depend primarily on the respect in

which this law is held by all concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have on my table notes of certain

amendments  which  are to be moved,  I  understand,  in

Committee stage, and of which no notice has been given.

Perhaps, this is the proper time for me to suspend this



Assembly  to consider whether or not I should  give  my

consent  to  these amendments being moved,  because  in

giving  my consent, I will of course have to take  into

consideration  the  interests of the  minority  in  the

Assembly.  I myself have not had the time  to  look  at

these  suggested amendments and I am sure hon.  Members

would like some time to look at them, if the amendments

are  to  be moved today in Committee. Perhaps the  hon.

Member for Tanjong Pagar may wish to comment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> If I may, Mr Speaker, Sir, I had

indicated, when the Bill was tabled for First  Reading,

that  I would get in touch with the Government so  that

any  amendments  which  we  may  propose  would  be  by

consent.  Partly because of the urgent  duties  of  the

Chief  Minister and partly because of the  Chinese  New

Year  holidays, which caused two dies non - Monday  and

Tuesday - I  was  not  able  to  give  notice  of   these

amendments  which I had agreed with the Chief  Minister

on Saturday afternoon at 12.45 p.m. I had not been able

to see him earlier because he was away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have since this morning been in consultation

with  the Attorney-General as to the legal accuracy  of

these  amendments and, apart from one  or  two  further

provisos which he proposes to make to my amendments, he

agrees  with me that they would not dislocate the  main

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you feel, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the other Members

of  this  House  who  are  not  included  in  the  main

political  parties should also have an  opportunity  to

express  their  opinion, may  I  suggest  that  at  the

Committee  stage  they will have  full  opportunity  to

express  their  views. Alternatively, I  would  suggest

that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1957</b></font><br><br>



Committee   stage  be  taken  tomorrow  or,   if   the

Government so wills it, on the 3rd of March.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon. Members, of course, know the

Standing Order. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Notice shall not be dispensed with in the case of a

motion or in respect of any other proceeding for which

notice  is  required except with the  consent  of  the

Speaker and the general assent of Members present."



<br><br>I  think there has been no firm expression whether  or

not  the Government wishes to take the Committee stage

today  or  tomorrow,  unless the Chief  Secretary  has

something in view?



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, as far as Government is concerned,

these  amendments are broadly acceptable, but we  have

not  had the opportunity of looking at them in  detail

and  it  would  be  convenient, from the  Government's

point of view, if the Committee stage of the Bill were

taken this afternoon.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In that case, I suspend this Assembly.

I will take this Chair again at half-past two.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended</i></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of debate on Question, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it looks quite

unusual  for an Independent Member to rush forward  to

speak first on such an important Bill. Later on, after

you  have followed my speech, Sir, you may be able  to

know  why I have to speak at this early stage  of  the

debate on this important Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1958</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the mover of this Bill (the Hon. the Chief

Secretary) touched on the point of malpractices during

elections. Sir, I would like to say something more  on

this  subject on which I dwelt at great length  in  my

speech  at  the last sitting when debating  the  Local

Government  Elections (Amendment)  Bill  in  order  to

clear  away  the political apathy of this  country.  I

prefer  not  to take up too much of the  time  of  the

House but I would like to emphasise two points on this

question of malpractices during elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the people of Singapore think that only

those politicians who are prepared to accept money  or

any material reward are guilty of malpractices, but  I

think  it  is better to let the public know  that  the

question of malpractices is not only confined to those

corrupt  politicians  who receive  money  or  material

reward  like the acceptance of a few bottles of brandy

or  free transport during elections, but also to those

politicians  guilty  of  moral  corruption  and  power

corruption.  I  am  sure that  this  is  not  properly

understood  by  the masses because they  have  already

been   led   to  believe  that  only  the   Right-wing

politicians  are  corrupt  and  that  any   politician

professing   himself   to   be   a   Left-winger    is

incorruptible.  They are led to believe  that  such  a

person does not like cash gifts or a present of a  few

bottles   of   brandy  and  that   therefore   he   is

incorruptible. Sir, it is high time for the people  of

Singapore to open their eyes as to why they are to  be

compelled  to  vote. The public should know  that  the

Left-wingers  are  also  guilty  of  certain   corrupt

practices. They may have many secrets but those  close

to  them  know  that  this is no longer  a  secret - the

misappropriation of union funds. How are  such  unions

run?  How  are the accounts of such unions audited?  I

will not hesitate to lay the blame on the Minister for

Labour  and  Welfare whose duty it is to  check  every

union's accounts and to see that the hard-earned money

of  the  poor worker is not put to a wrongful purpose.

The  unscrupulous and opportunist politician  says  to

the  workers,  "Oh,  I  will  provide  everything  for

you - even the moon," and yet he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1959</b></font><br><br>



is considered an incorruptible Left-winger. The people

are  led  to  believe  that  all  Socialists  and  all

Leftists in this country are incorruptible. Sir, it is

high  time for the people to open their eyes that  the

malpractices  in elections extend to moral  corruption

and power corruption. If on the one hand we agree that

the  Right-wing  party  always  gets  the  support  of

wealthy persons and that it will therefore be able  to

provide  free  drinks,  free transportation  and  even

indulging in gangsterism, on the other hand, the Left-wing  party  organises  picnic  parties  where  for  a

contribution of 50 cents a person can spend a few days

in  a beautiful bungalow with nice scenery and receive

political indoctrination. Who are the sponsors of such

goings - on and where does the money come from?  Many  a

time I have emphasised this point. We believe that the

democratic  system  should survive  in  this  country.

Unfair political activities should be avoided. We  are

not  inexperienced to know that lies and  hatred  have

been  implanted  in the minds of the innocent  masses.

There  are  politicians  who look  after  their  party

interests  and  also their personal  glorification  by

saying, "Oh, I am the champion of the poor. I  am  the

champion  of  the workers." Such politicians  stir  up

emotional  feeling  among the poor workers.  And  then

hatred  is implanted in their minds. The rich and  the

poor are clearly divided in Singapore today, and while

these  politicians know too well that Singapore  is  a

commercial port and that if it has to survive  it  has

to  rely  on  the entrepot trade, yet they  prefer  to

destroy the economy of Singapore because they  do  not

want to lose the popularity that they enjoy as leaders

of  political parties. This is another form  of  moral

corruption. They cheat and lie to the masses by trying

to  create  in their minds a distinction  between  the

rich  and  the  poor. The people are told,  "The  rich

always  exploit the poor cold-bloodedly, and therefore

we  must  unite all the poor against the  rich."  Sir,

there  are many theoreticians and learned scholars  in

such political parties and they know the actual number

of  poor people in Singapore and because of this  fact

they realise that the easiest way of getting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1960</b></font><br><br>



votes  to put them into power is to cheat and  lie  to

these poor people. Sir, this is the most disgusting of

all political sins.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning we touched on the subject of the

Constitution.  The Member for Tanjong  Pagar  said  he

would  not be satisfied unless the Government  gave  a

full  explanation of why the new stamps  were  printed

with  pictures  showing  the  new  Constitution  as  a

stepping-stone to merger. Sir, I remember saying  that

the  present  Constitution is a  stumbling, block  to

building the unity of our people. Everyone of  us  has

to admit that the Lennox-Boyd Constitution has divided

Singapore and the Federation into two distinct  parts,

and  yet  we  talk of the unification  of  Malaya  and

Singapore.  What  about  the Bornean  territories  and

Sarawak? These politicians are only telling lies! They

do not tell the people that they only want to seek the

quickest  way  to step into power, and therefore  they

quickly make us believe that something is better  than

nothing  and  that they do not want to  be  the  Prime

Minister  or  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Negara.  Sir,  the

activities  of  all these political  adventurers  and

opportunists and those engaged in malpractices  during

elections should be restricted, because they tell lies

and they refuse to tell the truth to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now happy that the Singapore People's

Alliance - although it is called the Rojak Party, yet it

is very tasteful - has introduced this Bill in time for

the new Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill contains many detailed clauses on how

elections  are  to be carried out. I just  wonder  how

many of us here sincerely believe that every clause in

the  Bill  will be carried out truly and  honestly.  I

said  in  the  last  debate on  the  Local  Government

Elections  (Amendment) Bill that compulsory voting  is

the only hope to Singapore's stability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this Bill at least political Parties have

certain  assurances against malpractices. We will  not

continue  with such malpractices on a big  scale.  The

political  apathy of the middle-aged  and  the  middle

class will then be stirred at what happened during the

last  elections,  for example, the last  City  Council

elections.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1961</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to take this golden opportunity to

appeal  to all the journalists in Singapore  to  weigh

well  the  importance  of the coming  elections.  They

should  bear  in  mind that their  personal  political

inclinations and beliefs should be put aside, and they

should    make   an   honest,   frank,    just,    and

straightforward report, because this is going to  play

a  very,  very important part in the coming elections.

From  time  to  time,  we hear of complaints  in  this

Assembly - they are not new - that certain reporters  have

twisted the facts: when we say this, they twist it  to

that;  when we say black, they change it to white.  We

cannot deny that all the reporters or the editors have

a  right  to express what they believe. But they  must

also  bear  in mind that they are responsible  to  the

people,  and that fact is of vital importance  to  the

country.  Their reports are going to have a tremendous

influence  over the people. They might take  a  biased

stand instead of an unbiased stand. They might have  a

personal  admiration  for  a  certain  hero  in   this

Assembly:  and therefore when this hero  speaks,  they

give  a  large space in their papers to his  speeches,

irrespective of whether their hero's views  are  right

or wrong, and they even add favourable comments to the

views. And if they should dislike a certain Party  and

if  that  Party  speaks  on an  important  issue,  for

example, the issues on which the Minister for Commerce

and  Industry speaks from time to time,  they  do  not

give  him  enough  space for the  information  of  the

public.  They  simply ignore him. That  is  the  first

point - that  the  reporters  should  play  their   part

fairly, carefully and with responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the second point, I wish to appeal to the

workers  to  think, not only twice  but  three  times,

whether  it  is time for them to spend a  quiet  hour,

after  the last general election fervour, to think  of

our  economic  position today,  and  whether  the  co-operation   between   capital  and   labour   can   be

maintained.  But  all they have  done  so  far  is  to

continue  to believe in the irresponsible and  selfish

politicians who cheat them and lie to them - "You,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1962</b></font><br><br>



the  labourers, must unite and fight the capitalists!"

I  would  like  to divide the labour  force  into  two

categories - the  first  is  in  close  touch  with  our

political  advancement, like the  Army  Civil  service

workers;  and  the other, the industrial workers.  The

first category of workers think that they are going to

oppose compulsory voting, because compulsory voting is

against  democracy; compulsory voting is only for  the

benefit of the rich, compulsory voting is supported by

colonial stooges. And this Bill then becomes  a  waste

paper.  Why? It is because these workers have  already

been  poisoned in their minds to believe in  a  famous

slogan, "Drive the white men into the sea!" (the white

men,  of course, are the British). If so, what happens

to the rice-bowl of the over 40,000 Army Civil service

personnel? Who is going to provide for them? All these

workers  really  think that the politicians  who  lead

them with shouts of "Merdeka! Jatoh Orang Puteh!"  are

sincere  nationalists and sincere trade union leaders.

And also because the people who are going to lead them

condemn  compulsory  voting, they  themselves  boycott

compulsory  voting. Compulsory voting then  is  turned

into  a  class-hatred  issue - "Orang  Kaya  Punya!   ";

compulsory  voting  is only for  the  benefit  of  the

Chinese. Sir, this is one of the controversial  issues

which  have to be cleared. And if in future  elections

there   are  still  many  more  politicians   shouting

skyhigh, "Drive the white men into the sea! Down  with

capital!  ",  I  do  not  know  what  will  become  of

Singapore!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, come the other category of industrial workers.

I learn they are called industrial productive workers,

but  that term is not of much importance, because  our

industry is still in the embryo stage. Sir, this  type

of  workers believe that the strike weapon is the best

weapon  to  demand an increase of wages. They  do  not

believe  in  increasing the industrial  output  or  to

increase the enterprise returns, which ultimately will

give  chances  of an increase in their salaries.  Why,

Sir?  Again, because they believe in the irresponsible

and selfish politicians who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1963</b></font><br><br>



strongly condemn capital and who present to them a one-sided story that Singapore must be ruled by the working

class;  Singapore  must be ruled by the  farmers!  They

want  to follow China. The China pattern is on the land

reform - they promise the farmers, "You vote for me, and

I will give you plenty of land free!"; that, of course,

means nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third point is this: I especially would like

to  appeal  to  the  students. In this  Bill  there  is

provision   forbidding   any  registered   student   to

participate in any election campaign. But I still  feel

that  certain  political parties have to  use  students

because they are the nucleus of the people. The nucleus

of those political Parties is from the students, and so

the  Parties have to make use of them, to exploit them.

This  can be judged from the activities of the branches

of   these  political  Parties  in  Singapore.  And  we

discover  how the students are working in the branches - running night

classes and making home visits. Sir,  all

these facts add up to create an unpleasant and unstable

political situation in Singapore. The man-in-the street

always comes to the conclusion that the P.A.P. is  sure

to  come into power. That is the first fact. But  then,

Sir,  he is afraid of the second fact that follows - "Oh!

hari akan datang banya susah!" [the future is going  to

be  a  bleak one] - they have no hope in the future. They

know  it  is going to be bleaker and bleaker. Even  the

P.A.P. has admitted that the day will come within  the

next  few years when the people of Singapore will  have

to   tighten   Their  belts  and  to  expect   economic

hardships.  Why then should the P.A.P. come into  power

and  we  suffer  economic  hardships?  Why  should  the

standard  of  living of the people be lowered,  if  the

P.A.P. should  come into power? That is  the  question

before us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I wish all the journalists, workers, and

students  in  this  country - we call them  youths,  the

youth  section  is  the pillar of society - will  play  a

very, very important part in the coming elections,  and

carefully  consider why we must have  this  Bill,  what

causes the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1964</b></font><br><br>



circumstances which bring about this Bill, and what  is

the  benefit of this Bill. They must not be misled,  as

they  have  been misled time and again, into  believing

that  Singapore should be ruled by the workers and  the

farmers, that Singapore should drive away the white men

and  the capitalists, and we can then achieve political

independence!  How  many times  have  I  reminded  hon.

Members in this House that we have to rely on the whole

of  Asia,  the international repercussions in Asia  and

not only on our own people. Our future is in somebody's

hands.  We must frankly admit it! It is not a shame  to

admit facts, but it is a shame to tell a lie!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, since I may not make any more

speeches  in this Assembly, this is my last  chance  to

issue  my  final  invitation to  the  hon.  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar. Sir, from time to time, I have issued  a

challenge - I  want to tell the truth, I want  to  preach

love  - to  fight  the P.A.P., with their  preaching  of

hatred and telling of lies. This is the time for me  to

extend my humble invitation to the hon. Member to  name

any  ward  he  wants me to contest. While believing  in

love,  hope,  and  truth, I throw  accusations  at  the

P.A.P. for  their preaching of hatred and  telling  of

lies.  Therefore, Sir, I crave your indulgence to issue

my challenge.



<br><br>2.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. R. Lazarous (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  the  debate on the Local Government Elections  Bill

last  month in this House, I recorded my opposition  to

compulsory  voting. I see in this Bill that  compulsory

voting is again to be debated here, and it is therefore

fair  for  me to record my opposition here  also.  Last

month  I  quoted  figures and facts to  show  that  the

people of Singapore were not far behind in going to the

polls  as  compared  to  the U.K. elections.  If,  for

argument's  sake,  we admit that there  is  a  lack  of

enthusiasm,  that  a section of the  public  is  really

indifferent towards the question of going to the polls,

let us find out if such is the reason, and why such  an

attitude is shown by the people of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1965</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the reasons why a large percentage of the

voters  in Singapore do not take the election seriously

is  that Singapore is not an independent country. Those

who  are elected to this Assembly do not have the power

to  make  important decisions or fight for the interest

of  this  country.  At  present this  Assembly  has  no

control  over foreign affairs and defence. The Governor

and  the Secretary of State for the Colonies can  over-ride any decision that this Assembly may make. The  new

Constitution  of Singapore is hailed as bringing  self-government to Singapore. This is a big deception  being

preached to the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Legislative Assembly, under the new

Constitution,  will not have any more  important  power

than  the  present  Assembly has over foreign  affairs,

defence  and internal security, and those who  will  be

elected  will be powerless to do anything. The  present

power of the Governor will be shared between the United

Kingdom  Commissioner and the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara,

both  of  whom  will be nominated by the  Secretary  of

State   for  Colonies,  and  both  of  whom   will   be

responsible to him and not to this Assembly and not  to

the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that if we get real self-government, a greater

percentage  of  the  people of Singapore  will  take  a

serious interest in the election, and it will be  quite

unnecessary  to  force anybody to  vote  to  keep, the

machinery of democracy working smoothly. So long as  we

have  a  phoney  brand  of self-government,  it  is  my

opinion that a large percentage of voters will  not  be

seriously interested in the outcome of the election. If

we  get  self-government, the provision for  compulsory

voting will be quite unnecessary. The fact that  it  is

found  necessary to compel people to go to  the  polls,

even  under  the  new Constitution, is proof  that  the

present   Government  is  aware  that  the  people   of

Singapore have no enthusiasm for the new Constitution,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1966</b></font><br><br>



because,  other than providing for large sums of  money

to  be  given to the expatriate officers as  donations,

and  guaranteeing  that the local senior  officers  who

succeed  them shall enjoy the same rates of salary  and

privileges  as  their predecessors, it does  not  bring

about  any substantial change in the existing state  of

affairs.  For the reasons which I have outlined,  I  am

opposed  to  the provision in this Bill for  compulsory

voting   which  I  regard  as  quite  unnecessary   and

undesirable at this stage.

contest  does  not produce, too literally,  a  physical

contest!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was intrigued to see the Chief Secretary in his

explanatory statement at the end of this Bill make this

note:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is estimated that implementation of the

provisions of this Bill will involve expenditure of the

order of $100,000."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in fact the provisions of this Bill could be

faithfully implemented, both in the letter and  spirit,

then  I  say  Singapore has never spent a  more  useful

$100,000.  But  I  am sanguine enough to  believe  that

perhaps   the   greater  expenditure  of  men,   money,

materials  and  effort given to  the  referee  of  this

contest  can  ensure that the rules are observed,  that

the  main provisions of this Bill which we now seek  to

pass  will be honoured, or, if not honoured,  at  least

enforced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those who spend their time trying to prophesy

the outcome of a contest - be it a horse race or a boxing

match - usually   do   not   bother   about   the   final

performances of a race horse or a boxer before he  goes

into the ring. One looks at the long history behind the

contestant,  to know (1) his stamina, (2) the  fighting

qualities he has, and (3) the wallop that he packs.  On

that  basis  of careful calculation, one  could  fairly

predict,  if  it is a horse race, which  would  be  the

first three of any Derby or Grand National.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1968</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hate to disappoint Members in this Assembly, but I

would  like to remind them that, in fact, this  contest

has  been going on for the last four years, and  it  is

not  on the final playing of the gramophone records and

musical   chairs  which  are  being  enacted  in   this

Assembly,  and  outside,  that  the  outcome  will   be

decided.  For  four  years  the  people  have   watched

political parties gyrate and perform and politicians do

acrobatic gymnastics, and I would say that the bulk  of

the  masses have already made up their minds whose side

they  are  on, and, if I may put it in a more  positive

way, whom they believe will be on their side. It is  as

simple as that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Misled!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, different people have

different  reactions when faced with catastrophe.  Some

are  led to extravagant emotional outbursts in the hope

that  even if they are not big guys, by making  noises,

particularly  at big parties, they might  attract  some

attention.  There  are  those  who  believe  that   the

position  is  well  lost,  and  therefore,  since  this

Constitution is not worth having any way, what  is  the

point   of  it?  "Let  us  forget  about  winning   the

election."  But to those who are left with the  problem

of  not only winning the election, but carrying on  the

business  of this community, I would like to state  the

intentions  of my Party in unmistakable,  terms.  In  a

contest there is always a referee - unless it happens  to

be  a total war, and an election contest is not a total

war.  It  is war within limited confines, according  to

certain rules of etiquette and certain rules of conduct

which  the referee is there to enforce. He is a referee

with  a  police force, a civil service and an apparatus

of  state which is sufficient enough, in my opinion, to

be  able  to  administer the majority  of  these  rules

fairly and efficiently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Kallang by-election we had a foretaste of

what  happened when political leaders started to resort

to    unconstitutional   and   indecent   methods    of

electioneering. Two members of my Party were stabbed. A

Labour Front



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1969</b></font><br><br>



car  was detained at the Beach Road Police Station  for

two  months.  The  occupants of  that  car,  which  was

registered in the name of the Labour Front, were  never

found. The car contained bicycle chains and iron rods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect the Government, which will carry on after

this  Assembly is dissolved in March, to  maintain  law

and  order regardless of political parties and  to  see

that  the  rules are observed because this is not  like

Kallang where no government changed as a result of  the

election.  We  envisage a whole  host  of  difficulties

which will face the next Government, whoever wins,  and

it would be a pity if the next Government were to spend

its  first six months of office ferreting out gangsters

and  ferreting out police officers who, either  because

of  indolence  or otherwise, allow these  gangsters  to

operate;  because  with the result  of  this  election,

there  comes a change in the Government. If the referee

does  not wish to do his duty, then the next Government

will.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take the House briefly through the main

provisions? When we were debating the Local  Government

Elections  (Amendment)  Bill, I  did  not  consider  it

either  appropriate or desirable that we  should  argue

purely academic or hypothetical provisions which  would

never  be  brought into operation until a new  Assembly

had  been elected. But I do consider it important  that

every  provision  in  this  Bill  should  be  carefully

scrutinised,  because  we shall  be  contesting  within

these rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to tell the Chief Secretary and the

Chief  Minister  that  I am obliged  to  them  for  the

willingness  with  which they  have  been  meeting  the

difficulties which I have pointed out to them and which

will arise from the operation of these provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform you, Mr Speaker, Sir, that

the amendments which I have indicated to the Clerk this

morning  I would be moving, will not have to  be  moved

after  all,  because  the  Government  has  decided  to

postpone the Committee



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1970</b></font><br><br>



stage to the 3rd of March, rather than  adjourn

till  tomorrow and also carry on in that case with  the

debate on my motion regarding Malayanisation (it is not

so urgent, and we can keep it till next month).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also asked the Chief Minister whether that would be

our  last  sitting.  He  was unable  to  give  me  that

assurance, but I think we can safely predict  that  the

sitting  cannot  go  beyond the  month  of  March.  But

between  now  and  the sitting on the  3rd  March,  the

several amendments which I had intended to move at  the

Committee  stage  would  be formally  tabled  with  the

requisite two days' notice. Sir, I would just  like  to

inform  Members who do not belong to political  parties

what  these amendments are in order that there will  be

no mystery about them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first amendment concerns the parking of motor-cars outside a polling station, and the Government has

indicated its willingness to accept a clause to provide

that no motor-cars shall be stopped or parked within  a

hundred  yards of a polling station. Those  of  us  who

have  watched the motorcades on polling day  will  know

that   this  provision  will  relieve  the  unnecessary

congestion and the frictions that will arise with motor-cars  competing  for  pre-eminence  of  position  to  a

polling station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second provision, which is also by way of filing

up the gaps, is an amendment to ensure that no election

office  as  distinct from a desk  or  a  table  on  the

roadside - is  allowed to be opened within 200  yards  of

any  polling station on polling day. This is a  common

practice  of politicians who believe that the  presence

of  their  posters and their supporters will  help  the

voter  to  make  up his mind. It is their  practice  to

choose  an  election office which is near a school,  in

the  hope  that the school will be chosen as a  polling

station;  and so on polling day, particularly with  the

no-canvassing rule, they will be in a place of  vantage

from  which perhaps, if not by the roadside,  at  least

from the legal eyes, the precincts of the drawing room,

they  might  be  able to flutter their posters  at  the

recalcitrant voter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1971</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third amendment is to ensure that the use of cars by

those   who   own  them  should  not  be  abused   in   its

interpretation to become a means whereby it is possible  to

supply  motor-cars  to those who are  not  members  of  the

family.  Certain  amendments will be  moved  to  limit  the

meaning of the word "family" appearing in clause 23 of  the

amending Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final amendment is one which provides specifically

that polling day shall be a public holiday, it is only fair

to  say that the Government assured me that they would give

me  an undertaking, if necessary publicly, that polling day

would  be  a public holiday and declared to be  so  by  the

Governor under the Public Holidays Ordinance. But my  Party

has  thought  it appropriate that rather than work  on  the

basis  of undertakings, since we are legislating on minutia

provisions,  it  might be as well if we  included  such  an

important provision which is tied up with compulsory voting

and  no-canvassing on polling day - namely, that there should

be  a public holiday in order to enable everybody to go and

vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, first on compulsory voting. I have only this to

say  to the Government - that I do not think they have as yet

analysed  whom  they  are compelling  to  vote.  They  have

attributed  their defeats since 1955 to a lack of  interest

on  the  part of large numbers of people, whom they believe

to  be their supporters. Sir, I have always been told  that

the  art  of self-deception, if practised skilfully enough,

keeps   one  happy.  But  when  the  deception  is  finally

discovered, one is apt to be thoroughly discomfitted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind this Government, particularly the

Chief Minister who is no novice in these matters, that when

the  Progressive Party in 1954 and 1955 agreed to automatic

registration  of  voters for the then  Legislative  Council

which they dominated - as the new S.P.A. Government dominates

this  one - they  thought  they  were  paving  their  way  to

success. But they did not know whom they were automatically

registering,   and   to  their  great   discomfiture   they

discovered  that  the large masses who  were  apathetic  in

previous elections and who had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1972</b></font><br><br>



not  taken the trouble to register themselves, in fact were

against the Progressive Party. Because when they were given

the  facility  of  throwing their vote  for  or  against  a

particular  political party without  the  bother  of  first

claiming the right to vote, they cast it decisively against

the Progressive Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the next election there will be some 200,000

people who have been registered as Singapore citizens. Many

of them will be voting for the first time. It is a long and

complicated story how this came about. The predecessor  to.

the  present Chief Minister believed that he was  embracing



these people to his bosom in order that they would vote for

him.  I  will  say this. These people who have  been  given

citizenship are not fools. They are no different  from  all

the  others who reside in Singapore. We can be rest assured

that  they,  having  taken  the  trouble  to  register  for

citizenship, will exercise their right to vote and  we  can

be  confident that what has happened in the last four years

has not missed them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not seek panaceas by compulsory voting. But if this

Government  believes  that this is  the  way  to  cure  its

headache,  then I say by all means. But if  it  so  happens

that,  by  the much larger poll that will be created  as  a

result  of  this provision, the majority of the  successful

party  is  thereby increased, I can only say they have  not

been forewarned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a provision with which I am not altogether

satisfied, and that is contained in clause 25 of this Bill.

We  broadly know what its intention is. It says  here  that



the  principal Ordinance will be amended by adding  another

section. The content of this section is this:

<pre>

 "Regulations for    72A.-(1) The Governor in Council may make regulations

display of           to regulate the display of posters and banners in

posters and          respect of an election.

banners.               (2) Such regulations may provide for the Returning

                     Officer to determine the number and size of posters

                     and banners which may be displayed in any electoral

                     division and for the determination of the places at

                     which they may be so displayed."

</pre>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1973</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes on to define what a poster means, what a

banner  means; and then it says whoever commits  an

offence against such regulations shall be liable to

a fine of $1,000 or to imprisonment for one year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am anxious to see a set of these

regulations,  because  once  we  have  passed  this

Bill - we  will  have  empowered this  Government  to

enact  subsidiary legislation. It is only fair  and

desirable, even though we all believe we know  what

is   in  each  other's  minds  on  the  matter,  if

everybody  saw  a  set of these regulations  before

this  Bill goes into Committee on the 3rd of March.

We  all  know  that  the  idea  is  to  prevent  an

unnecessary  and  expensive and a rather  unsightly

poster  war.  This provision, like  so  many  other

provisions,  requires an administration  determined

to  execute it. I think the Chief Secretary is very

optimistic if he believes he can get away with just

$100,000.  I  think it costs quite a good  deal  of

money  to  get  people to scrub off  posters  which

might  have  been  unlawfully put up,  and  symbols

which  might  have been unlawfully painted.  It  is

important, if these provisions are to be  honoured,

that  we  make it worth the while of any  party  or

candidate  to  honour  them.  In  other  words,  we

penalise  effectively and smartly those who  breach

these provisions. To do that you need a whole  host

of  men,  not  only to detect any breach  of  these

regulations, but immediately to rectify it. Because

if  candidate XYZ belonging to Party RSPCA were  to

put  up  a whole series of posters on the  wall  at

some  unearthly hour of the morning when nobody  is

awake, and if his opponent woke up the next morning

to  find a whole wall plastered with these posters,

it  would be no consolation to him to be told  that

in  fact  whoever did it was committing an  offence

and  that  if he had been detected, he  would  have

been punished. So long as those posters remain  up,

they  will  be  an incitement to the  opponent,  or

supporters   of  the  opponent,  to   emulate   the

nocturnal  pursuits  of  the  supporters   of   the

candidate who first did so. Therefore, if we are to

make these provisions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1974</b></font><br><br>



effective, we must make punishment sure and certain

and  see that no benefit is to accrue from such  an

act. In other words, the posters should immediately

come  down.  For that there must be a host  of  men

with buckets and brushes and the necessary scrapers

to  see  that  all  the rules and  regulations  are

effectively implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I trust the Chief Secretary, with or without

the   assistance   of  the  Chief  Minister,   will

implement these regulations. We all know  that  the

Federation  Prime Minister has decided to  give  up

his  high  office in order to help  his  Party.  In

fact,  quite a number of people were dismayed that,

perhaps,  his  counterpart in  Singapore  might  be

stimulated  enough  to emulate this  great  act  of

sacrifice. But if the Chief Minister, in  fact,  is

to remain in office right up to polling day, then I

ask  him  to do what is only fair. If he  does  not

feel  that  he  can  effectively  run  an  election

campaign  and,  at the same time,  implement  these

provisions,  he  should at  least  not  impede  his

official colleague the Chief Secretary from  seeing

that  each  and  every one of these  provisions  is

honoured in its letter and in its spirit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, polling day - be it April, May or June - will

present  a sight completely different from that  to

which we have been accustomed in the past. To  many

it  will  be  a relief, because of the  unnecessary

expense and irritations from motorcades, of  people

running  around chasing everybody else up  to  cast

their vote, of crowds milling and gathering outside

polling  stations - all  these  will  be  gone   and,

perhaps,  for the better. Because finally,  all  we

want  to do in a fair and equal contest is  to  get

the  man  to register his vote. If these rules  and

regulations are honestly and sincerely implemented,

we will have a cleaner and better election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the election result is already

foregone, because the margin of the floating  voter

in   the  Singapore  situation  is  so  small  that

whatever  the  twists and turns  in  the  next  few

weeks,  it  cannot make any change in the  outcome.

This is not a situation where a shift of, say, five

per cent or two per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1975</b></font><br><br>



cent of public opinion could mean success or defeat for  a

political party. This is an endemic situation which we saw

emerge  from 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958 right up to 1959.  All

that  I  am asking this Government to do - when I say  "this

Government" I mean the originally elected Labour Front now

turned S.P.A. elected Ministers - is that if it has not  got

the  will  to  implement  it, at least  leave  it  to  the

Officials  whose  last act of service  to  the  people  of

Singapore is to make sure that the elections are clean and

peaceful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, Sir - particularly since you yourself will not have

the  unnecessary chore of taking part in a grisly contest - those  of us who emerge from this peaceful competition  of

political ideas and political records will be able to give

you in this Assembly, in any case for an assured statutory

period  of  a  year, a much more rousing and  entertaining

time.



<br><br>3.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I have very little to say on this

Bill as discussions have taken place on similar lines when

the   Local  Government  Elections  (Amendment)  Bill  Was

debated. Some of my friends on this side of the House have

spoken on the subject. Sir, I will go into the details  of

the Bill when the amendments are put forward either by the

Government or by the Member for Tanjong Pagar, but I would

like  to  stress this. As the most senior Member  in  this

Legislature, I think a public holiday is very essential to

enable  the people to vote. In the past, shops  were  open

and  sales were going on and many people did not vote.  In

the  coming  elections, it will be  compulsory  for  every

citizen  of  Singapore to vote. However, it will  help  if

polling day is declared a public holiday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Liberal-Socialist Party have already announced

in the Press that they are in favour of compulsory voting.

I have very little to say on this. The people of Singapore

will  judge the candidates contesting the coming elections

on  the past records of their Parties-what they have done,

whether  they have changed their Party labels and  whether

they have improved the economy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1976</b></font><br><br>



of the country. Sir, I have been watching the voters since

the post-war period and I think that they are quite shrewd

today.  They will not be misled by all that is  said,  but

they will go through the records of the candidates and  of

the  Parties standing for election and I am sure that they

are  not  going to vote for those who failed to carry  out

the task entrusted to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as far as supervision is concerned, I am sure the

officials  will see to it that the elections  are  carried

out  without  fear or favour. However, if  anyone  in  the

Government service is found not doing his duty, of course,

he will be responsible to the future Government. One thing

is  sure: the present Ministers will not be there  because

of their past performances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen, Sir, how clever some of the voters are. They

sit  in the cars provided by one Party and they vote for

another  Party  because  they know  for  whom  they  vote.

Fortunately,  today our voting population consists  mostly

of youngsters and they are quite clever people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some people talk of the Right, and others talk of the

Left.  Personally, I think Singapore's economy depends  on

entrepot trade. This can only be fed by capital and labour

working  hand  in hand in the interests of  Singapore.  No

ideology of the Left or the Right will achieve this as far

as  Singapore  is concerned. Singapore as a  city  has  to

stand  alone and has to formulate its own policy  for  the

sake of the people, and therefore it is rather unnecessary

to talk of Leftists or capitalists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present members of the S.P.A. who are ex-Labour

Fronters, have been co-operating with the P.A.P. for  3½

years.  Now all of a sudden, they say that the  P.A.P. is

bad.  Why  have they been cooperating? How is it that  the

P.A.P. have suddenly become bad during the last two to six

months? Why are they now separated? They have been married

and  divorced many times during the last 3½ years and the

Government  Benchers are still holding on  fast  to  their

seats.  Can the public swallow all this? They are now  too

clever!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1977</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, I have very little to say and I will speak

on the clauses when the amendments are moved.



<br><br>3.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as usual, I find

that  one's  kindness  of heart and one's  willingness  to

accommodate even one's political opponent can  be  twisted

round  to  mean  quite a different thing. The  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar, Sir, was a Member of the Select  Committee

on the Local Government Elections (Amendment) Bill, and it

was pointed out to him that what happened to that Bill, in

so far as the implementation of the recommendations of the

Elias  Commission was concerned, would be introduced  into

this  Bill  under discussion. He knew of it and  did  take

part  in  some of the discussions. All in all, he did,  in

fact, help with several amendments which were accepted  in

Select Committee and which turned the original Bill into a

totally different Bill. At that time, he did not think  it

was  necessary that the definition of "family" should  not

include grand-parents, grandchildren, brothers or sisters,

and that motor cars should not be allowed to park or to go

right up to the gate of the polling booth. He also did not

think it was necessary to move the two amendments which he

is  now  proposing. He thought everything was satisfactory

and,  on that unanimous note, we introduced amendments  to

the  Local Government Elections (Amendment) Bill  when  it

was  in  Select  Committee. But when the adoption  of  the

Report  was  debated  last month, he thought  it  was  not

necessary  even  to waste his time on  it  other  than  to

ridicule the Government and say that it was just  a  piece

of  legislation which meant nothing. It would appear  that

it  means something now, as he desires to propose  certain

amendments because the thought has been changed for him. I

am sure that it must have been changed for him, and not by

him, so much so that he was unable to table the amendments

in  good  time,  although this Bill was tabled  for  First

Reading  on 21st January. Maybe the driving force was  not

in  good  operation  until it was too late;  and  yet  the

Government, being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1978</b></font><br><br>



kind  and charitable even to its political opponent, said,

"Never  mind,  my  dear opponent, we  will  give  you  the

general  assent." The hon. Member then found that  he  was

unable  to get the consent or the general assent  of  this

House  and  yet  we  still  said,  "Never  mind,  my  good

opponent, we will defer the Committee stage to the 3rd  of

March."  When I was asked whether there would  be  another

sitting in March, I said, "I cannot say. There may be  one

last  sitting  in  March if we have some more  legislative

business."  But then he spoke in such a way as  to  deride

us. He wants a sitting on 3rd March, and I do not know how

many  more sittings there will be in March! I do not  know

whether  there is going to be a sitting in April.  But  he

says, "Surely they will not dare to go beyond March!" Sir,

I  have been hauled up by you many a time and I still call

it impertinence!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I beg to withdraw the word, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is not enough. I do not think

the  Chief  Minister ought to use the same word which  was

over-ruled at another sitting quite so deliberately as all

that. I think he should also apologise to the House.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I apologise, Sir, but sometimes one

gets roused! I think it is easier to deal with people  who

do  not turn and twist, and twist and turn! I cannot stand

that. Here is a man who stands up today and says, "We  are

going to win! ", and it was the poor Members on this side

of  the  House  who cleansed his Party and helped  him  to

become  strong  and brave enough to talk  in  those  terms

today. Such is politics! Talking of clean politics - psst!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he said, "This Government, particularly the elected

Ministers, will not see to it that there is fair play. Oh,

now  they  cannot be trusted. They will do this  and  they

will do that! They will do a lot of things!" Sir, I may be

accused of having done many things, but there is one thing

that  I  have  not been accused of and that  is  political

dishonesty. I do what I think is right and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1979</b></font><br><br>



I  do  not  care  what my political  opponents,  my

friends,  or even my family say. What is  right  is

right,  and  no  People's Action Party,  or  P.A.P.

leader,  or P.A.P. members can make me say what  is



right is wrong, or what is wrong is right!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Posters, banners, regulations! Sir, all these

were discussed in the Select Committee on the Local

Government  Elections (Amendment)  Bill.  The  hon.

Member  had,  in  fact,  quite  bright  ideas.   He

suggested  that there should be an equal number  of

posters  to  be  pasted in certain  areas,  and  in

certain  places  in every electoral  division,  and

that  the Supervisor of Elections should try to  do

all he could to implement what had been decided  in

that  Select Committee. Of course, as usual, as  we

are  very  accommodating, we  will  still  keep  on

accommodating.  In  fact, we sometimes  accommodate

snakes,  and keep them warm too! We will  let  hon.

Members  of  the Opposition see the regulations  so

that  they too will be satisfied that the  election

that  is  to come is clean, healthy and good.  They

need not worry about that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, compulsory voting is a very, very old

subject.  It  was brought up by representatives  of

various   organizations  and  by   individuals   in

Singapore,  who sent in petitions to  me  and  said

that  the  Government  should introduce  compulsory

voting. We were not satisfied, and in fact  I  said

at  the  sitting last month, when we were  debating

the  adoption of the Report of the Select Committee

on the Local Govermnent Elections (Amendment) Bill,

that  I was not satisfied that the introduction  of

compulsory  voting would be to the  benefit  of  my

Party.  But as good democrats we will always listen

to  the wishes and representations of the people of

Singapore!  That has nothing to do with the  Party,

and  because the people want it, we introduced  it.

Of  course,  the  hon. Member cannot  understand - he

would like to twist it. I am sorry - he would like to

make  it appear that it was the Government who want

to introduce it, that it is the Government benchers

who are anxious to keep their seats warm.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1980</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the people do not want me to remain here,

I  think  I will go to church and offer my  prayers

and  say, "Thank God! I have no more hairs to drop!

My  hair  does not go grey! And I do not go  to  my

grave  sooner,  and  leave  my  family  not  looked

after!" But because I felt it was necessary in  the

service of my country and of my fellow-men, I  have

to  carry  on and to bear it; not that  I  want  to

remain  here, nor do I keep on praying that I  will

be  here.  But surely I can say this:  it  is  good

psychology for any political party to say  at  this

particular  time, "We are bound to  win!"  I  would

like  to  say to the hon. Members of the  political

parties  that the S.P.A. is bound to  win,  and  we

will meet them there!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of the new citizens, Sir, it was this

Government's desire to give citizenship  rights  to

those  people  who have been resident in  Singapore

for  eight years or more. We fought for it, we  got

it,  and we gave it to them. But we do not  do,  as

some PAP, politicians have done, and that is to  go

round and say, "I give you citizenship now, and you

vote for me. If you do not vote for me, you jaga! I

will take off your citizenship tomorrow!" We do not

do  that, Sir. We never do that at all! If  you  do

not  put up my picture in a coffee shop, maybe some

inspectors might go round and do something. That is

logic.  Talking  of such things is not  clean,  not

healthy, and not good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of information?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> On a point of information,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Information? I am sorry, Sir,

because  if I give way to one, I will have to  give

way to another!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Chief Minister is not giving

way.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Because of the interruption

of  the  Member of the Opposition, I have forgotten

what I wanted to say now.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1981</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Honourable the Chief Minister

was in the coffee shops!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Oh, yes, I was talking about coffee

shops - and  the hon. Member for Changi has been frequenting

coffee shops! I am sure what he wanted to say was that  he

did see large photographs of the honourable -

I  do not think I would like to follow my predecessor who

calls someone, "My God the Mayor".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar then talked about

the by-elections in Kallang. He insinuated that the Labour

Front had been indulging in illegal activities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> A Labour Front car had been involved!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> A Labour Front car had been involved

and  he insinuated that because it was a Labour Front  car

the  Chief  Minister had instructed the Police not  to  do

anything about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said earlier, I can be accused of many, many

things-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> You do not know how-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I have never been accused of being

dishonest. Even if it were my own brother or my own father

who  was there, I would not raise a hand if the Police had

got  evidence. He described incidents that happened to his

supporters, but there had been many, many incidents  which

happened  to all supporters. We do not plead,  nor  do  we

cry. We take what comes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Like regular gangsters!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Then it is suggested that perhaps I

could  follow the footsteps of the Tunku and  resign,  and

all that. But is it necessary? The Government has to carry

on  under the Constitution until the next government comes

in-not that I would like to warm my seat at all. If it  is

suggested  that  I resign my seat, the wonderful  People's

Action Party then do not have a man



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1982</b></font><br><br>



as Chief Minister who is wise to the ways of

subversionists and P.A.P. tactics. Perhaps they would be

given free rein to keep on operating. Sir, I cannot al-low

the interests of Singapore to be jeopardised. I remain

until I am not wanted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the tone of the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar's

speech, it would appear that his is the only political

party that is keen on clean elections; his is the only

political party that has never indulged in malpractices.

And yet, strange to say, Sir, the Report of the Elias



Commission clearly indicated what the P.A.P. did during

the Tanjong Pagar by-election.



<br><br>3.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

glad the P.A.P. has said a mouthful! They want clean

elections. We all want clean elections. In fact, the 1948

elections that we knew were not as dirty as the elections

in 1955 and in 1957, when the P.A.P. stepped in. I like

the suggestion made by the Member for Tanjong Pagar - that

we must keep this country sane and clean, and see that

everybody fights according to the rules. This is indeed

very commendable, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the by-elections in 1957 and in the City Council

elections, I happened to be around Elgin Bridge observing

election campaigns, and I just want to point out a few

things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At those elections, we found that posters were pasted

indiscriminately. We found posters of Ong Eng Guan over

the bridge, under the bridge, right in front of it, and

behind it! In fact, Elgin Bridge being pasted all over

looked as if it was made of paper! Then I also had

occasion to observe students milling around with a zig-zag

sign over their heads; and crowding around polling

stations telling voters what to do, or telling them what

not to do! All these, Sir, are of whose making? I would

say the Member for Tanjong Pagar has found that all these

were not good; all these things done by his Party were

quite a sight, and he is now asking this Assembly to do

away



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1983</b></font><br><br>



with them. I agree with him, heart and soul, on

this! But I would like to see him observe all these

rules. I have a feeling, Sir, that all these rules

are made to be observed by all other Parties. And I

have a feeling too, Sir, that these rules may not

be observed by some Parties. Perhaps at the

Committee stage, the Member for Tanjong Pagar, as

the present head of the P.A.P., might give us an

assurance that he will keep to the rules. However,

I have a feeling that students will still be used;

posters will still be pasted - though probably not in

the way that the Member for Tanjong Pagar wants:

"You stick your own posters." Other people might

probably be used to put up the Opposition

candidate's posters to give him a bit of trouble.

But, Sir, if we all want to see the next elections

clean, I would say that it is not a matter of rules

that will make them clean. It is the determination

of all political leaders to see the elections

clean. If one Party does not start it, then I am

sure other Parties will do the same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point, Sir, I have been told times

without number that the P.A.P. are ever so

confident of winning the next elections. "Everybody

will fail, but the P.A.P. cannot fail!" I wonder if

this is just a way of hiding all the defects

within. I am certain, Sir, that the people of

Singapore already have a foretaste of what is to

come. I agree with the Member for Changi who echoes

what the people say: that if the P.A.P. win, the

future will be gloomy. In fact, everybody says, "If

the P.A.P. come in, there will be no future at

all!" And if people are of this opinion, I do not

see how they can ever vote them in!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is this: we are not go, ing to be

ruled just by students. We are going to have sane

people - people who have a lot of experience - going to

the polls to cast their votes. I am sure the people

will counteract their heartaches. I am certain that

the people who can think will exceed those who

cannot. I am also certain that those who are afraid

of the P.A.P. have been educated. They will know

that their votes are secret, and that they will go

to the polls without the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1984</b></font><br><br>



fear  that their attap huts will be burnt  down  if

the  P.A.P. candidate is not returned in the  Bukit

Timah  division! Certainly, Sir, all  these  things

tell  us that the wind is now blowing in the  right

direction and not in the direction the P.A.P. want,

indeed if they look into the picnics and the  adult

classes, and also the number of students who failed

and  who are helping them, the parents will not  be

happy, and they will tell their children not to  go

and   help   them  further.  Perhaps  the  students

themselves  will change their minds. I  have  heard

stories of education classes being conducted by the

P.A.P. Have they been doing good work? I have heard

many  parents  were  furious because  of  the  many

"marriages" to which they have had to give  consent

before  their time. In one area it is so  bad  that

all  these  "educational"  centres  have  now  been

classified  by  the  rural  folks  as  "matrimonial

agencies"!  I am afraid things have not been  going

right  all  the  time. I am certain the  people  of

Singapore are today fed up to the teeth,  and  they

want to prevent what is going on now, come to them,

should  the  Member for Tanjong  Pagar  occupy  the

chair of the Chief Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have had a lot of surprises, and my

greatest  surprise today was when  the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar, who is always anti-white and  anti-British, told us that he would like to see  a  good

referee!  And whom has he chosen as a good referee?

Not  the Chief Minister, or any other Ministers who

have  been  elected,  but the  Chief  Secretary!  I

thought  he  wanted to say good-bye to him  a  long

time ago! I thought he wanted to get him out of the

country a long time ago! But today he has revealed,

to  me  his  inner  desire  of  wanting  the  Chief

Secretary,  an official appointed by Her  Majesty's

Government,  to  remain here to be his  referee!  I

must congratulate him, Sir!



<br><br>4.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, to save the hon. Member for

Tanjong  Pagar the necessity of replying,  I  would

remind  the  hon. Member for Serangoon  that  in  a

general  election  of this kind,  it  is  only  the

officials  who can act as the referees in running

the election.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1985</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I endorse what the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar has

already said, namely, that this Government is prepared  to

put  off the Committee stage of this Bill to the 3rd March

in  order to accommodate him and his amendments. There  is

one  aspect of compulsory voting of which I would like  to

remind the House, since it was not mentioned either by the

hon. Member for Farrer Park or the hon. Member for Changi,

or  even by the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar, and that is

that  the recommendation for compulsory voting was one  of

the  basic recommendations in the Elias Commission Report,

in  order  to  assist in doing away with  the  element  of

intimidation  among persons who were not  recording  their

votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I certainly give an assurance to the hon.

Member  for Tanjong Pagar that we will do everything  that

lies  in  our  power to enforce these rules, and  we  will

certainly  not let expense stand in the way.  He  compared

this contest to a boxing match with a referee. But I would

remind  him  that boxers going into the ring, or  football

teams  going  on  to  the  ground,  all  do  so  with  the

determination to abide by the rules; and they accept those

rules before they go on. I would like to reiterate what  I

said  in moving the Second Reading, that by enacting  this

legislation, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1986</b></font><br><br>



shall  not  be  passing  the whole responsibility  to  the

Police Force to ensure clean elections. They will do  what

they can, and everything they can, to see that these rules

are  observed. If there is a breach of the law  committed,

they will take the appropriate action, but even then it is

only  with  the support of the public, and in  particular,

the  witnesses  to any particular breach  which  may  have

occurred  that  they can carry the action through.  But  I

hope  that  all Parties will enter the election  with  the

determination  to abide by these rules. In  my  view,  the

main  responsibility must be shared and shouldered by  the

Parties,  the  candidates and the public in ensuring  that

these provisions are effective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committee Tuesday, 3rd March, 1959.
