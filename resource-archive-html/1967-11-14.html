<div align="center"><b>QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE - SIN CHEW JIT POH</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Announcement by Mr Speaker)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have to inform hon. Members that I

have  received  a  complaint in writing  under  the

provisions  of paragraph (c) of Standing  Order  92

(7)  from  Mr  P.  Selvadurai,  Member  for  Bukit

Panjang,   alleging  a  breach  of   privilege   of

Parliament.  The complaint refers to  an  editorial

appearing in the issue for the 7th November,  1967,

of  the Sin Chew Jit Poh, a daily newspaper in  the

Chinese language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having considered the matter under the provisions

of  that Standing Order, I was satisfied that parts

of  that editorial, which is the subject matter  of

the complaint, prima facie affect the privileges of

Parliament  and that the complaint has been  raised

at the earliest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



opportunity.   Accordingly,   pursuant    to    the

provisions of Standing Orders, I have referred  the

matter to the Committee of Privileges.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>MALAYSIA-SINGAPORE AIRLINES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Staff recruitment)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister whether he is aware that citizens educated

in  the  Chinese, Malay and Tamil language  streams

are  not  given equal opportunities for recruitment

in  Malaysia-Singapore Airlines in the Republic  in

accordance   with  the  declared  policy   of   the

Government  of  providing equal  opportunities  for

citizens educated in the four language streams  and

that  advertisements for staff  vacancies  are  not

inserted   in   the   Chinese,  Malay   and   Tamil

newspapers, and if he will look into the matter and

take appropriate action to ensure that the Airlines

act   in   accordance  with  the  policy   of   the

Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajaratnam (Acting Deputy Prime Minister):</b>

Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  draw  the

attention  of the hon. Member to two facts  in  the

context  of  which the particular  problem  he  has

raised should be viewed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that the Singapore Government is

only  one  of  the  shareholders of  the  Malaysia-Singapore Airlines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is that the Company is run on a

strictly  commercial basis and that recruitment  of

staff should have relevance to the requirements and

efficiency  of  the  enterprise.  In  the   airline

business,  the  company and its employees  have  to

deal  with  firms  and  passengers  not  only  from

Singapore  but from all over the world. The  medium

of communication has to be one of the international

languages - in our particular case, English - if  the

M.S.A. is   to  hold  its  own  in  an  extremely

competitive  business.  Therefore,  there   is   no

question   of   discrimination  between   different

language  groups in the matter of recruitment.  The

criteria  is whether the candidate has the specific

qualifications demanded by the job.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for the information of the hon. Member,

there  are  nine senior staff and about 600  junior

staff  who have had part or most of their education

in  the  Chinese, Malay or Tamil language  streams.

Only a few days ago, one of the accountant trainees

selected  for  employment was from a  Chinese  High

School  and one of the two-system analysts selected

was a graduate from Nanyang University. Conversely,

a  number  of English-educated staff know  Chinese,

Malay  or Tamil as well. Since it is essential,  in

the  very  nature  of  the  airline  business,  for

candidates  to know English from whatever  language

stream   they  may  come,  they  should   have   no

difficulty   reading   vacancy   announcements   in

English.

<div align="center"><b>CIVIL SERVICE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Dismissal of Divisions III and IV officers on account of indebtedness)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. A. Gonzales -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr R. A. Gonzales</b> asked the Minister for

Finance (a) how many officers in Divisions III  and

IV  of  the  Government Service have been dismissed

during  the  past  twelve  months  on  account   of

indebtedness;  and  (b)  whether  consideration  is

being  or will be given to those with a long record

of  faithful service for further employment in view

of  the  social problem which can result  if  those

persons  are  unable  to  find  employment  in  the

private   sector  because  of  their  having   been

dismissed from the Service.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Sir, during the past twelve months, 34 officers  in

Divisions III and IV of the Government Service have

been dismissed and another two officers retired  in

the public interest on account of indebtedness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration is given to cases deserving of

sympathy,  but  in  almost all  these  cases  these

persons have displayed a weakness of character such

as  to  raise  difficulties in their employment  in

positions of trust.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>INCOME TAX RELIEFS FOR CHILDREN</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  the  reasons  for  the  continued  liberal

income tax reliefs in respect of children up to  as

many  as five, and if this is not inconsistent with

the Government's policy on family planning.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the policy is neither

liberal    nor   inconsistent   with   Government's

encouragement of family planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, relief was given for up to nine

children and the limit was reduced to five in 1965.

Further   reduction  in  the  number  of   children

entitled  to relief will not improve matters.  What

is  a  matter  for concern is whether  those  whose

incomes  are  below the taxable range exercise  due

care in limiting their family size to what they can

afford to maintain at a decent standard. Experience

in other societies indicates that it is the poorest

families  who  are most reluctant to  limit  family

size.

Foreign Affairs how many Singapore missions  abroad

have   been  established  to-date  and   in   which

countries.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in all, some 12

embassies   and  missions  have  been   established

abroad.  They  are  Australia, Cambodia,  Hongkong,

India,  Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Thailand,

the  United Arab Republic, the United Kingdom,  the

United Nations, and the United States.

<div align="center"><b>SEX EDUCATION IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for

Education  what  is the Government's  view  on  the

proposed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>



introduction  of  sex  education  in  some  Mission

secondary  schools  next  year,  and  whether  such

subject  will  be  introduced  in  other  secondary

schools.



<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Inche A. Rahim Ishak) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the Ministry of  Education  has  no

objection  to  the  proposed  introduction  of  sex

education  in  some Mission secondary schools  next

year   outside   the  regular  school   time-table,

provided  such instruction is intended  to  prepare

adolescents for a healthy sex life with due  regard

for its moral and ethical aspects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other secondary schools, medical officers from

the  Ministry  of  Health and  lecturers  from  the

Department  of  Social Medicine and  Public  Health

have  on  occasions  been  invited  to  give  talks

related to sex education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Ministry has no plans for

introducing  sex education as part of  the  regular

curriculum in secondary schools.

<div align="center"><b>ELIGIBLE VOTERS IN 1959 AND 1963 GENERAL ELECTIONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Number refused Red identity cards)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock</b> asked the Minister for

Labour the number of persons, who had been eligible

to vote in the 1959 and 1963 General Elections, who

have  been  refused  the  red  (Singapore  Citizen)

identity card.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, there are no records kept of  persons

eligible to vote in the 1959 and 1963 elections who

were  refused  registration  for  citizen  identity

cards. The Member for Ulu Pandan is aware that  the

previous electoral registers were compiled from the

counterfoils of the old identity cards. So long  as

a  person  is  21 years of age and above,  and  his

place  of  birth is shown as Singapore on  the  old

identity card, his name is automatically put on the

electoral register. With the re-registration of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



population  for the new plastic laminated  identity

cards under the National Registration Act, we  have

cleaned up our records and have determined who  are

citizens  and  who are non-citizens.  All  who  are

Singapore  citizens are issued with  the  new  pink

Singapore laminated identity cards.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock (Ulu Pandan):</b> Will the

Minister consider the approval of applications  for

citizenship  by  those who do  riot  possess  birth

certificates  but  who voted during  the  last  two

general elections?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> What those people who have no

birth  certificates  have to do  is  to  apply  for

citizenship  and  then submit whatever  documentary

evidence  they  have for the consideration  of  the

Registrar of Citizens.

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND MEMBERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Use of contributions as down payments for house purchases)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock</b> asked the Minister for

Labour  if  he will consider setting up a committee

to  examine the feasibility of allowing members  of

the   Central   Provident   Fund   to   use   their

contributions as down payments for the purchase  of

houses in order to promote home ownership among the

lower income group and to recommend such amendments

as  are  necessary  to the Central  Provident  Fund

Ordinance, 1955.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon.

Member's   suggestion  has   already   been   given

consideration before by my Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his information, there are 325,433 out of a

total  of  442,351 members of the Central Provident

Fund  who have a balance of less than $1,000.  This

constitutes  74 per cent of the C.P.F. membership.

Further,  254,880 members have a  balance  of  less

than  $500 in the Fund and this constitutes 58  per

cent  of  the C.P.F. membership. The C.P.F. records

also  show  that about 63 per cent of  the  persons

currently contributing to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



the  Fund earn $200 a month or less. These  persons

have  their  contributions paid in  only  by  their

employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the low balances held by the great

majority  of  the  members  of  the  Fund,  it   is

considered that no useful purpose would  be  served

at present to set up such a committee.

<div align="center"><b>WATER-BORNE SEWERAGE SYSTEM IN UPPER SERANGOON AREA</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. A. Gonzales -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr R. A. Gonzales</b> asked the Minister for Law

and National Development if he will indicate when a

water-borne sewerage system will be extended to the

Upper  Serangoon  area, which is one  of  the  most

densely  populated suburbs, so that the  people  of

that area can enjoy the amenity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon) (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, before I answer the question, perhaps

it   is  useful  for  me  to  explain  briefly  the

Government policy on sewage schemes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-term objective of the Government is to

provide  services  to the entire  island  Republic,

including both developed and developing areas,  but

for   practical  purposes,  having  regard  to  the

limitation of human and financial resources, it  is

necessary  to  plan out the development  of  sewage

schemes  in  different  phases  according  to   the

priority  of the areas concerned. For example,  the

developed areas at Toa Payoh, Jurong, Kallang Basin

and  other similar big new town developments  where

new  projects are taking place have to be  accorded

top  priority  in order that these  new  towns  are

provided  with  facilities in time for  occupation.

Priority is also accorded to areas on the basis  of

economic    returns,   such   as    the    Braddell

Road/Serangoon  Gardens Scheme. All  these  schemes

have,   therefore,  been  included  in  the  Second

Development Plan.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret to say that the Upper Serangoon area has

not been given priority for inclusion in the Second

Development  Plan. However, when the sewage  scheme

for  the  Serangoon area is completed by  1970,  it

will  be  further  extended to the Upper  Serangoon

area.  Therefore, the Upper Serangoon area will  be

considered together with some other areas  such  as

Thomson,  Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Timah  under  the

next Development Plan.

<div align="center"><b>(Progress of projects)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Lim Soo Peng</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National  Development what progress  has  been

made  in  each of the fourteen projects  under  the

Urban Renewal Scheme.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in keeping

with  Government's  policy of  encouraging  private

participation  in  urban  renewal,  14  sites  with

designated projects were offered to the public from

the 15th June this year. Tenders for the leases  of

these  sites closed on the 16th October this  year.

The  tenders received were processed by  a  Tenders

Sub-Committee  comprising officials concerned  with

the   technical  and  financial  aspects  of  these

projects. The Sub-Committee's recommendations  were

considered by a Ministerial committee of three  who

decided  to  accept seven tenders,  particulars  of

which are set out in a table* (* Appendix, cols. 401-2.)

which I propose, with your  permission, Sir, to

distribute to Members  of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Copies of the table handed in to the Clerk]

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Barker, do you anticipate

any supplementaries on this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I have not finished, Sir, but I will

be referring to this table shortly.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In that case, I will ask the Clerk

to hand copies of the table to Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Copies of the table distributed to hon. Members.]



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Members will see from the table which

has  been  circulated that the total  land  premium

offered  is  in  the  region  of  $8,728,000.   The

expected  total investment in these seven  projects

will  be  in  the region of $31½million,  and  the

projected   employment  of  persons,   when   these

projects  are completed, is expected to be  in  the

region of 3,650 persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our first exercise to promote

private participation in urban renewal has met with

an   encouraging   response   and   success.   More

important,  the  results have shown that  investors

have  confidence and faith in the stability of  the

economy of our island Republic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> What does the

Minister  intend  to  do with the  remaining  seven

projects?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, some of these projects, for

example, the three projects along the Golden  Mile,

attracted  no tenders. We think the main reason  is

that  these projects require capital in the  region

of  $10 million to $15 million. Our plans for  some

of  these projects are to get a group of - if I  may

call  them  - small investors together so that  they

can  combine  and  perhaps take up  some  of  these

projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add that the Government itself would be

happy  to  share and take part with  any  group  of

investors who may be prepared to group together  to

undertake these projects.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Can the

Minister  inform  the House how many  tenders  were

received for all the projects, and how many tenders

were received for each project?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> In all, there were 14 sites which

attracted  14  tenders altogether. The  14  tenders

were  only for 8 sites. In respect of the  other  6

not  even one tender was received. Shortly, for the

8  sites  which were tendered for, a  few  received

just  one tender, a few others two tenders,  and  a

few others three tenders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> Can the Minister

say whether the reclamation of the sea-bed opposite

the  Golden  Mile  will affect the  popularity  and

demand of the Golden Mile?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The Member for Joo Chiat has

something  in  what he says. I have said  just  now

that  the  main reason, we think, for the  lack  of

tenders  for the Golden Mile projects is  the  huge

capital required. But another reason is the one put

forward  by  the Member for Joo Chiat.  We  have  a

scheme  to  reclaim the sea off the Esplanade,  and

perhaps  this  scheme  is  frightening  away   some

investors  who would not like to put up hotels  and

then find that the sea has gone back by 500 to  600

feet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (Choa Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  is this then not contradictory policy on  the

part  of the Ministry of National Development?  And

what is the Minister going to do about it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I see no contradiction in the policy,

Sir.  One  is  reclamation, and  the  other  is  an

entirely  different project. When you  reclaim  the

sea,  you  get  valuable land. And if  these  sites

along  the  Golden Mile are not taken up after  the

reclamation,  we  will probably have  better  sites

along  the  sea  coast. As I have pointed  out  the

other  day to a Member here, reclamation  does  not

mean that the sea coast disappears.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Does the Minister agree that

the  incentives  were  inadequate  to  attract  the

public to tender for the other projects?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I disagree with the Member. In my

view,  the  incentives are more than sufficient  to

attract  investment  and, in fact,  the  incentives

that we offer are the best in South-East Asia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee) (for the Minister for Culture and Social Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read a  Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of the proposed amendment of the

Printers and Publishers Ordinance (Cap. 196) is  to

enlarge  the definition of "book" so that the  main

purpose of the Ordinance, which is to preserve  all

books  and  other publications printed or published

in  Singapore as part of the national literature by

the National Library, will be better fulfilled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the law as it stands, Mr Speaker, Sir, many

publications  are excluded from being deposited  in

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>



National Library. Such materials include Government

publications  which,  although  not   exempt   from

deposit  under  the Ordinance, have  sometimes  not

been  sent  to the National Library when  they  are

published  by  agencies other than  the  Government

Printer.  Similarly, under the existing  definition

of  "book",  annuals  and  other  reports,  whether

Government  or  otherwise, are not required  to  be

deposited in the National Library. As such  annuals

and   other   reports  are  important  sources   of

information which the National Library should  have

as  a  primary  source to satisfy the informational

needs  of the citizens of Singapore as well  as  of

outside   researchers   and   scholars,   the   new

definition  of  "book"  has now  been  enlarged  to

include  reports  besides Government  publications,

graphic art forms, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendment of the definition of "book",

thereby making the deposit of publications with the

National Library as complete as possible, will also

enable  the compilation by the National Library  of

the  catalogues of books published in Singapore  to

be  comprehensive.  And if  the  compilation  of  a

national bibliography, as provided in section 6  of

the Ordinance, is extended to all works printed  or

published in Singapore, it will not only facilitate

information  on current publications in  Singapore,

but   will  also  provide  welcome  assistance   to

booksellers,  publishers,  printers,  authors,  and

librarians  both  in Singapore and other  countries

which   have   a  growing  interest  in   acquiring

Singapore publications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has also been found that although the

Ordinance puts the onus on the publisher to  submit

printed  publications  or  books  to  the  National

Library, there is in the existing law no definition

of the term "publisher". This omission has now been

rectified  by providing a definition of "publisher"

in clause 2 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new definition of "book" to include all

publications, and in consideration of the publisher

who  may  sometimes  publish a  limited  number  of

copies of a particular work, clause 3



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



of the Bill reduces to five the number of copies of

a  publication  to be deposited,  as  there  is  no

longer a need to send a copy of such publication to

the British Museum as has hitherto been done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enable quicker registration of publications

and    subsequent   listing   in    the    national

bibliography, clause 5 of the Bill amends section 6

of  the  principal Ordinance so that the  publisher

will  furnish  details  of  publications  deposited

within  two weeks of deposit, instead of one  month

as under the existing law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequent on clause 4 of the Bill reducing the

number of copies of every book or publication to be

deposited under the Ordinance to five, clause 6  of

the Bill amends section 7 to delete the requirement

of  sending catalogues of books to the Secretary of

State and to the Trustees of the British Museum, a.

practice  dating  back to old  colonial  times  but

which is no longer necessary with our new status as

an independent nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, to encourage greater speed on the

part of publishers in depositing their publications

in  the National Library and to provide details  of

publications deposited within two weeks of  deposit

instead  of one month, clause 7 of the Bill  raises

the  penalty for non-compliance with the provisions

of the Ordinance from $500 to $1,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Fong Sip Chee].

<br><br>3.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill seeks to amend the

Singapore  Parliament Elections Ordinance,  Chapter

53,  to  provide for the preparation of  the  first

registers  of electors from the register maintained

by the Commissioner of National Registration and to

include  in such electoral registers the  names  of

all  entitled persons who were on the first day  of

July   1967  citizens  of  Singapore  and  to  whom

identity cards were issued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present registers of electors were first

compiled  nine years ago in 1958. In the past,  any

person  who possessed an identity card showing  his

place of birth as Singapore, and who was ordinarily

resident  in Singapore on the first day of February

in  any year and was not less than 21 years of  age

on  the  first  day  of  July  of  that  year,  was

automatically   included  in   the   registers   of

electors. In the recent re-registration of persons,

it  was discovered that a number of identity  cards

had  been forged. Further, a number of persons with

identity  cards  showing their place  of  birth  as

Singapore  were not given citizen's identity  cards

due to insufficient proof of Singapore citizenship.

For these reasons, fresh registers of electors have

to   be  compiled.  The  fresh  registers  will  be

compiled from the records of citizens maintained by

the  Commissioner of National Registration and will

include  only  those entitled persons  who  on  the

first  day  of July 1967 were citizens of Singapore

and  to whom identity cards were issued. This would

mean  that  those  persons  whose  names  had  been

expunged  from the registers since 1959  under  the

provisions  relating  to compulsory  voting,  other

than  those  who  are now dead  or  have  left  the

country, will have their names restored in the  new

registers,  as  they will be in possession  of  new

citizen's identity cards. It is hoped that with the

restoration  of  their names to  the  registers  of

voters



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



without penalty, these citizens will exercise their

civic duty of voting in the elections in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the provision remains in the Ordinance

to  expunge the names of electors who fail to  vote

at  any election, and to restore their names to the

registers of electors only after payment of a  fine

of   $5.   If   this  measure  proves   inadequate,

Government   will   consider  amendments   to   the

Ordinance   to   remove   certain   privileges   of

citizenship.  For example, it may be provided  that

anybody  seeking  a Housing Board  flat  or  social

welfare  relief  or  a place in  school  for  their

children, may in future have to show that they have

performed  their  civic  duty  of  voting  in   the

elections  and  keeping their names  alive  in  the

electoral registers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for the revision of the

registers in each year following the year  1967  to

be  completed  before the 31st day of  December  in

that  year.  Past  experience has  shown  that  the

deadline  of  15th September for the completion  of

the  annual revision of the electoral registers  is

impracticable. The proposed amendment will  obviate

the  necessity  for reference to  be  made  to  the

Minister  each year for permission to  certify  the

registers  on or before the 31st December  of  that

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will also make it an offence for any

person  to  dissuade electors from  voting  between

Nomination Day and Polling Day at any elections. At

present  such dissuasion is an offence only  if  it

takes  place on Polling Day. The amendment provides

the  same  penalty for the offence as that provided

in the Singapore Parliament Elections Ordinance for

canvassing on Polling Day. Power is given to police

officers to enter and search any premises or  place

in  which  they believe that the offence  is  being

committed, and to arrest without warrant any person

committing the offence in their presence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during the Bukit Merah by-election in January 1966, members of a certain

political  Party went from house to  house  in  the

constituency between Nomination Day and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



Polling  Day attempting to persuade the  electorate

to  cast  blank  or spoilt votes. Similar  attempts

were  made  in  the subsequent Thomson by-election.

Similar   attempts  will  no  doubt  be   made   by

subversive  elements in future  elections.  It  is,

therefore, necessary that provision should be  made

to   ensure   that  every  citizen  is  given   the

opportunity  of  casting his vote without  fear  or

interference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the repeal of the Registration of Persons

Ordinance,  1955,  and  its  substitution  by   the

National Registration Act, 1965, the Bill seeks  to

amend  all  references in the Singapore  Parliament

Elections Ordinance relating to the Registration of

Persons  Ordinance, 1955, to that of  the  National

Registration   Act,  1965,  and  to  make   certain

amendments connected with the identity cards issued

under the National Registration Act of 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has been taken to revise some of

the  forms in, and to make certain other amendments

to,  the  Singapore Parliament Elections  Ordinance

with  a  view  to  achieving  greater  clarity  and

explicitness  in  the  expressions  used   in   the

Ordinance    and   thus   providing   for    better

administration of the provisions of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I fully support  the  Singapore

Parliament Elections (Amendment) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, undoubtedly the introduction of this Bill at

the previous sitting has been most timely. This  is

in  keeping  with the present situation because  we

know  that in the past ten years the conditions  in

our  population and society have been far different

from   those   obtaining   before.   According   to

statistics, there were 1,445,900 persons  in  1957,

but  there  are  1,939,000 persons now  -ten  years

later.  This  is  an increase of  500,000  persons.

According  to the latest statistics, the number  of

electors  in  1959 was 555,655.  In  1963,  it  was

635,782;  in 1966, it was 708,316. At present,  the

number of electors is ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Teong, I am having some doubts

about  the relevancy of your speech. What  you  are

saying  may  perhaps be more relevant to  the  next

Bill on the Order Paper.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, if that

is  the case, I will say something briefly on  this

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this Bill is very timely and is in

keeping  with the present situation, because  there

have  been a lot of changes in our country. I  also

feel  that  after  the amendment Bill  relating  to

citizens  is  passed,  the number  of  citizens  in

Singapore  will be known definitely so  that  every

general    election   will   be   conducted    more

successfully and smoothly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I support this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I just want to bring out one or two points  on

this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I believe that in principle this is a

logical development from the compulsory voting that

we have in Singapore, I am not very happy about the

way  in  which clause 9 of this Bill in respect  of

section 78A (1) is drafted. The words that I  refer

to  are found in the last but one sentence - "  ...

attempt to dissuade any person from giving his vote

at  the  election." This may prevent a person  from

appealing to the voters not to cast their votes  at

elections, but it may not really stand in  his  way

of  asking  them to go into the polling booths  and

cast   their  votes  for  all  candidates,  thereby

spoiling  the  votes.  Technically,  that  may   be

considered  as giving a vote to some  candidate  at

the  election itself, or you can even appeal to the

voters to go into the polling booths and spoil  the

votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if this point can be looked into so that

the  prohibition  that  this  amendment  seeks   to

introduce is comprehensive indeed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I have nothing further to add except

to assure the Member for Bukit Panjang that we will

consider his proposal. But for the moment, I intend

to   take   the   Bill  through  as  presented   in

Parliament.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 9 stand

part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

clarification from the Minister on the new  section

78A  (4)  in clause 9 of the Bill. Section 78A  (4)

reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any police officer may arrest without warrant

any person offending in his view against any of the

provisions of this section and take him as soon  as

practicable before a Magistrate's Court to be dealt

with according to law.'.



<br><br>The  words  I wish clarification on appear  in  the

second line - "in his view". Does this phrase  mean

"in the opinion" or "in the presence" of the police

officer?  Can  the  Minister  clarify  it  and,  if

necessary,  amend this new sub-section to  make  it

clearer? Reading the subsection as a whole, I think

it should be "in his presence".



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not prepared

at  this stage to change "view" to "presence".  The

Ordinance  has been drafted by the law officers  of

the   Attorney-General's  Department.  Should   the

Member  be  correct in his submission, I will  come

back  to Parliament and move the amendment.  But  I

think he is well aware that though I am moving this

Bill,  it  is a Bill that has been looked after  by

the  Deputy  Prime  Minister. It has  obtained  his

blessing and I am not prepared at this stage, as  I

have said, to move the amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>

to  clarify? He has asked me a question and I  have

answered it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Can the Minister clarify

whether  the  words  "in his  view"  mean  "in  his

opinion" or "in his presence"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The phrase includes the meaning "in

his presence". It is for the Courts to construe the

meaning,  and  if  they  construe  "view"  to  mean

"opinion" and we are wrong, we will come back.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the sitting of Parliament on the 31st October,

Government announced in a White Paper (Cmd.  22  of

1967) the acceptance of the recommendations of  the

Electoral  Boundaries  Delineation  Committee  with

regard    to   the   subdivision   of   10    large

constituencies   and  the   creation   of   8   new

constituencies with consequential adjustments to  3

constituencies,  and  the  decision  to  merge  the

electoral  division of Southern  Islands  with  the

electoral  divisions of Jurong, Pasir  Panjang  and

Telok Blangah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for Government's acceptance of the

recommendations   of   the  said   Committee   were

explained in the White Paper. The boundaries of the

present 51 electoral divisions were demarcated in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



1957  and have remained unchanged for the  last  10

years. Due to major housing developments and  urban

renewal and large population shifts, the population

ratios  in the 51 constituencies have become  quite

disproportionate, and to ensure that there is  more

equal  representation throughout all constituencies

in  the  Republic,  the 10 largest  constituencies,

with  an  electorate of more than  18,000  electors

each,  have  been  subdivided,  resulting  in   the

creation of 8 new constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deciding to merge Southern Islands with the

mainland  electoral  divisions  of  Jurong,   Pasir

Panjang  and Telok Blangah, the Government  had  in

mind  the  desirability of eliminating the tendency

for   the  Islands  to  develop  into  an  isolated

constituency.  This  division  has   a   very   low

electorate, namely, 4,273 electors, and this number

is  likely to dwindle when more people shift to the

city.  These Islands would have a better chance  of

achieving  a  quicker  rate  of  development  after

merger  with  the more developed constituencies  of

Jurong, Pasir Panjang and Telok Blangah, as in  the

case  of the islands of Pulau Tekong and Pulau Ubin

in the constituency of Changi.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of electoral divisions will be

increased  from the present 51 to 58. The Singapore

Parliament  Elections Ordinance (Cap. 53)  provides

that  each  electoral  division  shall  return  one

Member to serve in Parliament. The Constitution  of

Singapore stipulates a Parliamentary membership  of

51   until   other  provision  is  made   by   law.

Accordingly,  it  is necessary for  a  Bill  to  be

passed to provide for an increase in the number  of

elected Members to Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Membership Bill provides that so much of clause (1) of Article 23 of the Constitution of Singapore as prescribes a limit of 51 on the number of elected Members shall cease to have effect, and that as from the time of the election of Members to serve in Parliament at the

next  general  election, and hereafter  until  such

time  as other provision is made by law, Parliament

shall consist of 58 elected Members.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also provides that, for the purposes of

the  next general election, power is given for  all

things  to  be done under the Singapore  Parliament

Elections   Ordinance  as  if  Parliament   already

consisted of 58 elected Members. This would  enable

various  matters to be carried out for the purposes

of  the  next  general elections; for example,  the

naming   and  delineation  of  the  boundaries   of

electoral divisions by notification in the  Gazette

under   section  8  of  the  Singapore   Parliament

Elections Ordinance, and the exhibition of the 1967

registers  of electors for public inspection  under

section 10 of the same Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in my opinion, the White

Paper  which  was introduced in this Parliament  on

31st  October last is very fitting in  the  present

situation  in  Singapore. Although Singapore  is  a

small   country,  the  number  of  inhabitants   is

proportionately large, consisting of various  races

and religions. I feel that the demarcation of every

constituency should not be based on the size of the

area but on the number of inhabitants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore has become the centre of attention

of  many  countries, it can be said that  Singapore

can  be likened to a beautiful woman who has caused

others  to  be  mad about her and people  of  other

countries  have  left  their  homes  to  stay  here

forever.  One  of  the  responsibilities   of   the

Government   of   Singapore  is  to   give   social

assistance,  and as such constituencies  should  be

changed to increase the Parliamentary membership in

order to balance the number of inhabitants with the

constituencies from time to time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Member of Parliament does not only

represent his constituency but also the inhabitants

of  that  constituency. Also, he has not  only  the

responsibility



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



to  attend  sittings  of Parliament  but  also  the

responsibility to help solve whatever  difficulties

his constituents are faced with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain political Parties which use

constituencies as a stepping stone to obtain  seats

for  their candidates in Parliament where they  can

boast  and behave like heroes but meantime ignoring

the  fate  of their constituents. This had happened

before the P.A.P. came to power, especially in  the

Geylang  Serai  constituency. I  believe  that  the

candidates of these political parties who were  not

elected  to  Parliament in the last  elections  are

rather anxious about their future because of  these

changes.  They  know  that they  do  not  have  the

support  of  the people and therefore their  future

might be worse off than what they were in the  last

elections.  That  is why all this while  they  have

been  saying  all sorts of things  to  confuse  the

minds   of  the  people,  particularly  after   the

announcement  of this White Paper on  31st  October

last.  The tactics which they have carried out  are

the  same  as those of the Malayan Communist  Party

during  the Emergency, and it is possible  that  we

here would also be anxious if the Malayan Communist

Party were also present in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for the good of the people, we should be

firm in facing this situation. Considering the ever-

increasing  number of our population, the  increase

of  Parliamentary constituencies is also necessary.

This   is  to  improve  the  work  of  Members   of

Parliament   in  their  respective  constituencies.

Constituencies  in  Singapore  are  different  from

those in Malaysia which consist of jungle areas and

inhabited  by  wild animals, with  very  few  human

beings living there. But in Singapore the situation

is different because our constituencies are full of

housing estates accommodating all races. This is  a

big  problem for Singapore and should be  borne  in

mind  by the people and the political Parties. They

should  not  work  for personal gain  but  for  the

prosperity and safety of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the recent changes in Singapore and

the increase in population as time goes by, I

support this White Paper.

<br><br><!-- Dr Chew Chin Han -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chew Chin Han (Tampines)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, in the past few years because of  the

increase in industrial development and the  renewal

of  the urban areas, there has been an increase  or

shift  in population in our country. In some places

there  are  less people because they have  gone  to

other  housing estates, and in some areas,  because

of  the former demarcation of constituencies, there

is  some inequality. Now we are going to divide the

State  into 58 constituencies. It is proper  to  do

so.  The division into 58 constituencies will  make

our  work as Members of Parliament easier and  more

effective.  We must know that Members of Parliament

are  elected  not  just  for politics.  Their  main

purpose  is  to  serve  the people.  Otherwise  the

people    will   not   support   them.   So    more

constituencies will mean that we have more  Members

of  Parliament to serve the people better.  Someone

has  asked, why is it necessary to divide the State

into   58   constituencies?  Is  it  for  political

interests?  Or for what interest? What  we  say  is

that  the  division  into 58 constituencies  is  to

enable  the Members of Parliament serve the  people

better.  For  the  past few years the  standard  of

political  consciousness of  the  people  has  been

raised under the present Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone has said that having more constituencies

will   mean   more  expenditure.  Our  Members   of

Parliament  get the lowest allowance in the  world.

Therefore, an increase of seven Members will mean a

very  little extra expenditure. Therefore,  I  hope

that,    in    addition   to   the   increase    in

constituencies, the number of Ministers should also

increase so that they will serve the people  better

and more efficiently.



<br><br>3.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I fully

support the Parliamentary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



Membership   Bill.  The  history  of  parliamentary

democracy in our country is not long. It is only 12

years.  Since 1955 there have been only  local  and

partial  elections. But judging  from  the  healthy

manifestation  of  progress  of  our  parliamentary

democracy, we are not less democratic compared with

any other country. The success of our parliamentary

democracy  is due to two basic factors. First,  our

citizens  have a rather high standard of  political

consciousness and they understand the true  meaning

of democracy. Second, in recent years, the Party to

which  I  belong  has  made great  achievements  in

nation-building and in various other spheres. As  a

result, the voters have more faith in democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the increase in

constituencies,  I feel that it  is  very  apt  and

proper. As I have just pointed out, there has  been

a great increase in our population, and accordingly

there  are  more  voters. Judging  by  our  present

achievements  in  housing  and  other   fields   of

activity,  we  have  made great changes  in  recent

years.  At  the moment, we have quite a  number  of

satellite  towns,  such  as  Queenstown,  Aljunied,

Kallang,  and  Toa Payoh. Hence, the population  in

certain  areas  has  increased.  So  if  today  our

constituencies have the same boundaries, will  that

be  in keeping with our present changes? In certain

constituencies  there  will  be  more  voters.  For

instance, in Queenstown at present there  are  more

than 100,000 residents, but the number of voters in

the last elections was 40,000. In Mountbatten there

were  28,000  voters. In Delta  there  were  26,000

voters.  Because  of the shift in population,  some

constituencies  will  have  more  voters,   whereas

others  will  have less. For instance, in  Geylang,

Crawford  and Havelock, the population  is  crowded

there.  If  we do not make any adjustments  in  the

boundaries  of the constituencies, we  may  not  be

able to serve the people better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ours is a non-Communist democratic country.

We  have  an enlightened policy of equal  treatment

for  all  streams of education and all races.  This

policy  has  welded our races together and  is  the

basic factor in our nation-building.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



I  believe we will soon set a very good example  in

South-East   Asia  as  a  democratic,  multi-racial

country. We will also set a leading example to  all

the multi-racial countries in the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now consider certain views expressed

by  some  of the Opposition Parties. I think  their

views  are not constructive. For instance, U.M.N.O.

have  said that the Government has not allowed them

any  time  to express their opinions. This  is  not

true, because in a democratic country everybody has

the  right  of  free speech. Whether or  not  their

views  will  be  accepted by  the  Government  will

depend on whether they are constructive and whether

they  meet  the wishes of the people. For instance,

certain  political parties want us to do away  with

parliamentary democracy. They do not  want  general

elections. Does it mean that we are bound to accept

their  anti-national policy or views? I  would  ask

them  whether they have the interest of the  people

at  heart,  or whether they are just making  noises

before   the  general  elections,  and   when   the

elections  are over they will take to their  heels.

They  will close up their party offices. Our people

know these adventurers very well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Chinese Party has suggested five

points,  one of which is to ask when the Government

will  hold general elections and also to give  them

sufficient  time to prepare themselves. This  would

set the people guessing as to their true intention.

But  these people should not forget their past evil

records which are well known. The people know  they

are  adventurers. They cannot fool all  the  people

all the time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Alliance Party, this is a Party

that  was  discarded by the electorate in the  1959

and 1963 elections. So their policy is not new. One

of  their  requests is to prolong  the  period  for

campaigning  in the general elections.  They  think

that  by  this they can get more people to  support

them.  I  would say that they are day-dreaming.  We

know  that the support which a political party  can

get from the voters depends on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



whether  they have served the people well and  have

an  efficient  democratic system. In  other  words,

basically  the question is whether they  have  come

close  to the people and have helped them to  solve

their problems and difficulties. If they have  done

so, then when the general elections come along, the

people  will  vote for them on the basis  of  their

record. If certain political parties normally close

up their offices for the most part of the year, and

in  their branches not anyone of their members  can

be  found, how can they expect anybody to vote  for

them? Naturally the masses will cast their votes in

such  a  way as to wipe off such political  rubbish

from  the political scene, such as the Lim Yew Hock

regime and the anti-national elements -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Teong, I am afraid you

are  getting away from the scope of this Bill.  The

purpose  of  the Bill is to increase the membership

of  Parliament from 51 to 58, and what Tun Lim  Yew

Hock  did in the past has nothing whatsoever to  do

with this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, thank you

for your reminder. The Opposition Parties have made

certain  statements, so I feel that  I  must  rebut

their  arguments. Now I would like to touch on  the

editorial in the Sin Chew Jit Poh on the 7th of ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Teong, I do not know whether you

were  here at half-past two this afternoon,  but  I

made  an  announcement which contains a preliminary

ruling by me on this editorial. I also stated  that

I  have  referred it to the Committee of Privileges

which will consider the matter and I am afraid  you

are not permitted to say anything at all about that

editorial at this stage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you for

your direction. I have prepared my rebuttal to  the

editorial but I have no chance to do so now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, I feel that this amendment Bill to

re-adjust the constituencies is in keeping with our

changed  conditions.  The  constituencies  can   be

better developed and can serve the people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



better.  This  is  something  that  should  not  be

delayed.  As  a  responsible  Government,  we  must

introduce  this  Bill at the present  juncture.  We

cannot  allow  the  present situation  to  continue

because it will lead to chaos. If we are not  doing

what  we  are now doing, then it will mean that  we

are  negligent. So any criticism of the  change  in

the  constituencies is baseless and  malicious.  On

the other hand, I think this action on the part  of

the Government is most judicious and farsighted. It

is   a  necessary  step  in  the  history  of   our

parliamentary democracy.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department (Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, originally it was not my

intention to speak on the Bill, but because in  the

process  of increasing the Parliamentary membership

by   eight,  and  my  constituency,  the   Southern

Islands,  is no more, that is why I am now speaking

on  this Bill. Of course, Mr Speaker, I have  been

working  hard  for  the  last  four  years  in   my

constituency, i.e. Southern Islands, and I  believe

that  in  the  next elections, I will  be  returned

unopposed. Even if there is opposition, I believe I

can  beat  my  opponent with a majority  vote.  But

because  this constituency has been deleted,  I  am

obliged  to reiterate my stand that I fully support

the Bill which has been tabled by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Member of Parliament will feel ashamed if he

represents  only 4,000 voters while other  Members,

like  the Member for Queenstown, may represent more

than  40,000  voters. The purpose  of  merging  the

Southern    Islands   into   the   three   mainland

constituencies of Jurong, Telok Blangah  and  Pasir

Panjang  is  to reallocate the responsibilities  of

Members  of  Parliament. Hitherto, the  inhabitants

who  occupy 22 islands of the Southern Islands have

been looked after by only one Member of Parliament,

but  in  future they will be looked after by  three

Members of Parliament. When I bring up the problems

of  the Southern Islanders, I find it difficult  at

times to gain support for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



the  reason  that  I  am  the only  representative.

However,  in  future, if one Member  of  Parliament

puts  forward his proposals, he is sure to get  the

support of the other two Members of Parliament  who

represent the Southern Islands. Therefore,  I  feel

that  it  is more to the advantage of the  Southern

Islanders  to  be represented by three  Members  of Parliament  instead of one member of Parliament  as at  present. Although I may not be representing the Southern Islands in future, these three Members  of Parliament  will have to look after the 22  islands which  are  inhabited by a small number of  voters.

The  expenses  are  high for  only  one  Member  of

Parliament  to  look after the Southern  Islanders,

but  it will be to their greater advantage if  they

are looked after by three Members of Parliament.  I

am  of the opinion that if the Southern Islands are

not  merged  with the mainland constituencies,  the

residents  will  be neglected especially  if  their

Member  of  Parliament does not have good financial

means.  The  reason  is  that  he  will  incur   an

expenditure  of  about  $30  for  a  visit  to  the

Southern Islands, and hon. Members can estimate how

much  expenses will have to be incurred by a Member

of Parliament who pays visits 7 or 8 times a month.

If  a Member of Parliament who gets an allowance of

$500  a  month  were to incur expenditure  for  the

purchase of petrol and an outboard motor and  other

incidental  expenses, it would mean that  he  would

not be able to visit his constituents regularly, as

evidenced  by the fact that my two predecessors  in

the  Southern Islands had failed to discharge their

duties. For that reason, people have been asking me

about  my  stand. Once again, I reiterate  my  full

support  for the White Paper in the hope  that  the

residents  of the Southern Islands will  be  better

looked after after the next elections.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, we will not compromise  in  our

struggle.  We  will  not budge from  our  stand  of

creating   a   prosperous,  free,  democratic   and

socialist Republic of Singapore. We believe that an

increase  in  the number of Members  of  Parliament

will better



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



weld together our multi-racial population. This  is

our  main aim and we will strive to the best of our

ability to achieve it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we all know, the total of 58

Members of Parliament is arrived at as follows:  51

plus  8  totals  59;  59  less  1  equals  58.  The

constituency which has been deleted is the Southern

Islands.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>4.05 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of that constituency know one another

very well. They live in peace and harmony and enjoy

prosperity.  As  elected representatives,  we  have

always   striven   to  achieve   this   basic   and

fundamental    aim.   However,   that    particular

constituency  has been deleted. I  share  the  same

belief  as  that of the Minister of State  for  the

Prime   Minister's  Department,  the   Member   for

Southern Islands, that it would be better  to  have

three  Members of Parliament to cultivate a  multi-

racial  spirit  among the people  of  the  Southern

Islands.  This  will be the responsibility  of  the

future  Members  of  Parliament  representing   the

Southern Islands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Geylang Serai, there will be

another  constituency, Kampong  Ubi.  Although  the

White  Paper  has been tabled and we  will  approve

this  Bill, I feel that Kampong Ubi is not a proper

name in our progressive world and that it should be

renamed,  for  instance, Geylang Bahru  or  Geylang

Maju, because it is not our intension to recall the

past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the increase in the number of Members of

Parliament  to  58  poses a  question.  First,  the

people   will  think  that  there  are  eight   new

constituencies  to be won by political  leaders  in

Singapore. I would like to express my view that the

progress  achieved in our Republic has necessitated

an increase in the membership of Parliament. We are

well  aware  that we will have to face  trials  and

tribulations  not  only from political  Parties  in

Singapore,   but   also  from   outside   political

ideologies, in order to fulfil



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



the  needs  of  our  people. We must  shoulder  our

responsibilities to the people and not think of our

own  benefit. When the people go to the polls, they

will  be  the  final  arbiters.  They  will  decide

whether  or  not  this increase  is  justified  and

whether  or  not  the elected representatives  will

look after their interests.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, may I thank the Members of the

House  who have spoken on the Bill for their  views

and their support?



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.13 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I would like to thank the Member

for  Southern  Islands who, though naturally  sorry

that  his  Islands will find no seat for  him,  has

supported the Bill without any reservations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member who would rather have Kampong

Ubi  called Geylang Bahru or Geylang Maju, I do not

see anything wrong in the name. There have been, in

fact,  some  objections to the English  names,  for

example,  Alexandra and Macpherson, but  these  new

constituencies  have  been  named   Alexandra   and

Macpherson for so long that all you have to do when

you take a taxi is to say, "Alexandra" and the taxi-

driver  will bring you there. So these place  names

have grown up with the town and though they may  be

foreign names, we are certainly not ashamed to  use

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Bill in general is concerned, I

have  only one more point to say and that is  this:

there have been criticisms that the purpose of this

Bill is to "fix" the next election for the People's

Action Party. Sir, whether the next election is for

51  seats or 58 seats will make no difference. I am

confident  that  it  will be a  walk-over  for  the

People's Action Party.

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before Parliament seeks to make

amendments  to  the Income Tax Ordinance  that  are

necessary.  Clause  2  alters  the  definition   of

"Accountant" to bring the legislation in line  with

the Singapore Society of Accountants Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 20 of the Ordinance to

allow   more  accurate  adjustments  of   balancing

allowances  and  charges on  machinery  and  plant,

where  they are not used in Singapore but are  used

in  another  branch  of  the business  outside  the

Republic. This is required because of the repeal of

the  combined  income provisions  which  previously

operated  between  Singapore  and  the  States   of

Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 limits the right of election to adopt

the  written  down value of plant and machinery  in

the  case  of  controlled companies to cases  where

both the buyer and seller are chargeable under  the

Ordinance  in  Singapore.  Otherwise,  there  is  a

danger  of excessive depreciation where one of  the

parties  is  not  within the  tax  jurisdiction  of

Singapore.  This problem arises particularly  where

separate companies are now operating in Malaya  and

Singapore,   where  they  previously  operated   as

branches of the same organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 is a minor correction to section 40. It

is  purely a technical amendment arising out of  an

earlier amendment to section 39.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 is an important variation in that it

provides  that the tax on interest earned  by  non-

resident  individuals on deposits held in Singapore

banks will be 10 per cent. The intent is to make it

more  attractive for non-residents to invest monies

in Singapore banks. This amendment is in accordance

with  the  Budget speech made at the  end  of  last

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 provides that non-resident public

entertainers and non-resident persons in employment

in  Singapore will be charged tax at 15 per cent of

the normal rates applicable to residents instead of

40  per cent as is provided for in the law now.  It

is  considered  that a flat rate  of  40  per  cent

causes  hardship to persons who are  in  employment

for less than 183 days a year, and it is hoped that

this   amendment  will  result  in  better  quality

entertainment  and also facilitate  industries  and

businesses  in  bringing  out  experts  for   short

periods of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 8, 9 and 10 are technical amendments

relating  to the recovery of monies like penalties,

sums  deducted from interest paid to non-residents,

and  sums  due  from companies which have  declared

dividends in excess of available taxed profits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 makes minor variations to the list of

exempted bodies contained in the First Schedule  of

the Ordinance.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill now before the House seeks to amend

section  21  of  the Minor Offences Ordinance.  The

amendment has been rendered necessary by reason  of

the  inadequacy of the present penalties  contained

in  the  Minor Offences Ordinance for such offences

as riotous, disorderly or indecent behaviour within

the  precincts of a court house. Hon. Members  will

remember that a few months ago section 368  of  the

Criminal   Procedure  Code  was  amended  enhancing

penalties  which  may be imposed  for  contempt  of

court where such contempt is committed in the  face

of  the  court.  The  very same  reasons  that  had

rendered necessary the amendment of section 368  of

the  Criminal Procedure Code also made it necessary

for  Government to seek an amendment to section  21

of  the Minor Offences Ordinance. This section,  as

it  now stands, would make it an offence punishable

with  a  mere $20 at the most in the first instance

for  such  riotous behaviour in court that  is  not

committed in the presence of a magistrate and would

accordingly escape the provisions of section 368 of

the  Criminal Procedure Code. Technically speaking,

therefore, as the law now stands, riotous behaviour

even  in court before the magistrate comes  on  the

Bench can only be punished under section 2] of  the

Minor  Offences Ordinance which carries a fine  not

exceeding $20. This, as hon. Members will agree, is

wholly out of proportion to the seriousness of such

an  offence. Indeed, the inadequacy of the  penalty

in this respect has been somewhat underlined in the

recent  disturbances  in  the  magistrates'  courts

where  the  accused  and their  friends  and  their

supporters   have  caused  riotous  and  disorderly

behaviour  within the compound of  the  courts.  In

order that a sufficient



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



deterrent may be imposed for such transgressions of

the law, it has been thought appropriate that there

should  be corresponding increases in the penalties

that  may be imposed for such offences as for those

where  the misbehaviour is in the face of the court

itself.  Accordingly, therefore, it is now provided

in this Bill to increase the penalties, in the case

of  a  first conviction for riotous, disorderly  or

indecent behaviour in the places specified  in  the

Bill, to a fine not exceeding $250. The alternative

punishment   of   imprisonment   has   also    been

correspondingly  enhanced to a term  not  exceeding

one  month,  and  in  the  case  of  a  second   or

subsequent   conviction,  the   maximum   fine   is

increased   to  a  sum  not  exceeding   $500   and

imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 21 as it now stands combines the offence

of drunkenness and disorderly behaviour as a result

of  inebriety  with  disorderly behaviour  that  is

intentional   and   calculated   to   bring   about

disrespect  and contempt for the administration  of

the  law.  And the amendment that is to be  brought

about  to  the  law accordingly seeks  to  separate

these acts from the remainder of the provisions  in

the  present  section  21  of  the  Minor  Offences

Ordinance,  and  it  is  only  where  the  riotous,

disorderly  and indecent behaviour takes  place  in

any public road or in any public place or place  of

public  amusement  or resort, or in  the  immediate

vicinity  of  or  in  any court or  public  office,

police  station  or  place  of  worship,  that  the

offence  would  attract  such  enhanced  punishment

contemplated by this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill can be said to go hand in hand

with  the  amendment to section 368 of the Criminal

Procedure  Code in increasing penalties  for  those

convicted  of  offences  committed  with  the  sole

purpose of expressing their contempt and disrespect

for the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

just  want to ask the Minister to clarify clause  3

with regard to the new section 2lB. "Any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



person  ...".  Does  "Any person"  also  include  a

lawyer  in  court who misbehaves and who will  also

come within the provisions of this Ordinance?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Does any other Member wish to speak?

None. Mr Barker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> "Any person" means what it says. It

will  include  any  lawyer. But  this  Bill  covers

offences not committed, as it were, in the face  of

the court. A lawyer could misbehave in the face  of

the court or in the precincts of a court house, and

the  fact that he is a lawyer will not give him any

protection.  If he is handling the case  in  court,

then, of course, it is up to the magistrate to deal

with  him  if  he misbehaves, under the  powers  of

contempt  of  court for contempt committed  in  the

face of the court, which powers the magistrate has.

Even   before  the  recent  amendments   to   these

Ordinances,  any lawyer misbehaving in court  could

be   convicted  for  contempt  of  court   by   the

magistrate or the judge hearing the case.
