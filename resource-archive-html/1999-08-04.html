<div align="center"><b>(Traffic congestion)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  what  are  the  reasons for the traffic  jams  recently

experienced  at  the  Causeway after  the  opening  of  the  new

Woodlands Checkpoint.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

(a)  what  are  the  main contributing factors  to  the  current

traffic  jams  at the Johor Causeway and whether  any  long-term

solutions  to  the  problem are being  taken;  and  (b)  whether

statistics  are  available on the number of work permit  holders

among  the  total  number  of commuters  travelling  across  the

Causeway daily.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs what are the reasons for the traffic congestion  at  the

Causeway.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Hawazi Daipi</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a)

what caused the recent traffic jams at the Causeway and how this

can  be  avoided  in the future; (b) what is the possibility  of

both  the  Singapore  and  Malaysian  authorities  stepping   up

cooperation to avoid similar problems at their respective  entry

and  exit points; and (c) whether his Ministry will consider the

proposal to use a special pass for lorry drivers and smart  card

for  motorcyclists  so  that they can clear  immigration  checks

quickly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

what  causes  the severe traffic congestion at the Causeway  and

Woodlands  Checkpoint  especially during  peak  hours  and  what

measures have been taken to solve the problem.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho</b>

<b>Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, may I take

questions 1 to 5 together as they are related?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1877</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the morning traffic at

the  Causeway has always been extremely busy.  In the past,

because  our immigration officers were not able to  conduct

complete checks, illegal immigrants were able to slip  into

Singapore, especially during peak hours.  In the first half

of  1999,  more  than  70% of the 5,500 illegal  immigrants

arrested came through the old Woodlands Checkpoint.  It is,

therefore, necessary to conduct stricter immigration checks

at  all times. When the new Woodlands Checkpoint opened  on

18th July this year, Singapore Immigration and Registration

(SIR) started stricter checks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to prepare travellers for the new Woodlands

Checkpoint,  SIR  conducted trial  runs  over  a  few  days  for

arriving  and departing travellers during the peak-periods.   In

addition  to  media  publicity, pamphlets in the  four  official

languages  were  given to all travellers at  the  old  Woodlands

Checkpoint.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three incoming lanes into Singapore and three

outgoing  lanes  to Johor on the Causeway.   On  the  first  few

mornings, there was heavy congestion as vehicles were unable  to

get  into  the correct lanes after leaving the Johor checkpoint.

In  particular, huge numbers of motorcyclists jostled for  space

among cars, buses and lorries.   Lorry traffic was also heavy as

usual.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Checkpoint, stricter immigration checks were carried

out  on travellers, taking about 30 to 45 seconds each.  Customs

takes   about two to three minutes to clear each lorry.    There

is  a  red and green lane system for customs clearance  for  all

travellers, including lorries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To relieve the congestion, SIR and Traffic Police deployed

more  officers  to direct traffic on the Causeway.   One  Johor-bound  lane was converted into a Singapore-bound lane, making  a

total of four incoming lanes to Singapore and two outgoing lanes

to Johor.  More clearance counters were opened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the current situation? After the first week,

school  and factory buses are now generally cleared by 7.00  am,

which is better than before;  cars are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1878</b></font><br><br>

moving  steadily,  also better than before; and  the  motorcycle

queue has eased off earlier, at about 8.00 am instead of 9.00 am

at  the  old  checkpoint.  The lorry queue remains the  same  as

before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clearance of buses, cars and motorcycles and lorries is

now normal.  The situation has stabilised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the departure side, there is a marked improvement in the

traffic situation.  Traffic used to stretch right up to the  BKE

during  the evening peak-hour.  It is now confined to  near  the

checkpoint boundaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIR is looking into ways to further improve the clearance

rate  at the Checkpoint.  There is a smart card clearance system

at the bus halls.  More regular commuters have applied for these

smart  cards and will be encouraged to do so.  There is  also  a

pilot  study  to  clear  motorcyclists through  the  smart  card

system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already a special pass for lorry drivers who make

20  or  more trips a month.  These Multiple Journey Visit Passes

(MJVPs) may be given to more lorry drivers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the congestion during the first few days of operation

is  unlikely to be repeated.  As regards Mr Hawazi's question on

both  sides  stepping up cooperation, there  are  already  links

between SIR and Customs, and their Malaysian counterparts.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister  of  State  to  clarify  what  is  meant  by  "stricter

immigration checks"?  Is this primarily to control the number of

illegal immigrants trying to enter Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the Member is correct. As I

said,  for the first half of this year, out of the 5,500 illegal

immigrants who were arrested, 70% or almost 3,800 said that they

came  through  the Woodlands Checkpoint.  One  reason  could  be

because  of  the  large number of motorcyclists involved.   What

they  did  in the past was to flash their travel documents,  and

only  about  12-13% would be checked.  So the  rest  would  just

flash through.  Because of the constraints at the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1879</b></font><br><br>

old  Checkpoint, we could not check everybody.  So this  is  one

gap  which  we  feel  we have to plug.   And  so  with  the  new

Woodlands  Checkpoint, all the  motorcyclists and all the  other

travellers are checked.  Their travel documents are given to the

customs officers who will look at the photographs and check  the

particulars against the persons.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the Tuas Second

Link  is  now  under  utilised.  Would the  Government  consider

working  with the Malaysian government in a scheme to popularise

its  use,  so  as  to  ease  the  congestion  at  the  Woodlands

Checkpoint?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the means of regulating the

use  of  the  Causeway and the Second Link are by means  of  the

tolls.   And  as  the Member knows, toll amounts  are  not  just

derived  at  from one side.  They are derived from  both  sides,

taking  into  consideration what each side  is  paying  for  the

tolls.   This  is  something that cannot  just  be  unilaterally

changed by ourselves.  In terms of regulating traffic flow, this

really   comes   under   the  Ministry  of  Communications   and

Information  Technology (MCIT).  It is something that  MCIT  can

consider.   Like  I  said, it is not just  a  matter  of  simply

raising tolls to regulate traffic.  I think what we have  to  do

is  that we have to recognise that the main bulk of traffic will

still  come through the Woodlands Checkpoint.  Like I have said,

there  were, of course, initial teething problems.  But  arising

from  the  various measures that have been taken, these problems

have been largely solved, and the situation has stabilised.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I have noticed that

in  the old Woodlands Checkpoint, many of the immigration booths

were  not  opened during peak hours.  I do not know whether  the

Minister  has given instructions for all the booths in  the  new

Checkpoint to be opened, especially during the crowded periods.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, like I have said, one of the

measures taken to ameliorate the situation arising in the  first

few  days was the opening of more counters.  For example,  as  a

quick check, in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1880</b></font><br><br>

the  old  Woodlands Checkpoint, for motorcycles and cars,  there

were  24  counters.  Now, there are 53 counters for  motorcycles

and  cars  in the new Woodlands Checkpoint.  This is  more  than

double.  For buses, at the old Woodlands Checkpoint, there  were

10  counters,  and  now  there are 26  counters,  including  the

conversion  of  some departure counters into  arrival  counters.

Not  only  has SIR converted one departure lane into an  arrival

lane  so  that there is better flow, but for the bus  commuters,

six  of  the counters, I understand, have also been so converted

to  accommodate  a  faster flow.  And lorry counters  have  been

raised from four in the old Woodlands Checkpoint to six.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I take Mr Chiam's point that more counters should and

indeed  have been opened.  I think the basic point is that  what

can  be  done have been looked at and have been done.   But,  of

course,  like I have said, SIR together with the other  agencies

is  still looking at ways to improve the situation, eg,  getting

more  of  the commuters, particularly the bus commuters,  to  go

into  the  immigration access card system.   I  understand  that

since the new Woodlands Checkpoint opened, about 4,000 new cards

have been issued.  So the situation should further improve.

<div align="center"><b>WOODLANDS CHECKPOINT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Smuggling of illegal immigrants)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

whether  there has been an increase in the number  of  attempted

smuggling of illegal immigrants into Singapore detected  at  the

Woodlands Checkpoint; and what measures have been taken to check

this problem.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (for the Minister for Home</b>

<b>Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, more cases involving the smuggling of

illegal  immigrants  into Singapore have been  detected  at  the

Woodlands Checkpoint this year.   For the first half of 1999, 10

traffickers and 51 illegal immigrants were arrested, as compared

to  only  one trafficker and two illegal immigrants arrested  in

the corresponding period last year.  In the whole of last year,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1881</b></font><br><br>

61  foreigners  were  arrested at the Woodlands  Checkpoint  for

attempting  to  enter  Singapore  illegally.   Sir,  indeed  the

numbers have gone up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, more than 14,700 illegal immigrants were caught

in Singapore.  SIR estimates that about 70% of them came through

the  Woodlands Checkpoint.  This illustrates that illegal  entry

into  Singapore  through the Woodlands Checkpoint  is  indeed  a

serious  problem.   SIR has thus taken a range  of  measures  to

check the problem at the Woodlands Checkpoint.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are some of these measures? First, like I have

mentioned  just now, more intensive checks.  SIR has, since  the

later half of 1998, intensified checks at the checkpoint.   From

July  1998  to  June  this  year, 19 vehicles  were  seized  and

forfeited,  as  compared to only five vehicles in  the  12-month

period  preceding  that.  With the recent  opening  of  the  New

Woodlands  Checkpoint,  SIR  has also  started  conducting  more

complete checks on travellers and vehicles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, enhanced intelligence capability. SIR has also

enhanced   its   intelligence  capability   against   syndicates

trafficking  illegal immigrants.  These efforts have  paid  off,

with  more  syndicate operations being crippled.  For the  first

half  of  1999,  10  trafficking  cases  were  detected  at  the

Woodlands  Checkpoint as compared to only one case in the  first

half of 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, more and better trained officers deployed at the

Checkpoints.  SIR and Police have also deployed more and better-trained   officers  to  intensify  checks  at  both   the   land

checkpoints.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, SIR also works with the other Home Team's

departments to jointly tackle the illegal immigrant problem.   I

am  sure Members must have read in the papers about the  use  of

SCDF  rescue dogs deployed at the Woodlands and Tuas Checkpoints

to sniff out illegal immigrants

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1882</b></font><br><br>

concealed  in  car  boots  or  secret  compartments  in  tourist

coaches, lorries, and `Bas Kilang' buses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to rigorous enforcement, we have also

spread  deterrent messages to potential illegal  immigrants  and

traffickers.   Since April 1998, SIR has been issuing  pamphlets

in four languages to foreigners at the land checkpoints carrying

messages  on the tough penalties for immigration offences.   SIR

has  also been applying for deterrent sentences to be meted  out

when traffickers are prosecuted in court.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, can the Minister

of  State  say whether there have been instances where Singapore

Immigration has apprehended illegal immigrants trying  to  leave

Singapore by the Causeway?  Second, would the Minister of  State

agree that if the Malaysian authorities also took tough measures

to  prevent  such smuggling  from taking place and by  crippling

the  ground operations of these syndicates, it will be a win-win

situation for both sides?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I take it that the Member is

referring  to  illegal immigrants leaving Singapore.   SIR  also

takes   a   tough  stand  against  illegal  immigrants   leaving

Singapore.   Perhaps  he has in mind a recent  incident  at  the

Causeway  where 35 or so illegal immigrants tried to  come  into

Singapore from Malaysia, and some of whom, because they were  in

a lorry, were killed.  I think Members know and have read in the

papers  that  SIR  also  takes  a tough  stand  against  illegal

immigrants  trying  to leave Singapore.  I think  it  stands  to

reason,  because this would add to the deterrence  that  if  you

come  into Singapore, even if you come in successfully, it would

be  difficult for you to leave.  In any case, these  people  who

successfully leave may return in future.  And that is why SIR is

vigilant.  Indeed, just two days ago, it is in the Straits Times

today,  a  small column, page 3, Members can read  about  it,  a

Malaysian registered vehicle was trying to leave Singapore  with

five Thai illegal immigrants.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1883</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, for example, SIR has apprehended 23 such

immigration offenders at the Woodlands Checkpoint.  In 1998, 138

such  immigration offenders tried to leave Singapore  illegally,

mainly  in  Malaysian registered cars driven by Malaysians.   In

the  first  six  months  of this year, 53  such  offenders  were

arrested.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in answer to the Member's second question, indeed, I

agree  with  him that continued vigilance is important  on  both

sides  of the Causeway and I hope that the measures that he  has

mentioned would be considered by the Malaysian authorities.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Given that the illegal

immigrants  are  on  the rise and illegal immigrant  trafficking

seems  to  be on the rise, is there any intention to review  the

penalties, especially  for the traffickers?  I say this  in  the

light of the recent case mentioned by the Minister of State that

some  illegal immigrants actually died on the way across in that

particular incident.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the focus now is to plug

this  flow  where in the past they came through the checkpoints.

That  is  the  focus of our efforts.  In terms  of  the  overall

number  of  illegal immigrants caught, in fact, the  number  has

come down.  It has come down by about 30% for the first half  of

this year compared to the same period last year.  But the number

is  still  nevertheless high.  I think there is no need  at  the

moment  to  enhance the penalties.  Looking at the situation  of

each case, for example, the case mentioned by the Member, if the

driver  is  caught,  one  possibility is  to  charge  him  as  a

trafficker, and he would get up to five years' jail.  But  again

it  is  up to the Attorney-General's Chambers.  If indeed he  is

caught,  the  AG may look at the facts and the facts may warrant

the  AG  to consider charging him under a more serious  offence,

perhaps  causing death by a rash act.  So there is  a  range  of

penalties which can be considered currently.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

enforcement  against  illegal immigrants  at  the  causeway  has

brought  about  other problems, especially  to  companies  which

require to move goods

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1884</b></font><br><br>

to  and  from Singapore.  How do we ensure that these  companies

are not affected as more stringent enforcement is conducted?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> If the Member is referring to the

lorry  queues,  the situation, as I have said,  has  stabilised.

Again,  initially in the first few days, arising  from  teething

problems,  not just the lorries but all the other vehicles  were

affected.   But in the second week of operations  that  we  have

monitored, the situation has improved and now the lorry queue is

back to normal.

<div align="center"><b>EMPLOYMENT SITUATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Harun A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Harun A. Ghani</b> asked the Minister for Manpower if he

will  give  an update on the employment situation since  January

1999 to date, in particular, (a) how many new jobs were created;

(b)  how many jobs were lost; and (c) whether workers can expect

to see better job prospects for the rest of 1999.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the labour market has shown signs of strengthening in  the

first  half  of  1999.  In tandem with the pick up  in  economic

activities, total employment rose by an estimated 15,400 in  the

second quarter of 1999.  This is the first quarterly increase in

employment  after declining for four consecutive quarters.   For

the  first  half  of  this year, the total employment  gain  was

5,800.   In  other  words, jobs created exceeded  jobs  lost  by

5,800.   This was a sharp contrast to the net job loss of 26,600

in  the  second  half of 1998 when the impact  of  the  economic

downturn on the labour market was most severe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike in the previous quarter, nearly all major sectors

registered  increases  in employment in the  second  quarter  of

1999.  The employment gains came mainly from the real estate and

business  services with an estimated net job creation of  8,000,

followed by manufacturing at 3,900, financial services at 1,400,

hotels   and   restaurants   at   1,200,   and   transport   and

communications at 1,000.  Employment also rose by 4,300  in  the

other services sectors covering education, health,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1885</b></font><br><br>

domestic and other community, social and personal services.   In

the  construction sector, employment continued to  contract  for

the  fourth consecutive quarter.  However, the net loss of 4,200

construction jobs was significantly less than the 10,500 in  the

preceding quarter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary findings from a survey of private sector

establishments  with  at least 25 employees  showed  that  about

3,300  workers  were retrenched in the second quarter  of  1999.

This  is  close to the 3,400 displaced in the previous  quarter.

With  the  pick  up  in  the  economy,  the  number  of  workers

retrenched  in  the  first quarter of this year  has  fallen  to

6,700, less than half of the 14,600 laid off in the second  half

of 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent economic indicators have been very encouraging.

Manufacturing  output grew by a healthy 10.4% in the  first  six

months of the year compared with the same period last year.  Non-oil domestic exports also rebounded with an increase of 10.3% in

the  second quarter of this year.  While the economic  situation

has  certainly improved, the recovery can only be  sustained  if

there  is  continued strength in the developed economies  and  a

benign environment in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the economic recovery gathers momentum, this would have

a  positive  impact on the labour market.  We can expect  demand

for  workers  to  increase  while  retrenchment  is  likely   to

moderate.  Nevertheless, there would still be some retrenchments

as  companies  upgrade  or restructure  to  remain  competitive.

Lower educated workers who lack the necessary skills will remain

vulnerable   as  industries  move  towards  higher  value  added

activities.  Workers must not be complacent.  They must continue

to  upgrade themselves to ensure that they are able to  take  up

new  jobs that are being created as the economy recovers.   That

is  why  my  Ministry will continue to support skills  upgrading

programmes such as the Skills Redevelopment Programme.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> What is the total number of

retrenchment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1886</b></font><br><br>

expected this year and which sectors would contribute mostly  to

this retrenchment?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, it is

rather  difficult  to  give  a final  projected  figure  on  the

retrenchments likely to be experienced this year.  But  we  know

that  it would be significantly less than the 29,000-odd workers

who were retrenched last year.  But it would probably be still a

little bit more than the 10,000-11,000 that we experienced prior

to the economic downturn in 1998.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> I would like to ask

the   Minister  three  questions.   (1)  What  is  the   current

unemployment rate?  (2) What is the net employment creation  for

the  commerce  sector?  (3) What is the net employment  creation

for local workers as opposed to foreign workers?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, the unemployment rate at the end of

March this year was 3.9%.  As for the current unemployment rate,

the preliminary figures indicated that it is on the decline.  It

is  coming down.  We expect the unemployment rate to continue to

decline.   The figures will only be available when we issue  the

quarterly economic survey probably later this month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the details on the employment creation in the

commerce  sector,  I am afraid I do not have the  exact  figures

with  me, but I would be prepared to share the information  with

the Nominated Member.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the net employment creation for local workers as

opposed  to foreign workers, the demand for foreign workers  has

actually  been  fairly  stable  as  a  result  of  the  economic

downturn.   In  fact, we saw a dip in demand.  In  other  words,

employment  creation for foreign workers would have  gone  down.

As a result of the recession, many companies, particularly those

in  the  construction  sector,  had  to  release  their  foreign

workers.  Therefore, we would expect a decline in the employment

creation for foreign workers.  But due to the swiftness  of  the

recovery, we are also expecting to see a resurgence

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1887</b></font><br><br>

in  the  demand  for  foreign workers and the  demand  for  work

permits  would rise quite quickly as the manufacturing, commerce

and  transportation and communication sectors pick up  in  their

business prospects.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister three points:  (1) If one is given the figures year-on-year, as I understand it, how do the job numbers compare to  the

pre-crisis figures?  Have we a net gain?  (2) In the down swing,

there   were   concerns  about  discrimination   in   job-hiring

practices.  What measures would the Minister take in the upswing

to make sure that the jobs created are hired out fairly?  (3) Is

there  a  sense  that the type of jobs we are  getting  are  now

different  from  the  jobs  we had in the  pre-crisis  days,  as

certain lower end jobs are gone for good and these people  might

face,  in  that  sense,  structural  problems  in  seeking   re-employment?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> In terms of job creation that we are

seeing  in the first half of this year compared to the past,  in

other words, prior to the economic downturn, I have to say  that

we  are  still  a  long way.  Between 1992  and  1997,  we  were

creating between 70,000 and 120,000 jobs a year.  Last year,  we

had a net job loss.  In the first half of this year, as has been

mentioned earlier on, the total employment gain was only  5,800.

So  we are a long way from what it was before.  Perhaps, this is

an  indicator  to  say  that  the  economy  has  not  completely

recovered to what it used to be pre-1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's question on discrimination, whether in

the   light   of   the  economic  downturn,   there   were   any

discriminatory  practices adopted by employers  vis-a-vis  local

workers versus foreign workers, I have replied to this point  on

a previous occasion in this Chamber that we have observed during

the  recession  that, on average, when it comes to retrenchment,

employers,   in  fact,  retrench  their  workers   without   any

discriminatory  practices.   In other  words,  the  retrenchment

reflects  the profile of the workforce in the company.   If  the

company has 50% local and 50% foreign workers in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1888</b></font><br><br>

the  manufacturing sector, then the retrenchment would take  the

same  proportion.  There was no evidence to show that there were

clear  attempts  by  employers to retrench Singaporeans  and  to

substitute them with foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the type of jobs that would be created as the economy

recovers,  I  think  this  is a very important  point.   As  the

economy  recovers, we will shift into a new area of competition.

Our neighbours will also recover, just as we are recovering, and

they  will  be very much more competitive in some  of  the  more

labour-intensive   type   of   businesses,    particularly    in

manufacturing.  So, as I have said in my main answer,  companies

will  have  to restructure their operations, move on  to  higher

value  added  activities, bring in new technology and  introduce

new  processes.  In fact, as the economy recovers, the jobs that

are  going to be created will be quite different from  the  jobs

that were available prior to the recession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, our workers will have to take note of this and

make  efforts to upgrade their skills so that they are  able  to

take  on  the new jobs that are being created.  If they  do  not

upgrade  their  skills,  they will find that  when  the  economy

recovers,  jobs  are going a-begging, but the unemployment  rate

may   well   stay  high,  mainly  in  the  form  of   structural

unemployment.   This  is  a serious concern.   That  is  why  my

Ministry, working together with all the other economic agencies,

is  putting in efforts to try to address this by providing  more

opportunities  for  skills  upgrading  and  retraining  to   our

workers,  particularly the older workers and the  less  educated

workers who are most vulnerable to structural unemployment.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Can I ask the Minister whether

the  most affected workers are the older workers and what  plans

are there to enhance their employability?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I agree with the Member that during

the  economic downturn of last year, the workers who  were  most

affected  by  unemployment and most vulnerable to  retrenchment,

were

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1889</b></font><br><br>

indeed  the  older workers.  Many of these older workers  missed

out  on  the  opportunity for a good education  and  for  skills

training when they were younger.  Now they are in their  mid-40s

and they become very vulnerable to retrenchment.  In fact, if  I

recall correctly, they were over-represented among the groups of

workers  who  were  retrenched.  That is why  we  have  to  have

special  programmes to meet their needs.  In the way I responded

to  the Nominated Member, Mr Simon Tay, we have to put in  extra

efforts  in this area to help the older less-skilled workers  to

upgrade their skills.  The Skills Redevelopment Programme is one

such  programme  focused  at meeting  the  needs  of  the  older

workers, helping older, less skilled workers to upgrade, refresh

their  skills,  so that they can take on the new jobs  that  are

being  created, in other words, helping them to avoid structural

unemployment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, the newspaper reports show

that  Malay  workers  are more prone to retrenchments  and  have

greater difficulty in finding new jobs.  Two questions: (1)   Do

the  latest statistics from the Ministry confirm this?  (2)  How

successful  have retrenched Malay workers been looking  for  new

jobs?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, during the economic downturn,

nearly  two-thirds  of  the retrenched  workers  came  from  the

manufacturing sector.  And the vast majority of those  who  were

retrenched  in  the  manufacturing sector  were  the  production

operators.   Many  Malay  Singaporeans work  in  the  production

operation  type  of   jobs in the manufacturing  sector.   Then,

logically,  you expect that you will see more Malay Singaporeans

among  those  who  were retrenched as a result of  the  economic

downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to helping them to find re-employment, we have made

every effort to help all Singaporeans who were retrenched  as  a

result  of the downturn.  We have organised many job fairs  with

the  support of the various Community Development Councils.  The

job fair was

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1890</b></font><br><br>

an  attempt to bring employers who are still recruiting  to  the

community, and very often at the community centre itself, and to

bring  people living in the vicinity of the community centre  to

come  down if they need job assistance.  We found the job  fairs

to  be quite useful in helping unemployed Singaporeans look  for

jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also benefited from the support given to us by the

various  community self-help groups.  For instance, MENDAKI  and

even  AMP  have actively participated in some of our  employment

exercises.   Likewise, SINDA and CDAC have also participated  in

helping   to   act   as  surrogate  employers   for   unemployed

Singaporeans who need to go for further training before they can

take  on  new jobs.  So, in the Skills Redevelopment  Programme,

we,  in  fact,  were  able to work with the community  self-help

groups  such  as MENDAKI, SINDA and CDAC whereby  the  self-help

groups  will  take on the role of employers for  the  unemployed

Singaporeans  and put them through the SRP programme,  providing

the  financial  support  for them,  so  that  they  can  undergo

training to take on new jobs.

<div align="center"><b>MEDISAVE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Contribution rate)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

whether he will consider lowering the Medisave contribution rate

for Central Provident Fund (CPF) members aged 60 years and above

so  that  they have sufficient funds in the CPF Ordinary Account

to pay for housing mortgage loans.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government

recognises that as a result of the CPF reduction implemented  on

1st  January 1999, CPF members who have committed all their  CPF

Ordinary  Account  savings to housing would need  assistance  to

tide  over  the difficult period.  It is with this in mind  that

the  Government has introduced the bridging loan  scheme  and  a

range  of  HDB assistance measures to help CPF members  who  are

affected  by the CPF reduction.  These measures help to minimise

the impact of the reduction in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1891</b></font><br><br>

Ordinary  Account  contributions  on  CPF  members'  ability  to

service their housing loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 30th June 1999, 126 CPF members have applied for the

bridging  loan  scheme.  89 of them are  for  the  servicing  of

private property mortgage loans.  This is less than 0.1% of  the

total  number  of  CPF members who are fully or partially  using

their  CPF  savings  to service their private property  mortgage

loans.   The balance 37 CPF members who applied for the bridging

loan  are HDB mortgagors on market interest rate.  According  to

HDB  records, from December 1998 to May 1999, slightly less than

10,000  HDB  mortgagors (about 2% of total HDB mortgagors)  have

been  assisted under the various HDB assistance measures.  These

measures  include the rescheduling of mortgage loan instalments,

converting mortgage loans to reduced repayment scheme,  allowing

working  family members as joint-owners to help settle  mortgage

arrears  or  requesting  HDB to allow  mortgage  arrears  to  be

settled  by  instalment plan.  The CPF cut has thus  not  caused

severe difficulties to many CPF members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, it will not be appropriate to reduce the Medisave

contribution rate for CPF members who are aged 60 and above.  In

fact,  they are the ones who need more savings in their Medisave

Account.   The Medisave contribution rate of 6-8 per cent  takes

into  account the greater need for CPF members to save for their

hospitalisation  expenses as they grow older.   The  Member  for

Hougang may wish to know that if a CPF member's Medisave Account

has   reached  $22,000,  any  additional  contributions  to  his

Medisave  Account will overflow automatically into his  Ordinary

Account.   This  will  avoid an excessive build-up  of  Medisave

balance  and  allow  the  members the  flexibility  to  use  the

contributions for housing or other purposes.  For these reasons,

we will maintain the Medisave contribution rates.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Does the Minister agree that

even before the economic downturn when the CPF rate was cut, CPF

members who have reached

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1892</b></font><br><br>

the  age of 60 and above, their total CPF contribution was  15%,

and  8%  of the 15% had to be contributed to Medisave,  which  I

think  renders  very little money in their Ordinary  Account  to

service  the  housing loan?  So for those who are still  serving

their  mortgage loans and have difficulty in paying,  would  the

Minister  consider allowing these people to temporarily  give  a

lesser  contribution  to Medisave to help  them  tide  over  the

period?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the reduction in the

CPF contribution for those who are aged 60 and above has been in

place  for  some  time  already.  So CPF  members  who  purchase

property  should  have made their calculation on  the  basis  of

their  existing CPF contribution.  When we raised the retirement

age  from  60  to  62 effective this year, there  was  a  slight

reduction in CPF contribution for those aged above 60.  But that

was a very, very small adjustment only and would not have caused

additional  difficulties  to those CPF  members  who  are  still

servicing their mortgage loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained in my answer, in fact, the 8%

contribution for older CPF members is really necessary,  because

they  are the ones who are most in need of accumulating  savings

to meet their medical expenses.  If we were to allow them to use

these Medisave savings to finance their mortgage loans, we might

expose  them  to other dangers later on if they should  suddenly

fall  ill and need to be hospitalised.  They would still end  up

facing  a problem.  So it is better for us to remain focused  on

what we are trying to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is Medisave for? Medisave is for you to save to

prepare   for  your  hospitalisation  expenses.   If  you   have

sufficient  CPF  contribution now, even with the reduction,  you

should  emphasise on putting aside the amount that you need  for

your  medical expenses.  That is first priority.  The  rest,  if

you  have  additional savings left over to  service  your  loan,

fine, by all means.  If you have other difficulties, eg, if  you

are  in a HDB flat, as I have already explained, there are  many

measures offered by HDB to assist home owners

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1893</b></font><br><br>

who have difficulty paying their mortgage loans.  If you are  in

the  private  sector, when I look at the figure, it  is  such  a

small  percentage of people who are affected  and  who  have  to

apply  for  the bridging loan.  If they want to, more  can  come

forward.   They  are welcome to come forward and apply  for  the

bridging loan, and we will help them through the bridging  loan,

rather  than erode the savings for medical expenses  which  they

would need sooner or later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, letters, followed by reminders are sent to the

parents, inviting them to register their children for school, or

requesting information about their children's education.   Where

necessary, Ministry of Education officers follow up with  visits

to  these  families at their last known addresses, and  most  of

these  visits are conducted in the evenings to maximise  chances

of meeting the parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through these efforts, about 70%-80% of these roughly 1,500

children eventually

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1895</b></font><br><br>

either  enroll in mainstream schools with help from the Ministry

of  Education  and  MCD,  or  have  made  alternative  schooling

arrangements  in  Islamic Religious Schools,  Special  Education

Schools or Private Schools.  The remainder have either left  the

country,  are medically unfit for school, have no known address,

or  cannot be contacted at their last known address.  These  are

listed  down for 1997 in the table that I have just distributed.

We thus already have a system in which we systematically follow-up every case of non-registration for primary school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education has considered the option of

introducing  compulsory education in Singapore  very  carefully,

and has decided not to do so for the following reasons:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) We must strike a balance between state's

responsibility  and family's responsibility.   The  Ministry  of

Education will make school places available, but parents and the

family  must want to send their children to school.  This  is  a

family's  responsibility.   Making  education  compulsory   will

undermine  the principle of self-reliance and sense of  parental

responsibility which undergirds society; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Even if we legislate compulsory education for all

children  of  school-going age, that does not in  itself  ensure

attendance, much less motivation.  Enforcement becomes  a  major

issue.   Jailing  or fining parents who fail to  register  their

children,  or  who do not send their children  to  school  after

registration,  is unlikely to solve the problem,  and  may  even

make  matters  worse  for the child and the family.   Compulsory

education does not solve the root problem, and it may merely re-surface in another form, such as absenteeism or truancy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is great concern that children who do not attend

schools  will be disadvantaged as Singapore becomes a  knowledge

economy.  This is a concern which my Ministry shares.   We  will

continue  to work with MCD and other organisations to  persuade,

encourage  and help parents to enroll their children in  school.

This is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1896</b></font><br><br>

ultimately   a   more  effective  way  than   making   education

compulsory.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> I agree

with  the  Minister  about balancing the responsibility  of  the

family  and the school.  But, Sir, in this case, is it  not  the

responsibility  of  the  state to  give  a  strong  sanction  to

families that are obviously irresponsible?  We are assuming that

parents  are responsible to send their children to school.   But

when parents are irresponsible and do not send their children to

school, what is the Minister's position then?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, as I said, by making education

compulsory,  we do not solve the root cause of the problem.   In

fact,  we  are looking at the symptom of the problem.  What  the

Member  is  asking  is  whether or not we should  be  separating

children  from  their parents because we, or somebody  else,  or

perhaps the Member, judge that the parents are not carrying  out

their  responsibility properly.  That is a much larger  question

that goes beyond compulsory education.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I am not in favour of compulsory

education  either.  But I think that we should be interested  in

the  best interest of the child.  Let me ask the Minister  then.

In  the question of follow-up in the Annex that is given to  us,

if I add the figures for items 3, 4, 5 and 6, in item 3 (Parents

responded  to  letter but did not specify  very  much),  item  4

(Addresses  not  available),  item  5  (Parents  could  not   be

contacted  at  the  address stated) and  item  6  (Parents  have

divorced and whereabouts of child are not known), may I ask  the

Minister, given that this is over 50% of the figures,  will  the

Ministry further follow up?  Surely it is possible for  the  SIR

or  other  Government agencies to update the  addresses  and  to

pursue the parents and the children?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, first, I will comment on the way

that  the  Member has added up the numbers.  Item  3  should  be

added  to the first two items, ie, items 1 and 2, that is, these

families  have indicated that their children are attending  some

form of schooling or other.  So item

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1897</b></font><br><br>

3  should be added to items 1 and 2 and you will get about  75%.

For  items  4,  5  and 6 where the parents'  addresses  are  not

available in the record, parents could not be contacted  at  the

address stated and parents have divorced and whereabouts of  the

child  are not known, we will take whatever measures we  can  to

trace  the  children.  As I said, we have a record of all  these

children and we actually go to quite some length to follow up on

each  of them.  And I think that is a better way of dealing with

the  issue  of  trying to get as many children as possible  into

school  than  some  blanket formula, like compulsory  education,

which looks nice but is not going to solve the problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, item

5  in the Annex says that parents could not be contacted at  the

address  stated.   The  Minister  just  now  has  addressed  the

problem.   May  I  ask  the Minister whether  he  will  consider

speaking  to the neighbours of these people to find out  whether

they  could  be contacted because the figure is quite  alarming?

At least, other steps should be taken to address this matter.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, I leave it to the people on the

ground  to do this.  These are quite dedicated people  and  they

are  interested in wanting to get the children to go to  school.

In  fact,  what  we  are doing is that we especially  hire  some

retired teachers and give them the list and ask them to  go  and

try and trace these children.  These people are quite dedicated.

They have the interest of the children at heart and they do  try

their best to find them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, despite what the

Minister has said, I remember not long ago the then Minister for

Education said that there were 2,900 students who had  not  been

enrolled in schools but now the Minister has given the figure of

1,500.   Why  is there this contradiction?  That  is  the  first

question.   The  other  point is that  the  Minister  says  that

education  is a family responsibility.  The fact that the  state

has educational

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1898</b></font><br><br>

facilities for these children, does the Minister not think  that

the state is in fact irresponsible by not getting these children

to  school?   How  can  a child be thrown into  society  without

learning how to read and write?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, I am unable to answer the

Member's  first  question because I do not quite understand  it.

On the second question that the Member has asked, I have already

explained  that.   There should be a balance of responsibilities

between  the  state  and  the family.  The  state  provides  the

places.   The  families  should want to  send  the  children  to

school.  And we take quite extraordinary measures to track  them

down and encourage them to come to school.  While we want all of

them  to  come  to  school,  I do not  believe  that  compulsory

education itself is going to solve the problem.  What do  we  do

if  the parents do not wish to send their children to school for

some  reason  or other?  Do we jail them?  Do we fine  them?   I

think  that  will  make the problem worse.   You  break  up  the

family.   So  while we want to encourage all these  children  to

come  to school, we need something which is more than compulsory

education.  Compulsory education is not a magic bullet which, if

we   enact,  will  suddenly  see  all  the  children  in  school

miraculously.   In fact, what we are doing is quite  a  sensible

and  reasonable approach, ie, to encourage as many  children  as

possible  to  come  to  school, I think we have  achieved  quite

considerable success.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, does the Minister agree that the

paramount  interest must be the child?  Even if  the  family  is

broken up because the state wants the child to be in school  and

one of the parents says no, does the Minister not think that the

interest of the child should come first?  If the family is going

to  be  broken  up,  so be it.  But the child  must  receive  an

education, otherwise he will be disadvantaged for the  whole  of

his life.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> I am not sure everyone would agree

with the Member's assertion that the family must be broken up.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1899</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> I was

interested  to hear the Minister say that the family should  not

be  compelled  to send children to school.  Is the Minister  not

aware that in a great many other areas, compulsion is brought on

adults to do whatever the Government thinks should be done,  for

example,  topping up Medisave.  Licences are not renewed  unless

people  go  and top up their Medisave?  Is that not a compulsion

even when they cannot afford to top up?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in some cases, this

will  work,  but in other cases, it will not.  In  the  case  of

compulsion to attend school, I do not think it is going to  work

because  it depends on a larger series of things to be in  place

first.  I  can compel or I can try to compel children to  be  in

school,  but  I  cannot compel them to be looked after  properly

when  they are at home for 18 hours.  A lot of things can happen

during that period of time.  As I have explained, compulsion  to

send children to school will not necessarily mean that they will

be  in  school  because there will be other  issues  then,  like

absenteeism,  truancy, and so forth, which will  not  be  solved

merely by enacting legislation or putting in place the rule that

says that all children must be in school.  If we could magically

solve that problem, I will be the first to do so.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> I am still not convinced by

the  rationale.   We have fines and legislation that  have  made

people respond properly, so why cannot we compel parents to send

their  children  to  school?  Would that not create  a  positive

response?  I would like the Minister to elaborate on that again.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I circulated the

Annex  basically to show what we have done.  I am not sure which

group  of  these children we intend to compel to come to  school

because  items 1, 2 and 3 are children who are already going  to

come to school.  For items 4, 5 and 6, we cannot trace them.  So

how do we compel them?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Would the Minister clarify item 3 in

the Annex that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1900</b></font><br><br>

parents  responded to MOE's letter but did not  specify  whether

their  children were in local mainstream schools or other  types

of local schools?  Are they in school or are they not in school?

Does the Minister know?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, as the parents have responded

that their children are in school, we take their word for it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> I think there is a deeper issue here.

The  numbers actually are quite small.  Categories 5,  6  and  8

together add up to only 282 children.  But the issue is:  should

the  child suffer because the parents are irresponsible?  And  I

think many of us feel that children should not be made to suffer

simply  because their parents do not send them  to  school.   In

which  case,  if  it  needs legislation to  have  some  sort  of

compulsion  to enable the state or the authority to  send  those

children  to  school,  so be it.  But  the  issue  is  that  the

children   should   not   suffer   because   the   parents   are

irresponsible.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, children always

suffer when their parents are irresponsible.  I am not sure that

compulsory  education, while it sounds very nice,  is  going  to

solve  this  particular  problem.   If  you  have  irresponsible

parents  who  have  children  and they  do  not  bring  them  up

properly, compulsory education on its own is not going to  solve

the  problem.   What  we are talking about is removing  children

from  the  care  of  their  parents.   That  is  not  compulsory

education.  That is a different subject.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think hon. Members are repeating the

question in one form or other.  We seem to be getting the answer

in  one form or other too.  Unless there are fresh questions,  I

intend to proceed.  Yes, Dr Wang.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Would the Minister

elaborate the experience of other countries that have compulsory

education  and give us their experience and see whether  or  not

Singapore should adopt compulsory education?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1901</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Many countries have compulsory

education.  But I do not have the data with me.  I was trying to

track  it  down to answer the NMP's question, and I would  track

down  the  data.  But from what I know of education  that  takes

place  in  a  number  of these countries which  have  compulsory

education,  it is a nice piece of legislation but  not  all  the

children are in school.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Would the Minister give a

breakdown  of  the number of students who have gone  to  Islamic

schools,   special   education  schools  and   private   schools

separately?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> I do not have the breakdown with me

right now.  I will try and get it.  But if the Member would file

another  question, I will try and get the data for him.   I  may

not be able to get all.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Has the Government considered making

education  free  for children of parents who may  find  it  very

difficult   to  send  their  children  to  school?   Would   the

Government find some money for that?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, education is

available  to all in Singapore and a wide range of  schemes  are

available.   If  there  are children who the  Member  knows  are

unable to attend school because of financial reasons, please let

me  know.  We will refer them to the appropriate authorities  to

help  them,  if  the  Member is unable to refer  them  to  those

appropriate authorities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask what is wrong in making a general

policy  announcement instead of leaving it  to  the  parents  to

appeal for charity every time?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> I am not sure what general policy

announcement the Member is asking for.  But as I have explained,

anyone who needs financial assistance for his children to be  in

school, he is able to get it.  If the Member knows

of  any such person, please let me know if he is unable to  help

him himself.

<div align="center"><b>FINAL SUPPLY (FY 1998) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to make final provision for an

additional  expenditure of $1.8 million for payment of  expenses

on  investments (EOI) under the Ministry of Finance  (MOF).  The

supplement  will bring the total provision for EOI  in  FY98  to

$247 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FY98 provision for expenses on investments was $227

million.  The final expenses on investments came to $247 million

which  was  $20  million more than projected.  After  offsetting

savings  of some $18 million from other votes under the Ministry

of Finance, a further supplement of  $1.8 million is needed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher expenses were incurred because of increased

investment  opportunities towards the end  of  FY98,  which  had

resulted in higher than expected expenses. In a sense, it was  a

happy  problem because higher profits had accrued. Members  will

appreciate  that  it  is  difficult to estimate  accurately  the

requirements for expenses on investments, especially given these

times of market volatilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<div align="center"><b>INSURANCE INTERMEDIARIES BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes to license insurance intermediaries

(agents   and  brokers)  carrying  on  business  in   Singapore.

Currently, there are 150 insurance brokers and 28,000  insurance

agents in the Singapore insurance market. Except for six brokers

who are registered under section 36(6) of the Insurance Act (Cap

142) for the purpose of placing business with Lloyd's in London,

the rest of the brokers and agents operate under self-regulatory

systems maintained by their relevant trade associations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While self-regulation has been satisfactory so far, MAS has

felt  the  need to supervise brokers' activities and to  enhance

the   quality  and  professionalism  of  insurance  brokers   in

Singapore.   Licensing  would enable MAS to  have  oversight  of

insurance  brokers' activities and conduct, thus furthering  the

protection  of  policyholders'  interests  and  ensuring  proper

development of the insurance industry. Countries like the United

Kingdom,  Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia and certain  states  in

the United States have, similarly, enacted legislation to govern

insurance brokers' activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than incorporating the new requirements for

licensing  of  brokers  in  the Insurance  Act,  the  Government

proposes  the enactment of a separate legislation. The rationale

is  that  the  activities of insurance brokers are substantially

different  from  those of insurance companies. In  drafting  the

proposed legislation, MAS has had

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1904</b></font><br><br>

several rounds of consultation with relevant trade associations.

The  insurance  industry  generally welcomes  and  supports  the

proposed licensing of insurance brokers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will highlight the key provisions of the Bill. Clause 3

of  the  Bill makes it an offence for any person to  act  as  an

insurance agent for a registered insurer unless he has a written

agency  contract  with  that  insurer.   Similarly,  clause   12

prohibits any person from carrying on insurance broking business

unless it is registered with MAS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All licensed insurance brokers are required, under clauses

17  and  21, to maintain minimum paid-up capital and  net  asset

value  of  50%  of minimum paid-up capital at all times.   These

requirements  are  necessary so as  to  establish  the  brokers'

commitment  to  operate in Singapore and  to  ensure  that  they

possess a minimum level of financial assets. Further, to protect

the   insuring  public  against  wrongful  advice  and   against

suffering  any  financial  loss due to  brokers'  negligence  in

carrying  out  their duties, all brokers are  required  to  have

professional indemnity insurance covers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As insurance brokers are holding clients' and insurers'

moneys  in trust, it is imperative that brokers maintain  proper

accounts  of  these moneys.  Clause 22 requires all  brokers  to

maintain separate bank account(s) with a bank(s) licensed  under

the Banking Act.  All premium receipts and claim moneys received

by  brokers  on  behalf of their clients must be duly  deposited

into these accounts and only specified withdrawals can be made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is customary for insurance intermediaries to collect

premiums   from  policyholders  for  payment  to  the  insurers.

Similarly,  insurance claim payments may be  made  to  claimants

through  the  intermediaries. In order to protect policyholders'

and   claimants'  interests,  clause  4  stipulates  that  where

premiums  are  paid by a policyholder to an insurer  through  an

intermediary, the payment will be considered as a  discharge  of

the policyholder's liability to the insurer up to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1905</b></font><br><br>

amount of the payment. However, where an insurer transmits claim

payments  to  a  claimant through an intermediary,  the  insurer

remains liable to the claimant for those moneys.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 24 restricts a registered insurance broker from

receiving,  and prohibits insurers from giving, any remuneration

to  the broker that is tied to the broker's business volume, for

example, production bonuses which are paid on achieving  certain

levels  of business volume. This clause is to minimise  conflict

of  interest  between brokers and their clients as  well  as  to

enable brokers to uphold their independence and professionalism.

If  an  insurer offers production bonuses to a broker, this  may

influence  the  broker to place more of its business  with  that

insurer,  against  its duty to source for best  covers  for  its

clients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for the control of appointment of

key persons, that is, chief executive officers and directors  of

broking firms.  Clause 25 requires brokers to seek MAS' approval

before  allowing any interested party to acquire 20% or more  of

its voting share capital.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 28 to 33 allow MAS to require returns, inspect

insurance intermediaries or any persons suspected of carrying on

insurance  broking business in Singapore, issue  directions  and

wind  up  the  affairs  of  a registered  broker.  MAS  is  also

empowered  under  clause  41 to make regulations  generally  for

carrying out the provisions of the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill carries a transitional provision to deal with

persons  who  are  employed  in the insurance  broking  business

before  the  enactment of the Act. To ensure that  the  proposed

licensing does not pose undue difficulties on existing  brokers,

they  would be given six months to seek and obtain the necessary

approvals from MAS to continue conducting their business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1906</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

in  support  of the Bill which would help raise the professional

standards  of intermediaries and hence the insurance  sector  at

large. Equally noteworthy are the provisions to be put in  place

so  that  the  insured,  that is the end-users,  are  adequately

protected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There remains a need to clarify the extent of recourse

available to an insurance company in the event of default by  an

intermediary with specific reference to the broker intermediary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 4(1) and (2) effectively discharge the insured

and  intending  insured  from  any  liability  to  make  further

payments  to the insurer if moneys, such as premiums payable  to

the insurer, have already been paid by them to the intermediary.

While these provisions protect the insured, albeit to the extent

of  moneys  already paid, the insurer is bereft of any  recourse

under these provisions for moneys due to him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the same token, under clause 4(3), an insurer who pays

to the intermediary, moneys such as claims or return of premiums

meant for the insured party, remains liable to the insured until

receipt  by the insured.  Likewise, the insurer has no  recourse

under these provisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this could imply an assumption of liability by the

insurer for which he has little control over, particularly  with

respect  to  insurance  brokers.  Unlike agents  over  whom  the

insurer  can  exercise  some level of  control,  brokers  are  a

different entity altogether.  Insurers have no jurisdiction over

brokers' functions and actions.  Although clause 2(1) gives  the

definitions  of insurance agent and insurance broker,  the  Bill

appears  to  be  silent  on their explicit responsibilities  and

liabilities vis-a-vis the insurer and the insured.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the above comments for which I seek the

Deputy Prime Minister's clarifications, I support the intent  of

the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wish to refer

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1907</b></font><br><br>

specifically  to clause 23 of the Insurance Intermediaries  Bill

which states in no uncertain terms that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No registered insurance broker shall, in the course of its

business  as such, negotiate any contract of insurance with  the

insurer (whether directly or through an insurance intermediary),

except  with  a registered insurer acting in the course  of  his

business as such."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;References to "contract of insurance" are further spelt out

in  subclause  (3)  as  not applicable  to  the  reinsurance  or

business  relating to risks outside Singapore.   Notwithstanding

the  fact  that Singapore intends to provide local insurers  the

opportunity  to  write  business,  the  restriction  creates   a

position  where  Singapore shipowners  are  forced  into  paying

uncompetitive  local  rates for certain  specialised  insurance.

Marine hull insurance is an example which I will elaborate on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am personally involved in the shipping business and am

conversant  with the procedures whereby insurance intermediaries

obtain  quotations on marine hull insurance.  The quotations  by

the overseas insurers on marine hull insurance can sometimes  be

only  50%  or  one-third of the quotations obtained  from  local

insurers  and yet the insurance intermediaries will be bound  by

clause  23 of the Insurance Intermediaries Bill to engage  local

insurers even if their rates are extremely uncompetitive  vis-a-vis  the  overseas  insurers as long as they have  supplied  the

quotations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subclause (5) does provide for exceptions where the MAS

will  grant approval by reason of exceptional nature of the risk

or  other exceptional circumstances.  However, in practice,  the

shipping  industry  has not benefited from such  approvals  from

MAS.    Singapore's  financial  industry  has  been   undergoing

deregulation and liberalisation with the removal of barriers  to

full  foreign  participation  in the  domestic  banking  sector.

Similarly,  measures would be taken to liberalise the  insurance

sector to fully develop Singapore as a regional financial hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Insurance Intermediaries Bill does not appear to make

sufficient provisions

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1908</b></font><br><br>

for  this.  If local insurers supplying uncompetitive rates  are

given  undue protection under this Bill, Singapore's  shipowners

would be greatly disadvantaged.  I believe that it is imperative

for  the Singapore shipping community to take advantage  of  the

most  competitive rates available worldwide. At the  same  time,

the  local insurance intermediaries should be given the  liberty

to  source quotations from overseas insurers.  It appears to  me

that  the  principle  embodied in clause  23  is  tantamount  to

protectionism of the local insurers.  Surely, this  is  contrary

to  the  fundamental tenets of an open economy  which  Singapore

champions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to refer to clause 24 of the Bill which relates

to  the  restriction  of  receipt  and  payment  of  any  gifts,

gratuities,  benefits or other rewards (however  described)  for

the  services of a registered insurance broker.  In other words,

insurance   intermediaries,  specifically  registered  insurance

brokers, will be prohibited from receiving an "incentive  bonus"

from the insurance companies which they deal with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many small and medium-sized insurance broking firms are

receiving  such  an  "incentive  bonus"  from  the  insurers  in

Singapore.   Moreover, this form of remuneration  is  acceptable

and  has  always  formed  part of the remuneration  received  by

insurance  brokers.  The incentive bonus paid to  the  insurance

brokers has not caused problems to the insurers, neither has  it

prejudiced  the insuring public.  If clause 24 is  passed,  this

would  mean  the  loss of an estimated 20%  of  income  to  each

affected   insurance   broking  firm,  resulting   in   possible

retrenchment of their employees and translates into the loss  of

an important source of revenue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a regulatory framework is indeed

necessary.  However, over- regulation in business practices will

unfortunately stifle business initiative.  Singapore  businesses

need  to  have a certain leeway to survive, thrive and excel  in

the  global  marketplace.   Where appropriate,  they  should  be

allowed to operate within a reasonable market practice.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1909</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that MAS conducts a thorough review of the

insurance industry and how it is performing its role of  serving

the rest of the business community with a view to amending those

laws  which  are  no  longer appropriate for  the  promotion  of

Singapore as an international business hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with the exception of clauses 23 and 24,

given   the   foregoing   reasons,  I  support   the   Insurance

Intermediaries Bill.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua asked

about  the  assumption of liabilities of insurers on  behalf  of

brokers.  She said that she could understand why insurers  would

assume  liabilities on behalf of agents, but does  not  see  why

they should do so on behalf of brokers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill holds insurers accountable for

liabilities  of  agents  and  brokers  in  respect  of  premiums

collected  from  policyholders by the intermediaries  and  claim

payments  made  to claimants through intermediaries.   It  deems

premiums received by an intermediary as having been received  by

the  insurer, but the insurer remains liable to the claimant for

any claims monies made through an intermediary.  Basically, this

is  a consumer protection measure, because it seeks, firstly, to

protect  consumers from paying premiums a second time  where  an

intermediary  does not pass the money on to the  insurer.   And,

secondly,  to  ensure  that  the claimants  will  receive  their

payments  where  an  intermediary fails to transmit  the  claims

money.  The boundary between the insured and the insurer is  put

on  the  side of the intermediary.  The intermediary is  on  the

insurer's side.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This provision is applicable to both brokers and agents, as

it  is also found in the Australian Insurance Agents and Brokers

Act, 1984.  It is deliberately designed to apply to both brokers

as well as agents, because whether or not an insurance broker is

only the agent of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1910</b></font><br><br>

insured  depends on the facts and circumstances of a  particular

case and the type of the insurance business, and the common  law

rule is that in some cases, the broker may actually be acting as

an agent for the insurer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan raised two questions. The first one has

to  do  with  basically  marine hull insurance.   First,  may  I

clarify that there is no restriction whatsoever on a person  who

wishes  to  place  insurance  risk  directly  with  an  overseas

insurer.   If the rates are more competitive, you may choose  to

go  there, and that includes shipping companies or anybody else.

But an overseas insurer is not licensed to operate in Singapore.

An unlicensed insurer is not allowed to write domestic Singapore

risks.    This   restriction  is  similar  to   that   of   most

jurisdictions, including the US.  So clauses 7  and  23  of  the

Bill  essentially  ensure that neither brokers  nor  agents  are

allowed   to  assist  unlicensed  insurers  to  write   domestic

Singapore risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is a lack of expertise or capacity in the local

insurance industry, MAS will grant exemption for the risks to be

placed  directly  with overseas insurers.  And the  majority  of

risks  that  have  been granted exemptions are marine  hull  and

liability  risks.  The statistics for the last three years  show

this.   For  example, in 1998, we received 160 applications  for

exemptions  for lack of expertise or capacity locally.   Out  of

these 160 applications, 158 were approved.  For marine hull  and

liability, we received 49 applications last year, and  all  were

approved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise the need to develop marine hull and liability

expertise  and  to increase the local capacity  so  as  to  help

develop  Singapore's international maritime  hub.   So  we  have

taken  the  lead  to  attract specialist  maritime  insurers  to

Singapore  and  we have also provided tax incentives  for  their

offshore marine and hull liability business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member suggested that we should undertake an overall

review  of  the  insurance industry and  the  legislation  which

applies to it.  This is indeed what we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1911</b></font><br><br>

are  in  the  process of doing.  MAS is currently reviewing  our

admission policy on insurers and we hope we will have some clear

conclusions within a few months.  But even if we are to open  up

the  insurance  market  in  Singapore,  no  overseas  unlicensed

insurers will be allowed to operate in Singapore unless they are

registered  with MAS.  This upholds the principles of  insurance

regulations of the international regulators, because if they are

not licensed and they operate here and something goes wrong, the

Government will be responsible.  If they are overseas and you go

and  look  for them, that is you are taking it on yourself,  but

they are not operating in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also raised a question of gifts, gratuities,

benefits  and other rewards from insurance brokers.   I  presume

that   when  Mr  Tay  refers  to  "incentive  bonus",  he  means

everything  received by the broker other than the  brokerage  or

the  fee.  Clause 24 of the Bill seeks to prohibit brokers  from

receiving  any payments from an insurer including gifts,  except

as  remuneration for services rendered in arranging a particular

contract  of insurance or settling a claim.  And the payment  in

such cases cannot vary according to the number of contracts, the

amount  of  premiums  or sums insured that  are  placed  with  a

particular insurer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clause prohibits the giving of production bonus which

is  tied solely to the broker's business volume.  This bonus  is

paid  to brokers for achieving certain levels of business volume

with a particular insurer.  The rationale for the prohibition is

that when an insurer offers such production bonuses to a broker,

it is likely to influence that broker to place most, if not all,

of  its business with that insurer, whereas, in fact, the broker

has  a  duty  to  his client to source for the most  appropriate

cover  and  terms  for his client.  Such a restriction  is  also

found  in the Australian Insurance Agents and Brokers Act, 1984.

Again,  the objective in the Australian legislation is to ensure

that  the  broker's impartiality is not influenced by incentives

or  volume-based  remuneration and to ensure that  the  broker's

obligation to his client is not compromised.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1912</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, other than volume-based incentive bonuses,

brokers  are  not  prohibited  from  receiving  other  types  of

incentives such as profit commissions and persistency bonuses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill.  -   [BG Lee Hsien Loong].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>1.57 pm

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Insurance Act was last amended in 1993. With the

promulgation of the Insurance Intermediaries Bill 1999 which  we

have  just dealt with, consequential amendments have to be  made

to  the Insurance Act.  At the same time, several amendments are

also proposed which are aimed at clarifying the scope of present

regulatory requirements and to reflect current practices in  the

insurance industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the provisions in the Insurance Act that relate to

agents  and  brokers  will  be repealed  and  taken  up  in  the

Insurance Intermediaries Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 (section 5A) of the Insurance (Amendment) Bill

requires the setting up of new insurance representative  offices

to  be  approved by MAS.  This control measure is  necessary  as

representative offices can easily underwrite insurance  business

and  it  is  difficult to uncover such activities.  In addition,

the  clause  prohibits,  firstly,   any  persons  in  Singapore,

including  staff  of  unregistered  insurers  or  any  of  their

representatives, from soliciting direct insurance  business  for

the  unregistered insurers; and, secondly, the establishment  of

an  office  in  Singapore by any person to  solicit  reinsurance

business for unregistered insurers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1913</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 tightens the control of takeovers of insurers to

include direct and indirect acquisition, holding or control  and

acquisition  of  a right to shares under an option.   While  the

Insurance  Act provides MAS with the power to control  takeovers

and substantial changes in shareholdings of locally incorporated

insurers,  the power does not extend to holding companies.   The

amendment  widens  the  present  control  to  include   indirect

shareholdings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To safeguard policyholders' interest and to discourage

insurers  from granting unsecured credit facilities to directors

or employees, clause 10 broadens the restriction on the granting

of  unsecured  loans by insurers to directors and  employees  to

include grant of unsecured advances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 updates the description of Lloyd's. Lloyd's, a

society  of  underwriters in the UK and incorporated  under  the

Lloyd's  Act  1871, is an approved insurer under  the  Insurance

Act.   In  recent  years,  it  has  undergone  major  structural

changes.    Since   1994,  it  has  been   admitting   corporate

memberships.   Unlike  the  original  Lloyd's  members  who  are

individuals,  the  corporate  members  can  either  be   limited

liability   companies   or  partnerships.    Consequently,   the

description  of  Lloyd's  in  the Insurance  Act  is  no  longer

accurate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also proposes, in clause 14, to clarify that where

a registered insurer becomes insolvent, priority of claims would

be  granted  to  policyholders on an individual  insurance  fund

basis.   Assets of an insurance fund would be used, firstly,  to

meet  the  claims  of  its policyholders,  secondly,  the  other

creditors  of that fund; and, finally, any balance in that  fund

would  be released to other policyholders and creditors  of  the

insurer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 provides for legal immunity of MAS and its

employees   in  the  course  of  carrying  out  its   regulatory

functions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing section 54 of the Insurance Act requires MAS

to prepare and submit

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1914</b></font><br><br>

to the Minister an annual report on the working of the Insurance

Act  for  presentation to Parliament.  Section 54 is  no  longer

relevant and clause 16 seeks to repeal this provision.  Prior to

1977,  the  Insurance Department (ID) was under the Ministry  of

Finance   and   its  annual  report  was  intended   to   ensure

accountability.  The Insurance Department was transferred to MAS

on 1st April 1977, and with effect from 1st April 1998, has been

brought  under  MAS'  Financial  Supervision  Group  to   enable

consolidated supervision of all financial institutions.   It  is

no  longer necessary for the Insurance Department to present  an

independent  report to Parliament as MAS submits a comprehensive

annual report, including the same matters required under section

54, to Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br><i>Introduction</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the world, exchanges are facing new forces of

change.   They  must contend with increasing global  competition

from  existing and new players, and investors who  demand  cheap

and  efficient  channels  for trading.  New  electronic  trading

systems  are  executing trades between large market participants

at  low cost, bypassing the exchanges.  Exchanges themselves are

seeking  to  link  up  or  forge  alliances,  so  as  to  remain

competitive and to offer a wider menu of products to investors.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1915</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the stock and derivative exchanges, the Stock

Exchange  of  Singapore ("SES") and the Singapore  International

Monetary  Exchange  ("SIMEX"), have thus  far  performed   well,

contributing  significantly to the development of our  financial

markets,  and serving both regional and international investors.

But  Singapore's  exchanges must now  urgently  re-define  their

strategies  so as to remain viable and relevant,  and  to  serve

investors  as cheaply and efficiently as technology  allows  and

the competition demands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November last year, I announced that the Government had

accepted  the recommendations of the Committee on Governance  of

the  Exchanges. SES and SIMEX would be merged, and at  the  same

time be demutualised, in other words, no longer run as a member-owned entity, but as a private, stock company accountable  to  a

broad range of shareholders.  These changes are essential if the

exchanges  are to respond quickly to new challenges  and  remain

competitive.   A  merged exchange would also  be  able  to  reap

benefits in the future from a common user interface and  trading

platform.   It  would  also  be  able  to  offer  a  variety  of

integrated  products and services which cut  across  traditional

cash and derivative asset classes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since November last year Hong Kong has also announced its

intention  to  combine  and demutualise its  stock  and  futures

exchanges.  The two exchanges have just agreed to the plan.  The

Hong  Kong Government has stated that unless the members of  the

two  exchanges  vote  for the plan, the government  will  pursue

merger and reform through other means.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Australia, the Australian Stock Exchange, which went

public  a year ago, is seeking to merge with the Sydney  Futures

Exchange.   The  New York Stock Exchange and  the  London  Stock

Exchange  have  both just announced their plans to  demutualise.

The  Financial  Times  quoted  one  London  stockbroker  saying:

"Running  an  exchange must be like living in  biblical  Jericho

with the walls falling down all around you."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1916</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Transfer Provisions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to demutualise and merge SES

and  SIMEX.  The first part of this Bill deals with two matters.

The  first is the process of demutualising and merging  the  SES

and  SIMEX.   The  second  is the placement  of  shares  of  the

combined  exchange  to  new investors.   The  approach  to  both

matters  has  been  endorsed by the  Pro-Tem  Committee  of  the

Integrated Singapore Exchange ("PTC").

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demutualisation and merger of SES and SIMEX will be

effected  by  a transfer of ownership from existing members  who

hold  shares  in  SES  and  SIMEX to a  new  transferee  holding

company, or Newco.  On Transfer Date, which is targeted for  1st

December 1999, the existing shares of SES, SIMEX and SCCS  which

are  currently held by the members will be cancelled.  (SCCS  is

the  computer arm of the SES jointly owned by SES itself and its

SES's  26  local  members.  Since SCCS  is  not  a  wholly-owned

subsidiary  of  SES,  its  shares  will  have  to  be  cancelled

separately.)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time that these shares are cancelled, the three

companies  will  issue  new shares  to  Newco.   In  return  for

cancelling  their shares in SES and SIMEX, members  of  the  two

exchanges will receive a fixed dollar amount of shares in Newco.

Each  SES member will receive $6 million, and each SIMEX  member

$170,000  for  every  seat owned and $115,000  for  every  share

owned.    In aggregate, SES and SIMEX members will receive  $301

million worth of shares.  SES and SIMEX members will thus become

shareholders of Newco, and Newco will in turn own 100%  of  SES,

SIMEX and SCCS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining shares of Newco will be placed with new

investors.   The  share  placement will be  implemented  in  two

steps:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Newco will issue new shares to a pre-designated

special-purpose company.  The special-purpose company will be  a

"shell"  company  owned by Temasek.  It  will  not  be  able  to

exercise the voting

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1917</b></font><br><br>

rights attached to the Newco shares, and will not be allowed  to

deal  in  Newco shares without the approval of the  Minister  in

charge of MAS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the special-purpose company will place Newco shares

with  new investors.  The proceeds from the sale of shares, less

the  par value and certain merger-related expenses, will  accrue

to the Financial Sector Development Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial advisor to the Pro-Tem Committee (which is

Merrill  Lynch) will establish a market value for  Newco  shares

based  on a book-building process.  The special-purpose  company

will,  however,  not  place out all  the  Newco  shares  in  one

placement.  It is intended that the first placement to local and

international   financial  institutions,  as   well   as   other

investors,  will  be  completed by Transfer Date.  The  special-purpose  company  will hold back a portion of Newco  shares  for

subsequent placements, including to strategic partners with whom

the integrated exchange may enter into alliances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newco will not be publicly listed immediately. The PTC

envisages  an IPO in the medium term.  When Newco is  listed  on

the stock exchange, the Bill will provide that MAS will directly

regulate  the listing and trading of Newco's shares.  This  will

ensure  that Newco will not face a conflict of interest when  it

lists on its own subsidiary.

<br><br><i>New Regulatory Provisions Governing Newco</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the Bill establishes regulatory

provisions which govern Newco.  The exchanges are a key part  of

Singapore's  financial  sector  infrastructure.   MAS  currently

regulates  the SES and SIMEX under the Securities  Industry  Act

("SIA")  and the Futures Trading Act ("FTA"). Since  Newco  will

own  and  run  the  exchanges, it is  in  Singapore's  strategic

interest  for  MAS  to also exercise some degree  of  regulatory

control  over  Newco.  The Securities Industry Act  and  Futures

Trading Act will continue to apply to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1918</b></font><br><br>

Newco's   two   subsidiaries,  SES   and   SIMEX,   with   minor

modifications which I will mention later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not unduly constrain the new for-profit entity in

the  running  of its exchanges and the pursuit of  new  business

opportunities.  The  regulatory provisions pertaining  to  Newco

give  MAS  power to issue directives in the interest of ensuring

fair  and orderly securities and futures markets, and the proper

management  of  systemic risks.  This is necessary  for  MAS  to

perform  its role as securities regulator, but is otherwise  not

intended  to  impinge  on  Newco's  capacity  to  make  business

decisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also creates an avenue of appeal by Newco to the

High  Court against any MAS action.  This is consonant with  the

broader  recommendation of the Corporate  Finance  Committee  to

allow parties aggrieved by decisions of the securities regulator

to have recourse to independent bodies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first directives that MAS will issue to Newco relate to

its  corporate  governance.  MAS will require Newco  to  do  the

following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to seek MAS approval for the appointments of both

the Chairman and CEO of the exchange.  These are key appointment

holders  who define the strategic direction of the organisation,

and its key risk management principles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, MAS will require Newco to set up a Nominating

Committee,  whose  purpose is to recommend appointments  to  the

Board  and  key  management positions. The  appointment  of  all

members  of the Nominating Committee will require MAS  approval.

It  is  common  for  international  exchanges  to  have  such  a

Nominating  Committee.  In Singapore, we have just introduced  a

similar arrangement for the local banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, MAS approval will be required for individual

shareholdings  that  exceed 5%.  MAS may  approve  shareholdings

exceeding 5% subject to conditions, such

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1919</b></font><br><br>

as  requiring  further  approvals for  subsequent  increases  in

shareholding above specified limits.  The 5% limit on individual

shareholdings  prevents excessive ownership  by  any  one  party

without  the regulator's knowledge. Its objective is similar  to

limits  imposed  on  other demutualised exchanges  such  as  the

Australian Stock Exchange.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One consequence of these measures is that it will not be

necessary to cap foreign  investment in Newco.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These regulations will remain in the Exchanges

(Demutualisation and Merger) Act until MAS review of  securities

legislation is complete in 12 to 18 months time.  The provisions

for  the  regulation of Newco could then be  migrated  into  new

legislation.   MAS  is currently undertaking  a  review  of  the

structure   of   securities   legislation,   to   follow-up   on

recommendations made by the Corporate Finance Committee ("CFC").

It  will  study  the  feasibility  of  integrating  the  current

securities and futures trading legislation into one Act.

<br><br><i>Establishment of the Financial Sector Development Fund</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third part of the Bill establishes a new Financial

Sector  Development Fund ("Fund") under the purview of MAS.    I

had  announced  the  establishment of  the  Fund  last  year  in

November as part of the scheme to demutualise the two exchanges.

The  Fund will be the receptacle for the proceeds from the  sale

of Newco shares to new investors, and monies in the Fund will be

ploughed back into the financial sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill defines clearly the objectives of the Fund. The

monies  in  the  Fund  will be used, amongst  other  things,  to

develop and upgrade skills and expertise required by the capital

markets  and  other components of the financial sector;  support

educational  and  research institutions and R&D programmes,  and

fund development of infrastructure and projects that support the

financial sector in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fund will be administered by the MAS, and its

activities will be reported

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1920</b></font><br><br>

annually in the MAS Annual Report. MAS will announce details  in

due course.

<br><br><i>Amendments to the Securities Industry and Futures Trading Acts</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final part of the Bill contains consequential

amendments  to the Securities Industry and Futures Trading  Acts

arising  from  the demutualisation and merger of the  exchanges.

All  references  to  "member" companies have  been  adjusted  to

reflect  the  separation  of  ownership  and  membership.    The

definition  of  "securities" in the Securities Industry  Act  is

also  being  expanded to include new instruments such  as  stock

index futures.  This will clarify that such new instruments  are

allowed to be offered and traded on the new exchange.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

fully support this Bill.  As the Deputy Prime Minister has said,

this  Bill  will be beneficial to Singapore.  The  restructuring

and merger of SES, SIMEX and SCCS will help the merged entity to

become  a premier exchange in Asia and make Singapore a hub  for

financial markets in the region.  The trend worldwide is towards

the  merger of exchanges, as the Deputy Prime Minister has said.

We  find  ourselves in an increasingly competitive  environment.

We  have  to  compete not only with the other exchanges  in  the

region  but also against the major financial centres around  the

world.   Therefore,  creativity  and  product  innovations  will

enable  the integrated Singapore Exchange to stay in  line  with

competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand it, the creation of a single integrated

privately-held company through the merger of SIMEX and SES  will

be  completed by end 1999.  Then the open access of both SES and

SIMEX  to qualified foreign investors and financial institutions

will  take place within three years by January 2002.  This  will

coincide  with  the  freeing of SES  commissions.   The  initial

public  offering (IPO) of the merged holding company  may  occur

within five

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1921</b></font><br><br>

years.   Since the proposed demutualisation and merger  will  be

very  beneficial to Singapore, I would like to  ask  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister  whether  he  would  consider  speeding  up  the

process,  assuming  the  various parts of  the  merger  exercise

progress expeditiously and smoothly and ahead of schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting three to five years for the entire process to run

its  full  course  appears to be a long time.   Since  the  said

result  will  strengthen our pole position as  a  top  financial

centre  in  this region, it would be worthwhile  to  hasten  the

process.    Moreover,   the  freeing  of  the   commissions   of

transactions  on  the  SES will benefit the ordinary  investors,

especially  the  small  retailers.   Of  course,  the  speed  of

implementation   depends  on  our  ability  to   find   suitable

management  for the merged entity and conduct training  for  the

staff and executives of the merged exchange.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to refer to clause 13 of the Bill

which  pertains  to  the  regulatory  functions  of  the  merged

exchange.  I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister how  he

intends  to  separate the regulatory functions  of  this  merged

entity  with its other interests.  As the entity will eventually

be  listed, it will have profit oriented objectives.  Hence,  if

the  integrated entity were to be responsible for  some  of  its

regulatory  functions, areas of conflict of interest may  arise.

The  Deputy  Prime Minister has said that the new exchange  will

continue  to perform routine regulatory functions, like  listing

approvals  and  market surveillance.  I am concerned  that  even

such  regulatory functions may on occasions be at conflict  with

the  financial interest of the exchange.  As in the case of  the

corporatisation  of the Singapore Telecom, the Public  Utilities

Board  and  others, when they were corporatised, the  Government

set  up separate bodies to undertake their regulatory functions.

In  this  instance,  therefore,  I  wish  to  know  whether  the

integrated  exchange will continue to be a self-regulatory  body

over the long term, or that the Government intends to ultimately

take over all the regulatory functions of this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1922</b></font><br><br>

exchange.   I  think this is important as the exchange  will  be

listed  in  about  five  years'  time.   The  interests  of  the

shareholders, the broking houses, the management and the  public

may  not coincide.  Hence, I feel that an independent regulatory

agency separate from the exchange should play the overseeing and

arbitration role.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this merger is one of the recommendations of the

Committee  on  Governance  of  Exchanges.   The  Government  has

accepted or agreed to study many of the recommendations  of  the

Committee.   I would like to take this opportunity  to  ask  the

Deputy  Prime Minister whether the MAS is ready to disclose  the

results of their study of the various recommendations, and  what

are  the  further  changes,  if any,  to  be  expected  of  good

corporate   governance   practices  or   additional   disclosure

requirements of listed companies on the SES.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now refer to clause 10 of the Bill which governs the

proceeds  from  the  sale  of shares  of  the  holding  company.

According to press reports, the proceeds from the opening of the

new  exchange to more new investors could amount to between $350

million and $380 million.  The proceeds are a large sum of money

which  should  be put into a Financial Sector Development  Fund.

The  stated usage is for training and upgrading of the financial

industry.  This amount of money seems quite substantial.  I wish

to  enquire whether the Government wishes to, besides having the

MAS  being involved in the management of the funds, allow  other

fund managers; or perhaps allow some involvement of the exchange

in  giving  its views as to how the funds can be used.   And  if

these  funds are ultimately not being fully utilised, would  the

Government consider putting it to other uses, or putting it into

the Government Consolidated Fund?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to conclude by stating once again that I

support  the Bill.  The questions that I have asked are to  seek

further clarity on the functions and the related issues  on  the

exchange.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me

this opportunity.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1923</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise to support the Bill moved by the Deputy Prime

Minister.  I wish to make some observations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merger of the three entities that has been outlined by

DPM  is  to be welcomed if we are going to play a major role  in

the  financial  market.   Thanks to SingTel  and  to  Government

policy, we have got the most shareholders in the region,  and  I

would  also declare my interest that I am also a shareholder  of

some listed companies.  It is very important to have an exchange

that  is forward-looking and I am glad the Minister pointed  out

the  example of Australia and even Hongkong.  However,  I  would

like to be much more nearer home, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Stock Exchange, when it is merged, to try

to  educate the public, because there is this lack of  knowledge

of  how the Stock Exchange works in Singapore, and everybody who

has  got  some spare money wants to make quick bucks, and  their

money  goes into shares.  I am not going to say that  the  Stock

Exchange  should prohibit people from being speculative,  but  I

hope that some sort of public education will do us some good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same vein, I would like to urge the banks in

Singapore to take heed of this Bill, that if the banks  were  to

play an important role in this country, they should try to think

of  merging as fast as possible.  Otherwise, we will  be  behind

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area which I am a little disturbed in this Bill is

clause  17.   Clause 17 of the Bill deals with the  question  of

jurisdiction of the District Court.  As hon. Members are  aware,

if  a  man is convicted in a District Court, his right to appeal

lies  only to the High Court and no more.  He cannot go  to  the

Court  of Appeal without the leave of the Court of Appeal.   But

if the matter is tried in High Court, he has got a chance in the

High  Court with one judge; and then in the Court of Appeal with

three  judges.   In  view  of  the  seriousness  of  the  issues

involved, I hope, if not now, at least in future, the Government

will  consider this position that the High Court should  be  the

proper forum to hear criminal cases.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1924</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with this observation, I am more than glad to support

the  Bill, and I think it is a timely Bill.  In fact, when I was

in  Sydney some months back, I never thought that it would be so

soon, but it has in fact come to this House, and I support  this

Bill.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Leong Horn Kee has

asked   whether  the  Government  will  consider   speeding   up

liberalisation of brokerage commissions.  Indeed, the  timeframe

for  liberalisation  of  commissions is being  reviewed  by  the

Financial  Centre Advisory Group which we set  up  with  private

sector participants, and MAS itself is also studying this issue.

A  number of factors need to be taken into account, for example,

the  schedule of liberalisation of commissions may  need  to  be

dovetailed  with the timing of various other regulatory  changes

affecting brokers.  It is a very swift moving industry.   Events

are happening around the world, and if we are 12 months late, we

may  be  out  of  the game.  So we may well have to  revise  the

schedule.  But there will be other parts of the plan which  also

would have to be dovetailed as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the regulatory functions to ensure that shareholders

are  properly  protected,  the merged  exchange  will  be  in  a

different  position  than,  say,  SingTel  or  Singapore  Power,

because SingTel and Singapore Power came out of statutory boards

which both used to regulate as well as to operate.  TAS used  to

regulate  and  operate the Telecoms industry  and  PUB  used  to

regulate  and operate the utilities industry (water, electricity

and  gas).   When they corporatised, they had to  be  split  and

their functions were divided up into the regulatory part and the

operating  part.   In  the case of the Stock  Exchange  and  the

Futures  Exchange,  MAS has always been the ultimate  regulator.

We  have  always  had oversight, and we will  continue  to  have

oversight and regulate the two exchanges as well as the  holding

company after their merger and demutualisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exchanges themselves will always have to do a certain

amount  of  policing  of  their own rules,  but  that  is  at  a

different

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1925</b></font><br><br>

level, and MAS will always be in an over-watching position.   We

have   to   maintain  a  balance  between  being  hands-on   and

controlling everything and standing back and letting things  run

perhaps in the wrong direction.  We have to be not hands-on  but

in  a  position to put things right, if necessary.  And that  is

what MAS will do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Corporate Finance Committee, indeed, they made a

large number of recommendations which we have been following up,

and we have made progress in many of these.  I think MAS will be

putting up an update soon within a few weeks to keep the  public

posted as to the progress of the work so far.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the Financial Sector Development Fund, what

should  the money be used for and can we take views  on  how  to

spend it?  As Members will know, there is never any shortage  of

suggestions on how money should be spent.  In this case, we will

certainly take ideas not just from the Stock Exchange  but  from

the  industry  and  the Financial Sector  Advisory  Group.   The

purposes  have  been spelt out very broadly in  the  Bill  -  to

promote  the  financial  industry  and  the  infrastructure  and

training - and I think there will be many worthwhile avenues  to

which  the  money can be applied.  Of course, what is  done,  we

will report annually to Parliament in the MAS' Annual Report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai asked why issues should not be raised in

the  High  Court  when  there are appeals against  decisions  of

Newco, whether these should not be heard at the High Court  with

an  avenue  of  appeal to three judges at the Court  of  Appeal,

rather than be heard in a District Court and appeal only to  the

High  Court.   It  is a matter of how you want  to  balance  the

judicial  system and where you want to put the prerogatives  and

the  powers of the different levels of the Courts.   It  is  our

judgement,  and  I  think also the Attorney-General's  Chambers,

that  the  offences  can be dealt with by  the  District  Judges

because they have sufficient expertise, skills and experience to

do so, and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1926</b></font><br><br>

offences do not attract capital punishment or life imprisonment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at a more fundamental level, there is an appeal allowed

directly to the High Court, because if MAS issues a directive to

Newco and Newco is aggrieved by this directive, Newco can appeal

to  the  High  Court, and the High Court will judge the  matter.

And  if the High Court rules against Newco, there is nothing  to

prevent  further appeal to the Court of Appeal,  which  is  very

important, because it will mean that MAS' directives would  need

to stand up to High Court's scrutiny.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [BG Lee Hsien Loong].

<div align="center"><b>GOODS AND SERVICES TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Goods and Services Tax Act to

give  legislative effect to a new scheme announced in  the  FY99

Budget,  the  Approved Contract Manufacturer and  Trader  (ACMT)

Scheme.

<br><br><i>Rationale</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have announced the ACMT scheme in the 1999 Budget to

address  the  GST  burden  faced by some contract  manufacturers

whose  businesses are substantially with overseas clients.   The

increasing  complexity of business transactions has  caused  GST

problems  for some contract manufacturers.  Instead of exporting

the   finished   goods  to  their  overseas  clients,   contract

manufacturers  are  increasingly  also  being  asked  by   their

overseas  clients to deliver the finished goods to the  overseas

clients'  customers  in  Singapore.   This  local  delivery   is

considered a taxable

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1927</b></font><br><br>

supply  under  our  GST law.  In instances  where  the  overseas

clients  who own the finished goods do not want to designate  an

agent  in Singapore to account for the GST on their behalf,  the

contract  manufacturers might end up having to bear the  GST  on

local delivery and have no recourse to claim it back.  This  GST

burden   makes  our  contract  manufacturers  less   competitive

internationally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the ACMT scheme, the local delivery of the finished

goods  by  the approved person to the customers of the  overseas

clients and the fees for the value-added activities on the goods

will  be deemed to be outside the scope of GST and GST will  not

be  chargeable.  Instead, the overseas client's local  customers

who purchase and receive the goods in Singapore will account for

GST.   The  scheme is also made available to other  traders  who

engage  in  value-added  activities substantially  for  overseas

clients   and  face  the  same  GST  problem  as  the   contract

manufacturers on their local deliveries.

<br><br><i>Proposed Amendments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill makes the following amendments to the Goods and

Services Tax Act:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Amendment of section 12(8) to allow regulations to be

made with respect to the time of supply for the purposes of  the

recipient accounting for the output tax;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Amendment of section 20(2) to allow the approved

contract  manufacturer or trader to be able to claim credit  for

input tax attributable to supplies made by him; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Introduction of a new section 37A relating to the ACMT

scheme  such  that local supplies made by the approved  contract

manufacturer or trader on behalf of an overseas client shall  be

free of GST and the recipient of the goods would be required  to

account  and pay GST for the goods as if he had himself supplied

them.   The  new section 37A also enables the Minister  to  make

regulations  relating  to  the  implementation  details  of  the

scheme.

<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC TRANSPORT COUNCIL (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Communications and Information

Technology (Dr John Chen Seow Phun):  Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg  to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Transport Council (PTC) was formed on 28th

August  1987  with  the enactment of the PTC Act.   The  Council

approves  and  regulates bus routes and public transport  fares,

balancing the interests of the commuters with that of the public

transport operators.  The PTC Act has not been amended since its

enactment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, various developments have taken place, such

as  the  deregulation  of  taxi fares  last  September  and  the

expansion of types of bus services such as shuttle bus  services

between  private  housing estates and the nearby  MRT  stations.

The  Ministry and the Council have, therefore, reviewed the  PTC

Act and are proposing to amend the Act to:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) bring it up to date with latest developments;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) increase the Council's size to widen its

representation; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) facilitate the Council's discharge of its functions

more efficiently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain these amendments in greater detail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we propose to include a new section 24 in the

Act  to  empower the Council to exempt any person  or  class  of

persons from all or any of the provision of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1929</b></font><br><br>

the  Act  or  regulations made.  This amendment  will  give  the

Council more flexibility in the application of its decisions and

operations.   For  instance, the Council  has  deregulated  taxi

fares  from  1st  September 1998, hence this  new  section  will

enable  the  Council to regularise the policy  and  exempt  taxi

operators  from requiring the Council's approval  for  any  taxi

fare revisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we are proposing to amend paragraph 1 of the First

Schedule to increase the number of Council members who  are  not

representatives of public transport companies by two, from  nine

to   11.    This  is  to  allow  the  Ministry  to   widen   the

representation of public members on the Council  so  that  other

key  segments  of  the  population may  be  represented  on  the

Council.   This will allow the Council to take into account  the

views of a wider segment of population in its deliberations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining amendments, mainly in sections 5, 12, 13, 19,

21  to 23 and 25, are to regularise the various functions and to

enable the Council to carry out its role more effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 5 is amended to be consistent with other statutes

on  appointing and employing officers, employees and  agents  to

carry  out its functions.  In addition, new sections 5A  and  5B

have been drawn up to provide members, officers and employees of

the  Council  and  persons acting under the  directions  of  the

Council   protection  from  personal  liability  for   functions

undertaken  in  good  faith  under the  Act.   Likewise,  it  is

proposed that all members, officers and employees of the Council

be  deemed to be public servants within the meaning of the Penal

Code.   These amendments will make the Act consistent with other

statutes  where all employees of statutory boards are deemed  as

public  officers.   It  will formally give explicit  powers  and

protection to PTC officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 12 is amended to allow security deposits collected

for the  issuance of bus service licences to be made to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1930</b></font><br><br>

Council instead of the Accountant-General.  Sections 13  and  19

are  consequential  amendments arising  from  the  amendment  to

Section  12.  Currently, the security deposits are held  in  the

Accountant-General's account.  To enable the  Council  to  carry

out its functions more efficiently, it is better for the Council

to hold these deposits in trust.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment in section 21 is to provide for the

procedures  and  requirements  for  the  application  of  public

transport fare revisions to be clearly spelt out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, paragraph 4(3) of the Second Schedule

requires   the   Minister  to  present  the  audited   financial

statements and auditors' report to Parliament.  The amendment in

section 22 is to include this in the main Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 23 empowers the Council to compound any offences

committed  under  the  Act.  This is not  provided  for  in  the

current  Act.   This  amendment  will  give  the  Council   more

flexibility to take action against public transport operators or

commuters who flout the rules set by the Council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 25 contains the provisions of the existing section

22   and  further  empowers  the  Council  to  make  regulations

necessary  or expedient for carrying out the provisions  of  the

PTC Act.  For instance, the Council may prescribe the procedures

for  application  of bus service licences and fees  payable  and

other  procedures  pertaining to the  hearing  of  appeals,  the

powers and duties of officers, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has also taken the opportunity to update the

provisions  on  financial and auditing  matters  in  the  Second

Schedule  of  the Act to bring them in conformity with  standard

provisions of the Government which had changed over the years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I speak in support

of this Amendment Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1931</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, in general, no questions about the main items

relating  to  this Amendment Bill.  But there is one  clause  11

which  refers to section 21 of the principal Act which  I  am  a

little  bit  concerned.   It concerns the  application  for  the

approval   of  fares.   Under  this  proposed  amendment,   this

application  for  the approval of fares should be  supported  by

documents, including certified copies of the balance  sheet  and

profit  and loss account, and any auditor's report, relating  to

the applicant's undertaking as the Council may require.  And  in

considering  such applications, it is written in the  Bill  that

the Council shall take into account the need of the applicant to

remain  financially  viable as well as the need  of  the  public

interest.    I  want  to  ask  the  Minister  to  consider   the

possibility that there should be some efficiency criteria to  be

built  into  this kind of application to review or increase  bus

fares  or public transport fares.  The reason is that these  are

public charter monopolies in a sense.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposals to raise fares in public bus companies or public

transport  companies  can be made of course  provided  they  are

justified.  The justification of it is not necessarily  just  on

balance sheet or profit and loss account, but of course the need

of  the  public.  But there should be also efficiency critieria.

How  do  our  public  transport companies,  in  discharging  its

functions and answering to the public, match themselves  against

other  such  public  transport  companies  in  delivering   such

services worldwide?  With this benchmark, at least we know  that

such  fare increases are justified and not just based on balance

sheet  and  profit and loss account alone.  I hope the  Minister

will consider this point and raise it with the PTC.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as mentioned by the

Minister of State, the Public Transport Council is set up by  an

Act  of Parliament in order to be a watchdog body to look  after

the  public interest where public transport is concerned without

detriment   to  the  financial  viability  of  public  transport

operators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to bring to the attention of the House three

features of the Public

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1932</b></font><br><br>

Transport  Council.  First, the Council is meant to approve  and

regulate  bus  routes and bus, taxi and MRT fares.   This  is  a

laudable  objective.  However, the First Schedule  of  the  Bill

provides  for  representatives of  the  major  public  transport

companies to sit on the Council as members.  I would like to ask

the Minister of State whether the Council finds difficulties  in

carrying  out  its  responsibility in being a watchdog  body  in

regulating  public  transport fares and  routes  when  the  very

operators  themselves  are members.  Is  there  no  conflict  of

interest?   Would it not be more appropriate for the Council  to

be  independent of the public transport operators  since  it  is

meant to regulate them?  How does it regulate itself because the

public transport operators are themselves members?  Furthermore,

if, in addition, in the event of a fare increase, supposing that

the  public  transport  operators would have  to  provide  their

financial  data  and  you have other public transport  operators

also  in  the Council sitting at the table, how then can  proper

deliberation  be done because these are private  financial  data

belonging to a private operator?  So I am a bit puzzled by  this

particular clause in the First Schedule and I would like to  ask

for clarification from the Minister of State.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, since the Bill seeks to increase the Council

size,  can the Council not make it a point to include  at  least

one  representative of the handicapped as a member in  order  to

represent them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, assessment of applications for fare increase and

changes in bus routes requires a thorough understanding of  both

the  demand  and  supply of public transport,  as  well  as  the

financial operation of the public transport companies  in  order

to   assess   the  financial  implications  for  the   companies

concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore support the new section 21 which gives the

Council  powers to ask for supporting documents such  as  profit

and  loss  accounts to support an application for the change  of

fare.   In  addition,  I  believe  that  in  the  event  of   an

application  to  increase fares, the Council should  perform  an

independent assessment of its implications, both for the  public

as well as for the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1933</b></font><br><br>

operators concerned.  It should not merely rely on the  analysis

provided by the operators themselves.  I would therefore like to

seek an assurance from the Minister of State that an independent

assessment is indeed made by the Public Transport Council before

a fare increase is agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to seek clarification from the Minister

of  State  as to the resources that the Council has to  do  this

detailed  and complicated work and whether this is done  by  the

six  staff at present comprising the Council secretariat.  After

all,  unlike  other regulatory agencies such  as  the  Singapore

Broadcasting  Authority or the Telecommunications  Authority  of

Singapore, the Public Transport Council is not a statutory board

but  a  part-time  council, comprising  at  present  13  members

representing all walks of life.  I also presume that  this  kind

of  analysis is not done by the Land Transport Authority as  the

Council's  annual report states that the LTA acts as  the  agent

for the Council in carrying out its operational decisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to seek clarification with the Minister of

State regarding the relationship between the Council on the  one

hand,  and  the  Ministry on the other.  I am  sure  that  close

consultation occurs between the Council and the Ministry.  After

all,  I  believe  that  the  Minister appoints  members  to  the

Council.   My  question  is:   can the  Council  make  decisions

independently  and  if  necessary,  contrary  to  that  of   the

Ministry's?   Is  it  an  independent  body  from  that  of  the

Ministry?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support Mr Chay Wai Chuen's point that he made just now

that  the  need for financial viability should not be  the  only

criterion for assessing fare increases.  I think his point about

including an efficiency criterion is a very good one because  in

all  that  I  know  of  the way the Government  handles  private

companies,  financial viability has not been a  major  criterion

for assessing an issue which is of public concern.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1934</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, since public transport has a direct impact on the

lives of Singaporeans, there is a keen interest in the decisions

of  the  Council with regard to fare revisions, changes  in  bus

routes  and so on.  The new section 22 states the Council should

submit  an  annual  report  to  the  Minister  which  should  be

subsequently   presented  to  Parliament.   The  annual   report

provides useful information regarding the work of the Council in

the preceding year.  I therefore support this new clause.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, however, in the interest of providing the

public  with information and the reasoning behind the  decisions

taken  by the Council, I would like to suggest that the  Council

goes  beyond  the publication of an annual report.  The  Council

should,  soon after making a major decision such as approving  a

fare revision, hold a public forum to explain to the public  the

rationale  for  its  decision. I am sure  that  there  are  good

reasons  for its decision and such a face-to-face dialogue  with

the  public would help clarify doubts and concerns.  This  forum

should  also  be  open  to  the media  so  that  the  subsequent

discussions,  which  would include answers to  frequently  asked

questions that many of the public may have, would be covered and

publicised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I support the motion, but I would like to

seek clarification from the Minister of State regarding a number

of points.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Public Transport

Council  is  doing  a  lot  of work.   In  fact,  our  transport

services,  both the buses and MRT, have improved  by  leaps  and

bounds.  But I would urge the Minister of State to take note  of

some of the areas which I am going to address to him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I agree that there should be a handicapped

representative.  Most of the Council members are car users.   We

should get a bus commuter to sit on the Council.  I know we have

an NTUC representative but it is not enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, which Dr Lee has mentioned, is to have a

feedback unit.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1935</b></font><br><br>

bus  and  MRT  are a very important part of our  industry.   The

passengers  are the best people to give feedback on the  changes

of  routes and fares.  On the fares, Sir, I share the concern of

Members.  The Council has members from MRT and bus operators and

they  are  going  to  decide how much fares should  be  charged,

subject   to  the  Minister's  approval.  We  should   be   more

transparent.  Whenever decisions are taken, there  should  be  a

convention that those who are involved directly in the operation

of  the bus or MRT should not take part when a decision is taken

to  raise  fares.  We should make it a point to see  that  these

people  do  not  vote.  Otherwise, we will lose our  maxim  that

justice must not only be done but seen to be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I would like to comment is this. I

think  the  regulatory power that is given  to  the  Council  is

laudable.   It  should be because after all, the Council  is  in

charge and clause 25 has laid down all the areas which it has to

do and I welcome it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I would like to mention is the

composition of offences.  Why do we restrict ourselves  to  $200

for a fine?  Instead of coming back to this House again, what we

could  have  done  is  to state $200 or such  a  figure  as  the

Minister may approve.  That would save us the trouble of  coming

to  this House, because $200 is a pittance if you really want to

regulate some of the offences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final point is to have a feedback where the public at

large, the users of public transport, can give its views and the

Council could study them and serve the public better.  With that

reservation, Sir, I support this Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I too

rise in support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, ever since the Public Transport Council was

established,  I  believe  the public  transportation  system  in

Singapore  has been operating very well.  Fares have been  quite

reasonable even though from time to time, I have spoken in  this

House regarding the lack of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1936</b></font><br><br>

service  in my constituency but by and large, things  are  going

very well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think the Public Transport Council was established at

a  time  when  the public service providers are very  distinctly

classified  - taxi operator, bus operator, MRT operator  and  so

on.   As we look into the future, we already understand from the

LTA  that the future operators will be different.  The  bus  and

rail will be merged and the geographic areas will be partitioned

and  competition will perhaps be restricted whereas  performance

measures will be slightly different.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to the Minister of State is that, in the future

regime,  how would PTC play its role, or whether its role  would

be changed because of the new public transport scenario.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, allow me to say a few words regarding the

amendment Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree and support the amendments that are proposed. But

there  are  a  few  issues that we need to address.   The  other

changes  that  are to be introduced are going to make  commuting

more  efficient  and  to allow for greater  input  by  commuters

themselves.   That  is  a  basic  question  that  needs  to   be

addressed.  Are the changes to the composition of members to the

PTC  going to be a better check to upgrade and improve the  work

of  the public transport system?  If that is the case, then  the

amendments are worth its salt.  Otherwise, I do not think it  is

going  to be worth its salt if no changes are going to  be  made

and  the  interests of the commuters are not going to  be  taken

into consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the viewpoint raised by the GPC Chairman for

Communications.  He has got a few valid points and I think it is

worth looking at.  But what I would like to say is that there is

a  need to ensure that a balance be maintained between operators

and commuters.  I know it is a difficult task. One has to ensure

that  public transport remains viable but there is obviously  an

interest to ensure that there is no run away price increase.  In

order that the interest of commuters is looked into, there

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1937</b></font><br><br>

is a need to increase the number of people from nine to 11.  Why

nine  to 11? Why not 15? That is the basic question.  What  type

of   representations  are  you  going  to  have?  These  members

basically  have not even taken a bus ride at all,  and  I  think

quite a majority of PTC members are not bus commuters.  They are

people  who live in ivory towers.  One needs to examine and  see

that  there is adequate input.  If that is the objective of  the

Public  Transport  Council,  you have  to  bring  in  inputs  of

commuters  to ensure the quality and efficiency are  maintained.

You  may argue that all this is at a price.  I agree that  there

is a price to be paid but not at the expense of the commuters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a need for PTC to ensure that there is

adequate  audit  of  the  different  services  offered  by   the

companies, and at the moment there is a duopoly.  Only two major

companies,  other than SMRT, are providing the  service  at  the

moment.  I  think  it  is  timely that PTC  allows  for  greater

competition.   There  is a need to re-look at  the  current  bus

transportation  system  provided by  the  two  companies  alone.

Perhaps, one should look at the possibility of introducing  more

changes  for  ordinary travelling commuters,  at  the  new  town

level,  particularly  the  feeder  bus  system.   And  if   more

competition  can  be  brought in,  there  is  a  possibility  of

improving  the services provided by the different companies.   I

am  sure that the Minister of State would agree with me that the

more competition we have in public transport, we may be able  to

increase  efficiency and allow the commuters  to  have  a  wider

choice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that proviso, it is very important that representation

on  the  PTC  be  re-looked  at and a  wider  representation  of

commuters  be  brought into the PTC.  The idea is to  allow  for

better inputs and to bring public transport to a greater height.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, there is another point which I

forgot to mention.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Rai, you have already made your speech.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1938</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Could I just add one point that I have

left out?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am sorry. Mr Jeyaretnam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not propose to speak

on  any particular amendment.  But I do wish to bring up  a  few

points  which have already been raised.  I do not wish to repeat

what  has  been said.  But I think a valid point that  has  been

made is the over representation on the Council by people who run

the  transport  service and people who do not travel  on  public

transport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know how you are going to remedy this imbalance.

One  way  may be to form an association of commuters,  encourage

all  over the island associations of commuters and then ask them

to  delegate somebody on to the Public Transport Council to look

after  their  views.   Alternatively, may  I  suggest  that  the

Government   consider   appointing  an  Opposition   Member   of

Parliament on to the Council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> NCMP?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Please do not laugh at this. I am saying it

quite seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one of the earlier motions that I moved in this House in

1997,  I had proposed an all party parliamentary committee,  ie,

including  Opposition  Members and the  Government  Members,  to

review any increases in prices for basic services  -  transport,

utilities and other basic services  -  that are provided for our

people.   That, of course, was rejected.  It could not have been

passed.  But would the Government now consider seriously setting

up  an  all party parliamentary committee, consisting of Members

from  the  Government  and  the  Opposition,  to  consider   any

applications from the operators for increase in fares?  They can

then make their recommendations to the Council.  You may perhaps

think  that the Council should not be bound by it, but at  least

they will have the views of people who have been elected by  the

people, and they can take them seriously.  That is my suggestion

for enlarging this Council, to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1939</b></font><br><br>

try and find a way to allow commuters to have representation  on

the Council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I wish to put forward is the holding

of  a  public inquiry when any operator or operators  decide  to

withdraw any particular service.  In other countries,   when  an

operator  plans  or announces that he is going to  withdraw  the

services,  and  if  there is an objection from  people  who  are

served  by that service, the Minister then appoints an inspector

to  hold a public inquiry to listen to the objections and decide

whether the service should be withdrawn or not.  Can we not move

along those lines, instead of always having Government appointed

people   on  councils?   Let  us  give  our  people  a   greater

participation  in how things are run in this country.   That  is

the  whole  idea of democracy.  So, I would ask the Ministry  to

consider  these  two  proposals quite seriously,  and  not  just

dismiss them as coming from the Opposition.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I would

like  to  thank all the Members for their support, comments  and

suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, first, take the question on representation. I

think  many  Members  expressed opinions on  representation  and

asked  whether there is a conflict of interest when  we  appoint

representatives from the public transport companies  on  to  the

Council.   Sir, I would like to draw Members' attention  to  the

Act  itself   which  we enacted in 1987.    In  section  21,  we

explicitly  listed the objectives of the Council.  Specifically,

for  fare adjustments, (a) the need for the applicant to  remain

financially viable; and (b) the need for public interest  to  be

safeguarded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the reason why we specifically included the two

provisions  in the Act is to send a very strong signal,  because

if  a public transport operator is not viable, then we are going

to  have  degradation of service and there would be very  severe

implications  on  the  public transport service.   Arising  from

that, in the  First Schedule, we also listed the composition  of

members of the PTC.  There are two

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1940</b></font><br><br>

provisions   there.    The   first   is   the   appointment   of

representatives  from the public transport  companies,  and  the

second is from the other sectors of the population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for appointing public transport representatives

on  the  Council  is  to  allow them to  also  voice  their  own

interest.   That is the intent of the Act when we first  enacted

it in 1987.  This is the way for the PTC to balance the interest

of  commuters against the financial viability of the  operators.

And  if Members look at the numbers on the Council, we have four

representatives  from  the  public transport  companies  at  the

moment.   And  we  have  nine members who  represent  the  other

sectors  of  the population.  As it is, you will find  that  the

majority are from the other sectors of the population, like  the

grassroots  organisations, unions, community leaders,  academia,

professionals   and   so   on.    So   the   public    transport

representatives  are  there,  as  I  said,  to  represent  their

interests  and to provide inputs to the PTC on their  operations

and financial situation, and to justify in front of the majority

of  the  Council  members  who  represent  public  interest  any

proposal for fare or route adjustment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Council takes into account views from all

interested   parties.   This  arrangement   promotes   consensus

building among its members, and has worked well over the  years.

In  a  way, it is not unlike our National Wages Council.  I know

what  Members are thinking of.  They are probably thinking  that

the  NWC  provides guidelines, whereas the PTC  approves  fares.

But   what  I  am  trying  to say here is  that  it  allows  the

different parties to argue their case and then come out  with  a

consensus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me inform Members that since the formation of the PTC

until  today, not a single vote needs to be taken at  the  PTC's

deliberations.  It is all by consensus, and I think  that  is  a

fantastic  testimony of how we work in Singapore, ie,  everybody

looks  at the overall interest of everyone and comes out with  a

consensus that will serve us well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Dr Wang Kai Yuen for praising our public transport

system.  I think this is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1941</b></font><br><br>

a  good  arrangement  and we should continue  with  the  current

practice.   I  take note of Dr Wang Kai Yuen's point  about  the

evolution  of the public transport industry.  Yes, we are  going

into  a  multi-modal public transport operation.  In  future,  I

think it is impossible to get all the public transport operators

to be represented on  the Council.  In my view, we would have  a

future  situation  where  we  have  a  representation  from  the

operators as a whole, and then we have representation  from  the

rest of the Singapore population.  So this is how it is going to

evolve.   And  it is also our intention to continue  having  the

majority of the Council members coming from the other sectors of

the population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GPC Chairman, Mr Chay Wai Chuen, brought up a very

important  point  about the criteria that  the  PTC  takes  into

account  when  they  decide on approving  fares.   And  in  this

amendment, we are putting in place, more specifically, the  kind

of  information  that the Council will ask from  the  operators,

such  as  certified copies of balance sheets,  profit  and  loss

account, auditor's report and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the GPC Chairman that efficiency is a very

important  criterion  and, indeed, over  the  years,  when  they

consider  applications  for  fare  adjustments,  track   record,

productivity  and  efficiency  have  always  been   taken   into

consideration.  In fact, the reason why we have two  instead  of

one major bus operator is to allow the PTC to also benchmark one

against the other, so that the inefficiency of one operator will

be shown up by the performance of the other.  And, of course, we

are   always   paying  attention  to  overseas  bus   companies'

performance and inefficiency, but, of course, it is not so  easy

because  of the different systems, subsidies and so  on  and  so

forth.  But the point is well taken and I assure the House  that

all  these  criteria are taken into consideration when  the  PTC

approves fare adjustments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee asked whether there is independent assessment. Dr

Lee is right that a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1942</b></font><br><br>

thorough  understanding is required in order for the Council  to

properly  assess applications for fare revisions and  bus  route

changes.   Hence, the Council does not rely only on  the  inputs

provided by the operators.  The Council is also assisted by  the

Land  Transport  Authority, which provides independent  analysis

and technical advice to the Council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Dr Lee were to look at its Annual Report, it does not

say  that LTA is an agent to implement operational details only.

It  says that it also provides technical advice to the PTC.   In

fact,  if  you  look at the PTC Act, the PTC has  the  power  to

appoint  agents,  and  that  is a very  wide  power.   An  agent

includes  LTA  and any consultant that they want  to  engage  to

provide  inputs, technical advice and analysis for the Council's

deliberations.  I would therefore like to assure Members, and Dr

Lee  in particular, that the Council is given full authority  in

its deliberations and decisions independent of the Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee also suggested that the Council holds public forums

to  explain  the  rationale  of its major  decision,  and  other

Members  have also brought up a related point.  I would like  to

explain that it is already a current practice of the Council  to

hold  a  press conference to announce major decisions,  such  as

fare  revisions, and explain the rationale.  The  media  usually

reports  this  extensively.  To my mind, this is more  important

than  holding a public forum involving a few hundred  people  to

explain  the policy, because once the new measures are announced

and  the press reported them widely, Singaporeans too will react

and  give  feedback to the Council.  The Council  then  monitors

these    public   responses   closely   and   provides   further

clarifications, if necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to that, there is an on-going process whereby

the  Council receives and responds to feedback from  the  public

through   forums,  like  the  Feedback  Unit,   and   grassroots

organisations.  So the feedback is on-going and we also  receive

a  lot  of  letters from members of the public,  either  to  the

Ministry or the PTC, and the Ministry will channel them  to  the

PTC for their consideration.  So this feedback

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1943</b></font><br><br>

mechanism is in place and it is an on-going process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members commented that perhaps many of the PTC members are

motorists and not bus commuters.  Let me remind Members that, as

far  as possible, we will involve people who can contribute, but

I  do  not  think  it is a prerequisite for PTC  members  to  be

commuters  before  they can become members.   I  would  like  to

remind Members that all of us are motorists and yet we are  here

commenting  on public transport.  How is it?  It is  because  we

take  the  trouble  to talk to our residents, our  friends,  our

grassroots  leaders, and we get feedback and  we  are  genuinely

concerned.  We can put up a very credible argument.  So I do not

think  Members can say that just because most of the PTC members

are  motorists they are therefore not doing their job.   Let  me

inform  Members  that  I  know that PTC members,  including  the

Chairman,  take  the trouble sometimes to go and  test  out  the

public  transport system. In our review to expand  more  members

and  have  a  wider representation, we can try to  include  more

people,  as suggested by Members, but let me explain to  Members

that they have to bear in mind what I have said earlier.  As for

the suggestion that the handicapped be represented, we will look

into it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai commented that the composition fine of $200 is too

low.   If  he  looks at the current Act, there is no composition

fine  in  the current Act.  If a person commits an offence,  the

Act  actually allows PTC  to bring him to court and if the court

fines  him  guilty, then he will be fined up to  $1,000  or  six

months'  jail or both.   So the composition fine is  to  provide

that  flexibility  so that, for fare evasion, you  can  exercise

flexibility.   A  fine  of $200 is in  line  with  some  of  the

composition fines that we have in other  Acts.  So it is not too

low.   In  addition  to  that, in the amendment  Bill,  we  also

provide for the Council to make regulations and prescribe  fines

up to $1,000 for different offences.  So the flexibility is also

there.  It is sufficient for this composition fine to be $200.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo talks about audits and competition. Yes, every

year the Public Transport

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1944</b></font><br><br>

Council  audits  the service standards of the  public  transport

operators.   The PTC has specified the standard  of  service  in

terms  of frequency and the length of bus route because it  does

not  want the route to be too long.  Every year, they do  audits

to  make  sure  that the bus service standards are within  those

specified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for competition, I would like to remind the House that

our  public transport market is a very small one and we lack the

critical  mass to allow free and unbridled competition  in  this

sector,  as  we  had experienced in the 1970s where  we  had  11

private bus companies competing with one another and the  result

was  chaos  and  badly  maintained buses and  a  poor  level  of

service.   But  that  is  not to say we are  not  interested  in

competition.  In fact, as I have said, the competition is  there

in  terms of benchmarking.  In addition to that, for peak  hours

where  the  existing bus companies have got problems in  meeting

the  high demand, we allow the Scheme B service to compete  with

the bus operators.  This has also worked well.  If any Member or

any  company or member of the public feels that there is a  need

for  such  supplementary services in other routes and areas,  he

can put up a case and the PTC will be happy to consider them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the longer run, as I have mentioned earlier, the public

transport industry is being restructured into a multi-modal one.

As  far  as  we  can see, we are going to have  two  multi-modal

operators  by  the year 2002.  When the industry  structure  has

become more established and stabilised, and if there is room for

more competition, we will consider introducing new players.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I come to Mr Jeyaretnam's comments. Again, he

brought  up  old  issues.   He wants an All-Party  Parliamentary

Committee to review and recommend price increases, including bus

fare increases.  Let me remind the Member that his proposal  was

debated in the House and it was rejected.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Why?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Because we do not think the House

is the right forum

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1945</b></font><br><br>

to  do that.  These are matters that we think should be left  to

the Ministry, the statutory boards and the Council to do.  We do

not think this is something that the House should do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for a public inquiry to look into the proposal of, say,

withdrawal of services, and so on, again this is the role of the

PTC.   Whether  it is an addition of services or  withdrawal  of

services, the PTC is tasked to look into all these proposals and

decide.  I do not think we should have a public inquiry just  to

do  this.  If we conduct a public inquiry, maybe we would  never

move,  and that is detrimental to the development of the  public

transport  industry  in Singapore.  So I will  not  support  his

suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would just like to say that the Council's

task  of  balancing  commuters' interests versus  those  of  the

public  transport  operators  is  not  easy.   It  has  so   far

discharged   its  responsibilities,  in  my  view,  fairly   and

effectively  in  accordance  with  its  charter.   The  proposed

amendments   would   enable  the  Council   to   discharge   its

responsibilities even more effectively.  With that, I thank  all

the Members for their support.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> By way of clarification, may I ask the

Minister  of  State, on his statement that the Public  Transport

Council  looks  into  any  proposal to withdraw  any  particular

service,  whether the Council invites the people who are  served

by  that  service  to send in their representations?   Does  the

Council  call  them up and listen to their grievances?   May  we

have an answer to that?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> The Public Transport Council

gathers  all  the  information,  including  feedback  from  MPs,

grassroots  organisations and bus operators.   Again,  it  is  a

consideration involving all interested parties.  So I do not see

anything wrong with that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You are not answering the question.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1946</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> The Minister of State, in his detailed

reply,  for which I thank him, stated that the public  transport

operators  sit  on  the  Council in order  to  voice  their  own

interest.  I would like to seek clarification from the  Minister

of State regarding the following related aspects:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Can the public transport operators not represent their

own  interest by extensive discussions with the members, but not

sit on the Council?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Minister of State likened the PTC to the NWC. The

NWC  is involved in wage negotiations and discussions among  the

parties  concerned.   It  is  not a  watchdog  body  where  wage

negotiation is concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Hence, my third point is, therefore, that the PTC is

not  really a watchdog body, as mentioned in the annual  report.

It  is  a  Council to deliberate on fare revisions  and  matters

pertaining  to  public transport.  If so, I can see  why  public

transport  operators sit on the Council.  But in that  sense,  I

think  further and subsequent annual reports should exclude  and

refrain from having this particular description of the Council.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> I think Dr Lee has not understood

my point.  I said "in a way PTC is not unlike the NWC".  What  I

meant  is  the  consensus  part.  We  know  that  NWC  works  on

consensus.   I  was on the NWC Council before and  the  Chairman

always  said, "Look, it is always by consensus that we  come  to

the  final recommendation."  What I am saying is that there  are

important  advantages of having the public  transport  operators

sitting  on the PTC.  It is not just for them to advocate  their

own interest, but also to provide opinions on matters concerning

the  industry.  I understand her point that we can always invite

them  to sit in and ask them questions.  But I do not think that

is   quite  the  same  as  members  sitting  around  the  table,

discussing   throughout  the  whole  session,   offering   their

opinions,  and  when one transport operator proposes  something,

the other transport operator will be there also to criticise.  I

think there are advantages in doing that.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1947</b></font><br><br>

I  just  want to clarify that that is what I meant when  I  said

that  the consensus and the result are quite like the NWC  where

we  actually have this close relationship between the  employers

and the unions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [Dr John Chen Seow Phun].

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Section 4 of the

Foreshores  Act  (Cap  113)  approves  the  proposed  additional

reclamation  by the Government of the foreshore  and  seabed  at

Sentosa  Cove  containing  an area of  about  9.7  ha  as  shown

coloured  pink on the plan marked 'LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION  PLAN

NO 3/99', which is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Parliament at its sitting on 9th November 1990

approved  the reclamation of about 69 hectares of foreshore  and

seabed  between  Sentosa and Buran Darat (now known  as  Sentosa

Cove).   This  reclamation has been completed.  The Ministry  of

Trade  and Industry proposes to reclaim an additional 9.7 ha  of

foreshore and seabed.  This is shown coloured pink on  the  plan

marked  as "Land Office Reclamation Plan No 3/1999".  A copy  of

this  plan  is  displayed in the Library of this House  for  the

reference of hon. Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed reclamation will bring the total development

area  for  Sentosa  Cove to 116.5 ha.  Upon  completion  of  the

reclamation,  the  land  will  be  used  for  recreational   and

residential  development.  The additional area to  be  reclaimed

allows for optimisation of the development mix and will yield an

additional 150 housing units.  The overall profitability of  the

project  will  be  improved  with the  provision  of  high-value

housing units fronting the sea.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1948</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will take 27 months from the date of approval to

complete  the project.  The Sentosa Development Corporation,  as

agent of the Government, will undertake the reclamation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Section 4 of the

Foreshores  Act  (Cap  113)  approves  the  proposed  additional

reclamation  by the Government of the foreshore  and  seabed  at

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Section 4 of the

Foreshores  Act  (Cap 113) approves the proposed reclamation  by

the  Government of the foreshore and seabed (Stage  4A  and  4B)

south  and west of Jurong Island Stage 3B containing an area  of

about  550  hectares as shown coloured pink on the  plan  marked

'LAND  OFFICE  RECLAMATION PLAN NO 4/99', which is deposited  in

the Land Office, Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Government in 1991 approved the concept plan for the

amalgamation  by  reclamation of the 7 southern islands,  namely

Pulau  Sakra,  Pulau  Pesek Kechil, Pulau Merlimau,  Pulau  Ayer

Chawan,  Pulau Ayer Merbau, Pulau Pesek and Pulau  Seraya  which

are  used  by existing oil refining, petrochemical and  chemical

companies  to  form  Jurong  Island  for  industrial  use.    On

completion of the amalgamation and reclamation of the  foreshore

and  seabed  around the 7 islands, Jurong Island  would  have  a

total area of 3,000 hectares.  The whole amalgamation process of

the  Jurong  Island  was  to  be implemented  under  4  separate

reclamation stages.   To date, the reclamation of Jurong  Island

has    been   substantially   completed.   The   infrastructural

development has commenced and is on schedule to meet  the  needs

of  investors.  The last stage of reclamation under Stage 3B  is

in progress and is scheduled to complete by end 2001.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1949</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI, with the recommendation of Jurong Town Corporation

(JTC), now proposes to reclaim approximately 550 hectares of the

foreshore and seabed in Stage 4.  This is shown coloured pink on

the  plan marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN 4/99", a copy  of

which  is  displayed  in  the Library  of  this  House  for  the

reference of hon. Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reclamation would yield land to overcome the current

shortage  and  meet  future  needs at  Jurong  Island  with  the

expected  expansion  of the petrochemical hub  in  the  next  10

years.   This  would also enable the development of  a  Chemical

Park  and  a  Chemical Logistics Hub that would allow  for  more

efficient management of hazardous materials.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The JTC will be appointed as agent of the Government to

oversee  the  reclamation  works.  The  reclamation  works  will

commence in the 2nd Quarter of 2000 and will be completed by the

end of 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Section 4 of the

reclamation  by  the  Government of approximately  1,908  ha  of

foreshore  and seabed south of Tuas View as shown coloured  pink

on the plan marked 'LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO 5/99', which

is deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Parliament at its sitting on 27th February 1996

approved the reclama-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1950</b></font><br><br>

tion  of  about 372.6 hectares of foreshore and seabed  at  Tuas

View  to  meet  the  increasing demand for  industrial  land  in

Singapore.  The  reclamation work is  now  in  progress  and  is

expected to be completed by the 4th Quarter of 1999.  This  land

has been committed for general, pharmaceutical and utilities use

and  will be taken up almost immediately upon completion of  the

reclamation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recognized that the industrial land on the mainland

could run out as early as year 2001/2002.  As such, there is  an

urgent  need  to  create  more  land  by  reclaiming  Tuas  View

Extension  to  build up the supply of industrial  land.   Jurong

Town  Corporation proposes to reclaim additional land  south  of

Tuas View as shown coloured pink on the plan marked "LAND OFFICE

RECLAMATION PLAN NO 5/99", a copy of which is displayed  in  the

Library  of  this House for the reference of hon. Members.   The

proposed reclamation will yield an additional 1,908 hectares  of

land  for industrial development and also for the siting of four

major  utilities,  namely, a desalination  plant,  a  wastewater

treatment plant, an incineration plant and a power station.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jurong Town Corporation will be appointed as agent of

the   Government   to  oversee  the  reclamation   works.    The

reclamation works will commence in the 2nd Quarter 2000 and will

be completed by end of 2006.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Section 4 of the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<div align="center"><b>FUNDING OF POLITICAL PARTIES</b></div>

<br>3.36 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, why is it that this PAP

Government, which wastes no opportunity of boasting how  learned

its  Ministers and its leaders are, and how gifted they  are  in

leading the country, finds it so difficult to learn an essential

truth.   To  learn the lesson that for the growth of  a  country

economically,  politically and socially, there is  a  place  for

dissent.   That  it is absolutely essential that  constitutional

dissent,  lawful  dissent,  should  be  allowed  and   be   even

encouraged, if the country is to move forward.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developed countries have recognised this long years ago.

And  countries which are developing are beginning to learn  this

lesson.  Countries with autocratic rulers are learning that they

cannot keep out constitutional lawful dissent of its people, and

they  learn it sometimes at great cost to themselves.  This  has

happened in a number of African countries.  It has happened  not

very  long ago in this part of the world when President Suharto,

the  former President of Indonesia, had to learn that  he  could

not keep dissent out and had to give way to the people's demands

for   their  voices  to  be  heard.   But  this  PAP  Government

stubbornly refuses to recognise the lesson.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a time, of course, when it held sway completely

in  this  House from 1965 or so, to 1981, without any  room  for

dissent, and during that time it perhaps suffered the opposition

outside  Parliament.  But after 31st October 1981, when  dissent

found  a  place  in this House, they have clamped  down  on  any

attempt for dissent, for democracy to grow in this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1952</b></font><br><br>

country.  One of the measures that had previously been used was,

of  course,  the  arrest of political leaders,  detaining  them,

scaring them from taking part in politics, and keeping them away

from  any  thoughts of offering themselves as candidates  for  a

party  other than the PAP to this House.  But that,  of  course,

was  not the only method.  The PAP knows that a political  party

cannot function if it is starved of funds.  And so it uses  this

weapon very effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right from the beginning, there was this climate of fear

brought about by the deliberate policies of the Government  that

kept  people from contributing to Opposition political  parties.

The PAP themselves, of course, have no problems.  They have only

got to ask and they will get their donations.  But the people in

Singapore  were  scared into giving anything for the  Opposition

parties.   And  the PAP found that very effective,  and  so  the

result  is  that the Opposition parties find it a  struggle,  an

uphill battle to try and maintain any form of dissent to further

their  calls  for  democracy  in this  country.    And  so  this

continues, and has continued for the last 50 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I explain - I have not got very much time, Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir  - what I am saying by reference to  a  particular

case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the recent judgment in the High Court ordering the

Workers' Party to pay a substantial sum in damages and costs  to

a  group  of  11  plaintiffs, which included  a  PAP  Member  of

Parliament,  the Executive Council decided that it would  appeal

to  the  public  for  help to keep the Party continue  with  its

struggle,  because  there was a threat to  wind  up  the  Party.

Council took the decision to apply for a licence under the House

to House and Street Collections Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have handed to the Clerk copies

of  the correspondence that has passed between the Party and the

Police,  and I would ask that it be distributed to those Members

present, so that they may have sight of the correspondence  that

has passed.  [Copies of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1953</b></font><br><br>

correspondence distributed to hon. Members.]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pointed out to the Police - there should be four

letters,  I  think - that the Executive Council  had  taken  the

decision  as a result of that judgment, and we asked whether  we

may have a licence to make an appeal.  We took this decision  as

a result of two previous attempts, of which time does not permit

me  to  go into in great deal but I will speak a bit later about

them.   So  we  wrote, "Will you give us a licence  to  make  an

appeal?"  There was an immediate reply asking how did we propose

to  do  it.  We said that we would like a licence to be able  to

appeal  over a period of time, and not just one day  as  in  the

case  of Flag Days given to associations, and we said we propose

to  station  perhaps one or two members in prominent  places  to

receive any donations that the public may wish to give.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some five weeks or so came the reply from the police

that  no licence could be granted to us under the House to House

and  Street Collections Act.  The reason is apparently  that  it

can  only  be granted to a worthy charitable cause.  Nowhere  in

the  Act  does  it say that a licence can only be granted  to  a

worthy  charitable cause.  So we wrote back to the police asking

to  be  shown where the Act restricted the grant of licences  to

only worthy charitable causes.  We also asked the police to tell

us  under which of the grounds specified in section 4 of the Act

a  licence was refused, because there are specific grounds under

which  a licence may be refused.  And, finally, we asked whether

our request had been sent to the Minister and whether it was his

decision  or  whether it was the decision of the police  officer

concerned.  That letter was written about three weeks ago and we

have  not  heard  any reply, although I asked for  an  immediate

reply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We asked for this licence, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, because,

as  I said, of two previous attempts.  We first attempted to put

out a leaflet for appeal when the Party's accounts were put into

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1954</b></font><br><br>

receiver's hands by an ex-PAP Member of Parliament and we  asked

for the funds to be sent right to the official receiver, not  to

us.   We were not soliciting in the streets.  We were prosecuted

for  it.  And sad to say, we were convicted, and appealed.   The

appeal  was  dismissed.  We do not agree with that decision  but

that is the decision of the court.  So there was that instance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another instance was when we made an appeal for help for

the  Secretary-General of the Party to meet  certain  judgements

that  had  been  made against him in suits brought  against  the

Secretary-General.  We had an account opened and asked for funds

to  be sent direct to that account.  Again, we were not standing

in the streets or going round from house to house to collect the

monies.   The  police swooped in after a period of time,  seized

the  monies,  closed the account and said we  could  not  appeal

without  their  licence.  Hence, the decision of  the  Executive

Council.  So now, we have applied and we have not heard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am asking in this House now for the Minister - I hope the

Minister  is  replying  - to give categorical  answers  to  four

questions.   We  do not want any "ifs" and "buts".   We  want  a

plain answer "yes" or "no".  We want to know, first of all,  why

is  it  that no licence can be granted to us under the House  to

House and Street Collections Act.  Was it his decision that  the

Workers' Party should not be given any licence?  Or was it  just

the  decision of the police officer?  And why have we not had  a

reply to that question?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I point out that, under the Act, the Minister has the

power   to   exempt  any  person,  including  organisations   or

societies,  from  the  provisions of the  Act.   Should  he  not

consider  exempting the Workers' Party from  the  provisions  of

this   Act   for   this  particular  purpose?   Any   democratic

government,  conscious of its duty to the people  to  provide  a

place  for dissent and the growth of democracy, would  exempt  a

political party making an appeal from any law preventing it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United Kingdom, for the last two years, political

parties with representation in Parliament receive annual grants.

We

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1955</b></font><br><br>

are  not  asking for annual grants.  We are asking for a licence

to  collect lawfully and peacefully any contributions  that  the

public may wish to give to us without any fear or worry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second assurance I want from the Minister here is, if

he  thinks no licence should be granted under the House to House

and Street Collections Act, will he give a categorical assurance

in this House that the police will not interfere if the Workers'

Party  made  an appeal to the public, I repeat, not standing  in

the streets and collecting the money but an appeal to the public

to  send  whatever they wish to the account of the Party  or  to

hand  it in to an appointed official of the Party.  And together

with  that,  an  assurance from this House to Singaporeans  that

they  are free to make any contribution or donation towards  the

Workers' Party.  So I would like answers to these questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, may we have clear, unequivocal answers, not an

answer that is clouded by "ifs" and "buts" and "qualifications".

We  want  a clear "Yes, we will grant you a licence, or we  will

not  grant you a licence.  But you may proceed to make an appeal

provided you do not stand in the streets or do not go from house

to  house."  We do not intend to do that, because the  House  to

House and Street Collections Act forbids standing in the streets

and collecting money or going from house to house because of any

pressure  that  may be brought.  We wish to make an  appeal  and

those  who  are  moved to give may send their donations  to  the

Party.  So may we have the clear assurances from the Minister?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr

Jeyaretnam makes a mountain out of a molehill.  He spends  about

10  minutes introducing the subject, talking about a wide  range

of  matters on fear and whatnot which had all been dealt with in

the  House.   Then with the remaining time he has, he  complains

that  the  police has not replied to his latest letter regarding

whether or not his Party could raise funds in the manner he  had

asked.   In  fact, no formal application has been  made  by  the

Party.  This exchange

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1956</b></font><br><br>

started  when the Workers' Party requested information from  the

police.  Despite that, the police very graciously replied to the

queries and I am told that the police has in fact sent out their

latest  reply.  Perhaps, it has not reached him yet.  So  it  is

not a question of delay.  It is only two weeks.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask, by way of clarification, when

was it sent out because I have not seen it yet?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I understand from the police

that they sent out the reply today.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Today! Thank you.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Two weeks from the time he

wrote,  ie, 20th July - the Public Entertainment Licensing  Unit

(PELU) issues 3,000 permits and applications a month - and  even

then not through a formal application but through an exchange of

letters.   That is the first point.  Let us see it  in  context.

Mr  Jeyaretnam jumps the gun because the police has not  replied

yet.   In fact, the police has been engaging him in a series  of

correspondence  which  I  will ask the Clerk  of  Parliament  to

distribute  [Copies  of  correspondence  distributed   to   hon.

Members.].

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Again, by way of clarification, may I ask

the  Minister of State whether he has read our letter.  We asked

if  a  formal  application has to be made, would  the  Licensing

Officer please let us know or send us the form, and we will make

it.  Have the police sent us an application form?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Whatever it is, the point is

there has been no formal application.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Have you sent us?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, I will not allow

any  more  clarification.   I will allow  the  Minister  his  10

minutes.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> The point I am trying to say is

that there was an exchange of letters between the police

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1957</b></font><br><br>

and  Mr Jeyaretnam which is still ongoing.  Police has furnished

the  latest  reply  which  is now  before  the  House.   But  Mr

Jeyaretnam  jumps the gun and raises this motion in this  House.

Perhaps, he is indeed anxious because, as he said just  now,  he

was  convicted  under the House to House and Street  Collections

Act in 1983, when he was fined.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just reply substantively to his points, having

cleared  the procedural matters because it is not as cynical  as

Mr  Jeyaretnam makes it out to be.  Police has replied  and  the

reply  is  before the House.  Police position is very  clear  in

that  a  licence under the House to House and Street Collections

Act  is required if an organisation wishes to solicit funds from

the  public by means of visits from house to house or soliciting

in  the  streets or other public places.  Police issues licences

when such soliciting of funds is for charitable causes or worthy

community projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give some examples. Examples will include flag day

collections   for   the   Salvation  Army,   Children's   Cancer

Foundation,  Walk-A-Jog  donations  for  the  National   Council

Against  Drug  Abuse, Singapore National Stroke Association,  or

Breast  Cancer  Foundation and for humanitarian aid  collection,

for  example,  by  the  Red  Cross  for  Indonesia.   All  these

licensees  are  charities registered with  the  Commissioner  of

Charities, or organisations with tax exempt status given by  the

IRAS,  or  members  and affiliates of the  National  Council  of

Social Services.  A licence will not be issued under the Act for

collections that are for personal gain or political funding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, the Workers' Party's intention to collect funds to

pay  damages  incurred  for  defaming  others  can  neither   be

considered  a  charitable  cause or  worthy  community  project.

Public charity should not be exploited to underwrite criminal or

civil penalties arising from one's wrongdoing.  This approach is

based,  as the letter says, on section 4(4) of the Act.  Section

44(4)(f) specifies that the Commissioner of Police may,  in  his

discretion,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1958</b></font><br><br>

refuse  to grant a licence if it appears to him that the purpose

of  the collection is objectionable on grounds of public policy.

It is objectionable on grounds of public policy that a political

party,  whether ruling or opposition, because the law is applied

equally  and  fairly across the board, be issued  a  licence  to

collect funds in a public place.  Let me explain why.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police's professional view is that its policy of

restricting  the issuance of licences to charitable  causes  and

worthy community projects should not be widened.  Doing so  will

open the floodgates for other individuals or groups to apply  to

make  collections  for  a  whole host  of  causes.   I  am  sure

Singaporeans will agree with this approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the public policy considerations? Police does not

want the proliferation of public solicitation of funds as it can

constitute a public nuisance.  For example, it does not want  to

see  a  situation  where  pedestrians, including  tourists,  are

constantly  accosted along Orchard Road by those  seeking  funds

for  a  whole  host of causes.  I am sure the Singapore  Tourism

Board ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I by way of clarification ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> No more clarification for you.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I am sure the Singapore Tourism

Board shares this view.  In fact, a proliferation of such public

solicitations would not just amount to a public nuisance but may

even  lead  to frayed tempers caused by persistent  hassling  or

harassment.  All kinds of groups going door to door  to  solicit

contributions for a whole host of causes cannot be any better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In public places, this is all the more so when political

parties   are   concerned.    People  of   different   political

persuasions   may  be  approached  or  pestered  or   urged   to

contribute.  There may be hackling or quarrelling, all in public

view.   The  situation  may then escalate and  others  join  in.

There  will  then  be  public  disorder.   I  think  the  Police

legitimately, being concerned

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1959</b></font><br><br>

that  people  should  not engage in being a public  nuisance  or

there  being public disorder, disallows such applications.   But

this  is  the second point.  This answers Mr Jeyaretnam's  first

question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that political parties cannot raise

funds. There are other ways they can do this.  For example, they

can raise funds through a private collection from party members,

supporters,  well-wishers and friends.  Or they can  hold  fund-raising  dinners.  Indeed, they can make public appeals provided

that  there  are no visits from house to house or soliciting  on

the streets.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I thought I made that clear.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Or in public places. The point

is,  as  for the Worker's Party, we are assuming that there  are

Singaporeans willing to donate to the party to help it  pay  its

cost.    He  asked  for  an  assurance  from  this  House   that

Singaporeans can contribute.  I think it is not for the House to

give an assurance.  It is for the party, if it thinks it can get

Singaporeans who want to contribute to its cause,  to  make  its

case  and the public, I am sure, will examine the party  on  its

record.   Indeed, I understand that there is even an  appeal  on

the  Internet by somebody who may very well be a Worker's  Party

member  appealing for funds for the party with the  address  and

account number given.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, up to now, there is no law against donations to

political parties.  But in the UK, for example, a draft Bill has

been  put before the UK Parliament which restricts donations  to

political  parties.  The restrictions include a ban  on  foreign

donations requiring donations of 5,000 pounds or more to be made

public and banning anonymous donations of 50 pounds or more.  UK

is tightening up in this area, even running before us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottomline really is that Singaporeans abhor money

politics.   This healthy attitude is because the PAP  Government

took a strong stand against it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1960</b></font><br><br>

from   the  outset.   Unlike  other  countries,  the  Government

scrupulously  avoided  travelling  down  this  path.   We   have

explained our approach before. The Senior Minister, when he  was

Prime  Minister in 1989, spelt out three cardinal rules to  keep

money  politics  out of Singapore. These are,  firstly,  observe

strict legal limits on election expenses, hence our cap of $2.50

per  voter for single constituencies and $2.50 per voter divided

by  the  total  number of candidates for GRCs in a parliamentary

election. Secondly, donations should never be made to individual

Ministers  or  MPs,  but to the party.  And  thirdly,  political

contributions must never become a means of buying  influence  or

swaying Government policies.  Hence, we have stood firm by these

three tenets which have served us well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about foreign donations? Indeed, a case can be made

to  prohibit political parties from receiving funds from foreign

sources.  This is the position in many countries, such as Taiwan

and  South  Korea.   As I said earlier, the UK  which  currently

allows   foreign   funding  is  re-considering   its   position.

Prohibiting  foreign  funding of political  parties  would  help

prevent  foreign influence and lobbying in the political  arena.

Foreign  organisations and individuals who provide  funding  for

political party may try to influence politics in Singapore. Some

of  these organisations or individuals may be fronts for foreign

countries  which  want to see a party with a  friendlier  stance

towards  their  country  come  into  power  in  Singapore.    In

addition,  some foreign organisations may, by channelling  funds

to  political  parties  here, promote  their  causes  which  are

incompatible with the unique make-up of our society.

<div align="center"><b>CHANGES IN EDUCATION SYSTEM</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Gerard Ee</b> asked the Minister for Education if he

will  consider making changes in the education system only after

a  comprehensive  plan  has been drawn  up  instead  of  regular

tweaking of the system which can cause confusion and concern.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental objectives of our education system are

to   develop  the  individual  and  mould  the  citizen.   These

objectives  have  not changed. But from time  to  time,  as  the

environment changes, it is necessary to re-visit our  strategies

and programmes, to ensure that the education system continues to

meet the needs of Singapore society and economy.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Committee of Supply debates on the budget

estimates for the Ministry of Education in this House  in  1997,

1998  and  in  1999 just a few months ago, I have laid  out  the

direction in which our education strategies and programmes  need

to  move.   MOE has adopted an ability-driven strategic paradigm

for education and is re-orientating the education system to this

strategic paradigm. The changes which have been put in place  or

announced  recently,  for example, the IT  Masterplan,  National

Education, the emphasis on creative thinking, the new university

admission  system,  the  quality assurance  approach  to  school

appraisal,  the  curriculum and mother tongue language  reviews,

the  review of the teacher-training system (amongst others)  all

tie  in  with  our aims to develop and harness the  talents  and

abilities of Singaporeans.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have outlined the rationale for and the inter-connections among these initiatives in my speeches at the

Committee of Supply debate in 1997 and 1998 and again this year.

I  thank  the  Members  of this House, including  the  Nominated

Member  of  Parliament, for having contributed their  views  and

ideas  during  the extensive debates we have had  on  education.

Indeed, a number of these initiatives have been implemented only

after  extensive consultations, for example, over  more  than  a

year for the new University Admission System.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direction that we are moving in is clear. And the

major  initiatives needed to operationalise the  strategies  and

translate them into action plans have also been laid out.  These

are already being implemented. I assure the Nominated Member  of

Parliament  that  MOE  works closely with our  higher  education

institutions and schools to ensure that our plans and programmes

are well thought out and smoothly implemented.

<div align="center"><b>DIRECT PURCHASE OF 3-ROOM FLATS FROM HDB</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng</b> asked the Minister for National

Development what are the reasons for the policy to disallow  all

applicants  classified as "Upgraders" to purchase  3-room  flats

directly from the Housing and Development Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, HDB does not offer new 3-room flats to flat

buyers. It buys 3-room flats from the open market and sells them

at  subsidised  prices to low-income first-timer  families  with

household income not exceeding $1,500 per month. The sale of  3-room  buy-back  flats is one of many HDB schemes  to  help  low-income families own HDB flats.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upgraders have already enjoyed one subsidised flat. They

should therefore not compete with first-timers for a 3-room flat

from  HDB. They can buy a 3-room flat from the open market  with

the  sale  proceeds  obtained from the sale  of  their  existing

flats.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members are aware, we have liberalised the paging and

mobile  telephone services markets for the benefit of consumers.

The liberalisation means that the service providers are free  to

make  commercial decisions such as how to market to and  service

the  different market niches. These service providers are  aware

that there are legal safeguards to protect minors who enter into

commercial  contracts,  and  that  signing  on  minors   without

parental consent may render such contracts voidable in law.  The

service  providers  must  therefore be  prepared  to  bear  this

business  risk  if  they  decide to enter  into  contracts  with

minors.

<div align="center"><b>MEASURES TO CHECK ABUSE OF POWER BY MEDICAL COUNCIL</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Minister for Health if

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, there are sufficient safeguards to enable

doctors  and  complainants  to challenge  the  decision  of  the

Medical Council prior to the commencement of a formal inquiry.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medical Registration Act requires that all

complaints  lodged with the Medical Council concerning  doctors'

professional conduct and fitness to practise to be processed  by

a  Complaints  Committee of the Medical Council.  The  Committee

comprises  four members - two Council members, one other  doctor

and  a lay person. It will obtain a written explanation from the

doctor  concerned and other relevant documents such  as  medical

records.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After examining all the facts and evidence available,

the  Complaints  Committee will either  dismiss  the  complaint,

issue a letter of advice or warning to the doctor concerned,  or

refer  the complaint for a formal inquiry.  The doctor  and  the

complainant  will be notified of the decision of the  Complaints

Committee.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any decision made by a Complaints Committee that

does  not  involve referring the complaint for a formal inquiry,

such  as issuing a letter of warning, the doctor and complainant

can  appeal to the Minister within 30 days from the date of  the

notice.   When the Minister receives an appeal, he  will  review

the  proceedings  of the Complaints Committee, after  which,  he

could  uphold  or  reverse  the order  made  by  the  Complaints

Committee, or make other orders as he deems fit.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any complaint that is referred for formal inquiry by

a  Disciplinary Committee appointed by the Medical  Council,  if

the  doctor  believes  that the Complaints Committee  has  acted

unfairly or unreasonably, he could apply for a judicial  review.

The  proceedings and decision of the Complaints Committee  would

then be examined by the High Court.

<div align="center"><b>TRAINING OF WORKFORCE FOR KNOWLEDGE-BASED ECONOMY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

what  initiatives are proposed by his Ministry in preparing  and

training   our   workforce  to  face  the  challenges   of   the

transformation of Singapore into a knowledge-based economy.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been working in close partnership

with  employers  and  unions  over the  last  several  years  to

implement initiatives in worker training and upgrading.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP) to equip less-educated workers with certifiable skills has been making good

progress since it was launched in December 1996.  To date,  more

than  14,000  workers  have  either completed  training  or  are

currently  undergoing training.  The labour  movement  has  been

gearing up for the challenge put to it by the Prime Minister  in

his  May  Day  Rally speech this year, to train 100,000  workers

under  the  SRP  by  May Day in year 2003.  Over  the  next  few

months, the SRP for several new sectors will be launched.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is fully committed to supporting the SRP.

We  have  so  far  allocated a total  of  $100  million  to  the

programme.   This  is supplemented by another  $50  million  set

aside  by the Skills Development Fund for the SRP.  In addition,

a  Skills  Development  Centre  costing  $20  million  has  been

established to increase the training capacity under the SRP.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also supported initiatives such as the NTUC Education

and  Training  Fund  (N-ETF), launched  in  October  1998.   The

Government  has provided a grant of $12 million to the  NTUC  to

match  funds of $4 million that the labour movement has  raised.

NTUC has reported that the Fund has received very good response.

More  than  10,600  union members have benefited  from  training

support,  already  exceeding NTUC's initial target  of  training

10,000 workers in the first year of operation.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's support for these programmes

demonstrates  the  urgency we are placing  on  redeveloping  the

skills of our workforce for the knowledge economy.  We intend to

build on the foundation laid by the SRP and other programmes  to

evolve  a  comprehensive  system for  manpower  development  and

lifelong learning.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for workers to become lifelong learners in

order to remain employable in the knowledge economy has been the

key  area  of attention in the Manpower 21 study effort launched

by my Ministry in June last year.  Manpower 21 will serve as the

blueprint  for  Singapore's manpower development into  the  21st

century.  Extensive consultations were held with industry, union

and   community   leaders  to  formulate  the   recommendations.

Initiatives to promote and support lifelong learning  will  form

the cornerstone of the Manpower 21 plan.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of the Manpower 21 Committees has now been

completed  and the Report will be released to the  public  later

this  month.   My  Ministry will then  provide  details  on  the

specific initiatives to be implemented.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has received workmen's compensation accident

reports  for  7 workers injured during the Compassvale  collapse

and are processing their claims under the Workmen's Compensation

Act.  My officers are investigating into the 7th case where  the

employer has yet to report the accident.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the workers injured in this case were construction

workers.  They  are "workmen" and are entitled  to  compensation

under the Workmen's Compensation Act

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Workmen's Compensation Act treats local and foreign

workers  alike. Foreign workers enjoy equal protection  and  are

entitled to the same compensation as local workers.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the 7 foreign workers whose accident reports have

been received, 3 suffered minor injuries. Their medical expenses

would  be  borne by their employers and they would receive  full

wages  for the period of medical leave. For the remaining  cases

where the injuries were more severe, my Ministry is awaiting the

final  medical  reports to determine the  extent  of  disability

suffered  by the workers. If the workers are confirmed  to  have

suffered some disability, they would in addition, be entitled to

lump sum payments for the permanent disability.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a worker is totally incapacitated, the minimum

compensation payable under the Act is $49,000.00 and the maximum

is  $147,000.00. The amount of permanent incapacity compensation

payable in each case will vary depending on the severity of  the

injury, the age of the worker and his average monthly earnings.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to keep criminal records for all serious

offences.    These   records  are  used  by   the   Courts   for

consideration   in  sentencing.   They  are   also   useful   in

facilitating  police  investigations.  Police  do  not  disclose

criminal records to employers, except for jobs that have  public

safety and security implications.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prisons Department already has in place a range of

rehabilitative  measures  to  help prisoners  re-integrate  into

society  upon  their release, when it matters  most.  Vocational

training  and academic programmes are available to prisoners  to

help  them develop good work ethics and acquire relevant  skills

that  would  help  them secure jobs after  their  release.   Ex-prisoners  who  have  difficulties in obtaining  employment  can

approach the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises

(SCORE)  for  assistance.  SCORE has tied up with  a  number  of

companies  that  are prepared to employ ex-prisoners  and  would

assist them in finding a job with one of these companies.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, it is the companies which decide whether to

employ any person.

<div align="center"><b>MEETINGS OF ASEAN MINISTERS AND ASEAN REGIONAL FORUM</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affairs  how  will the meetings of the ASEAN Ministers  and  the

ASEAN  Regional Forum contribute to the prospects for peace  and

economic recovery in the region.



<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent meetings of the Foreign Ministers of ASEAN

and  Dialogue Partners saw a candid and substantive exchange  of

views on a variety of issues, including sensitive subjects  like

good  governance,  human rights and recent developments  in  the

South China Sea, Korean Peninsular and Kargil.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting, the highlight

was the Minister's Retreat.  At the Retreat, we brainstormed the

challenges  facing ASEAN against the backdrop  of  the  regional

economic  crisis and an expanded membership. One of the concrete

outcomes that emerged from this self-appraisal process  was  the

unanimous  endorsement  of  PM's proposal  for  an  ASEAN  Joint

Roadshow.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ASEAN Joint Roadshow will collectively market ASEAN

to the major economies in North America, East Asia and Europe as

an  attractive investment destination. We hope to get the  first

Roadshow  out  before  the end of this  year.   By  pooling  our

resources  and  working closely together on this project,  ASEAN

will send an important message to the world that it is resolute,

effective and united.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meetings that took place in Singapore last month

were  essentially  meetings of Foreign Ministers,  not  Economic

Ministers.  Hence, we did not directly discuss specific  aspects

about   the   regional  economy,  although  we  reaffirmed   our

commitment to remain open, market-oriented and plugged into  the

global economy.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike last year, there was a strong mood of optimism

among  ASEAN  and  the  Dialogue Partners at  the  recent  ASEAN

meetings that countries in the region had turned the corner.  At

the  same time, they were realistic and recognised that  reforms

must  be  on  track  and  protectionist  tendencies  should   be

resisted.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear, however, that peace and stability in

Southeast  Asia  and  the wider Asia-Pacific  is  the  essential

foundation for economic growth and recovery.  ASEAN's  essential

purpose is to manage diversity and differences in Southeast Asia

within  a  cooperative framework.  We are a  very  heterogeneous

region and the potential for conflict is never absent.  Disputes

and potential flashpoints have to be carefully managed to ensure

that tensions do not escalate.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this in mind, ASEAN Ministers met Dialogue Partners

at  the ARF and Post-Ministerial Conferences and reviewed common

security concerns in the context of the broader implications for

regional  peace  and  stability.   In  this  connection,   ASEAN

reaffirmed the need for a Regional Code of Conduct in the  South

China  Sea.  The ASEAN Working Group on ZOPFAN and  SEANWFZ  has

been tasked to elaborate the document.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1973</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was encouraged by the fact that there was a candid

exchange  of views even on difficult and sensitive issues.  This

shows  that  the  ARF has made progress and  the  comfort  level

achieved  by the ARF Ministers has increased over the  past  six

years.   At the same time, the Foreign Ministers also recognised

that  the  ARF  process must continue to progress  in  order  to

remain  relevant.  To facilitate the evolution  from  Confidence

Building Measures to Preventive Diplomacy, Singapore, on  behalf

of  ASEAN, is preparing a paper on the concept and principles of

Preventive  Diplomacy for further discussion in the next  inter-sessional year.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The visit of the Malaysian Foreign Minister Datuk Seri

Syed  Hamid  was  an  introductory visit  in  keeping  with  the

tradition   of  new  ASEAN  foreign  ministers  visiting   their

counterparts.  We reaffirmed the importance of maintaining  good

bilateral relations and noted that both countries should  remain

focused  on  the long-term relationship and benefits  of  mutual

cooperation. We also agreed that both sides should press on with

negotiations on the package of outstanding bilateral issues.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we did not engage in detailed discussions on

specific issues during Datuk Seri Syed Hamid's visit.   This  is

because  negotiations  are  currently  ongoing  at  the   senior

officials'  level.   They  have  already  had  three  rounds  of

discussions,  and will probably meet again later this  month  in

Kuala  Lumpur.  Datuk  Seri Syed Hamid and  I  agreed  that  the

officials  on both sides should try to narrow the  gaps  on  the

issues,  so  as to arrive at a "win-win" package deal.  In  this

regard, he also noted that as our Prime Ministers had agreed  on

the  broad  framework for resolving the issues, both sides  must

translate this into reality. I share his view on this.

Preservation  of  Monuments Board (PMB) and  the  National  Arts

Council (NAC).

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NHB, for instance, has given curatorial advice on the

currently  providing secretariat and curatorial support  to  the

proposed  Malay  Heritage  Centre.   It  is  also  advising  the

Singapore  Chinese  Chamber  of Commerce  and  Industry  on  its

thematic exhibitions at the Sun Yat Sen Memorial Hall.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, NAC has been actively promoting local

cultural activities through outreach programmes such as "Concert

in the Park" and in the Singapore Arts Festival. For this year's

Festival, the ethnic groups that were featured include Singapore

Indian  Orchestra  and  Choir,  Gunong  Sayang  Association  and

Sriwana.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1975</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the agencies' activities are made possible

through  partnership with private and public organisations.  The

Civic  District  Trail  - Singapore's first  permanent  heritage

trail  to  be  launched at the end of this month - is  one  such

example.  Though spearheaded by NHB, this project  involves  the

community  at  large.  The  trail takes  visitors  through  many

historic   sites  and  preserved  buildings  within  the   Civic

District,   reflecting  our  multi-racial  and   multi-religious

heritage.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NAC has been supporting the various arts groups by

providing grants for their activities. These arts groups include

Teater  Kami, Sriwana, Nrityalaya Aesthetics Society,  Singapore

Indian  Fine  Arts  Society, Chinese Theatre  Circle,  Singapore

Association  of  Writers  and  Chinese  Calligraphy  Society  of

Singapore.   Likewise,  for monument  buildings,  PMB  has  been

administering  the  "Tax-Exemption  Scheme  for   Donations   to

National Monuments" since 1994. The scheme is intended  to  help

the  owner,  trustee  or management committee  of  a  non-profit

national  monument to raise funds for its restoration.  To-date,

about  $6.5  million  of donation funds collected  through  this

scheme  have  been  granted  tax-exemption.  NAC  administers  a

similar  scheme  whereby  donations to  arts  groups  channelled

through NAC qualify for tax exemption. For FY 98 the scheme  has

attracted some $6.97 million of donation funds.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding by the National Youth Council for projects

organised  by  youth and youth organisations is drawn  from  the

Youth  Development Fund, or YDF in short.  YDF is  an  endowment

fund  set  up by a grant from the Government.  The YDF works  on

the  principle  of co-funding.  That is, NYC will  provide  only

partial   funds.    This  is  to  encourage  youth   and   youth

organisations to obtain corporate or community support for their

projects.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year, NYC uses interest earnings generated from its

YDF  deposit accounts to co-fund youth projects.  The amount  of

funds available is determined by the interest yield on the fund.

This  sets the budget, and ensures that careful use is  made  of

limited  funds.  With a low interest rate in 1999,  there  is  a

smaller  budget  to fund youth projects.  NYC  decided  to  give

higher  funding  priority to youth community  service  projects.

This  is in line with the NYC's aim of encouraging youth  to  be

actively involved in the community.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st January 1998 to June 1999, NYC received a total

of 455 YDF funding requests.  These requests came from about 160

youth organisations.  Of these, 335 projects or 73% of the total

number of requests were successful.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same period, 18 Malay youth organisations applied

for funding from YDF for 42 projects.  A total of 32 projects or

76%  of  the  total number of funding requests were  successful.

This success rate is comparable to the overall success rate  for

funding requests.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1977</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NYC will continue to promote youth development to

corporate  and  community sponsors.  We  hope  that  with  their

available to support meaningful and promising youth projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need for such an amendment.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, under our constitutional structure

and  legal system, such disputes have always been decided by the

ordinary Courts.  The Courts are vested with the power to review

the  validity of legislation and executive acts on the basis  of

constitutionality.  This is the long-established  way  in  which

constitutional disputes are resolved in common law countries.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in 1994 the Constitution was amended to

provide  for  the  President, acting on  advice,  to  refer  any

question  as  to the effect of any provision of the Constitution

which  has  arisen or appears likely to arise, to a tribunal  of

not less than 3 Judges of the Supreme Court.

Expressway/Braddell Road Interchange project  was  gazetted  for

acquisition on 21st December 1998.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statutory compensation was arrived at in accordance

with  the  provisions  of  the Land Acquisition  Act.   The  Act

provides that the compensation to land owners should be based on

the  value  of the land as at 1st January 1995 or  the  date  of

publication of the declaration for acquisition whichever is  the

lower.  In  both these cases, the market value of the properties

at  the  date of gazette was lower than the value at 1st January

1995.   Therefore  the statutory compensation is  based  on  the

market  value of the properties at 10th December 1998  and  21st

December 1998 respectively, as determined professionally by  the

Chief Valuer.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Government's professional valuer, the Chief Valuer

assesses  the  value  of  a  property  in  accordance  with  the

provisions  of  the Land Acquisition Act and accepted  valuation

principles.   He  takes into account recent  sales  evidence  of

similar  properties in the vicinity to determine  the  statutory

compensation for the acquired property.  He also inspects  every

property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the statutory compensation as provided by

the  Land  Acquisition Act, Government will also grant ex-gratia

Development if the People's Association has any plan to  promote

the  ideal of active citizens as outlined in the report  by  the

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideal of Active Citizens has been an important

objective   of   the  People's  Association   (PA)   since   its

establishment in 1960.  PA's mission has been threefold:  racial

harmony,  social cohesion, and communication between the  people

and the Government.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Active citizen participation in community activities and

nation  building has been, and will remain, PA's modus operandi.

To facilitate this, grassroots organisations (GROs) were formed.

In  the  1960s, Citizens' Consultative Committees and  Community

Centre  Management Committees were formed at constituency  level

for  local communities to meet the welfare and social  needs  of

their constituents.  Since the late 1970s, Residents' Committees

were  first  formed  to serve residents in  HDB  neighbourhoods.

Today,  about 28,000 are serving as committee members  of  these

GROs.   Another 170,000 volunteers are actively engaged  in  the

various activity groups under the GROs.  These are fine examples

of active citizens.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly we need to, and want to, do better. In 1997,

nine  Community  Development Councils  (CDCs)  were  set  up  at

district  level. The CDCs are given more authority and resources

to initiate and manage projects.  They are given matching grants

for  funds  raised for approved projects. Government  Ministries

and  agencies,  such as Ministry of Community  Development,  the

Home  Team, the schools, as well as voluntary organisations have

organised joint projects with the CDCs.  More agencies will join

in.   Through  these  joint projects, the agencies  bring  their

services closer to the local communities.  The local communities

feel  greater  ownership of the services.  More residents  would

help  fellow residents in need through the projects,  either  as

volunteers or donors.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PA will also be helping to form more Neighbourhood

Committees  (NCs)  in private estates.  This  will  promote  the

active citizen spirit amongst residents in private estates, like

RCs have done in the HDB estates.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDCs, the NCs, the many GROs, plus their network

with  Government agencies and voluntary organisations, will give

our  residents  many  channels to be active citizens.   Emphasis

remains  community self-help and self-reliance towards a caring,

gracious and resilient society.  With more channels and  greater

awareness,  more of our citizens will become more active.   They

will  bring  in  new  ideas and new energy,  and  start  up  new

programmes that bring in even more active citizens.  This  would

become a positive cycle towards the active citizens' ideal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS allows banks in Singapore to offer Islamic banking

products and services as part of their banking activities.   For

example,  one  of the local banks is offering Al-Wadiah  savings

and  current accounts.  There are also unit trusts in the market

which are managed in line with Islamic philosophy and laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS has not received any application from Islamic

banks to set up operations in Singapore.  We have embarked on  a

gradual programme of liberalisation, to give foreign banks  with

strong  global  track records and sound credit  ratings  greater

access  to  our domestic market.  We would consider applications

for  banking licences in Singapore by Islamic banks  which  meet

these criteria, as with all other foreign banks.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach is to allow market forces to drive the

development of Islamic banking in Singapore.  Banks will provide

a  service  where  there  is adequate  demand  for  it  to  make

commercial sense.  That banks are already offering such products

and  services in the market shows that there is some  demand  in

Singapore  for  Islamic banking products  and  services.  Market

demand  will  determine the pace at which the range  of  Islamic

banking  products and services available in Singapore  grows  in

the future.
