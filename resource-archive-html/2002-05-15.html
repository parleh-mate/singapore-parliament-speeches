<div align="center"><b>(Paper Cmd. 3 of 2002)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of Supply [1st

Allotted Day].



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Main and Development Estimates of

Expenditure  of Singapore for the financial year  1st  April,

2002 to 31st March, 2003, contained in Paper Cmd. 3 of 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For convenience, I shall take the totals for each head

of  expenditure in the Main and Development Estimates as they

appear  in the last columns of the schedules of the estimated

expenditure under the Main and Development Estimates  Outlays

for  FY  2002/2003  on  pages 24 and 25 respectively  of  the

Command Paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;518 amendments to the estimates of expenditure have been

submitted  this year.  In spite of the sitting  time  of  the

Committee of Supply for each day's sitting being extended  to

<br>7.00 pm and the inclusion of Saturday, 18th May 2002, as an

additional  sitting day, the total times  requested  by  hon.

Members  for  discussion of the amendments still  exceed  the

total times available on the allotted days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such times requested have had to be considerably

reduced  when  I fix the "guillotine" times to the  heads  of

expenditure under Standing Order 89(7)(a).  I would  like  to

remind  hon.  Members that the times for  discussion  of  the

heads  of  expenditure  include the replies  from  the  front

bench.   I  would  therefore urge Members  to  be  brief  and

succinct  when raising their points so that we can  meet  the

"guillotine" times.  The front bench too can assist  in  this

by not giving overly long statements and replies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall deal first with the heads of expenditure in

respect  of  which  amendments  stand  on  the  Order   Paper

Supplement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head U -



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head U - Prime Minister's Office.

Amendment No. (1), Mr Inderjit Singh.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head U of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now, more than ever, the issue of racial harmony is

something  we  have to spend a lot of time  addressing.   The

events after September 11 triggered greater awareness of  the

type  of problems racial and religious differences can cause.

In  Singapore,  we  saw signs of problems starting  with  the

reactions to the September 11 issues and then followed by the

tudung  issue.   Looking back a few years ago,  we  also  saw

glimpses  of racial issues when hiring practices  of  certain

type  of  employers were openly discussed here.   While  most

Singaporeans  behaved rationally through all  the  periods  I

mentioned,  at the ground level there were quite  a  few  who

felt  otherwise and raised suspicions about the other  races.

The  levels of these suspicions are still not widespread  and

are  not  a  cause  of  major concern  yet.   It  nonetheless

highlights how delicate the situation can be and therefore we

cannot take things for granted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a nation, we have made progress in many areas,

including  inter-racial ties.  When I was growing up  in  the

1960s  and  1970s,  most of us were not so conscious  of  our

races  and we grew up thinking of each other as more or  less

the  same.   The  changes which happened in the  1980s  as  a

result of certain policies and practices started causing  the

realisation  of  our differences and thus resulting  in  some

weaknesses  in the race relations' foundations which  we  are

still building.  Some of these policies and practices causing

the  problems are: first, creating the ethnic based self-help

groups  where each feels that only their own kind  will  help

them;  second, high profile campaigns like the Speak Mandarin

Campaigns which are all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>



right on their own, but which were not very well explained in

the early years leading to suspicions of the intent of such a

campaign; third, school practices of segregating children  by

the  language streams that they came from in the past.  While

this  is  less  of  a problem now, it was a  problem  before;

fourth, the creation of SAP schools which again is all  right

for  the  intended  purpose,  but  other  races  never  fully

understood  the  need  for them; fifth, putting  emphasis  on

mother  tongue  and  using  it as  a  means  of  grading  and

measuring  children's abilities to move forward in  education

causing  our  children to focus a lot on their mother  tongue

and also emphasis on them interacting with each other so that

they could practise the language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While policies are important, it is equally important

that  our people interact with each other in schools  and  in

their  daily  lives  to  build  up  bonds.   Today,  we   and

especially  our children do not have enough opportunities  to

interact  with each other.  Even when they go to our  secular

schools, they tend to largely congregate along racial  lines.

The  long  term trend can be detrimental and unless our  race

relations  have  sufficient  depth  and  can  withstand   any

stresses,  we  will have serious problems should  any  racial

problems  arise.   We  should not be complacent  because  the

level  of race issues and stresses we have seen is small  and

our laws could contain any potential problem.  My opinion  is

that should we see any high levels of stresses, the seemingly

good racial ties here may not necessarily remain good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore need to do more to ensure that our people

are  really close to each other and go from beyond  tolerance

and  understanding to fully accepting each other and adapting

to each other's way of life.  Each of us has to make personal

changes.   We  cannot  live  in a cocoon  and  think  that  a

particular  race's  problem is not our own  personal  problem

because  we are all living in the same neighbourhood and  any

problems in the neighbourhood will inevitably affect  all  of

us.  I would like to suggest three initiatives that will help

us deepen racial ties.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, organising self-help groups along ethnic

lines.   I  believe it is about time that we broke this  into

two  components.  The first component basically  consists  of

administrative  fund raising and coordination  issues.   This

could  make  up of people from all ethnic races.  The  second

component  should be the component that actually reaches  out

to  the  various ethnic groups.  Because that has  been  very

effective,  the  ethnic group approach  of  reaching  out  to

people has been the right thing to do.  By organising the way

we are organising right now ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Inderjit Singh, I think you need to be

short.  Please get to the point.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Okay. The smaller ethnic groups

actually  have  problems  raising funds.   When  we  organise

ourselves along the suggestion I am making, it will help them

to  lessen the problem.  The second problem is that  our  SAP

school  children  and  Madrasah  children  do  not  have  the

opportunities to interact with children of other races.  So I

would  like  to  suggest that schools  implement  a  twinning

concept  where  SAP schools and Madrasahs  are  twinned  with

secular  schools so that, during academic time, the  children

can  spend  time  in  the  various schools.   But  when  they

participate in CCA and ECA activities, the children from  the

SAP  or  Madrasah  schools should  do  it  jointly  with  the

students  from the twinned secular schools and, in this  way,

they  will have an opportunity to interact almost on a  daily

basis.   If  they  grow  up  doing this,  they  will  get  to

understand each other even better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I fully support the implementation of the IRCC.

I see it as an equaliser of races. It does not matter how big

the  size of the ethnic group is.  Everyone should be equally

represented in this group.  And I hope that the Minister will

consider funding this group sufficiently so that they can  do

a lot more than just being coordinating agencies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You have taken five minutes, Mr Inderjit

Singh.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, I would like to

take  this opportunity to support Mr Inderjit's call and call

for  more  multi-racial  approach to solving  this  country's

challenges.  One of the major challenges that we have  is  to

reach out and provide help to children from poor families  so

that they will not be caught in the poverty trap.  This calls

for  a national effort.  Right now, this role is carried  out

mostly  by  ethnic-based self-help  groups.   Each  of  these

groups  has done very good work.  But some, such as the  CDCs

and  CDAC, have more resources than others.  This is in terms

of  funding  and volunteer base.  This means that those  with

less  resources, such as SINDA and the Eurasian  Association,

may  be handicapped in their mission.  Moreover, not all have

the same access to management expertise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, we also see a growing number of

Singaporeans of the different races volunteering to serve  in

these  groups  and  they come from all races  -  the  Chinese

serving at SINDA and MENDAKI, the Malay serving at CDAC,  and

so on and so forth.  This is a healthy sign and it shows that

Singaporeans do want a multi-racial approach.  It would  make

sense  for  one  multi-racial  body  as  the  managing  agent

overseeing  such services and tapping from  a  wide  pool  of

volunteers  and funds, rather than the different ethnic-based

groups tapping from their own narrow base.  If I have a Malay

resident coming to me seeking for help, I would not  have  to

refer  him  to MENDAKI, but to this multi-racial body.   This

way, poor students from the different races will then also be

able to attend the same classes together and they will not be

segregated.  It will also send the right signals  so  crucial

in  these times.  That you do not have to depend on your  own

kind  to  help you when you need the help.  This is the  time

for  us  to foster this confidence and not wait until a  race

riot  occurs for us to find out that we cannot depend on  the

other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us, at this time, push forward this multi-racial

agenda.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, the September 11

incident has given us an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>



occasion to examine our multi-racial policy.  After 35  years

of  independence, we have to ask ourselves whether   we  want

our  society to continue in its plural form where  the  State

continues  to accept and work with the various ethnic  groups

or  do we want to allow society to evolve naturally with  the

effluxion of time so that, with it, we have a common cultural

identity emerging that is characterised to a large extent  by

cross cultural influences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this point may well be illustrated by looking at

the American society.  We all know that the United States  is

characterised largely by a society that is made up of migrant

people, it is cosmopolitan in nature.  But, however,  if  you

look  at  the third and fourth generations, it would be  very

difficult  for them to continue with their cultural practices

and   native  language.   Many  American-born  Chinese,   for

example,  grow  up  in  the US without speaking  the  Chinese

language properly.  And yet, in America, you find that  there

is  an  emerging  distinct  identity  of  Americans  who  see

themselves as a new American that is divorced almost entirely

from  their ethnic origins.  This is the kind of new American

that  has  created a separate and distinct identity that  the

world can identify with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we may well ask whether the United States' model

has  any  relevance for us here.  I would say yes,  when  you

look  at it from the perspective of community bonding.   Sir,

by community bonding, one would suppose a sense of feeling as

one, united by a common cultural experience and founded in  a

common  language.  The Singapore model, for want of a  better

word,  arguably works towards the reinforcement of  different

cultural identities.  In our official media, for example,  we

pay  formal recognition to the four major languages  that  we

identify  as  official.  In many public  functions  that  are

organised    by   State   agencies   and   community    based

organisations,  the  organisers  are  required  to  pay   the

obligatory  lip service by ensuring that the  dances  of  the

four  major  ethnic groups are represented.  I am quite  sure

that  this  phenomenon takes place across the island.   While

pursuing this separate and distinct



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>



cultural  identity to a fault, the question that we  have  to

ask  is  whether  such  policies will  help  to  promote  and

reinforce  community bonding here.  My suspicion is  that  it

does not.

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from witnessing more cross-cultural exchanges, my

own  observation  and experience is that  ethnic  groups  are

becoming  more  insular  and inward-looking  in  their  daily

lives.   Is  it any wonder that when RCs organise educational

visits,  it  is  mainly the Chinese who attend  these  tours,

perhaps  because temple visits are a part of  the  itinerary?

Is  it any wonder also that Malays also prefer the comfort of

interacting  within the extended family and the  confines  of

the  mosques?  And is it any wonder that most CCs often  find

it difficult to have more members for the IAECs because there

are not enough of such volunteers around?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the retreat to their comfort zones is no doubt

spurred  on  by  the  greater familiarity of  the  respective

languages.  Unless such tendencies are checked, it  would  be

difficult indeed to see how greater community bonding  across

races can be achieved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, society and cultural values and practices have a

way of evolving naturally that is not necessarily defined  by

the  state.   I believe that any body of people  would,  over

time, produce a set of shared values and practices that forms

the basis of the group's identity that need not be determined

extraneously.   In  our  case, we could  perhaps  use  proper

Singapore English as a basis for the new Singaporean identity

that transcends all individual cultural barriers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we accept this suggestion as the way forward, we

have   to  fundamentally  redefine  the  way  in  which   our

Government  takes the initiative in preserving  our  cultural

heritage.   For instance, the Speak Mandarin Campaign  should

be   left  entirely  to  the  community  groups  to  promote.

Secondly,  the various community self-help organisations,  as

my two colleagues had advocated eloquently



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>



earlier,  should  be  reorganised into  one  large  self-help

organisation  that  is  independent  of  race,  language   or

religion.  The Government, on the other hand, could well just

allow  and  focus on the natural development  of  the  proper

Singapore  English.   Over time, it is hoped  that  a  common

language  will  be  the  social glue that  binds  the  people

together  and, over time, it is hoped that our people  should

not  feel that they have lost their cultural heritage  simply

because  they do not speak the language.  What matters  most,

as  I have said earlier, is that they must feel that they are

still  who they are ethnically and yet, at the same time,  be

bonded  by  a  stronger common identity which  they  feel  in

common with those of the other ethnic groups.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> The MPs have raised points on an important

subject.   Our  philosophy has always been to promote  social

integration and a common national identity among Singaporeans

while  ensuring  that  each  community  can  retain  its  own

cultural identity and heritage.  So, we facilitated ways  for

Singaporeans  to live, learn and socialise in  an  integrated

environment.   We  have  key policies  in  education,  public

housing and People's Association programmes as examples which

help  to  maintain  the common space where  Singaporeans  can

interact with other races.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, at the same time, we cannot force the pace beyond

what  people  are  comfortable with,  otherwise  it  will  be

counter-productive, because each community  wants  to  retain

its  own identity and to have its own space where members can

interact  with  one another, as Mr Sin Boon Ann  says,  their

comfort  zone.  And we must also recognise that the  tendency

for  different  groups to segregate will  always  be  present

because of different customs and religious requirements.  And

heightened  religious  consciousness,  strict  observance  of

rules  of  diet, dress, conduct, particularly among  Muslims,

have accentuated this tendency to separateness.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present situation, we need to make greater

efforts to strengthen inter-racial ties, especially among the

leaders  of  the different communities, so that we  can  deal

with any problems which may arise.  And we are actively doing

this  through  IRCCs  and  via activities  in  the  community

centres  to  reach  out  and bring together  Singaporeans  of

different races.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-help groups are not the root cause of ethnic

consciousness  or  of  the  distance  between  the  different

communities.  They were set up for a specific purpose, ie, to

help  the under-achievers in each community to overcome their

problems and uplift themselves, especially educationally,  in

a  way which a multi-racial group will find difficult to  do.

In this respect, the self-help groups have done well and will

continue to play a role.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the self-help groups do encourage

their  respective  communities to interact  more  with  other

communities.    Often,  they  have  volunteers   from   other

communities  and they collaborate to organise  activities  at

festivals  such as Deepavali, Christmas, Hari Raya  Puasa  or

Chinese  New  Year.   These  events help  bring  Singaporeans

together  from different ethnic groups and better  understand

and appreciate each other's values and customs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But looking ahead, the self-help groups can do more to

work  closely in partnership with one another.  As the  Prime

Minister  suggested  last  week, they  should  partner  other

groups  and  agencies  to run tuition and  other  programmes,

rather  than duplicate services.  For example, the  self-help

groups  are  planning  to organise and run  a  joint  service

centre  in Toa Payoh with an integrated management and staff,

and  cooperating with the CDC and, if this works, we will  be

able  to  do  it  in  other towns as well.  This  partnership

approach  will  prevent us from swinging unwittingly  to  the

undesirable  extreme  which the MPs have  highlighted,  where

more  and  more social services and programmes  are  provided

along  ethnic  lines.   It  will  also  enable  us  to   pool

resources,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>



minimise duplication and address Mr Inderjit Singh's  concern

that  the small self-help groups may be disadvantaged because

of their limited access to funds and resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also spoke about the need for regular

interaction  of  our  school children with  other  races  and

suggested twinning of schools where students can do their co-curricular    activities   or   extra-curricular   activities

together.   It  is  an  idea which  is  worth  exploring.   I

understand  that  MUIS, the Madrasahs  and  our  schools  are

actively  looking on programmes to enable their  students  to

interact   with  other  races  and  appreciate  the  national

perspective.  The Ministry of Education and MCDS  will  study

to see how we can promote this further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also suggested that the IRCCs be given

a  budget  to  tap on for their activities to promote  racial

interaction.  The IRCC is really an extension of the Citizens

Consultative  Committee.   It is  not  meant  to  be  another

formalised  and  structured  or  activity-centric  grassroots

committee.    For  a  start,  to  better  understand   ground

conditions   and  build  rapport  with  the  relevant   local

establishments,    many   IRCCs   have   visited    religious

institutions like temples, mosques, churches and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next phase, they could initiate informal

dialogue and chit-chat sessions with local groups to identify

pressing areas and practical opportunities for building inter-ethnic understanding.  Both the CDCs and the CCCs can finance

these  efforts  and the People's Association  will  seek  the

concurrence  of the Grassroots Grants Committee  to  increase

the   allocation  of  grassroots  grants  to  the  CCCs   for

activities promoting racial harmony.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the continual

injection  of  talents into the civil service is  crucial  to

maintaining a vibrant and dynamic service.  However, the size

of  the  civil  service is capped to ensure that  it  is  not

bloated.  My colleague, Mr Inderjit Singh, even called for it

to  be scaled down by 30%.  Moreover, when a young officer is

recruited at an age fresh out of university,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>



he  has a 30-year working life in the service.  With all  the

scholars we have recruited in the service all these years, it

is  possible  that we have reached a point where  the  annual

intake  of  scholars far outnumbers those  retiring  officers

based  on  natural  attrition.   Furthermore,  the  terms  of

service  are  also  so attractive that few  would  leave  the

comfort zone to strike out on their own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in many cases, those who are good in academic

studies   make  better  researchers  and  academicians   than

Division 1 officers.  To my mind, Sir, it would be better for

the  Government  to recruit those with proven abilities  from

the  market  and  to  depend less on the scholars.   This  is

especially so for those in the elite Administrative  Service.

As  regards the scholars that we have already signed  on,  it

might be better to assign them to the private sector, such as

those in the GLCs, to test them out first.  I understand that

there is a programme to attract mid-career officers, but  the

outcome to date has been quite poor.  May I know what are the

reasons?  Would the Government review the mid-career  options

and  renew the emphasis on this?  I believe, with the current

recession, it would be a good time to tap the market for mid-career officers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Zainul Abidin is not here. Mr Steve

Chia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir,

currently the scholarship bond is strict and non-convertible.

Our  best  and brightest students are sent over to  the  best

universities overseas to learn and mix with the world's  best

and  brightest.  Then, they are asked to come back and  serve

in  the  public service or the Armed Forces with a fast-track

career.  This may have served the public administration,  the

Armed  Forces and the statutory boards well in the  past  and

the  present.   But the time has come for us  to  expand  the

system a little bit further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no longer enough to send out brightest students to

these prestigious schools for four years and then get them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>



to come back to serve.  Will the Government consider allowing

some of these scholars, those who are interested and able, to

secure  careers  on  their  own  with  the  top  500  Fortune

companies, to allow them to postpone serving their bonds  for

a period of time?  Let them gain work experience in these top

MNCs,  learn  their  system, adopt their  work  cultures  and

benefit  by  dealing with the companies' best and  brightest.

After  five to 10 years, when these scholars are prepared  to

come  back  to Singapore, they may be invited back  to  serve

Singapore  in  any  of the sectors or industries,  public  or

private.  If they do not intend to come to Singapore at  all,

then  we  can  exercise the contractual bond and demand  high

compensation  for breaking the contract.  This  will  be  our

best  form  of international talent that we can  develop  and

groom and call our own.  We can be proud if a few of our  top

scholars are groomed to climb the corporate ladders in  these

top MNCs and then come back to serve their duty in Singapore,

in one of the SMEs or the GLCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the details and technicalities can be worked

out if this idea is considered.  I hope the Ministry can take

some  of these initiatives to prepare Singapore for long-term

competitiveness.  I hope the Prime Minister can look  further

and explore the feasibility of this proposal.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, the Government is an

enlightened  and  exemplary employer in all  aspects,  except

when  it  comes  to  the medical benefits  scheme  for  civil

servants.   Under  this scheme, family members  of  a  female

civil  servant  are not entitled to medical benefits  in  the

same way as those of their male counterparts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, tell me how I can explain to the women, such as our

SAF  women  regulars and our many top women  civil  servants,

that this is a patriarchal society, so just accept it?  Women

have  made  great strides over the years.  We  have  a  woman

commanding officer in the artillery, and a woman captain of a

ship  in the Navy.  If you are on a ship going to battle,  it

does not matter if you are a man or a woman.  You are on  the

same battleship going to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>



war,  defending  your country.  The risk is  the  same.   The

rewards, too, must be equal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told us

about the new Medisave scheme for civil servants.  They  have

$350  worth of outpatient allowance that the men can use  for

their children but the women cannot.  At the end of the year,

the  unused  balance goes into their Medisave, which  can  be

used  to  pay  for their dependants' medical treatment.   So,

Deputy  Prime Minister Lee said it is essentially  the  same.

But  it  is not the same.  The distinction found in  the  old

scheme is still found in the new scheme.  The men can use the

$350  worth of outpatient allowance for their dependants  and

the  women cannot.  In dollar terms, the distinction  may  be

very  small but, in symbolic terms, nothing has changed.   It

is  still  unequal  benefits for equal  work.   It  is  still

unfair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on Monday, when Deputy Prime Minister Lee extended

the  procreation tax rebate to divorcees, he said, "It is not

a  lot  of  money, but it is a matter of fairness."  Exactly.

This is also about fairness.  Sir, this policy, whether it is

the  old scheme or new, affects a big number of women.  There

are  33,000 women in the civil service.  That is 54%  of  the

public-sector workforce.  But its impact goes far beyond  the

civil service.  We know that the private sector looks to  the

public  sector  to  set  the tone for society  and  sees  the

Government as a role model for staff and welfare benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Government to remove this anachronism.

It  does  not  do justice to the progress of Singapore  women

over  the  years, nor to our fine Singapore system which  has

allowed many women to compete with men on an equal basis.  If

the Government still refuses to change this policy, I am sure

many  women would appreciate it if the Deputy Prime  Minister

can provide a very detailed explanation as to why this policy

needs to stay in the national interest.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is in our national interest to involve women

more at all levels.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Ng, I will give you another 30

seconds.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> We cannot tackle all the

problems  that  we face, if we do not include  women  in  all

levels.   Sir,  I  would urge the Deputy  Prime  Minister  to

consider  setting up a national women's council, in the  same

way as we have set up a National Council for Youths to engage

young Singaporeans.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong):</b> Sir, we have a dedicated

civil service.  It is lean and efficient.  According to PERC,

it is ranked the least bureaucratic of the 12 Asian economies

covered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service also implements initiatives to improve

itself,    for   example,   Quality   Service,   ExCEL    and

Organisational Review.  There are recent initiatives with  IT

such  as ZIP and "Innovator Activist" awards.  Yet there  are

still  many  complaints  of bureaucratic  indecisiveness  and

tardiness.  There  are also complaints of rudeness  and  poor

communication  skills  by frontline  officers  in  explaining

policies  clearly.   People wonder if  these  civil  servants

think  they are doing taxpayers a favour or they are  serving

the taxpayers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the administrative system need to change? We

are   facing  stiff  global  competition,  more  uncertainty,

greater information flow and shorter reaction time.  There is

also  the  higher  expectation of better  educated  and  more

demanding  citizens.  In a globalised environment,  decision-making  has also become more complex.  There are many  angles

to  a  problem.   Thus,  a  one-size-fits-all  administrative

structure and processes are no longer applicable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than sovereignty and security areas, as many areas

as  possible  could  operate like the private  sector,  where

possible,  corporatise and privatise the services.   However,

the social role, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>



integrity and transparency of the civil service should not be

eroded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of change? The civil service needs to change

in the following areas:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, be even more customer-focused and strive to

meet the needs of the customer.  If we place customers first,

we become very responsive to change in market needs, that is,

customers' preferences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote you an example of a cinema industry. We

used to have large cinemas that could seat a large number  of

people. Today, we have cineplexes that give customers greater

choice  based  on taste and preferences.  Small cinema  halls

are both efficient and effective.  If the cinema industry had

not made this move, it would have collapsed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the housing industry. A private developer would

build apartments of different sizes to give customers choices

based  on  their  principle of supply and  demand.   HDB  can

consider doing the same.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The childcare industry is a good example. It was

privatised and is able to provide more choices from community

childcare  to upmarket Montessori childcare and  yet  fulfill

the Government's social role through subsidy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, compete for effectiveness. We should use

competition  as  a  tool  for  improvement.  When  there   is

competition, there is greater choice. To draw customers,  you

need  to  be  efficient and effective in  your  services  and

products  and competitive in price. We should allow services,

traditionally  run by the public sector  to  be  run  by  the

private  sector, for example, the transport sector.  However,

we must bear in mind the affordability of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, build an enterprising culture in a public

organisation.  The management of public organisations must be

enterprising  and pro-active in seeking out ways  to  provide

services.   The  CEO  can  make quick,  autonomous  decisions

without bureaucratic layers.  For example, it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>



timely  for  our sports council to be privatised and  provide

comprehensive lifestyle services at the sports complexes.  It

can  extend  the  scope  of  its involvement  in  the  sports

business in Singapore. This will impose competition on  small

and medium sized enterprises.  However, we can invite them to

work together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, focus on developing leadership and human

capital.   Today,  the  human  factor  has  become  the   key

ingredient for success.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mrs Yu-Foo, could you please complete

your speech?

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon:</b> Yes, Sir. Our civil service must

continue  to develop its people, not only those in leadership

position but at all levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy to prescribe the number of hours of training

for  employees. This may improve their skills, but it is  not

enough  to create an entrepreneurial team.  How do we  change

mindsets  to make civil servants more enterprising  and  more

accountable  for  their actions?  We must  be  more  open  to

private  sector leaders taking up public sector positions  at

all levels, as my colleague, Dr Wang Wai Kuen also suggested,

not  just at the top policy-making level.  I understand  that

we tried that before.   We should continue to actively pursue

this area.  In many instances, reforms have been initiated --

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Your time is up, Mrs Yu-Foo.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon:</b> Can I make one point, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> One word!

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon:</b> I would like to urge all the

Ministries and organisations who provide services to link  up

through IT, to give a one-stop service to the people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is more than one word. Mr Chew.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, I shall be short

and sharp.  Over the years,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>



MPs  and  Ministers have emphasised the importance of private

sector inputs and injecting fresh ideas and talents into  the

civil  service. Some 5-6 years ago, the Government  tried  to

recruit   some  private  sector  executives  to   the   elite

Administrative  Service.   However,  as  we  understand,  the

response   was   poor  and  only  a  handful  of   executives

participated  in  the  scheme and,  for  the  few  mid-career

private  sector  talents who had joined  the  civil  service,

including  the high profile, Dr Finian Tan, most have  lasted

only about two to three years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a recent article in the Straits Times on 24th April

said that the Public Service Division is indeed embarking  on

a new campaign to woo more private sector talents to join the

civil service.  This is good news.  Just last month, the  PSD

also  announced  that  its  Administrative  Officers  go   on

attachment with global consulting firms like McKinsey,  while

the  EDB  said  that  they would try to  draw  in  mid-career

executives from the private sector to join its service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past few years, we have also seen the

Government tapping on more and more private sector expertise,

by getting them to serve on its various committees to provide

inputs  and  ideas  for  policy formulations.   The  Economic

Review  Committee and its various sub-committees is one  such

example.  Sir, they are all steps in the right direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe Singaporeans are generally supportive of

this  idea and in a rapidly changing economy, more new  ideas

and  a  willingness  to try new ideas  are  required  in  our

bureaucracy.  Changing  the mindsets  of  civil  servants  is

equally  important and should be an on-going  process.  Civil

servants  must  accept  that they  are  not  perfect  and  be

prepared to admit that certain policies are wrong and correct

them  early.   Inducting  private  sector  talents  who  have

experienced the harsh realities of the business world outside

is  an essential part of the process of changing mindset  and

self-renewal.  Selecting and appointing Ministers from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>



the  private sector have contributed to this idea generation,

changing mindsets and implementation process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent batch of our junior Ministers, majority of

whom  are  from the private sector, is indeed  a  good  move.

More must be done.  Sir, we should be looking forward to  the

day  when some from among our Permanent Secretaries  will  be

drawn from the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, like to ask the Deputy Prime

Minister whether the Government, drawing on the experience of

recent  years, now has a comprehensive plan and, if so,  what

is  this  plan  to  further achieve this  goal  of  inducting

private sector talents into the civil service, as part of the

overall  objective and mission of renewing and  strengthening

the   civil  service  and  changing  the  mindsets  of  civil

servants.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, in the context

of  the  Singapore economy, the role of the public sector  is

extremely  important.   Our  growth  record  is  in  part   a

testimony  of  the  high  standards that  our  civil  service

operates on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as competition heats up on a global scale, it

is  imperative that the public sector move in tandem with the

changing private sector and continually reinvent itself.   In

this  regard,  I would like to raise two areas of  importance

for the DPM's response - the need to be more customer-focused

and to improve our inter-agency coordination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, more customer-focused. How does the civil

service  internalise  the need to be  more  customer-centric?

How  does  it  strive  to  serve the public,  especially  the

business sector, to have empathy and to be spontaneous  about

it?   Sir, there is a real need to have substance beyond  the

mere  form  of  efficiency.   For example,  it  is  extremely

frustrating  to suffer the curse of a very politely  recorded

voicemail  when  all  you want is some  clarification.   Many

SMEs,   when   applying  for  assistance  under  the   myriad

Government  schemes,  have recounted experiences  of  dealing

with young bureaucratic officers, whose fault



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>



lies   not   in  the  lack  of  experience,  but   in   their

unwillingness to listen and understand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, how have working and servicing hours changed?

With  most  Singaporeans working longer hours,  it  would  be

helpful  if  public  service can be provided  without  people

having to take leave just to attend to personal matters  with

Government agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, inter-agency coordination. Sir, I have had

first-hand experience on this in my private Estate  Upgrading

Programme  (EUP)  and I know now that I am not  very  popular

with  several agencies.  The greatest challenge  in  the  EUP

was,  surprisingly, not in consulting the residents,  nor  in

the  design, but in the areas of overlap between two or worse

still, more Government agencies.  There was frequently  great

reluctance  to  take the perspective of the  end-user  or  of

another  agency as it may mean having to go the  extra  mile.

Preserving the status quo appears to rank supreme,  certainly

well above customer satisfaction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another occasion, it took my town council almost two

months  to  realise  that  no agency  wanted  to  acknowledge

ownership  of  a  tract  of  land  for  which  residents  had

requested  some  lighting.  As we were getting  nowhere,  the

lamp post went up anyway.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the DPM how the civil service

can be more customer-centric and how they can be incentivised

to ensure smooth inter-agency coordination.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, Dr Wang Kai Yuen talked about

scholars  not necessarily making good Administrative Officers

and  recommending that we recruit from the market and  depend

less  on  scholars.  I would agree with him that academically

able  people  are  not automatically good  managers  or  good

Administrative Officers.  When we select scholars, we try our

best  to find people who are not only academically good,  but

have  something  extra, so that they have a  good  chance  of

turning  out to be successful Administrative Officers.   Some

do, some do not. By



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>



and  large, I think the quality of our civil service  is  not

bad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do want to have more come in mid-career or from the

private  sector, as Dr Wang Kai Yuen and Mr Chew  Heng  Ching

suggested.  We have been quite successful generally  bringing

in   people  from  different  walks  of  life.   But  in  the

Administrative   Service  itself,  we  have   not   been   so

successful.  We only had a small number come in.  Perhaps, it

is  because  our  standards are high.  Perhaps,  it  is  also

because  in  the Administrative Service, it is  necessary  to

build  up,  over  a  long period of time,  knowledge  of  the

Government, how it works, as well as the culture and the  way

the  organisation operates.  That is not easily achieved  for

somebody who comes in mid-way, however able and however broad

his past experience to do.  It is not a problem unique to the

Singapore  civil  service.  Many other  civil  services  have

tried the same - the Australian, New Zealanders and British - and they tell us that they have the same difficulties. But we

will continue trying.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for seconding Administrative Officers to companies,

we  do  that.  Yesterday, we were criticised for  doing  that

with  the GLCs.  We do not just do it with the GLCs. What  we

try  to do is to attach them to companies like Shell or  even

management  consultant  companies,  like  McKinsey  or  other

institutions  where they can learn something  and  come  back

with a different perspective, and know what it is like to  be

on  the receiving end of a directive or instruction, and also

to  know what it is like to have a bottom-line responsibility

and  be  more  profit-focused, when they come back  into  the

civil  service.  In the private sector, time  is  money.   To

you,  it  is two weeks to write a paper; to them, it  is  two

weeks'  worth  of  salaries and overheads.   We  do  want  to

encourage this further and we are trying hard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia suggested allowing scholars to serve their

scholarship bonds for five or ten years with the Fortune  500

companies.   I  think this is difficult  to  do  because  the

fundamental  motive of Government scholarships is  to  ensure

that the public sector gets its fair share of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>



talent  to  contribute to the development of  Singapore  and,

particularly,  for  places  where you  cannot  readily  bring

people  in  from  the private sector, off the  streets.   You

think  about  the  SAF, which needs SAF scholars,  you  think

about  the  Singapore Police Force, they need  SPF  scholars.

When  we  think  about  the  Administrative  Service,  as   I

explained  just now, it does not find it so easy  to  recruit

people at mid-career and to fit in.  If we work on the  basis

of  giving people scholarships, then they go off and do their

own things for 10 years and they start their careers with the

civil service, maybe in their mid-30s, I think we have lost a

good  part of his working life, where not only should  he  be

contributing to us, but he should also be learning about  the

Government  of  Singapore and imbibing values  and  knowledge

which  would stand him in good stead over the long term.   We

cannot  do  this to everybody, but we hope to do  it  with  a

significant  proportion of our people.   There  is  no  model

anywhere in the world where the civil service depends  mainly

on  people  who join in mid-career.  There will be  some  who

join in mid-career but not everybody.

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Irene Ng raised again the question of medical

benefits.  As I have explained yesterday, and as she recapped

for  Members,  indeed the practical difference  for  the  new

medical  benefits scheme - Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient

Scheme,  MSO  - is really very small.  But the difference  is

one of principle.  So I think she will appreciate it if I  am

direct  and honest and explain what the principle was,  which

led  us to where we are today.  And the principle is, as  she

has put it, one of basic social philosophy.  Because this  is

an  Asian  society, and in an Asian society  the  husband  is

responsible  for  taking care of the  family,  including  the

medical  expenses.   Our  medical  benefits  schemes   should

reflect  this  and  should not undermine  the  rationale  for

holding the husband responsible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All MPs, even new ones, I am sure, have met constituents

at MPS sessions, where



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>



the  husband  has  deserted  the  family  and  abandoned  his

responsibilities  and the wife comes with young  children  to

seek  help.   We  seldom, not never, meet a  husband  seeking

financial assistance because his wife had left him.  It is  a

reality  of  our society.  So we have no immediate  plans  to

change  the  medical  benefits schemes but,  like  all  other

Government policies, this one is not set in stone either.  As

our  society evolves, we will review it periodically  and  as

Members know, in our new scheme we have already substantially

narrowed the difference, although not to the satisfaction  of

all Members of Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that many MPs, especially the female MPs, feel

that  times  have  already changed and  that  the  Government

should  set  the lead in establishing new social norms.   The

fact  that some male MPs supported them is some evidence that

perhaps  times are beginning to change.  But the Government's

view is that on a matter as basic as the family structure, we

should  follow, rather than lead social changes.   So  it  is

something which we will review, but for now I think  we  will

leave the status quo be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for a National Women's Council which Miss Irene Ng

also  suggested,  I  am not sure whether  this  is  necessary

because  we  already  have  a Singapore  Council  of  Women's

Organisation,  which is an umbrella body for women's  groups.

The  Youth  Council is not really meant as  an  advocate  for

youths  but  really has a developmental role,  which  is  not

quite  a  similar situation as the women are in, because  the

women are really adult members of society.  In Singapore, our

principle  and practice of meritocracy is the best  assurance

for the increasingly full and equal participation of women in

all  walks  of  life,  especially in  our  education  system,

providing  Singapore  women  the opportunity  to  participate

fully in all aspects of life in Singapore.  So I am not  sure

that we need a council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo asked about customer-focused inter-agency

coordination,  improving  the  public  service,  points  also

raised by Mrs Lim Hwee Hua.  I agree with both of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>



them.   Already,  we have been trying our best  to  privatise

Government services so as to subject them to competition  and

cause  them to operate more efficiently and competently.   We

have  to  study each of these privatisations specifically  to

make  sure  that it will work because, as Mrs Yu-Foo  pointed

out,  the  key role of the public sector is the provision  of

public  goods and services and also you have to  worry  about

social  objectives and these cannot be left entirely  to  the

private  sector to provide, especially public  education  and

public  safety and security.  But in many other areas  it  is

possible to depend much more on the private sector and we are

doing so through various programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Government itself, we are also trying to

improve  the quality of the service we provide, which despite

our  best efforts, sometimes it is frustrating to the public,

even  to  well-informed, knowledgeable members of the public,

and  even  to members of the public who have ready access  to

MPs.   When you have to deal with departments, sometimes  you

find  they  are not as flexible as you would like it  to  be.

There  are  times  when there is reason  why  the  department

cannot  be  flexible, but there are other times when  a  more

practical  approach,  a  more sympathetic  and  understanding

approach   would   have   helped  to   solve   the   problems

expeditiously.   So we have things like PS21 (Public  Service

for  the  21st  Century) and MFE (Managing  For  Excellence).

They are buzzwords, but they are also specific programmes and

activities which remind civil servants that it is  their  job

both to be civil and also to be servants of the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have mechanism to coordinate inter-agency which,

as Mrs Lim Hwee Hua pointed out, is one of the most difficult

things  to  do.   When two agencies are responsible  for  one

problem,  their  complexities doubled, when  three  agencies,

each  have some jurisdiction, it becomes quadrupled.   So  we

need  some way to tie up and make sure nothing falls  between

the  cracks and, furthermore, where there is overlap,  we  do

not  have  gridlock.  We have mechanisms like this, where  we

have got lead agencies which take on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>



coordinating  roles, and work with other  agencies,  so  they

provide  a point of contact to the public, you deal with  one

and  he  would  manage  the  complexity.   For  example,  the

Building  and Construction Authority coordinates the approval

of  building  plans that involve various Government  agencies

and we should work to improve such inter-agency coordination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somebody told me if you want to start a pub in Singapore

you  need  a  dozen different permits from a dozen  different

agencies,  which  drives you round the bend.   I  have  never

started  a  pub but I take him at his words and I suppose  we

should start a project to see whether -----

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> We have a one-stop centre.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> We can improve. We already have a

programme called ZIP (Zero in Process) which we introduced in

October  2000, which aims to reduce the number  of  instances

where the public has to go separately to various agencies for

related  Government service.  So if you have, for example,  a

feedback on noise pollution, refer to ENV and they would deal

with  all  the  parties.   If  you have  problems  concerning

maintenance of roads, street fixtures, street lightings which

need  fixing - Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, if you have another  problem

with   street  lightings,  please  refer  them  to  the  Land

Transport  Authority  - and if you do not  get  satisfaction,

please come and let us know.  We have a list of lead agencies

and  a  ZIP website (www.zip.gov.sg) and if you have feedback

for  the  ZIP  secretariat you can give  the  inputs  at  the

website  or call PSD.  We are committed to improving service.

We  are not quite satisfied with what we have achieved and we

will try our best to do better.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> The General Election is a

special time, once every five years, where citizens come  and

give  their votes of support or disapproval to the  governing

party  and  its  elected representatives in Parliament.   The

true  test  of democracy is a free and fair general  election

held at fixed intervals.  In the long term interest of nation

building, can the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>



Deputy  Prime Minister explain, if he truly believes  in  the

democratic  principle of elections, why  are  there  so  many

changes and adjustments to the electoral process aimed mainly

at  keeping the Opposition at bay and maintaining  the  power

and presence of the ruling party?  While we do not expect the

ruling  party to help the Opposition to win the election,  we

can only hope that the electoral process could be fairer.  In

this  regard,  I hope the Prime Minister can  look  into  the

following proposals to make the general elections fairer:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Allow at least six months after the release of the

Electoral   Boundaries  Committee  Report  before  dissolving

Parliament.   It would be equally fair to the incumbents  and

interested contestants to review the new constituency;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Reduce the number and size of each GRC to a maximum of

11 and four candidates per GRC, respectively.  Introduce back

more single member constituencies so that more citizens will

have a chance to exercise their votes;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Do not misuse national resources as a tool for political

support.  Linking upgrading to voter support is abuse of the

people's trust; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Finally, I hope the Minister can also look into setting

up a media watch committee to look into the matter of unfair

media coverage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By being open and playing fair, the Government will be

able to win more of the people's trust and support.  There is

no  need to be kiasu and kiasee and use all attempts to  stop

the  Opposition from gaining a foothold into Parliament.  The

electorate is now mature enough to differentiate between  the

better  candidates.  Can the Deputy Prime Minister  learn  to

trust the people more?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now go on to my next cut on the Elections

Department.   The Elections Department conducts the  election

process and produces the Electoral Boundaries



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>



Committee  Report  before every election is  held.   Can  the

Deputy  Prime  Minister  explain how some  of  the  electoral

boundaries  are  redrawn?  Specifically, can he  explain  how

Braddell  Heights, which is near the centre of Singapore,  in

Serangoon, be redrawn into Marine Parade GRC, which is at the

East  Coast?  Can the Deputy Prime Minister also  explain  on

what  basis did the Prime Minister convince the President  to

dissolve  Parliament  a  day after the  Electoral  Boundaries

Committee  Report  was released?  Did  he  not  have  special

privileged  information used to his  Party's  advantage?   Is

there  a  case of an abuse of power?  The Prime  Minister  is

also  the  Secretary-General of the  ruling  party.   As  the

Secretary-General of the PAP, it is his duty to  ensure  that

his  party  candidates  win  in  as  many  constituencies  as

possible.  Thus, is there a conflict of interest or is  there

not   a  conflict  of  interest  and  duty  by  placing   the

jurisdiction of the Elections Department under the control of

the  Prime Minister's Office?  Can the Prime Minister explain

what  due  process  did he use to ensure  that  there  is  no

conflict  between  his  obligation to  the  nation  as  Prime

Minister and as Secretary-General of his party?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, is it not better and safer for the Elections

Department  to  be  under  the jurisdiction  of  the  Elected

President  or  some independent commission?   Can  the  Prime

Minister kindly explain this matter?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, out-of-bounds markers. Many people have spoken

out  about OB markers in the past.  They had argued  that  OB

markers are vague, lacking clarity and creating confusion for

active  citizens  who  want  to  participate  in  the  nation

building process.  Some of them have also asked that  the  OB

markers  be spelt out and be clear so that it can be avoided.

I  want  to  ask the Prime Minster if he had  a  list  of  OB

markers  ready for public release.  If citizens have to  keep

wondering  what  they say is going to  step  on  any  of  the

Minister's  toe and thus out-of-bound, then soon  the  active

and  concerned citizens will learn not to say anything.  They

will  just  shut  up and shut out.  They  will  learn  to  be

bochap.  It is safer to adopt this bochap attitude.  Do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>



not  bother to listen to the Government, no need to disagree,

no  disagreement,  no need to speak up, no fear  of  stepping

onto  the  OB  markers, therefore, no fear of  offending  the

Ministers.  Life remains peaceful and calm.  How  good.   But

the  fact that this bochap attitude is developing is worrying

and bad for our society.  Where there is no exchange of ideas

it  is  bad for the society.  Our citizens must be encouraged

to  speak  up  without fear.  We must allow them  to  express

themselves  and learn to take responsibility  for  what  they

say.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are no OB markers in parliamentary debates then

there should be no OB markers at all in our society.  Once we

go  into  the  political arena we must expect  criticism  and

unfair  condemnations.   If we can defend  ourselves  in  the

parliamentary debates, I think we should have  the  grace  to

defend these criticisms in public.  I hope the Prime Minister

can  clarify on the list of out-of-bounds markers, and remove

this requirement from our society totally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I will move on to touch on youths in politics.

The  Prime  Minister had ever said that entering politics  is

the  highest  form of public service.   There had  also  been

laments from some Ministers that there are not enough  youths

who  are  interested  in  politics.   Politics  is  the  most

uncertain  of  careers  -  both for the PAP as  well  as  for

Opposition politicians.  Therefore, it is not surprising that

young professional Singaporeans are not interested to go into

politics at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is making matters worse is that there is only one

company,  one party or one cruise liner to go  to   if  these

young  professionals are interested to  make  politics  as  a

career,  ie, to join the PAP.  Joining the PAP is like  going

on  board  a  luxury cruise liner  -  very  big,  strong  and

stable.   No  risks  and no worries of a  capsize.   Full  of

luxury,  joy  and  entertainment, it is no wonder  that  many

Singaporeans   -   good and bad, qualified  or  not   -   are

rushing on board to join this PAP cruise liner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for those with a different perspective, who do not

like the trappings,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>



the  style,  the  direction or the destination  of  this  PAP

cruise  liner,  they have no other ship or  liner  to  board.

They  can  only  consider the rickety sampans  that  we,  the

Opposition,  have  to  offer.  But it is  full  of  risk  and

danger.  A storm may arise and we may have a shipwreck.  Or a

big  fish may jump out from nowhere and swallow us, never  to

be seen again for the next 30 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever it is, the PAP cruise liner has made it risky

for  young  idealistic Singapore professionals  to  join  the

small sampans.  They have no choice but to stay on shore  and

forget   about  their  ideals  of  helping  to  explore   new

opportunities  and  claiming new grounds for  the  people  of

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not many young Singaporeans are foolish like myself to

challenge  this  giant  Goliath.   Before  the  last  General

Elections, all my friends and family members thought that  it

was  suicidal or crazy to go into Opposition politics.   They

do  not see a future.  They do not see a hope.  There  is  no

hope of reaching shore with this sampan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if the Prime Minister is sincere in wanting to

encourage  more  young Singaporeans to  enter  politics,  the

Government must first calm the sea and play fair.  Allow  the

sampan  to  find  shore and grow hope.  Only when  the  first

batches of adventurers had safely crossed the Atlantic  Ocean

will  it  give hope to other great idealists.  Therefore,  if

the  Government wants youths to be interested in politics and

to serve the country in the highest office, then we must have

hope,  opportunity and freedom to choose which boat to board.

As  the  Prime  Minister's task is to look at  the  long-term

interest of the country, can we expect the Government to play

fair and give hope to all?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam, you can take your two cuts

together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, thank you for

allowing me to take one cut after the other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first topic is on the recognition of the Opposition.

This is not a new topic.  As far



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>



as  I  am  concerned,  I have spoken on this  many  times  in

Parliament.  The Government has torn down the office that was

built  for my use as a Member of Parliament at Potong  Pasir,

and  has  never  rebuilt it since.  On the part  of  the  PAP

candidate  at the constituency, he is given an airconditioned

room  where he can conduct his political business in  comfort

and  utter  privacy.  I have now to meet my residents  during

the meet-the-people sessions in an open void deck space which

is not very suitable, because residents often want to consult

me  on  very  personal  matters and they  do  not  feel  very

comfortable, as they do not have any privacy at all.   I have

spoken on this matter and, in this respect, I said that I  am

treated  no different from a roadside fortune teller  when  I

meet my residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Prime Minister can direct the HDB to

restore  my MP's office at the void deck at Potong  Pasir  as

soon  as  possible.  The Government should  not  discriminate

against  me  as  an Opposition Member.  All  PAP  Members  of

Parliament are each given, I believe, a room to work  in  the

constituencies.  Why am I, as an Opposition MP,  not provided

with the same facilities?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the constituency level, the Government recognises the

beaten PAP candidate at Potong Pasir more than me who has won

at  the  last  general election.  The PAP candidate  was  not

chosen  by the majority of the Potong Pasir residents.   Yet,

he appears to have more authority than me, the elected MP.  I

have  to apply to him, whom I have defeated at the elections,

for  funds  for community projects and for any other  matters

that  require  the  support  of the  CCC.   All  because  the

defeated PAP candidate is made the Advisor to the CCC and  I,

the MP for that constituency, has been left out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that the Government cannot take defeat.

Although the PAP candidate has lost at Potong Pasir, the  way

that constituency is run is based on the premise that the PAP

candidate has won at Potong Pasir in the last election.  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>



beaten  PAP  candidate is made the Advisor to the CCC,  CCMC,

RCs   and   other  grassroots  organisations,   whereas   the

Opposition MP there is treated as if he does not exist.  That

is  why  I  am  making  another call  to  the  Government  to

recognise  the Opposition MP at Potong Pasir as a  legitimate

representative of the people at Potong Pasir, and not someone

else.   If  the Government really wants to remake  Singapore,

then  it  must  uphold the democratic system,  recognise  all

elected representatives of the people to Parliament, and  not

only elected PAP representatives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall go on to the next cut and I will speak on

NCMP   honorarium.   My  speech  will  be  confined  to   the

honorarium or allowance given to NCMP, and not to NMP,  which

I  do  not support.  I understand from my colleague, Mr Steve

Chia,  that  the allowance given to NCMP is only 15%  of  the

elected  MP's  allowance.   I must  say  that  such  a  small

allowance is derisory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCMPs are different from NMPs on the following important

points:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) NCMPs, unlike NMPs, have taken part in elections,

whereas   the   NMPs   have   no  electoral   experience   or

participation at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) As a result of taking part in elections, NCMPs have

won a certain number of votes and they do represent those who

voted  for them when they are in Parliament, whereas NMPs  do

not  represent  anyone at all when they  are  in  Parliament,

except themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCMPs are chosen from amongst the Opposition candidates

who  have  won the most votes or the best losers among  them.

In the case of Mr Steve Chia, I believe he had garnered about

35%  of the total votes cast, and I must say that winning 35%

of  the votes cast is a respectable achievement.  I can  tell

you  that  it  is not so easy for an Opposition candidate  to

wrest  35%  of the votes from a PAP candidate.  To a  certain

extent,  one can say that Mr Steve Chia has won his place  in

Parliament with 35% representation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some countries where they have proportional

representation, one can get elected into Parliament with only

5%  of  the  total votes cast.  Although we do not have  that

system  in  Singapore, we do have a system  where  NCMPs  are

appointed to Parliament.  Mr Steve Chia need not be defensive

about  his  appointment to Parliament.   His  appointment  is

certainly  with  merit.  He does represent  quite  a  sizable

number of people at Chua Chu Kang.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his remuneration, I think if a poll were to

be  taken  at Chua Chu Kang, I would think that  35%  of  the

voters who voted for him would certainly want their NCMP,  Mr

Steve  Chia,  to  be  adequately  paid.   They  would  surely

consider   the   person   they  voted   can   make   valuable

contributions  to Parliament and to the people of  Singapore,

and  should  be  properly rewarded.   Mr  Steve  Chia  is  no

laggard.  He  is hardworking.   He has filed, I  believe,  24

cuts in this year's budget debate.  I think this is more than

many of the older MPs, including myself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I suggest that in order to give proper

recognition and respect to NCMPs, their allowance  should  be

raised from 15% to at least 50% of an elected MP's allowance?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Steve Chia, you can take your two cuts

together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Thank you, Sir. Thank you, Mr

Chiam, for speaking up for me

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Senior Minister had once said, "If you pay

peanuts,  you  will get monkeys."  I agree  with  the  Senior

Minister on this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, the House had a passionate debate on NMPs

and  voted strongly to have them in this House.  It had  been

said  that NMPs were very good and had contributed a  lot  of

good debate to this House.  I was not here then, but I do not

deny that they contributed a lot.  I think NMPs had helped to

liven  up debates in the past, but I went to argue that there

was no need for them in this session of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>



this House, because the PAP Government was freeing up its MPs

for more debates and disagreements, and this would help solve

the  cynicism and scepticism in youths.  It was not  listened

to and I was out-voted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we are going to get NMPs in this House, I would

want  to speak up for them too.  I think we should give  them

their due recognition.  The honorarium of an NMP is at 15% of

an  elected MP's allowance.   This is too little.   Like  all

MPs,  they  have  the  duty to speak up and  engage  in  good

debates.   We  should therefore recognise their  contribution

and  pay  them an NMP allowance equivalent to 40% or more  of

the elected MP's allowance, instead of a small honorarium  of

just 15%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the NCMP's honorarium, Sir, I would like to

declare my personal direct interest in this matter.  An  NCMP

is  not  quite, but is close to a political appointment.   We

know  that when the PAP Government wins all the seats,  there

will be at least three such NCMP appointments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our role, as NCMPs, is as heavy as an elected MP. We

are  not  only expected to be robust and vigorous in speaking

up  in  Parliament and contributing to good debates.  We  are

also   contributing  to  nation  building   by   giving   the

perspective of the non-PAP voters which number about  10-30%,

depending  on  which  election.  This is  important  for  the

Government that takes pride in caring for all its people.  On

top of speaking in Parliament, the Non-Constituency Member of

Parliament  has to cover as many electoral constituencies  as

possible  and  get  the  feeling  and  understanding  of  the

citizens,  especially  of those who  are  not  supportive  of

Government  policies.  We have to understand their grievances

and  raise  them  in Parliament.  Like all the  elected  MPs,

constituency  work is to build rapport and support  with  the

electorate for the next election.  This is the same  duty  as

any of the elected MPs.  Therefore, I hope the Prime Minister

will  agree with my above reasoning and look into reinstating

the NCMP allowance to be on par with all the elected MPs,  as

it was first crafted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>



<br>1.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next cut is on legislative and secretarial assistance

for NMP and NCMP.

Sir,  I would like to state my direct interest in this matter

again.   Like  all  MPs,  NMPs and  NCMPs  are  invited  into

Parliament  to represent a different viewpoint from  the  PAP

Government.  They are expected to speak up with sound advice,

research  and argument, to raise issues and discuss  policies

and  contribute to parliamentary debate.  Therefore, will the

Prime  Minister also agree with me that it is  necessary  for

NMPs  and  NCMPs  to  be  given legislative  and  secretarial

allowance  to employ help?  Does the House not want  to  hear

more  contributions and more in-depth debates from these NMPs

and NCMPs?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs and Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, on behalf of the Prime Minister, I

will  take  these  few  cuts raised  by  the  two  Opposition

Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first question of General Election, Mr Chia asked

why  are  there so many changes to electoral laws  that  have

impeded the Opposition.  I am not sure what electoral laws or

regulations  that have impeded the Opposition, because  these

same  laws,  regulations  and provisions  apply  to  all  the

candidates during an election, regardless of whether it is an

Opposition, a PAP or an independent candidate.  So, I am  not

able  to  answer  fully his question on the  laws  that  have

impeded  the  Opposition.   But he has  made  several  points

concerning   electoral  boundary,  the  Electoral  Boundaries

Review Committee Report and GRCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained not long ago in this Chamber why the

Electoral  Boundaries Review Committee Report  was  published

and  that  not  long after that, an election was  called.   I

think  those circumstances may not repeat themselves.   There

were  instances in the past where the Boundaries  Report  was

released and there was adequate time for people to look at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>



the  changes.   But  Opposition or PAP MPs  should  not  just

depend  on the publication of the Electoral Boundaries Review

Committee  Report  to  conduct their electoral  or  political

work.   I  know that Opposition parties and their  supporters

have gone round from time to time to different constituencies

to understand the ground, survey the ground, feel the ground,

and  see to what extent the people there warm up to them,  or

in what areas where the PAP constituencies may appear to have

some weaknesses and problems, and therefore take advantage of

them  and contest in those constituencies.  So, if Opposition

Members  do some home work, put their ears to the ground  and

be  more  hardworking,  instead of waiting  till  nearer  the

election,  or  when the election dates are  known,  to  start

working  the  ground in the constituency, they  may  stand  a

better  chance.   That  is one of the  ways  which  they  can

consider, although it is not my duty to teach them how to win

an  election.  No government party sets itself out  to  teach

the  Opposition how to win elections.  And like  every  other

country, it is the incumbent governing party that decides  on

many  of  the issues.  Of course, when it comes to the  vote,

the  people  will eventually have to decide which party  will

give  them  the stability, the progress, and the  quality  of

life that they are all looking for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GRC situation is the same, as I described not long

ago  in this House.  The question was raised by Mr Chiam: Why

do we have GRCs?  We have tried to give as many opportunities

as  possible,  but  the  Constitution and  the  Parliamentary

Elections  Act  state the number of GRCs and  the  number  of

single  constituencies  that can  be  allowed  in  a  general

election.   So long as these rules are followed, we  are  all

within  the  law.  Whether it is fair or not, I think  it  is

fair to everyone who wants to contest.  It does not mean  the

bigger  GRC or more GRCs will favour the PAP.  It also  could

mean  that if the PAP Members do not do their work, they  can

lose a significant number of seats in Parliament, and that is

the  risk that we have weighed, and we have decided  that  we

will  do  our  job,  make sure that we continue  to  get  the

people's support, and we are prepared to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>



take this risk.  But if the Opposition can do a better job, I

am  sure  the  people will support them and  return  them  in

larger numbers than what they have been doing in the last 13-14 years since we have the GRC system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the media watch, it is not the Opposition candidates

alone  that  complained about the coverage of the  Opposition

during   the  General  Election  or  at  other  times.    PAP

candidates and MPs also complained that they did not  receive

enough  coverage.  If we look at the number of  PAP  Members,

how  many of them appeared regularly in the press?  During  a

parliamentary  debate, if they said something interesting  or

spoke  on topics of significance, the media, generally,  will

simply  have a very brief summary of what they said, although

they  have made a speech lasting many minutes.  So,  if  they

want  to  appear  in  the media, then  make  sure  they  have

something that is newsworthy for the newspapers to report for

the  public, which the public has an interest, to  read  what

they have said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the election, I think the media has given a

balanced  coverage  to the Opposition.   The  Opposition  has

access  to  the media just as the PAP has.  And if they  have

something  of  importance  - maybe an  announcement  or  some

exciting  programme, or a good rally speech - I am  sure  the

media  will  be  interested  to  report  it.   For  the   PAP

candidates,  I  think there are far more PAP candidates  than

there  are Opposition candidates during any General Election.

During  the period of campaigning, PAP candidates had  always

complained  to  me  -  because I  helped  in  organising  the

election  -  that they did not receive enough  coverage.    I

would  just  say to them, "If you have something interesting,

if you have an exciting programme, or it will be a good visit

to  somewhere that will be of interest to the press, they may

cover you.  If not, just leave things be."  They will have to

work  their ground to convince the voters, not just the media

alone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Mr Chia's comment on linking political

support  to infrastructure or upgrading projects,  these  are

our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>



programmes.   People  will elect the Party  that  will  bring

these programmes.  When we are returned to power, we keep our

promises.   That is the way it is done in many parts  of  the

world.   In most democratic societies - in America,  Britain,

and  anywhere else he can name - I am sure he will  find  the

same  things being done.  There is nothing wrong  with  that.

Because if a party that is contesting an election cannot keep

its  promise and does not have good programmes, then it  will

not  be  returned  to power.  So if the Opposition  has  good

programmes,  can  convince the people,  and  be  returned  to

govern,  they  can  carry  out what they  have  promised  the

electorate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Elections Department under the Prime

Minister's  Office  (PMO),  and  the  Boundaries  Report,  in

particular  the  Electoral Boundaries Review  Committee,  how

they  arrived at the decision, they must have some basis  for

doing so.  As for Braddell Heights in Marine Parade, this has

been asked before.  If Mr Chia reads up the Hansard, he might

have  found an explanation there.  There may be a reason  why

the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee had decided to draw

the  boundaries  that way, just as they decided  why  certain

constituencies should be single-member constituencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Prime Minister influence the electoral process?

The  Prime  Minister  is  the person who  recommends  to  the

President  to dissolve Parliament, and that is the  executive

power  as  provided  for  in the Constitution.   Every  Prime

Minister  does it.  Not just in Singapore, but also in  other

parts  of the world.  That situation has worked well, and  it

will remain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will transferring the Elections Department to the

President's  Office  make  any difference?   The  President's

Office   -   do not forget the President himself is  also  an

elected  President  -   is also an elected  office  too.   So

whether  we  leave  the  Elections Department  in  the  Prime

Minister's  Office or transfer it to the President's  Office,

the same question will be raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point on the Elections Department is whether we have

a fair Elections



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>



Department  that  conducts  its business,  in  a  transparent

manner, and that the public can see  there is no fraud.  Even

if  we  have  an Elections Commission, it will not  solve  Mr

Chia's  problem.  I know, and he has read in the papers  too,

that  many countries have Election Commissions and there  are

complaints  about fraud, vote buying, pressure, rigging,  and

all  kinds  of electoral excesses.  So having an  independent

Elections  Commission does not guarantee him a fair election.

What is most important, and this has been established in  our

case for many years, is that the people running the Elections

Department  are  civil  servants who  carry  out  their  work

objectively and they did it fairly and according to the  law.

That  has  been the practice all these years.  We have  civil

servants  with high integrity and they have the systems,  and

they follow what is provided for in the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, regardless of whether we have an independent

Elections  Commission, an Elections Department in  the  Prime

Minister's  Office  or in the President's  Office,  it  still

depends  on  the  people running the election.   If  we  have

people  whom  we  can  trust,  with  high  integrity,   fair,

balanced,  objective,  then  we  have  a  fair  and  balanced

election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look back at all our elections, nobody has

challenged  the fact that our elections have been  fair.   If

not,  Mr  Chiam would not be here; Mr Low would not be  here,

and the NCMP would not have a chance to even smell 35%.  So I

think  the  basis  for  saying that by having  the  Elections

Department under the Prime Minister's Office leads to  unfair

practices simply is not valid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On out-of-bounds markers, is there a list of OB markers?

This  is  not a golf course!  The political arena  is  not  a

physical  structure  that we can set markers.   Same  as  for

nation building, as well as development of a society.   These

cannot   be   marked  by  markers.   There  are  conventions,

practices,  norms, values that we have established  over  the

years.  These values, norms, etc, change according to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>



the times.  As society matures and develops, as people become

better   educated,  better  informed,  then   the   society's

expectations  of  what  should  and  can  be  done  will   be

different.  People have acknowledged that we have  changed  a

lot  in  the  last 15-20 years.  The society has become  more

open,  much  more consultative, more participatory,  and  the

Government has always encouraged people to take part  in  the

affairs of the nation, because these are matters that concern

their lives and future.

To  say that the Government has put obstacles and discouraged

people  just because there are unseen OB markers simply  does

not state the facts.  The facts are there for him to see.  He

can  read  the  newspapers.  There are many  letters  in  the

press.   In  fact, the editors receive so many  letters,  and

they can choose only a few letters to publish every day.   He

can  watch  talk show programmes on television and listen  to

the   radio,  and  people  speak  up.   Even  in  Parliament,

Opposition Members spoke up.  They are none the worse.   Even

those  Opposition  Members, who are outside Parliament,  they

also spoke up.  They are none the worse for that, unless they

deliberately  offend  the  law.   Whether  a  person  is   an

Opposition, or whoever, if he breaks the law, the law will go

after  him.   There is no question about it.  So long  as  he

does things within the confines of the law, nothing is taboo.

He  can carry on talking, he can carry on criticising, he can

have  his views.  But as he has noted, if he has very  strong

views  about Government policies, and if Government is  right

that  he is wrong headed, the Government will come down  very

hard.   Is it because the Government deliberately does it  to

stamp  out  comments?  No.  He must take  responsibility  for

what  he  has  said, as Mr Chia himself admitted.   He  takes

responsibility  for  his  comments and  the  Government  will

respond, and the public, who read and hear both sides,  would

decide  who is right.  If the Government does not  come  back

and  rebut  and  comment, and if his  views  are  allowed  to

prevail, then over time, people would say that the Government

has got no arguments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>



<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is not afraid of genuine debate. A

person  can talk, he can debate, he can bring out  views,  he

can  disagree.  But that does not mean that he must tear down

the institutions, the foundations, or our value system.  That

would  make  people  lose  respect  and  credibility  of  the

Government.   Once people lose credibility, not  because  the

Government  is  found  wanting, or not  doing  its  job,  but

because the Government is doing its job and there are  people

who  want to cast doubt on that, the Government has  to  come

back  and  respond  to it.  Otherwise, the Government  cannot

govern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in many societies, many things are being said and

the  leaders  just  leave things as they are.   It  is  their

system.   In  our system, we must make sure that  our  people

know that this is a good Government.  They understand what is

a  good  Government and they have benefited  from  this  good

Government.  Otherwise, we will not be credible, not just  to

Singaporeans but to all our foreign investors.  And  that  is

important for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who say that they are afraid to speak up, I think

it  is  only  a cop-out for not wanting to take part,  either

because  they are pathetic, they do not want to be  involved,

or it is just an excuse not to want to take part in anything.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot define OB markers by law. It is not possible.

Society  changes and evolves, and we have to evolve with  it.

There  are many channels that are open to the people to speak

up.   This  is  known  to  everyone.  Are  the  young  people

discouraged  from this?  I do not see that happening.   Those

young  people who do not want to be involved, they  are  most

likely  the  ones  who find themselves too  busy  with  their

careers,  personal  pursuits,  or  with  their  relationship.

Therefore,  they find little time for community  or  national

matters.  But we encourage them to take part.  There are many

avenues for this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Singapore 21 exercise, more than 6,000 people

took part, and many of them were young Singaporeans.  In  the

recently



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>



set  up  Remaking Singapore Committee, there are  many  young

people,  and I encourage them to come forward to  give  their

views.   And we must bear in mind that in this very sensitive

regional  geopolitical context and the  fault  lines  in  our

society  -  issues of race, language, religion and culture  - these  should be treaded very carefully before we break these

fault lines and turn them into a disaster.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam has his usual lament about treating the

Opposition  and recognising them.  The question  of  his  MPS

office  was dealt with way back 10 years ago, if I  remember,

in 1991-1992, when HDB decided that, owing to the shortage of

void  deck  space,  they would give the  space  only  to  the

community  organisations.  As for MPS office, he should  look

after  himself, find some way, rent a place, and he can  have

his MPS office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Government treating the PAP MPs differently? No,

the  Government does not directly get involved in giving  the

PAP  MPs  an  office.  It is the PAP Community Foundation,  a

charity  social service organisation, that set up these  void

deck  offices.  They run kindergartens and some of the  other

social  services,  like childcare or day  care,  and  only  a

limited  period  is let out to the MP to hold meet-the-people

sessions.  The MP does not use the place all the time.  It is

only once a week and rent is paid for that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why can't Mr Chiam find similar arrangements? He can

set  up a Foundation.  If not, he can always rent space  from

any  owner of the shop, or whoever wants to let him  use  the

space  once  a  week.  I heard previously that Mr  Jeyaretnam

held his MPS at a coffeeshop.  That is a private arrangement.

The  Government does not set out to help the PAP MPs, neither

does it set out to help the Opposition MPs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about the role of the advisor and why the

losing PAP candidate is treated better.  The PAP candidate is

an  advisor of grassroots organisations.  I have explained on

many  occasions in this House the role of the advisors.  They

are the ones who assist the Government,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>



through  the  People's Association, to carry  out  Government

policies.   I  think  it is quite farfetched  to  expect  the

Opposition Members to help carry out Government policies  and

programmes.   That is not doable.  I do not  think  Mr  Chiam

will  agree to that.  Otherwise, he would become one  of  us.

Whether  it  is Mr Eric Low or Mr Seetoh, they are  advisors,

and  they  perform  community service as  advisors  in  these

grassroots  organisations.  It has nothing  to  do  with  the

remaking  of  Singapore.   We  do  not  want  to  remake  the

Opposition!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On NMP and NCMP honorarium, I find it quite ironical for

Mr  Chiam now to speak up for Mr Steve Chia and argue  for  a

higher honorarium.  First, let me make it clear that the  NMP

and  NCMP  do  not  receive an allowance.   They  receive  an

honorarium,  which is a small sum of money in recognition  of

their services and contribution in Parliament.  They are  not

like  elected  MPs  who have a bigger role  to  play  in  the

constituencies and in Parliament.  So let us not  equate  the

NCMP  with  that of the elected MP, regardless  of  how  many

percent of votes he has received.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many years ago, when we debated the NCMP scheme, Mr

Chiam  called them the "backdoor MPs".  He called  them  non-constituency  because  they  do  not  represent  anybody  and

therefore  they are second-class MPs.  Now, just  because  Mr

Steve  Chia is a member of the SDA and Mr Chiam is the leader

of  the  SDA, he sees it in his self-interest to promote  his

fellow colleague in this House.  That is, in fact, completely

within his right, but we must draw a distinction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP, like the NMP, does not have the same rights,

duties and responsibilities as the elected MPs.  First,  they

cannot  vote  on  confidence motions against the  Government.

Secondly,  they  cannot vote on money  Bills,  Supply  Bills,

Constitutional amendments.  Thirdly, the NCMP and NMP do  not

have constituencies to look after.  We must remember that the

duties  and  responsibilities of the NCMP and  NMP  are  very

different from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>



elected MPs.  It is this Government that made it possible  to

have  NCMP,  because the people wanted to  have  the  PAP  in

Parliament.   In  fact,  they  wanted  as  many  PAP  MPs  in

Parliament  as possible and we do not want a situation  where

the whole House is completely filled with elected PAP MPs and

there  is  no  Opposition  voice.  So  the  Constitution  was

amended to provide for Non-Constituency MP, so that the  best

losers  will come in if there is no Opposition MP.  The  fact

that we now have two Opposition MPs means we can now have one

NCMP.   That is how Mr Chia got in here, and in the words  of

Mr  Chiam, which he said many years ago, "by the grace of the

PAP".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to belabour this point. But to say

that  he had 35% of the votes of Chua Chu Kang, and therefore

should  be entitled to 40% of the allowance is simply without

basis.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> 50%.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Still no basis. Because if we follow

that  argument  that Mr Chia had 35% of the votes,  then  our

first-past-the-post system will not work.  We will then  have

a  different  system altogether.  If we have  a  proportional

representation  system where if his  party  has  35%  of  the

votes,  then  he will have 35% of the seats.   But  for  good

reasons,   which  I  have  explained  many  times   in   this

Parliament,    we   should   not   have   the    proportional

representation   system.   We  have  the  first-past-the-post

system.   Winner takes all.  He must get 50% plus  one  vote,

and that is it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay, or any of our PAP MPs

who won against an Opposition, he does not just represent 65%

of  the  electorate, he represents all the residents  in  the

constituency.   I cannot see Mr Low saying to his  residents,

"I  don't  represent you because you may have voted  for  the

Opposition."  He does not know who voted for the  Opposition.

But  once he is elected under this system, he represents  all

the  residents in Chua Chu Kang.  He does not speak only  for

65% of them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chia said, if I heard him correctly, that his job is

not confined to one constituency, but all constituencies, and

he  has to deal with a lot of constituency matters.  I  think

it is a bit too much.  I do not think my colleagues here will

agree  with him.  If he wants to do that, please  go  and  do

that  as  a  free agent.  He, as an NCMP, does not  represent

anyone at all in the constituency, not even in Chua Chu Kang.

He  does not know who voted for him.  He knows he had 35%  of

the votes.  That is all.  But in the system that we have,  he

does  not represent anyone in this Parliament.  Let  me  make

this very clear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is no question of revising the honorarium to

40%, as Mr Chia has asked, or 50%, as Mr Chiam has asked.  It

is  15%, quite appropriate, quite in keeping with the  amount

of  work  and contribution that an NMP and NCMP make in  this

Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same applies to the use of the allowance for

Legislative and Secretarial Assistants.  The NCMP  and  NMP's

job  in Parliament is to speak up in debates, etc.  There  is

no  constituency duty.  There may be some research that needs

to  be done in looking up the papers, or whatever, for making

speeches in Parliament.  For that, he can have access to  the

Parliament  Librarian.   I am sure our  Parliament  Librarian

will  be very happy to help him with any information that  he

seeks.   But that is not the same as the $1,000 that we  give

to the elected MPs to hire a Legislative Assistant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP's honorarium is only $1,600, or thereabouts.

To give him $1,000 to hire a Legislative Assistant is totally

out  of  proportion  to the honorarium.   Definitely,  it  is

completely unjustifiable.  I cannot explain that.

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, I have a point of

clarification.  The Elections Commission, as the Minister has

said,  does not guarantee a sense of fairness but, at  least,

there is a Commission that we can complain to, and which  can

look into how the people actually execute the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>



election  process.   And,  if  there  is  something  that  we

disagree,  we  can  actually  seek  out  the  Commission  and

complain to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also talked about other countries ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> What is your point of clarification, Mr

Chia?  You are making a speech now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> OK, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head U of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code UD 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, let me declare my interest. I am the

Adviser  to the Singapore Interpreters and Translators  Union

and, more than 25 years ago, I was a court interpreter for  3

1/2 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our political leaders travel to foreign non-English

speaking   countries   and   have  discussions   with   their

counterparts,  they must have noticed the  high  standard  of

their  interpreters.   The Chinese and Japanese  simultaneous

interpreters  are  normally  high-ranking  officers  in   the

foreign  services.  Do we have the same kind of  interpreters

in   Singapore?   If  we  take  the  standards  set  by   the

International  Association of Conference  Interpreters  as  a

reference,   the   answer  is  yes.   We   have   world-class

interpreters.   However, we have only  two.   They  are  none

other than Mr Lee Seng Giap and Mr Lee Hui Huan, the Lee  and

Lee.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have listened to their excellent interpretations at

our parliamentary proceedings and the Prime Minister's speech

at  the National Day Rally over TV.  Besides, they have  also

been  called  upon  to  interpret  at  various  international

conferences.  However, I raise this cut to remind PSD that as

far  as  world-class  interpreters  are  concerned,  we  have

stopped  at  two  for too long a time and we  should  produce

more, if we can afford it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last three decades, the scheme of interpreters

and  translators has not been reviewed while  other  services

have  been  revised on a number of occasions.  Market  forces

have forced many interpreters and translators to hop over  to

other  jobs  with  better career prospects.  Young  graduates

leave  after  a  short spell in the service, as  the  present

scheme  offers not much career prospects and the remuneration

is not commensurate with their capabilities and competencies,

and  the  responsibilities they carry.  As  they  put  it  in

Chinese,  "meiyou  qian tu, ye meiyou qian  tu",  meaning  no

career prospect, neither is there any money prospect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the gap between the pay of the interpreters in the

public  and  the private sectors is so wide, that  the  Chief

Interpreter's  monthly salary is equivalent  to  only  4  1/2

days'  conference  interpreting fees in the  private  sector.

Thus, the feeling among them is that they are, "zhong yong bu

zhong shang", ie, heavy responsibilities with stingy rewards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSD needs to revamp the scheme of the service and, more

importantly, something should be done to reward  and  attract

the  talent  at  the  top  rung,  ie,  the  interpreters  and

translators in Parliament and Supreme Court.  Sir, we are  an

international convention centre, with one million  foreigners

working  in  Singapore.   The  demand  for  foreign  language

interpreters  has  been  on  an  unprecedented   rise.    The

engagement of casual foreign language interpreters by various

authorities has been in an unsatisfactory state.  No criteria

have  been set for their accreditation.  I also urge  PSD  to

review



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>



this   and   come   out  with  a  certain  form   of   agreed

accreditation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the interpreter and translator services are not a

sunset  industry, as perceived.  The sun sets and  will  rise

again  with  globalisation.  And, if  we  are  serious  about

globalisation and want to be a winner in the world market, we

are  serious about what we are telling the world in their own

language, we need to professionalise the services.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, in response to Mr

Seng  Han  Thong's  question, there are  two  working  groups

headed  by MITA and the Subordinate Courts which are  working

on how we can improve the structure of the schemes to provide

better  career development and progression opportunities  for

translators and interpreters.  They are also exploring how we

can  enhance  the  learning  and training  opportunities  for

officers  in  order  to raise the professional  standards  of

interpretation and translation in the civil service.  The PSD

has  been  assisting in this review.  We will  wait  for  the

working groups' final recommendations which, I am sure,  will

help  the  public service better attract, retain and motivate

our interpreters and translators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the suggestion to have a system of accreditation for

interpreters used by Government bodies, I think we may  leave

it to the courts, who are the major users of interpreters, to

study this suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, I may add that I think it would be difficult

for  us to equal the standards of the interpreters which  the

Japanese  and the Chinese have.  For them, it is  their  only

way  to  connect with the rest of the world.  Their ministers

often do not speak English, French or foreign languages,  and

they  have  to deal with the world constantly.   Whenever  we

have to meet their Minister, he deals through an interpreter.

Whenever  he  makes  a speech, the interpreter  is  there  to

provide  a  version,  both  ways.   When  we  meet  them,  we

recognise  that we are dealing with not only a  very  capable

interpreter    but   somebody   who   has   a   comprehensive

understanding of the issues and, indeed,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>



might  be  a very senior official himself.  There  have  been

times when I have to talk to a Japanese minister and I make a

remark   to  him  and  the  Minister  says,  "Hm",  and   the

interpreter  gives  me  three  sentences  as  to  what  their

Minister actually meant.  And I am quite sure she was  right.

I  think  it  would  be difficult for us  to  provide  either

Ministers  like that or interpreters like that, but  we  will

try to improve our standards.

No. (1), Mr Leong Horn Kee.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I beg to

move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head M of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore tax regime has now been firmly set on

the  path  of  being a mixture of direct taxes  and  indirect

taxes  through  the introduction of GST.  The Government  has

announced that it intends to reduce the corporate tax rate in

the  top-end  personal income tax rate to 20% by  year  2004.

Meanwhile, the GST is increased to 5%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since 1985, almost 20 years ago, we have reduced

our direct corporate tax from a high of 40% to nearly half at

20%  by  year 2004.  This is a very substantial drop, and  it

has  helped  Singapore  to maintain its  competitiveness.   I

would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister  for

Finance  whether the Government has any further intention  to

set a lower direct tax to, say, 16%, to be closer to the rate

used in Hong Kong.  If there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>



a  need  to  reduce direct tax, the main concern  is  whether

there  would  be  a  parallel increase in the  GST  rate,  to

account  for the loss of income due to a reduction of  direct

taxes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, we heard from Deputy Prime Minister Lee that

he  cannot  give an assurance that GST will not be raised  in

the  next five years.  Sir, this is a concern of many  people

on  this  remark of the Deputy Prime Minister.  We know  that

many  prudent policies and principles are being  reviewed  by

the  Economic  Review  Committee and  the  Committee  on  the

Remaking of Singapore.  It is well and good that policies  be

constantly reviewed to bring them up to date and are  changed

with the times.  We want to ensure that they remain relevant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, overall, I want to say that we must have been

striking the right formula with regard to Singapore's  global

tax regime.  $7-8 billion of foreign investments continue  to

flow  into  Singapore  yearly.  We regularly  achieve  budget

surpluses,  as  shown  in the charts  by  Mr  Tan  Soo  Khoon

yesterday,  also in billions of dollars every  year.   Local-based  corporations  and  people are  paying  relatively  low

taxes,  compared to many other countries.  So, if the formula

is right, let us keep it.  Do not tinker too much with it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people wish to know what is the Government's long-term plan with regard to the tax philosophy of the

Government.  What the people want is some degree of certainty

of how our tax burden would be like in the long term.  Hence,

I would like to ask the Minister for Finance whether he could

enlighten the House on this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the present trend seems to be towards making

our present personal income tax system more complex, with the

various  new reliefs and rebates being introduced.   Like  Mr

Inderjit  Singh said yesterday, we appear to  have  become  a

nation  of reliefs and rebates.  There are several  types  of

reliefs,  such as for NSF, handicapped children,  baby  bonus

and many others.  Then, there are also constant rebates being

given.  Should we not make all these rebates simplified as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>



part  of  the basic tax structure?  I would like to  ask  the

Minister for Finance whether this approach will continue with

regard  to  reliefs and rebates in future,  or  is  there  an

intention to simplify the overall tax structure?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for my second cut, I wish to talk on the tax system

with  regard  to  the impact of the one-tier tax  system  for

dividends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the proposed one-tier system for dividend

payments for shares, there is no allowance for tax credit for

individuals.   Under  the  new  system,  both  corporate  and

individual shareholders are treated equally, as they will  be

taxed  at  the  prevailing corporate  tax  rate.   Individual

shareholders and institutions with tax-exempt status will  no

longer get tax credits based on the difference between  their

marginal  tax  rate  and the corporate  tax  rate.   From  my

understanding  of  the  new  regulation,  I  would  like   to

highlight to the Minister for Finance that this one-tier  tax

system  works to the disadvantage of the following groups  of

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, individuals, especially the lower income

workers and retirees who own shares, will now have to pay the

top-end   corporate  rate  on  their  earnings   from   share

dividends.   For  these people, their personal  marginal  tax

rate  could  well  be zero or very low.  Therefore,  the  new

scheme is disadvantageous to them as they now have to pay the

full  corporate tax rates for the dividend on the shares they

own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, institutions that used to enjoy tax-free

status, such as charities and community groups, will now have

to  bear the full corporate tax for the dividends earned from

their shareholdings of companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, real estate investment trusts (REITs) also

suffer  a disadvantage as the shareholders of REITs will  pay

the  top-end  corporate tax rate, whereas one of the  salient

points  of REITs is the possibility that taxes will  only  be

paid at the end of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>



the  shareholders, and be taxed at their respective  marginal

income tax rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe this is not the intention of the new

system  that  has  a negative impact on the above  groups  of

persons who are essentially low-income earners and charitable

organisations.  May I suggest to the Minister for Finance  to

consider allowing dividends to be imputed as normal income of

such shareholders.  Thereafter, they could be assessed to pay

their  respective taxes according to their personal  marginal

income tax rate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I would like to suggest a few

initiatives  related  to  tax  that,  I  believe,  will  make

Singapore even more attractive to investors and individuals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, on the group consolidation proposal that the

Minister  made, could I ask the Minister to revise the  limit

from 75% to 51%?  It seems that this is targeted to a limited

group of companies, especially property companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on property taxes, can I suggest that we

devise  a  new concept of a variable property tax system  for

businesses where the Government charges a low fixed rate of 1-2%,  and a variable rate based on percentage of profits  that

the companies make, subject to a maximum cap.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third idea is one of a reverse pioneer tax status

for  companies  that internationalise and have  positive  tax

impact  by  way  of  incentives they get  when  investing  in

foreign  countries.  We should allow such companies to  bring

their  income  back into Singapore without taxing  them,  and

allow  the  parent companies in Singapore to tax  deduct  the

capital investment they make in their overseas subsidiaries.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, preferential tax treatment should be given to

companies   which   invest  in  improving   productivity   of

manufacturing  companies, so that they  continue  to  have  a

viable presence  here in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>



Singapore.  This is similar to certain incentives that we are

giving  to  companies  embarking on  specific  projects  like

environmental and water conservation projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, the concept of negative gearing for taxes

imposed  on  individuals on income derived  from  rentals  of

properties.   They  should  be able  to  write  off  expenses

related to the maintenance of their rented properties against

their  income  taxes  and thus operate like  businesses.   In

doing  so,  we  can develop a sense of enterprise  among  our

people.  We can follow examples that exist in a few countries

and Australia is one of them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, stock options for employees should be taxed upon

realisation  of  profits and not when exercised.   While  the

Minister has allowed taxation to be delayed to the time  that

the  moratorium  ends, this seems to  be  just  half  a  step

forward.   In many cases, at the end of the period, employees

do not necessarily sell their shares.  The suggestion that  I

am making will encourage employees to hold on to their shares

longer, thus helping companies build employee loyalty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on the GST system. While I support the

system, can the Government improve the efficiency of the  tax

rebates  that exporters are claiming.  Currently,  a  lot  of

this is tied up and this affects the cashflow of companies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, I have already raised my

point  yesterday at the debate on the Budget Statement but  I

have yet to hear the Minister's reply on my suggestion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, on this cut on corporate tax, I

wish  to speak on group relief for corporate tax.  I am  very

pleased that the Government has finally agreed to allow group

relief for corporate tax.  This was a constant request of MPs

in  the past few years, but it has not been agreed to by  the

former Finance Minister, Dr Richard Hu.  We are pleased  that

the  new Finance Minister, DPM Lee Hsien Loong has agreed  to

this  proposal.  I would like to say that this is one of  the

sacred cows that we are pleased to see being removed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present scheme allows us for group relief for

corporate tax for Singapore companies, with 75% ownership  of

Singapore-based  subsidiaries.   I  would  like  to  ask  the

Minister  that in future, the scheme can be extended  to  the

following two areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, like Mr Inderjit Singh has said, to allow group

relief  for  subsidiaries that are above 51% ownership.   The

reason  is that the standard definition of subsidiary is  for

companies that are more than 51% owned.  If the concern is of

excessive tax losses due to the lowering of the definition of

the  subsidiary to 51%,  then, I would like to  suggest  that

the amount of tax relief can be accrued and computed based on

the actual percentage ownership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, to allow group relief for foreign-owned

subsidiaries of Singapore-owned companies. The main reason is

that  Singapore companies often have to go overseas  to  look

for  investment as Singapore itself is a very  small  market.

As  overseas investments are of high-risk and high reward  in

nature,  there  is  more need for group relief  for  overseas

investments to mitigate the prospects of losses.   If  it  is

the concern of Government that it may serve to be too much of

a  tax  leakage,  then the Government can  consider  allowing

group  relief for foreign subsidiaries only a limited  number

of  period,  say, only for the initial five  years  from  the

period of formation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Finance Minister would consider these

proposals favourably.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I have asked the question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I understand that

under  the  current  income tax system, an annuity  purchased

with  cash is subject to a tax of 3% of the capital sum until

such  time  that the amount deemed to be a refund on  capital

has  been exhausted.  Then all payments received subsequently

are taxable in full, while annuities purchased with CPF funds

are tax-exempt.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder why annuities bought in cash should be subject

to  tax.   First  of all, is the Government  not  encouraging

Singaporeans  to save for old age?  I think  taxing  of  such

savings meant for old age is contrary to the objective of the

Government  to  provide  a  saving  framework  for  old   age

financial security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, since we do not have capital gains tax

and  the  Government has decided not to tax interest earnings

in  savings  in the recent Budget, is there justification  to

continue to tax on annuities bought in cash?  I would like to

ask  the  Minister for Finance to consider exempting tax  for

annuities bought in cash.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong Kian Min is not here. DPM Lee.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, may I start with Mr Leong Horn

Kee  who  asked whether we have plans to bring our  corporate

income tax and personal income tax rates below 20% and if so,

whether the GST will have to go up further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I explained yesterday, our plan is to bring the

corporate and personal income tax rates down to 20% by FY2004

and to push up the GST to 5% from 1st January 2003.  We think

this is adequate and there is no need to go below 20% in  the

near  future, because with our various tax incentive schemes,

companies  qualifying for these schemes often have  effective

tax  rates  lower  than Hong Kong's.   But  we  cannot  tell,

depending  on  how  the situation develops.   It  may  become

necessary  for  us  to  go below 20%,  and  if  we  have  the

wherewithal  to  do so, we can do.  If we  do  not  have  the

wherewithal  to  do  so,  and  it  is  a  totally   different

environment,  then  we  will  have  to  re-look  at  all  our

calculations again.  But on our present plans, this is  where

we stand.  We work on this basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On reliefs, Mr Leong asked whether we have become a

nation of reliefs and rebates.  I hope not.  Our approach  is

to  grant  reliefs in recognition for individual efforts  and

for achieving certain social objectives. We grant new reliefs

only  after  very careful consideration.  We do  not  have  a

policy of creating new reliefs in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>



every  new  Budget.  In fact, this year, we have incorporated

the  personal relief into the tax structure and made a  minor

simplification to our scheme.  We agree that our  tax  system

should be as simple as possible, and this is actually one  of

our competitive advantages in Government administration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong also asked about the one-tier tax system and

noted  that  this  disadvantaged low-income  groups  and  the

charities. Under the one-tier tax system, retirees and  other

shareholders,  who pay low marginal income  tax  rates,  will

lose  their ability to reclaim their tax paid by the  company

on the dividends.  But the loss will be compensated, at least

to  some extent, because the new one-tier system will  remove

current  restrictions on the distribution of  dividends  from

capital gains and other non-taxable corporate income.  So the

base  on  which  the  companies can  pay  dividends  will  be

broader.    It  would  free  companies  from  a   number   of

restrictions  related  to distributing corporate  profits  as

dividends  and  would also enable unlimited  flow-through  of

dividends, meaning the subsidiaries can flow the dividend  up

to  the  parent and then beyond that, to the parent's  parent

and so on, without having to be taxed, which presently cannot

be done, because it can only flow through one level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These features of the one-tier tax system, along with

new  measures in group relief and lower corporate  tax  rate,

will  increase  company  income available  for  distribution.

This  could  result  in  higher  dividend  payments  for  all

shareholders   and  this  would  benefit  all   shareholders,

including individuals who either do not pay income tax or are

at the lower-income tax brackets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have introduced a five-year transition period from

1st   January  2003  to  31st  December  2007,  during  which

shareholders  will  still be able to receive  dividends  with

credit  attached.  This would give companies time to  consume

their accumulated credits and shareholders time to adjust  to

the  new  system.   The main reason for  this  change  is  to

simplify the corporate tax system and to facilitate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>



financial  transactions,  like  share  buy-backs   or   share

borrowing  and lending.  There is a trade-off, but  when  the

corporate income tax rate used to be 40%, it was important to

have  a  full imputation system because the impact was large.

But now that the corporate income tax rate is coming down  to

20%, the full imputation is desirable, but less critical.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the impact of a tax treatment on Real Estate

Investment Trust (REIT), the Government is studying the issue

and we will release further details at a later date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for group offsetting of corporate tax, which Mr Leong

and Mr Inderjit Singh also raised, we have already decided to

introduce a system of group offsetting at 75%.  This is quite

a  low rate.  In fact, if we compare with other countries, we

are  one of the lowest in the world.  Most countries  have  a

threshold closer to 100%.  In fact, Australia's threshold  is

100%,  while the US' threshold is 80%.  Let us get experience

operating  this  first  at  75%,  and  later  on,  if  it  is

successful, we can reconsider widening, lowering to 51%, pro-rating  and so on. These are complicated measures.   Even  to

introduce  group  offsets into our corporate  tax  system  is

already  a  major  departure.  We  will  have  to  craft  the

legislation and gain experience operating it before  we  take

it further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for foreign subsidiaries, that is a separate problem

because right now, foreign income is not taxed unless  it  is

remitted  to  Singapore.  If you can  offset  foreign  losses

against  local  profits, but you do not  tax  foreign  income

because foreign profit may not be remitted to Singapore, then

we  are  actually subsidising foreign ventures from  domestic

tax  revenue  and  this  revenue loss could  be  significant.

There  are people who have suggested ways to get around this,

short  of having a full global taxation system.  It is not  a

simple  matter.  Let us take it one step at a time.   The  UK

has got this scheme for loss transfer from foreign companies.

I  think they did not volunteer to do this. They had to do it

because  the  European Court of Justice ruled  in  1998  that

their regional law was in conflict with EU community law,  so

they have no choice.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>



We  have  no  EU community law to be consistent with,  so  we

better study this carefully.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also asked for variable property tax

on  businesses, low fixed rate plus a variable rate based  on

percentage  of  profits, subject to a cap.   But  this  would

change  the  principle of the property  tax.   In  fact,  the

property tax is a wealth tax on asset ownership.  I  am  told

this  is based on the annual value of the property, which  is

the   estimated  annual  rental  the  property   can   fetch,

regardless  of  whether it is in fact let out, owner-occupied

or  vacant.   If  we  switch to what Mr  Inderjit  Singh  has

suggested, we would be changing that wealth tax to an  income

tax,  and  instead of taxing the property, we will be  taxing

the  income  of  a company, and the more income  the  company

earns, the more it will be paying in tax.  We already have  a

corporate  income  tax for that.  We are  bringing  the  rate

down,  I  think we leave that alone and keep the  wealth  tax

element  in the property tax as a separate component  of  our

overall tax structure. They complement one another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also recommended a reverse pioneer tax

status   for  companies  that  internationalise  and   invest

overseas.  In fact, we already have a scheme to bring  income

back  to  Singapore without tax under section  13(8)  of  the

Income Tax Act.  But the condition is that the income must be

reinvested   and  must  contribute  to  productive   economic

activity  here.  To have a general scheme for a complete  tax

exemption  of  foreign income remittances, it is  too  big  a

loophole.   It will risk severe revenue loss and  it  is  not

going  to  be  easy  to plug this loophole  administratively.

Everybody says, "If you allow this, then the funds will  flow

back".   What you will not see is that there will be tenants.

There  will  be  many  ways  that funds  will  flow  offshore

invisibly and you will not be able to stop it.  Nevertheless,

the  idea  of a reverse pioneer, meaning do not tax  overseas

profits during a pioneer period, is an interesting idea.   It

amounts to not taxing companies for sending back their  small

profits  in  the  initial years, but  taxing  them  when  the

profits  grow  in the later years.  But this idea  cannot  be

addressed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>



on  its  own.   It has to be considered together  with  other

proposals  like extending group relief, which Mr  Leong  Horn

Kee  suggested.  Let us not get too complicated at this point

-  get Singapore companies to go overseas and make good money

first.   If  they make money, then we can talk about  how  to

arrange  the taxation.  If there is no money made, we  cannot

get started.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for preferential tax for companies improving

productivity  so  that  we  can continue  to  have  a  viable

manufacturing  sector, we already have a wide  range  of  tax

incentives for doing this.  Many of these tax incentives  aim

to improve productivity, encourage value-added activities and

technology  innovation.   For  example,  we  have  a  reduced

corporate  tax rate of 10%, and now it would be  5%.  If  the

company is awarded the development and expansion incentive we

take  into  consideration  the  value-added  contribution  to

productivity  in  the company when we assess  whether  it  is

eligible for the incentive.

<br>2.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for negative gearing on property, which means that if

an  individual  owns a property and he has  expenses  on  the

property  and  interest to be paid, and it  exceeds  what  he

earns on that property, then we allow him to offset all those

expenses, not just on what he earned in rentals, but  on  his

other  incomes, in other words, operate like a business which

owns  a  property  -  the question is whether the  person  is

carrying  on  a trade in properties, in which case,  we  will

allow  the offset, but when he sells the property,  the  gain

will  be  subject  to  tax.  Or, if he  is  just  owning  the

property as an investment, in which case he is not subject to

capital  gains  tax, but neither can he offset  the  expenses

beyond the earnings from that property from rentals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not allow interest expense deductions on other

transactions.   For  example,  if  you  buy  a  car  on  hire

purchase,  there  is interest to be paid,  that  is  not  tax

deductible.  The fact that we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>



allow  deduction of mortgage interest against property rental

is  already in a sense a concession and if we go further  and

allow interest expense to be deductible against other income,

apart from the rental income, I think it will encourage  even

more  over-investment in property.  In order that the  losses

can  be  offset against other income, I think we  should  not

introduce  any further distortions which incline people  even

more towards property purchase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, if I may point out, many property owners

are  paying their mortgage interest using their CPF  savings.

In  fact, paying their mortgage loans using their CPF savings

and the CPF monies are not taxable.  So if you are allowed to

pay  the  mortgage tax-free money and yet you  can  make  the

mortgage   interest  tax-deductible,  then  you  are   giving

individuals  tax  benefits  twice,  which  is  not  a   sound

principle to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also asked for stock options to be

taxed upon realisation of profits and not upon exercise,  ie,

when the employee realises the benefits of share ownership at

the  point of exercise of the stock option.  So therefore the

tax  liability arises at the point of exercise based  on  the

benefit  which  is  realised, in other  words,  the  discount

between  the  market  price  and the  exercise  price.   Most

jurisdictions, for example, in Britain, Hong Kong,  and  also

in  the US, for the normal stock option treatment, tax income

gained  at exercise.  In other words, once you have exercised

and  you buy the shares, whether you sell it or not, you have

already  derived the benefits, because you bought the  shares

at a discount to what they were worth on the market.  We will

tax  you  at  that point.  And, if you incur a tax liability,

you  better sell a portion of these shares to meet  that  tax

liability,  unless you deliberately want to go  long  in  the

shares,  but  then  you take a risk.   In  fact,  during  the

dot.com boom some people incurred tax liabilities and did not

sell  shares,  and  by the time they sold their  shares,  the

price had crashed and they had a big tax outstanding and some

of  them were bankrupted.  But the system is fair.  They made

the wrong judgement call.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case where the employee has to observe a

moratorium before he may dispose of the shares, now  we  will

allow  him  to pay the tax only at the end of the  moratorium

period,  which means the employee has to pay the tax only  at

the  point when he is actually able to dispose the shares and

realise  its  value.  And this is in fact a  special  benefit

which  we  are  uniquely operating in Singapore.   Other  tax

jurisdictions do not have this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may answer Mr Steve Chia's question. He raised it

yesterday  and we did not get around to it, but his  proposal

is to exclude essential items from GST.  He disagrees that we

should  tax  essential  items and he also  wants  to  exclude

services provided by the Government from GST.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have two main reasons for taxing even essential items

in  the  GST,  which  I  have explained on  other  occasions.

First,  most essential items are not consumed by poor people.

You  can say it is rice, you can say it is education services

or  health  services, but in fact, the largest  consumers  of

these  essential items are not poor people but higher  income

people.   For example, on average, if you compare a household

with  a monthly income of $10,000 against a household with  a

monthly  income  of  $1,000, on food,  the  $10,000-household

spends 3 times more than the $1,000-household.  On education,

the  higher income household spends 7.5 times more, on health

care, the higher income household spends 3.7 times more.   So

if we are going to exempt essentials from GST, it is going to

be a very large tax loss for very little benefit to the lower

income  groups.  Most of the money you are giving  away  will

not  be  to the lower income groups.  And so to make up  this

revenue,  you will have to raise the overall GST rate,  which

is going to hurt the lower income groups.  So it is better to

have an overall coverage, cover everything, keep the rate  as

low  as  possible, whether it is 3% or 5% and then we  target

the  lower  income group through specific assistance,  offset

subsidies, whatever, in order to address their special needs,

at  much  lower cost and much greater effect.   That  is  the

first reason.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that you have to make a distinction

between  what  is an essential and what is not an  essential.

Yes, I can define arbitrarily sushi to be not essential,  and

rice  and fish to be essentials.  But at the boundaries there

will  be  many  anomalies, many ridiculous things  which  you

cannot   explain.   Mr  Tharman's  example  is  what   is   a

confectionery and what is a cake.  Well, it depends  on  what

icing  and cream you put on top of it.  We are just  creating

distinctions which are meaningless but will occupy a  lot  of

legal time, arguing, defining, refining, disputing, which  is

not  worth  our while doing, and why do I want  to  encourage

people  to buy rice and fish separately instead of the  sushi

ready-made in Fairprice?  It does not make sense.  So, better

to cover everything and again the focused subsidy will enable

him to buy whatever he wants, whatever he needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for services provided by the Government, which was

another  point  which  Mr  Chia raised  yesterday,  generally

speaking, there are services which recover their own cost and

are  not funded out of taxpayers' money.  For example,  in  a

restructured hospital, if you stay in an "A" class  ward,  it

may be a Government operation, but there is no reason why  we

want  to  favour an "A" class ward in a restructured hospital

against a private ward in Gleneagles or Mount Elizabeth.  So,

in those circumstances, there is no reason to discriminate in

favour of the Government, just because the Government happens

to be providing the service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offset package is generous. You know all lower

income  groups are looked after and have at least five years'

worth  of  offsets.   We  have been through  these  arguments

extensively.  I think the best way to run a GST system is  to

keep it clean, low-cost, easy compliance, efficient, and most

convenient and most bearable for many Singaporeans.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> What about senior citizens?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> As I have explained, the GST covers

everybody, and the senior citizens, if they are in the lower



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>



income  group,  they  will be covered by  our  schemes  which

assist lower income groups.  And in the case of retirees  and

pensioners, we are also revising the Singapore Allowance  for

them,  and  that will also help them to offset any additional

GST which they will have to pay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long term, to put it in perspective, it is

precisely  because  there is going to be a  large  number  of

Singaporeans who are going to be senior citizens, and a small

number  of Singaporeans are going to be working, that is  the

reason why we cannot say we are only going to tax income, and

only  working people will pay tax.  Because in the long term,

if  you  only tax income, the burden on the taxpayer  who  is

working  to pay for his services, as well as all the services

for  the  retired people, will be very great.  Now  with  ten

people  working to one retiree it is bearable.  In  the  long

term,  three to one.  Then will you be able to sustain  that?

It  is  not possible.  It is necessary to widen the tax  net,

which  is why we have to cover senior citizens.  If they  are

not  poor, there is no reason to subsidise them.  If they are

poor, there are ways we can help them out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked about annuities and why they

are taxable.  It took me a bit of puzzling out, to figure out

they are taxable, but there is a reason.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Mr Low Thia Khiang is wrong to say that

interest earnings are not taxed.  I made no such announcement

in  the  Budget,  as far as I can remember.  So  interest  is

still taxable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the rationale for this is that we are allowing

the  capital  part portion of the annuity to be tax-free  but

the interest earnings' portion of the annuity will have to be

taxed.   So  what we are doing is, we are assuming that  when

you draw on your annuity, 3% of what you draw is interest and

the  balance is capital.  So the interest is taxable, because

interest  is  taxable  in  Singapore.   The  capital  is  not

taxable.  Until you have finished drawing out as capital, the

entire  amount which you put into the annuity over the years,

and then beyond



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>



that  we say, "Well, all the rest we will treat as interest".

So  beyond that point, the entire annuity sum will be taxable

every  month.  It is to be consistent with our approach  that

capital  sums are not taxable, but the interest is.   If  you

say  that  an annuity may have some capital gains element  in

it, so it is not purely interest, that is something which  we

will have to consider.  It is something which we will have to

study.  I think it is not something to be likely changed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head M (cont.) -

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Inderjit Singh, you have three cuts,

back to back.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I will take them together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my speech during the Budget debate, I talked about

how  the  direct  involvement of the  Government  has  had  a

profound  impact  on  the economy.  With  that  speech  as  a

backdrop, I have a few suggestions for the Minister  relating

to  how  the  Government and its agencies  should  reposition

themselves.   And  some  of these suggestions  may  give  the

Minister  an  idea  on how we can get close  to  achieving  a

couple  of the seven wish list items that I mentioned  in  my

speech.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Government regulators and statutory boards

should absolutely stay away from business.  They should  have

very specific roles as regulators and should have very little

role  in influencing and facilitating the creation and growth

of  businesses.  Currently, our regulators have  too  wide  a

responsibility, and they have a significant influence on  the

development of enterprises.  Any existing companies currently

owned by statutory boards should be immediately spun off, and

they should not be allowed to form new companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I talked about Government being lean, and it

should  endeavour  to  remain lean  over  a  period  of  time

through,  first, by productivity improvements and,  secondly,

by oursourcing non-core activities as much as possible.  Sir,

I  am not suggesting that we retrench civil servants, but  to

reorganise  and  outsource activities where the  same  people

could  be  doing  the  same thing in a  private  organisation

formed to perform the tasks which were previously done by the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One question I have for the Minister is the Government

expenditure of 5.6% of GDP.  How does this compare with other

countries?  And as the GDP grows, this percentage, I believe,

should come down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, on the issue of Government procurement

procedures, I talked about giving opportunities to small  and

medium enterprises.  When I suggested that, I really did  not

mean that they should be given the tenders, even if they  bid

higher  prices than the lowest tender.  There are many  other

procedures,  rules and regulations that govern the  tendering

process,  including track records.  I am suggesting that  the

Government look at the rest of the things and still  maintain

the  principle  of  lowest tenderer when awarding  contracts.

And  in doing so, at least, SMEs and newer companies have  an

opportunity to participate in the process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Government can also play a developmental role

by  allowing companies to test bed their products.  The  fact

that Nokia transformed from a shoe



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>



factory  to the world's number one telecommunications  player

was  because  in  the  early days, the  defence  ministry  in

Finland  allowed  Nokia  to test out their  technologies  and

products.   In the USA, big companies and the government  too

play  a developmental role by helping start-ups, particularly

in  the technology area.  The Government should therefore  be

prepared  to  allow a little higher cost and  a  little  less

efficiency as a result of allowing test bedding.  In the last

3-4  years,  this phenomenon has also resulted  in  excellent

results in South Korea, where many world-class standards  are

evolving  in the wireless technology area, again as a  result

of  test  bedding and allowing many entrepreneurs to try  out

their products.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the Enterprise Challenge, which is a

scheme administered by the civil service, be greatly expanded

to encourage test bedding, and civil servants should be given

merit  points for facilitating this in Government.  Actually,

test bedding is already happening, and I am suggesting it  be

expanded so that everyone knows about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next cut I have is on financing and risk

capital  for  Singapore-based  companies.   There  are  three

elements  that  are  needed  to transform  Singapore  from  a

corporate-based economy to an entrepreneurial-based  economy.

First,  we need the entrepreneurs or talent; second, we  need

the  regulatory  environment  and  infrastructure  which   is

conducive;  and,  third,  we need a well-developed  financing

environment.   Currently,  we have weaknesses  in  all  three

areas.   For the purpose of this cut, I would like to suggest

a  number of possible schemes which may help plug the gap  in

the financing environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest that Temasek should

proactively   provide  risk  capital   financing   to   local

enterprises,   in  addition  to  financing  Government-linked

companies.   Temasek  should also consider  partnering  local

companies to make overseas investments in technology  and  in

new  competencies  which may not exist in Singapore.   So  we

should be willing to move out of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larger companies, especially GLCs, should be allowed to

tax  deduct when they use part of their profits to invest  in

start-ups.   This  will greatly increase the availability  of

risk  capital.  Obviously, each company, including  the  GLC,

should  ensure  that their shareholders'  interests  are  not

compromised when they do that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we should incentivise and compel banks to move

from the current collateral-based financing towards cash flow

and  IP-based financing, by giving banks a 5-year tax  waiver

or  double tax deduction when they lend money based  on  this

new  method.  These waivers of tax deduction should  only  be

applicable  when there is no personal guarantee  required  by

banks,  to  encourage  the  banks to  move  away  from  their

conservative approach currently practised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also would like to urge the Minister to accelerate the

full  liberalisation  of the banking  sector,  so  that  more

foreign  banks  can  have full privileges compared  to  local

banks.    This  will  open up many more  channels  for  local

companies and individuals to raise funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, can we try to attract the likes of

Silicon  Valley Bank and Softbank into Singapore?  We  should

also liberalise our financial sector to allow our local banks

to  specialise in cash flow financing, as I said earlier, and

they should set up their bases in Singapore, and some of them

do this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home-grown companies, when globalising, should get the

support  from  their  home bases.  If  their  own  home  base

financial institutions are not helping, they have very little

hope of help from banks overseas.  We should look at the Hong

Kong's  model of the SMELoan, which is a small  bank  and  it

does not take deposits but depends on equity investments.  It

has  had  a record of lower default rate than banks, and  the

model  seems to be working for Hong Kong.  We should  try  to

duplicate it here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I have mentioned this before, and that is to make

it easier for companies to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>



raise funds from public markets, and I am suggesting that  we

set  up  an over the counter or "bulletin board" concept  for

companies  of  risky nature to raise funds from  the  public.

SGX  should  be  compelled to take the responsibility  to  do

this,  and listing requirements should be simple and  not  so

stringent  and costs need to be low enough for  companies  to

benefit.   This  could  be an electronic  exchange  which  is

easily accessible to everyone around the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the LEFS scheme, while we have achieved

limited  success, it has not effectively reached out to  many

companies,   especially  those  in   the   early   stage   of

development.  I would like to suggest that the LEFS scheme be

expanded  to  cover  the financing gap between  LEFS  and  VC

financing.   In this respect, we should allow  VCs  or  angel

investors to be included under the LEFS scheme via  a  hybrid

system where the VCs and the investors provide cash in return

for  convertible loans or preferred shares. So  long  as  the

instrument  remains  as  a  loan,  the  investors  enjoy  80%

guarantee  under  the LEFS scheme, and  they  too  should  be

allowed  to draw upon the LEFS funds, as the banks  currently

enjoy.   In  this  way, it will greatly  open  up  many  more

avenues  for financing, and it will allow the VCs  and  angel

investors  to take greater risks, because the risk  is  being

shared, as we are doing currently with the banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my last cut is on Government-linked companies. I

was  recently  asked to chair a focus group to  look  at  the

Government's  role in business, as part of Mr  Raymond  Lim's

Committee  on  Entrepreneurship and Internationalisation.   I

invited  key  people  from  the  private  sector,  academics,

journalists and also from GLCs to be part of my committee.  I

would like to say  -  and I have said it many times before  - that  GLCs  have  played a useful role as  we  developed  our

industrial  economy,  and  we have created  some  world-class

companies  like  SIA,  PSA and a few more.   My  focus  group

concluded,  quite unanimously, and this includes my  personal

view,  that the GLCs can still play a useful role, but  their

roles need to be changed and this will require significant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>



changes on the part of GLCs and local private companies,  and

everyone  needs  to  shift  from a mindset  of  distrust  and

competition   to   one   of  partnership   and   cooperation,

particularly when the companies globalise.  I would  like  to

be  constructive in my suggestions and this is in the  spirit

of  creating excellence in all Singaporean companies, whether

GLCs or private enterprises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few suggestions. Firstly, the focus for GLCs

from  here  on  should  be to globalise,  because  they  have

already  harvested the domestic market quite extensively.   I

am  not  advocating that they abandon the local  market,  but

they should get out of their comfort zones and look overseas.

Each GLC should set a target of achieving a certain target of

foreign  revenue, and the Government, through Temasek  should

drive this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when companies are corporatised from the

Government, no moratorium or privileges should be given,  and

many  Members talked about some examples and PWD  is  one  of

them.   For  the corporatised entity's own good and  for  the

sake  of  promoting  the spirit of private  enterprise,  they

should  compete  on  fair market practices.   The  Government

should also not allow corporatised entities to carry the name

of  the  "parent" statutory board, so that they  do  not  get

undue  advantage of the name, and there are many examples  of

this  happening.  PWD is one.  PSB Corporation is the  other.

In  fact,  in the case of PSB, the parent had to  change  its

name  to  SPRING, and PSB Corporation maintains its name  for

commercial purposes, I guess.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Temasek, as the shareholder, should implement

stricter corporate governance requirements for GLCs  that  it

owns.   Practices  like  the recent  loan  given  by  one  of

Keppel's subsidiaries to major shareholders do not look good,

and  indicate inadequate controls from the Government,  as  a

shareholder, through Temasek.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temasek should insist on strict financial goals for all

GLCs and have a transparent system by sharing information



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>



with  the  public to erase the perception that GLCs  have  an

unfair   advantage  and  are  governed  by  lower   corporate

standards.  The Minister mentioned yesterday that  the  GLCs,

in   fact,  are  being  operated  very  professionally   and,

therefore,  there  is  no reason why  we  cannot  share  this

information with everyone.  I believe there is a big  gap  in

perception of what it really is and what some others think.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, many GLC captains originate from the civil

service  or  from the Armed Forces.  This is not a criticism,

but   a  fact.   Many  of  them  are  unlikely  to  take  the

entrepreneurial   risks   necessary   to   create   excellent

businesses simply because of their background and because  of

what  they are used to.  Some do make the cut and are capable

of  performing even better than the leaders from the  private

sector,  but these are just a few who have made it.   I  urge

Temasek  to  consider bringing in many more people  from  the

private sector, either onto the boards of GLCs or hire people

with  true  private sector experience to head  the management

teams of the GLCs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, over the

past  few  years, the Government Ministries  have  set  up  a

number  of  private  companies to provide  opportunities  for

civil  servants to have hands-on experience in  the  business

world, to create the entrepreneurship in them,  and to create

more   jobs  for  the  people.   This  is  something  to   be

encouraged.   It  is  a kind of business  model.   But,  when

these  companies  are  set up, some  kind  of  protection  is

provided for them.  For example, when the PWD company was set

up,  most of the Government projects and contracts were given

to  this  company, without having to go through the tendering

process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the other private sector construction companies,

this  is  unfair  competition.   I support  the  view  of  Mr

Inderjit  Singh that this kind of protection  should  not  be

given  to the Government-linked companies.  Private companies

do  not  have  this privilege.  For example,  when  Singapore

Press  Holdings  set up its subsidiary companies  to  operate

Channel I and Channel U,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>



to give its journalists the new challenge of working in a new

broadcasting medium,  they were given no special  privileges.

They  have to compete with the well-established Channel  News

Asia, Channel 5 and Channel 8. This is fair competition.   In

order  to  get more audience and viewership, all  journalists

and  broadcasters have to do their best to squeeze and cudgel

their  brain, to improve the quality of their programmes  and

raise  their  standard.   Under  fair  competition,  all  the

channels,  be  it  Channel 5, Channel 8, Channel  News  Asia,

Channel I or Channel U, every station strives to put up their

best performances, and achieved remarkable results. This is a

win-win situation policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Channel I and Channel U celebrated their first

anniversary  recently, and the journalists  and  broadcasters

felt  very  proud of it, with a strong sense of satisfaction.

Through  competition,  they  have  achieved  the  status   of

satisfaction  and they have created a good  image  for  their

company  and  for their staff.  They have also generated  the

challenge that brings out the best in them.  I would like  to

congratulate all the staff involved in Channel U and  Channel

I  over  the past year for their strong commitment  and  good

work  done under fair competition.  I hope they will continue

to  work  hard  and  produce more  good  programmes  for  the

audience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was glad to hear the DPM saying that all companies

must  compete under fair conditions on a level playing field,

so  as  to create the standard for fair competition.  Private

enterprises do not have a 5-year protection or privileges.  I

would like to ask the Minister whether they would review  and

consider withdrawing the 5-year protection and privileges for

Government companies.

<br>3.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, Ministries and

statutory  boards should be helping businesses  to  grow.   I

join  my  colleague, Mr Inderjit Singh, to call on Ministries

and statutory boards to desist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>



from starting in-house units to provide products and services

that  can  be  readily  supplied by private  businesses  that

already exist, unless special requirements exist.  If they do

not,  they are really withholding business opportunities  for

the  private  sector.  Sometimes, these in-house  units  even

compete with the private sector for businesses, and some  are

subsequently spun off as independent companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example is PSB. There were many well-established

private training institutions ready to work with it.  Yet, it

set  up  its  own  in-house  unit  to  provide  the  training

programmes  that it administered.  These units were  recently

spun  off as PSB Corp.  In this particular case, it is  water

under  the bridge.  My two colleagues, who have just  spoken,

have  referred to other cases.  Government should not compete

with  the  private  sector.  Ministries and statutory  boards

should  concentrate  on their mission  and  core  activities.

They  should  outsource  their requirements  to  the  private

sector  to  help  the private businesses  grow  stronger  and

bigger,  so that companies not only operate in Singapore  but

where  opportunities exist to expand overseas.   Keeping  yet

again   to   the  training  industry,  a  good   example   is

Informatics.  The company not only operates in Singapore  but

has  successfully expanded into the region, and recently into

China as well.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, under section 328 of

the  Companies  Act,  if  a company  goes  into  liquidation,

workers'  claims  will  be given priority  as  they  will  be

treated as preferred creditors.  This means that their claims

for  any remuneration will have priority over other unsecured

creditors.   The  same situation applies when  a  company  is

placed   under  receivership.   Workers'  claims  will   have

priority  over unsecured creditors under section 226  of  the

Companies Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale for this is clearly to mitigate the

hardship  that workers face when a company winds up and  they

are left without a job and without any means of sustenance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the preferential treatment for workers' claims

does not apply when a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>



company   is   placed  under  judicial  management.    Hence,

employees  are  treated  as  unsecured  creditors   for   any

remuneration  which has accrued prior to the  making  of  the

judicial management order.  This is because employees do  not

fall under any of the exceptions specified under section 227G

(6)(b)  of the Companies Act.  Section 227G (6)(b) authorises

the  judicial  manager  to discharge  the  debts  of  certain

secured creditors, but workers' claims are not included.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, what happens is that the judicial manager

would  usually  seek an order of court to give the  employees

preferred  creditor status with respect to their pre-judicial

management  claims.   In such a case, the  payments  will  be

considered  as preferred payments made out of the  assets  of

the company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court has usually granted such an order but it is

cumbersome,   time-consuming   and   actually   means    that

unnecessary costs are incurred which could instead be used to

settle the debts of the company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I wish to urge the Minister to

consider  amending the Companies Act to give workers'  claims

when   a   company   is  placed  under  judicial   management

preferential treatment, on a similar basis as section 328  of

the Companies Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This last recession has affected many workers badly.

Many  companies  went into liquidation, receivership  or  are

placed   under  judicial  management.  Workers'   hard-earned

salaries  should  at least be given some  priority  in  these

situations,  without  having to  go  through  the  hassle  of

persuading  the judicial manager to secure a court  order  to

pay.   In  fact, many of these workers continue to work  with

the   company   even  after  it  is  placed  under   judicial

management.  Hence, it is only logical that their  claims  be

given  preferential treatment.  I would  like  to  urge  once

again  that  the Minister consider amending the Act  to  give

workers   in  companies  which  are  placed  under   judicial

management  the same status as those under liquidation  under

section 328.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, data and

information  are  the  lifeblood of an  information  economy.

Singapore  is in the forefront in this area.  The  Government

is  the repository of much information provided by the public

through  many of its services that it provides.  It asks  the

public   to   supply   particulars  and   information   about

themselves.   Sometimes,  it  is  also  statutory,  such   as

information  that  might be provided to  various  Ministries,

such  as the Ministry of Defence, for example, for enlistment

purposes and recall purposes, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the value of such information, both to the State as

well  as to the economy, is immense, and in a knowledge-based

economy,  this  is increasingly so.  In recent  weeks,  there

have  been  cases that we see in the media where  information

provided  to certain Ministries seems to have been passed  on

or  related for certain commercial uses, such that members of

the  public  may  receive  in their  mail  information  about

commercial  services that originate out of  that  information

being  passed  on by certain Government bodies  to  whom  the

information was supplied in the first place.  This gives rise

to  the  concern among some members of the public as  to  the

confidentiality   of  this  information.    No   doubt,   the

information  is  necessary for those statutory  purposes  for

which they are supplied in the first place.  And through  the

use of information technology, there is much to be gained  in

terms   of  efficiency  through  the  channelling   of   this

information,  and the coordination of this  could  also  save

much  trouble  for  members of the public when  services  are

provided to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key then would be how best can we further improve on

our  laws  in  the  area  of data confidentiality  such  that

information that is provided by members of the public, by the

citizens  of  the State, could then be dealt  with  in  total

confidence,  so  that members of the public would  know  that

without  their  express consent, that this information  would

then  not in any way be channelled to parties for which  they

do not wish the information to be made known.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also mention this because, with the increasing

use of economic value of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>



such  information,  we  have seen in  other  societies  where

information purchased through e-commerce have been amassed by

companies  in  the private sector and subsequently  sold  for

economic reasons.  Again, as Singapore progresses in the area

of  e-commerce and as we encourage development in this  area,

the enhancement of our laws in this area would further add to

the robustness of our economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Sir, first, I would like to take the issue about Government's

role  in  business, an issue that is raised  by  Mr  Inderjit

Singh, Dr Tan Boon Wan and Mr Ang Mong Seng.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a general principle, we agree that statutory boards

and  Government  departments should stay away from  business.

It  is  not  the  role  of  the Government  to  compete  with

businesses.  As a general principle, we agree with that.  But

the Government's role goes beyond just regulating the system.

So  it  is  not possible to follow what Mr Inderjit says  and

just  ask  the  statutory  boards  to  stick  to  regulation.

Because the statutory boards and Government departments  also

do promotion and provide services.  Sometimes, in the process

of  promoting an industry, they need to get involved with the

industry.   For  example, EDB, IDA, they are  promoting  that

particular  sector,  so  they have to  get  involved  in  the

industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other statutory boards provide services. You can either

provide  the  services in-house or you can buy  the  services

from  outside.   Again,  as  a  general  rule,  we  tell  our

departments  and statutory boards that they should  outsource

from  the  private  sector.  But,  on  the  other  hand,  our

departments  and statutory boards also want to be  efficient,

and  if  in their calculation, providing it in-house is  more

efficient, I think we should not stop them from doing so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two examples, which the Members raised about PSB

Corp  and  PWD  Corp, they are a different type  of  problem.

These are departments or statutory boards which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>



have  been providing these services for many years.  PWD  has

been  around  for more than 100 years; PSB, when  they  first

started,  we did not have the same equivalent private  sector

infrastructure and support providing all this training.   And

when PSB launched the productivity movement, this concept was

very new, and to provide the training, they have to do it in-house.   Having done so for many years, and having  built  up

the  capability  in-house, we now realise that  this  can  be

better  done by the private sector.  I think everybody agrees

that there is no reason why the Government should continue to

have  an  in-house consultancy department, like the  PWD,  or

that Government should have training courses done in-house by

PSB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is, how do you move this to the private

sector?   There are many options.  One way is to  just  close

down PWD, even though they may have 100 years of history;  or

close  down PSB training department.  But you demolish  value

in  doing so.  In the case of PWD, we decided that in future,

Government  departments will buy services  from  outside  and

that PWD should be corporatised and privatised.  The question

is, how do you transit to that stage?  So we decided that, in

order  not  to destroy value, we allow PWD to be  privatised.

In  doing so, we give them a five-year moratorium.  So it  is

not  a  situation,  as  Mr Ang Mong Seng  described,  of  PWD

setting   up  a  subsidiary  and  being  given  a   five-year

protection.   I can understand why some Members  have  raised

this  issue because they are presenting the perspective  from

the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me also tell Members there are two other

perspectives  that  we  can  look  at.   One  is   from   the

perspective  of the Government - the other departments  which

are  being  serviced; and the second perspective is  actually

the  people  who work in this organisation themselves.   From

the  private sector perspective, having PWD going out to  the

private sector means more competition, and they are not  very

happy.   The  counter-argument is, if we have not  privatised

PWD,  all these jobs that PWD is now doing outside would have

been done in-house.  So the private



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>



sector  is not going to get a bigger cake, in any case.   But

when  we privatised PWD, in fact, the moratorium is a limited

moratorium.  PWD was given the moratorium for projects  above

$20   million.   Anything  below  $20  million,  it  is  free

competition.  So when we moved PWD to the private sector,  we

did not give PWD the full slate of its original mandate.   We

give  them  only those projects which are above $20  million,

and   we  say  that  anything  below  $20  million  is   free

competition.  And the reason why we decided on the cut off at

$20  million  is because during this period,  there  is  huge

development  in schools, and most of the school projects  and

infrastructure projects of that level (roads, etc) are  below

$20 million.  So that gives more work to the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, unfortunately, of course, in the present decline in

the  construction  sector,  one can  understand  the  private

sector being unhappy that they only get the $20 million  part

of the cake.  They probably wish to have a bigger part of the

pie.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at it from the perspective of the people who

work in PWD, they have built up PWD for so many years, it  is

not  fair,  as Mr Inderjit suggested, that when we  privatise

such  entities, that they should not carry their name.   This

is goodwill; this is value.  PWD has a name.  Why should they

now adopt a new name and destroy value?  It is just like PSA.

When  we corporatise, and later on we privatise PSA, are  you

suggesting that PSA should not use "PSA" (the name)?  We  are

just intentionally destroying value.

<br>3.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I do not think the issue is whether the name is

retained.  I think the issue is that when they privatise,  we

deal  with them at arm's length and that they compete  fairly

and  without special privileges.  If you look at it from  the

perspective of the other Government agencies which are  being

served  by  PWD,  they have all these years  had  an  inhouse

consultancy department.  When we privatised PWD, we also want

to  make sure that the various Ministries running the  school

programme, the road programme and the various



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>



other  infrastructure  and  building  programmes,  are  still

getting proper service, and therefore this moratorium  period

allows all the various Government agencies to be assured that

when  the  whole  thing is opened up,  they  still  have  the

service which they originally enjoyed from inhouse but now by

PWD  Corp.   Anyway, this is only for five  years  and  after

that, it will be free competition, and all the projects  will

be awarded based on merit and open tender.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is similar for PSB Corp. As I have

explained earlier, it started off as an inhouse training  for

productivity  education  and for the  productivity  movement.

Having  built  that up, do we destroy the  value,  or  do  we

privatise it?  And as we privatise it, why not allow them  to

keep the name "PSB Corp"?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also asked for Government to be lean

and  to  emphasise on productivity and efficiency.   I  think

that  is indeed our intention and the civil service has  been

in  the  forefront  of many innovative changes  to  make  the

Government more efficient and more productive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh questioned the 5.6% GDP spending on

Government.  That component reflected the central  Ministries

-  Ministry  of Law, Ministry of Finance and also  Organs  of

State  - and within that big element, there is also a  budget

set  aside  for land reclamation under the Ministry  of  Law.

That explains the 5.6% of GDP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, if you look at the Singapore Government

expenditure, our operating expenditure at 10% of GDP  is  one

of  the lowest among the developed countries.  But that  does

not  mean  we  are  complacent.  It is just  to  give  you  a

benchmark that we are very conscious of the level of spending

within  the  Government, and we will  keep  this  as  low  as

possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also suggested that even though we

strive  for  the  lowest  tenderer  in  all  our  procurement

procedures we should sometimes facilitate the development  of

the  SMEs.   He knows that we are doing so in a limited  way,

although



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>



we  do insist on proper procedures in calling of tenders  and

the awarding to the lowest tender.  We do allow public sector

agencies  to  contract start-up companies with  no  company's

track  record  for IT and technology projects  of  up  to  $5

million.  So in normal tender procedures, if you do not  have

any  track  record,  you  will be disqualified.   But  we  do

recognise  that  in such areas, if you want  to  encourage  a

start-up,  then  you  should give such companies  a  fighting

chance and therefore we waive the need for a company's  track

record.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also suggested a test-bed for projects

so  as to give these companies a leg-up in their development.

He  acknowledged  that  we do have  this  entity  called  The

Enterprise  Challenge  which provides sponsorships  for  test

bedding  and  we try to identify suitable pilot  test  sites.

Whether the idea comes from the public sector, or the private

sector, or the people sector, it really does not matter.   So

The Enterprise Challenge was set up in March 2000.  This is a

$10 million fund and so far it has sponsored 32 projects with

the  private sector accounting for 13 of these projects.   To

recognise innovation, The Enterprise Challenge also  recently

created  this $1,000 Innovator Award which is given to  every

approved project for test bedding.  So it is an idea that  we

will definitely pursue further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next set of suggestions from Mr Inderjit Singh is on

how  to  plug  the various gaps in our financial environment.

All  the  suggestions  are very good  suggestions.   We  will

definitely  evaluate them.  I would just like to make  a  few

short  comments.  By and large, whether or not we use Temasek

as a vehicle to provide this financing of risk capital - that

has  been  addressed  by  DPM last  night  -  basically,  our

approach  is  that  Temasek is the holding  company  for  the

Government's  equity  investment in  companies  and  it  must

operate  on  commercial principles.  So  we  should  not  ask

Temasek to do national service.  If it is a public policy  to

encourage or provide, or to seek some of this type  of  money

for financing, then this ought to be done by the Government,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>



through the statutory boards, or through the various agencies

within the statutory boards.  So that is the first principle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, you will realise that Temasek has a

company  to invest in venture capital fund and that,  as  DPM

explained  last night, together with what EDB  is  doing,  is

really to provide the seed or the catalyst.  And once we kick-start  the venture capital sector, we will expect the private

sector to be on its own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other suggestion which Mr Inderjit Singh raised is

about  encouraging or compelling the banks to  provide  loans

based  on  cashflow principles, rather than on collateral  or

guarantee.   It  is  very  difficult  for  us  to  compel  or

incentivise the commercial banks.  They must be allowed to do

so  on  their own commercial calculations.  Among the various

banks  that  we  have, some would take this  up  as  a  niche

market, that the SMEs is the sector worth servicing, no doubt

it is higher risk.  But if you build up a core competence and

domain  knowledge of the SMEs, this is an area where you  can

do  well  and  be  competitive.  We should leave  it  to  the

commercial  banks to respond to the commercial needs  of  the

SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the specific suggestion about banks which are set

up  just  for SMEs, like what they have in Hong Kong the  SME

Loan,  this  is  something that we would definitely  explore.

Basically,  MAS would facilitate or encourage such  financial

entities  to  Singapore  as  long  as  they  meet  the   MAS'

regulations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh's other suggestion about the bulletin

board is also a good suggestion.  We would ask SGX to look at

his  proposal.  Basically, both the Mainboard and Sesdaq, the

rules  for  listing  and the rules for  raising  capital  are

already fairly liberal.  But if there is scope for a bulletin

board  which  allows  other companies to  raise  capital,  in

principle,  we do not see any objections to  it.   If  it  is

viable,  we will allow this to be operated, again as long  as

they meet the MAS' regulatory requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final segment is on the GLCs and the role of the

GLCs.   I  am much encouraged by Mr Inderjit Singh's preamble

about the GLCs.  Again, as DPM said last



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>



night,  most  of  the  GLCs  we  have  grew  because  of  our

developmental   history,  because  of   the   way   Singapore

developed.   As a matter of principle, we will be  much  more

reluctant   now   to  ask  our  statutory  boards,   or   our

departments,  to build up new companies.  But  we  have  this

stable   of  very  good  companies,  good  leadership,   good

management,  so  how do we transit?  Some we  will  keep  for

strategic reasons and others we will gradually divest to  the

private sector.  The challenge is to find investors and, more

importantly,  management teams to lead  these  entities.   We

agree  entirely with Mr Inderjit Singh that these GLCs should

move  out of their comfort zone, that they should go regional

or  global,  and  that they should observe  strict  corporate

governance in the way they operate.  We subject them to  very

strict financial targets and goals and the Government  has  a

role  as  a  shareholder, through Temasek, to make sure  this

happens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the management of these GLCs, we leave it to the

individual companies and Temasek to pick the best people  for

the  team.   We do not run a system where we parachute  civil

servants, or ex-SAF officers, into these companies.  It is up

to  the  companies, it is up to Temasek, they evaluate  these

people  on  their own merits.  If these people are  suitable,

then  they  recruit them.  Similarly, the boards running  the

GLC  companies,  again, the GLC companies and Temasek  ensure

that  the  board is a good board that can lead  the  company.

There is not a very high percentage of civil servants on  the

board.  It is less than 10%.  The GLCs and Temasek now make a

deliberate attempt to bring in foreign talent into the board.

Currently,  the  boards of our GLCs are largely  made  up  of

private sector people who serve on these boards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah asked about the employee's rights during a

judicial  management process.  I would like to  explain  that

the  liquidation process and the judicial management  process

are  slightly  different.   In  a  liquidation  process,  the

company  has gone bust and you want to distribute the  assets

and  there  is  a  clear order of ranking to  distribute  the

assets.  In a judicial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>



management  process,  they are still  hoping  to  revive  the

company.  The judicial manager is appointed and his  task  is

not  just  to wind up the company and distribute the  assets.

His primary objective is really to revive the company and get

it  started  so  that the employees continue  to  have  jobs.

Under  such  circumstances,  the  focus  is  not  on  how  to

distribute  your  assets, but really how to get  the  company

going again.  Because of this objective, the Act is framed in

such  a  way  that we give more flexibility to  the  judicial

manager   to   reorganise  the  company  and  rearrange   the

liabilities and the assets in such a way that the company can

be  revived  as  a  going concern.  So  I  hope  the  workers

understand the objectives of judicial management.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chee How raised the issue about data

confidentiality.   I agree entirely with him  that  any  data

which the Government agencies have obtained should be treated

confidentially, whether this data is obtained  through  IRAS,

or through the hospitals, or through MINDEF.  But at the same

time, we must recognise that we do not want the Government to

develop  into silos that every department and every  Ministry

and  agency collects its data and refuses to share  its  data

with  other  agencies.  If we do that, then I am  afraid  the

level of service provided by the Government will deteriorate.

So  the  question is: how do we strike a balance?  And within

the  civil service, we have very strict rules and  a  set  of

principles of how we maintain data confidentiality but at the

same  time  we  do  share information across  Ministries  and

across agencies so that we provide a better public service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise Mr Heng's point that in this modern age,

data mining is very commercially lucrative but it is not  the

intention of Government having access to this data  from  the

people to make use of this for commercial purposes.  Our main

focus is how to provide better service to the people.

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, you have three cuts in

all.  You can take them together.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Yes, Sir. On financial standards, I

was  recently in the United States to attend a conference  on

Corporate Governance for company directors.  Almost  everyone

was  seized by Enronitis.  It was instructive to observe  the

virtual paranoia amongst the non-executive directors  in  the

wake  of  Enron  and other equally famous, or  should  I  say

infamous, cases like Kmart and Tyco.  I think there is now  a

great  tendency to swing right towards more of  everything  - more  audits, more checks, more controls, more reporting  and

the list goes on.  Not only that, there is great lobbying for

all  these measures to be imposed as "best practices", if not

minimum standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, there were questions raised on how to

ensure the independence of directors on boards, how to  check

the powers of executive chairmen and top management, how much

stock  options to grant and how to account for stock options,

how  frequently to rotate auditors and how to achieve auditor

independence,   how  frequently  to  have  companies   report

performance,  and  how much detail to  be  included  in  such

public  reports.   These  are now questions  fired  in  rapid

succession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the root of the concern is more of a loss of trust

and  confidence in boards and management than  of  inadequate

practices or standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as we develop our own financial markets and study

best  practices  in the more established regimes,  we  should

carefully  review  the appropriateness of  standards  in  use

elsewhere.   In defining our own standards, how do  we  guard

against having an even more complicated or onerous form which

will  merely  raise compliance costs, but without necessarily

giving  the market the due benefits?  As it is, fund managers

in  the US are beginning to feel that whilst they now will be

receiving  reams  and  yet  more  reams  of  these   detailed

disclosures, they are not any wiser nor any more assured that

management is indeed doing a good or better job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, like to ask the Deputy Prime

Minister to enlighten the House on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>



the  philosophy the Government is adopting with regard to the

setting of standards in corporate governance, disclosure  and

the auditing for companies.

<br><br><i>Local Banks</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am moving on to the next cut on local banks. The

injection  of foreign expertise into our local banking  scene

deserves a lot more consideration.  Based on the response  to

a  query  on foreign ownership last week, I take it that  the

Monetary  Authority of Singapore still has reservations  over

allowing  greater equity participation in our local banks  by

foreign  interests,  as it wanted to ensure  that  there  are

enough locally owned banks to provide a stable base during  a

crisis.  Sir, this has different implications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one, it may imply that our local banks are obliged

to "stick-it-out" with bad debts during a crisis.  Would this

have implications from a risk-management standpoint?  In  all

fairness to non locally-owned banks, such as Malayan Banking,

they  have  remained  very much on the scene  through  recent

crises.   So,  the  link  of a controlling  interest  to  the

decision  to  operate  in  our  market  would  require   some

verification and further analysis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second implication is really whether this limit to

ownership  is,  in  fact, a limiting factor  and,  therefore,

disadvantageous to the market as a whole.  As our  market  is

relatively  small and the range of services  narrow,  foreign

banks  with  a minority interest may not find it worth  their

while  to introduce new services which may be products  being

offered through their operations elsewhere.  The scope can be

bewildering, given the convergence of retailing and  banking.

For  example,  many credit card issuers are now  providing  a

whole  host of other non-bank and financial services.  As  it

is,  competition locally for the narrow range of services  is

already intense.  There appears to be some anecdotal evidence

of this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to look at the refinement in capital adequacy

requirements  in recent years and note that  there  has  been

more emphasis on capital efficiency, we would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>



have  noticed  that  most  of the banks  have  lowered  their

Capital  Adequacy Ratios by a few percentage points to  where

they  are,  probably at around the mid to high teens  levels.

Yet, the returns on equity have not improved at all, and they

have  not actually surpassed the 10% ballpark.  The deduction

is  either  that  the customer base cannot  afford  the  same

services  at  prevailing rates, or that  managers  just  have

gotten  too  used  to  the  old ways  of  doing  business  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many have lamented the lack of innovation and risk-taking on the part of banks, which is apparently made worse

by the recent mergers.  Many also postulate that unless there

is   a  revenue  boost  and  a  margin  explosion  from   the

introduction  of new innovative products, the ROEs  of  banks

will  look  dull for a long time to come.  So, even  when  we

decide to lift foreign ownership limits in the future,  there

may  not  be  many  takers.   The related  issue  is  one  of

reviewing  the  scope for expanding the variety  of  services

which  would  have good margin potential.  For  example,  the

Housing  and  Development  Board is essentially  the  biggest

mortgage player which, hitherto, is one of the most lucrative

segments  elsewhere.  Should the HDB be confined to  being  a

housing  agency  and development agency for  the  Government,

instead of running the biggest mortgage business?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the above concerns, I would like to ask

the  Deputy  Prime Minister what are the real  arguments  for

limiting foreign participation in our local banks and how  we

can nurture innovation on our local banking scene.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now move on to my third cut on financial

services.

<br><br><i>Financial services promotion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has expended a lot of efforts on

promoting   financial  services  and  marketed  to   numerous

institutions which are currently located elsewhere in Asia or

do not already have a presence in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Equity markets</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of equity markets, we have been trying to

attract  regional companies to list on the Stock Exchange  of

Singapore, citing the benefits of going public in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, this goes against the grain of listing in

and allowing investors to trade in the country where the bulk

of  revenue is generated or assets are based.  Besides,  many

other  exchanges  are touting the same.  Understandably,  the

demand  side of the equation is important, and we would  need

to define some niche industries or competence for which would-be investors would be prepared to trade with us and for which

we  can  create a meaningful critical mass.  For example,  we

could target infrastructural-related listings.

<br><br><i>Fund management/hedge funds</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same vein, when promoting fund management,

including  hedge  funds,  we would need  to  go  beyond  just

providing   the   business  infrastructure,   primarily   tax

incentives.   As  we  do not have a great  hinterland  nor  a

natural  market, we would need to create some base  load  for

these  managers before the bigger players would even consider

relocating  or  setting up shop here.  For example,  we  have

been promoting fund management activities since the mid-1990s

and,  yet,  the  amounts being parcelled out  by  the  public

sector are far from attractive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindset changes have regrettably lagged. Public

agencies  would still prefer the tried and tested names  and,

generally,  mandate  sizes are far too small.   Likewise,  to

create  the necessary buzz in hedge fund activities,  we  may

want  to provide a base load for a diversified range of  much

smaller  players  who have the necessary energy,  instead  of

gunning  for  the  big  players.  This will  require  a  bold

programme which will involve taking more risks with  unproven

operators  in an inherently risky business.  However,  if  we

can   do   it   on  a  big  enough  scale,  there   will   be

diversification and a few winners can pay for the failures.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Deputy Prime Minister consider refining the

promotional strategy for both these segments, especially with

regard to creating local demand?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, I am heartened by

the various tax incentives in this year's Budget targetted at

strengthening  the competitiveness of our  wealth  and  asset

management  industries.  If we are seriously  going  for  the

goal  of building a world-class financial hub, we would  need

to  expand  our  derivatives market and deepen  our  existing

capital markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incentives that have direct impact on taxation of

banks  are  the  consolidation of existing  financial  sector

incentives into an umbrella Financial Sector Incentive (FSI).

Currently, the preparation of a bank's tax return is  complex

and  time consuming, due to the application of different  tax

rates  to  different products and units.  The new  scheme  is

supposed  to  simplify the tax system and should,  therefore,

reduce compliance costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that, at present, the regulatory

returns   and   tax  returns  do  not  provide   a   seamless

transference of information from one return to another.   For

instance,  revenue  from  financial institutions  comes  from

multiple  sources, both on-shore and off-shore.   To  qualify

for  the  concessionary  rate of tax requires  administrative

time and cost in splitting incomes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am mindful of the intention to merge several of the 11

existing  incentives  into  a single  umbrella  scheme.   The

scheme,   as  the  Budget  Statement  says,  will   offer   a

concessionary tax rate of 5% for "qualifying high growth  and

high  value-added activities", and 10% for "mature  but  tax-sensitive activities."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does appear that financial institutions may have to

grapple with further regulatory and definitional issues, like

"qualifying  high  growth activities"  and  "mature  but  tax

sensitive activities."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the above, I would like to ask the Deputy

Prime   Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  the  following

questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) How will the revamping of the existing incentives be

more attractive to existing financial institutions?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Does the FSI cover all products or only a few

selected ones?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Will the proposed FSI attract more financial

institutions and advisers into Singapore and, if so, how?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Will the proposed FSI result in higher compliance

costs, both in the revamp and thereafter?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, credit-card billings in the year 2001 totalled $11 billion, up 5%

from  $10.6  billion  in the year 2000  and  exceeding  total

billings  of around $8.9 billion in 1999.  In 2001, financial

institutions  wrote off $79.5 million of bad  debts,  up  28%

from  the  year 2000.  Over the past year, credit  cards  and

charge  cards  approval rate has risen by 14.4%.   In  short,

although  we  were in an economic downturn  last  year,  more

people  are getting credit cards, using them and chalking  up

bad debts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to highlight four cases across four media reports

in  the Straits Times which should give us something to think

about.   First,  more  young Australian women  are  declaring

bankruptcy after running up debts on credit cards to  finance

their  expensive  lifestyles; second, many  young  Hong  Kong

adults  are deep in credit card debts; third, young Americans

are  the fastest growing group filing for bankruptcy  in  the

US;  fourth, a young Hong Kong woman was reported to  own  80

credit cards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my meet-the-people sessions, I have come across cases

where  young residents chalked up big credit card  bills  and

sought  their  MPs  for  help.  In  these  cases,  they  hold

multiple cards and were crippled by mounting roll-over debts.

I  am  sure  many hon. Members of this House have  also  come

across similar cases.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know whether the Ministry of Finance

monitors the credit card situation in Singapore.  Are younger

Singaporeans chalking up more credit card bad debts  and  are

being declared bankrupt?  Should more be done to control  the

easy availability of personal credit facilities?   How do the

banks  determine their interest rates and why have the  rates

not  been  reviewed  for  years and why  are  all  the  banks

imposing the same rate, except for one or two?  Should we not

request the banks to clearly state the interest rates and the

late  charges  in  the  monthly  statements  to  remind   the

cardholders of the consequences?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What more can be done to educate bank customers on the

use  and risks of such credit card facilities or other credit

facilities?   I urge the Ministry of Finance to  monitor  and

study  the situation closely and do more to put a cap on  the

easy availability of credit.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are rather behind time actually, DPM.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, how much time do

I have?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Carry on, DPM.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I shall try to be brief.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, on Enron, I fully agree with

Mrs Lim Hwee Hua that the problem really is one of confidence

or  loss  of  confidence  and trust, rather  than  inadequate

standards,  and  however you tighten the  standards,  if  the

people  operating them are not honest and lack integrity,  we

are going to have a problem.

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we also have to recognise that we have

to  keep  our standards up to date and review them from  time

and  time and when there are obvious loopholes and when there

are   problems,  then  we  have  to  tighten  them  up.   The

difficulty is to strike a balance between



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>



having  a  set  of  standards which are  comparable  to  best

practices elsewhere and having a set which is not so  onerous

that,  in our circumstances, we are not able to get  them  to

work  and we are just going through the form and the  motion,

rather  than actually to maintain high standards of corporate

governance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no magic answer to this. Our approach is to

involve the private sector when we review our standards so as

to  help  ensure that the recommendations are  in  line  with

market  practices and are practical and worth doing.   Before

submitting reports, review committees would normally  conduct

extensive   public   consultation,  solicit   feedback   from

stakeholders so that we could get the widest range of  views.

I  ought to say, however, that there have been occasions when

we  have  not got as much and as timely feedback  as  we  had

hoped  to  get.   After we have settled the  recommendations,

then  people say, "I am sorry.  I should have told  you  this

earlier but there is this problem".  Where there has  been  a

serious problem, we had to go back and undo and redo. I  urge

the  industry  to take the feedback seriously  and  the  more

effort  you put in and the more candid you are in your views,

the more we will be able to come up with standards which will

be effective and worthwhile.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for form versus substance, in our capital market

standards,   our  current  standards  follow  generally   the

international  financial reporting standards  (IFRS),  rather

than the US generally accepted accounting principle or the US

GAAP.   Our  desired outcome is for companies  to  comply  in

substance,  and not just in form.  We also require  effective

enforcement actions on the one hand and active involvement of

the  private sector on the other, so that we can improve  our

corporate  governance  and disclosure  practices  over  time.

This is something which has to happen over time and cannot be

done  overnight just by fiat.  It is not just the  rules  but

also the norms and practices, the seriousness in which people

take  these  rules and the depth of understanding  when  they

implement, and their sense of responsibility - when something

goes wrong, to put the flag up so that it can be put right.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On foreign banks and whether we are hindering innovation

by  restricting the foreign banks from investing in Singapore

banks,  our  philosophy is not to prevent foreign banks  from

participating  in the industry altogether,  but  to  maintain

local  control of the main local banks. There  are  now  only

three  main  local banks.  There can be foreign participation

in  them, but not a controlling stake, and the reason is  not

that we want local banks to do national service, but that  we

want  to  align the interest of the local banks substantially

with  the long-term interest of the Singapore economy so that

in  a  crisis,  they will calculate their interest  and  will

thereby  further the interest of Singapore.   They  will  not

upstage  and  leave,  or say, "I just  cut  losses,  fighting

another day somewhere else."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the problem of range of services has to

do  with whether the foreign banks can or cannot buy into the

local banks because they are present here.  They have 40%  of

the  market, and through their own branches and their own ATM

networks now, they are able to provide quite a wide range  of

services.   In  fact, they have been quite innovative,  maybe

not  the  same  services  that you can  find  in  their  home

countries, but that could be as much due to cultural  reasons

and  mindset  and infrastructure, as it is  due  to  lack  of

market  opportunity.  In fact, some of the foreign banks  are

extremely  aggressive.  I have heard that they  even  set  up

stalls  on  five-foot ways on Saturday afternoons  and  press

people  with  application forms.  I have heard this,  not  as

information, but as complaints.  But that is the way  it  is.

If  it gets out of hand, the people in charge of touting will

look into the matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the low ROEs of our local banks, I think it is

early  days yet.  It has only been three years.  As  we  have

opened  up  the market, there has been increased  competition

and  the  opportunities for lending have not been that  great

because  of  the  economic downturn and the local  banks  are

grappling  with  the  change and upgrading  and  diversifying

themselves into fee-based income sources.  Furthermore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>



they  have  just made their mergers and there are some  costs

involved with the mergers and rationalisation.  I think  that

given time, they should be able to improve their returns  and

their standards.  Our objective in banking liberalisation  is

to  encourage  more  innovation by progressively  introducing

competition, but we cannot just pursue innovation  and  risk-taking  on  their own. We have to understand what  the  risks

are, understand them well and manage them well too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for promoting equity markets and hedge funds and

creating  local  demand,  I  agree  with  Mrs  Lim  that  for

promoting  the equity and debt markets, there is a  role  for

the public sector to start the ball rolling and to generate a

certain  base  load. We have done this for  the  debt  market

because  quite  a  number of the statutory boards  have  been

making significant bond issues in recent years and the market

has  grown  substantially.  In fact, we have been successful,

not  only in promoting the bond market, but also in the whole

fund management industry in Singapore.  In 10 years, the fund

management  industry has grown 15-fold, from $18  billion  in

1990  to  $276 billion last year.  Our debt market has  grown

substantially  too. Our survey shows that  the  bulk  of  the

discretionary  assets  that  are  managed  in  Singapore  are

invested  in  Asia, and 30% of them are invested  here.   The

amount of investments traded in Singapore by fund managers is

not insignificant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for hedge funds, we promote them, but we do not have

very  good  statistics on them because it  is  hard  to  tell

exactly  what  is a hedge fund and what is just  an  ordinary

fund  manager.   But  we have seen more hedge  fund  managers

setting up or expanding here and now Singapore is one of  the

significant hedge fund markets in the region. There are  four

-  Japan,  Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore -  and  we  are

definitely one of them.  If we took five or ten years ago, we

were not at all on the map.  We recently announced the merger

of  the approved fund manager and the approved boutique  fund

manager  schemes  in this year's Budget and I  am  optimistic

these new incentives will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>



help  to  attract  some  of these boutique  hedge  funds  and

specialist  hedge fund managers, which Mrs Lim speaks  about,

to set up in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo asked about our new tax incentives,

whether  they  would be attractive, what they cover  and  how

their  compliance cost would be.  The approach in our  review

for  the  financial sector and tax incentives is  firstly  to

enhance  the  incentives so that we are still competitive  in

the  new  landscape and, secondly, to rationalise the current

range  of  incentives so that it is easier to administer  and

comply with, precisely the point that Mdm Ho raised.  We will

be  placing  greater emphasis on high growth and high  value-added  activities and for these activities, we will  apply  a

consistent concessionary rate of 5%, which is lower than  the

existing 10% rate enjoyed by most of the financial activities

currently  incentivised.  This lower 5%  rate  will  directly

benefit   many  of  the  high  value-added  activities   that

Singapore  is  aiming  for.  The harmonised  incentives  will

ensure  that, where there are existing schemes which overlap,

they  will be simplified for ease of administration and  lead

to lower compliance cost.  How we will harmonise, how we will

work  it  out  will  take some time.  We  will  announce  the

details,  we  hope, in about six months' time.   We  are  not

going  to have a sunset clause on the overall scheme, but  we

will have incentives awarded to individual institutions which

will  have  specific expiry dates attached and the length  of

the  incentive will be based on criteria such as the kind  of

activities  or the skill sets which they bring to  Singapore.

Such  an expiry date will provide us the means to target  new

activities for promotion as the industry changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked about credit cards and young

people's  easy access to credit cards and unsecured  personal

credit  lines.  I agree completely with his concerns  because

an  individual with many unsecured credit card lines is going

to be tempted to spend beyond his means.  Borrowing on credit

cards  and  unsecured  credit is very  expensive  and  if  an

individual does not have enough means to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>



repay  his loans, he would soon see his debts piling  up  and

they  would come and look for us, as MPs, to help  them  sort

out  their problem.  As Dr Amy Khor told us recently, a young

lady came to see her and she had built up $20,000-$30,000  of

credit  card  debts, six cards.  She asked this  constituent,

"Why  did you do it?"  The constituent said, "hua de shi  hou

heng  shuang!" - when she spent it, it felt good.   Now,  she

has  to  look for her MP.  Therefore, MAS only allows  credit

cards  and unsecured credit facilities to individuals with  a

minimum  of $30,000 in annual income and even then,  we  have

limited  the maximum credit that can be extended on a  credit

card on unsecured personal lines to two months of income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, it is not watertight because consumers

can  still apply for multiple credit lines and add up to  far

more  than  two  months of income.  We need  some  system  to

prevent  individuals from having too large a credit  exposure

through credit cards, multiple cards.  We are going to launch

a  Singapore Consumer Credit Bureau in September this year to

pool  borrowing and repayment history of customers  and  give

lenders  the  list of profiles of borrowers.  When  it  comes

into operation, the card issuers will be able to monitor  the

number of credit cards which each of its customers holds, his

total  credit  exposure  and his credit  history.   The  card

issuers  can  then  manage the risk  exposure  and  use  this

information when deciding whether to grant him another credit

card.  MAS will also encourage the card issuers to be prudent

and to make full use of this information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo asked why interest rates on credit cards are 24%,

uniform across all issuers.  MAS' understanding is that it is

not  actually uniform.  Not all cards charge 24%.   Some  are

lower,  but these are interest rates which are determined  by

the  market.  I think it is a competitive market.  There  are

many  players, certainly more players than there  are  petrol

station  companies.  It is really not for the  Government  to

say  whether  this  is or is not at the right  level  because

credit cards are not a basic necessity and there is no reason

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>



the  Government  to  intervene  to  ensure  that  it  remains

affordable. One reason that the lending rate is high, 24%  or

thereabouts is because the default rate is significant.  When

you  borrow  from a credit card company, if  you  are  paying

regularly   and  paying  interest,  you  are  really   cross-subsidising  the  other  credit  card  customers   who   have

defaulted  on  their borrowing.  And because the  default  is

significant,  5% or 6%, so the interest has to be  high.  The

advice  to  you is, if you do not have to borrow,  especially

from a credit card company, better don't.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more important than trying to push the rate down

or  control the interest rate is for consumers to  know  what

interest  rate  they  are  actually  being  charged  and   to

understand what other charges are being levied on them.   MAS

requires  credit  card issuers to clearly disclose  in  their

monthly statements all the late charges and relevant interest

rates, and the Association of Banks has also acted to improve

transparency  of  fees and charges and terms and  conditions,

and  they are putting out leaflets to explain in simple terms

what  it involves, what are the terms and conditions, so that

you do not have to plough fine print and legalese and, at the

end, to be none the wiser.

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But more can still be done and I urge the Association of

Banks  to  look  into  developing  a  set  of  best  practice

standards on credit cards to take into account the  needs  of

the  public.   Then consumers can make an informed  decision,

whether they have the means to pay the principal, to pay  the

interest.  But finally individuals have to exercise  personal

responsibility to ensure he does not over extend himself  and

does not live beyond his means.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was inclined to withdraw my cut on middle income

after  listening to the Minister for Finance's  responses  to

the  House  yesterday.   However,  there  are  those  who  by

classifications as middle income would still fall between the

cracks  of the Budget, however fine the cracks may be.   Some

of  these middle income earners, who do not benefit from  the

offset package, do face daunting challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met the manager in an electronics manufacturing firm a

few  days ago.  He earns a salary of about $4,000, with three

young  school-going  children, a  wife  who  is  not  working

because she has to look after the two aged sickly parents  at

home.   They  live  in a condominium that they  bought  after

selling their 5-room HDB flat some years ago.  They were very

prudent last year.  They sold their family car.  They did not

have  this mindset that they have to continue having the car,

they   sold  the  car,  in  preparation  that  in  case   the

breadwinner  loses  his job, he does not  have  a  hefty  car

instalment  payment  to do.  They lost  money  on  that  car.

Still, they find it tough.  Worse, for those who are in  this

middle income group who are not unemployed.  They still  have

bills  to  pay, income tax to pay, and they are  in  a  bind,

hopefully they do not also have a credit card.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hear many grouses from this middle income group and

some  of  them are not all that unreasonable.  I am concerned

that these fallen "angels", as I call them, lose heart, hope,

and  become resentful.  As many of these in the middle income

group are mobile in their profession, and they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>



could be our talents-to-be for our country, I would like  the

Minister to see if they could look into something they  could

do  for  this group of people, so that for them it would  not

seem  that  it is a hopeless end, as we see it,  but  endless

hope  for them in this country.  I think I would like to  use

three  phrases in Chinese: xiwang tamen bu hui cong "xin  man

qiwang"  bian  dao "jinzhang dexiwang", bian doa  "daidai  de

huanxiang."   [Hope that they will not turn from "heart  full

of  hopes" to "nervously hoping" and then to "staring blankly

in illusion."]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I move on to my second cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong:</b> Let me declare my interest as a

banker.  As a result of the consolidation of our local banks,

many  bank employees and some bank executives have lost their

jobs.   I  do  recognise  the  call  to  consolidate  and  to

liberalise  our banking industry, as I think it is  important

and  I  firmly  believe  this  has  to  be  done.   But  with

liberalisation  we  have QFBs given to several  institutions.

For  these  bank employees who have lost their  jobs,  rather

than having them seek other jobs in other industries, can  we

not  train them in areas that are needed by these banks  that

would  want to expand in Singapore?  I understand that  there

is  a tiny issue here as we have no control over those banks'

development and marketing strategies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that MTI does not have a programme to bridge

retrenched workers in the banks but I am filing this cut as I

feel  there may be organs in the Ministry that play a crucial

part  in bringing banking business to Singapore.  And I  hope

that  the  banks,  when  they  do  decide  to  execute  their

expansion strategies, some of these employees can be absorbed

back into the banking industry.  And as far as the banks  are

concerned,  there  will  be a pool  of  human  resources  who

already have the technical ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong:</b> So I hope there will be some bridging

between these retrenched workers, the Ministry and the banks,

that are coming on-stream and with expansion strategies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Steve Chia, you have got 2 cuts. I

suggest  you just ask the questions or you would  not  get  a

reply.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, I would like to declare

my  significant  direct  interest in this  matter  about  the

market  manipulators.  It affects me as much  as  many  other

traders and investors who have suffered monetary loss because

of  the  SGX  Settlement Committee's decision on  the  Links-Island.  It has been 2 years.  I have spoken to many industry

practitioners and broking firms and they are also unhappy and

dissatisfied  with  the SGX's decision  but  they  cannot  do

anything.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been a remisier with OCBC when Links-Island

was  listed on the SGX and traded.  Subsequently, on  Friday,

11th  August,  many other investors and I  bought  shares  of

this  company in the market.  On the next available  day,  on

Monday,  14th  I contra-ed the 30 lots.  Some  of  the  other

investors also contra-ed.  Two days later, on Wednesday,  the

stock  was  suspended  by  the SGX  on  suspicion  of  market

manipulation.  It is very disappointing that the SGX took one

full year to conclude that the stock had been cornered.  What

is  worse is SGX's decision to cancel the trades done in  the

last  three  trading  days before the suspension.   This  has

caused  abnormality in the stock, especially  for  those  who

bought  the  shares a week before and contra-ed within  those

three  trading days.  Suddenly, by the arbitrary decision  of

the  SGX Committee, the buy positions on Friday became valid,

whereas  the  sell positions became invalid and cancelled  by

the Stock Exchange.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Finance Minister explain how the SGX arrived at

this  arbitrary  decision?  How has the cancellation  of  the

trades  of  the last three days helped to solve the  cornered

situation?   It  has been almost two years.  Those  investors

affected have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>



heard nothing from the SGX.  Can the Minister tell us if  the

market manipulators have been identified?  When will they  be

charged in court?  And for those investors who suffered  loss

because of the SGX's decision, what course of remedy is there

for them to claim this loss?  For further clarification, many

of the investors are going to be sued by the company.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chia, you may not get a reply for

that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> I hope the Minister can give a

fair  and helpful solution to these and other affected people

and how they can help solve the problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You have roughly 7 minutes, Mr Lim.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang :</b> Sir, to Mr Arthur Fong's two points,

I  think  both groups are catered for by our arrangements  of

the  offsets  and retraining.  So I think the  middle  income

group  really  will  also benefit from the  offsets  and  the

various   assistance  packages.   For  the  retrenched   bank

employees,  I think the same arrangements that  we  have  for

industry-specific training also will work out for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Mr Steve Chia's query on the Links-Island,

the  reason why SGX took two years to investigate is  because

it  is  a  very complicated issue.  They have to examine  the

trades   of   more  than  50  parties  involved  during   the

transactions.   They have to investigate the significance  of

the  commercial  and personal relationship of  all  these  50

parties.   They also have to investigate the cash  flows  and

the  trading  patterns of these individuals and  institutions

which were trading in the Links-Island shares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of their investigations, SGX has determined

that  Links shares were indeed cornered and I guess  what  Mr

Steve Chia is referring to is the decision of SGX on how they

should settle the market trades during this period before the

suspension.  So SGX has decided that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>



the  market trades during the period 14th to 16th August,  as

he  mentioned the three days, will be settled by cash instead

of delivery of shares.  Now they have set the fair settlement

price  at  $1.21.  They have decided that this  is  the  most

equitable solution without distinguishing whether the  trades

were done by investors with long or short positions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So having considered the circumstances of this case, the

Settlements Committee has concluded that the weighted average

of the Links shares during these three days would be the most

equitable   and  the  most  appropriate  price.   They   have

considered  other alternatives to this fair settlement  price

but  they decided against these alternatives because  it  was

less equitable.  As to what investors can do, let me just say

that   the   Commercial  Affairs  Department   is   currently

investigating  whether criminal offences  were  committed  in

relation to trading on Links shares and if the persons  under

investigations are convicted, then these investors  in  Links

shares  who traded with these persons will be able to  obtain

legal recourse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head M of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code MP 2100.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I have permission to take the three cuts

together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, please. You have about 5 minutes

for question and answer.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Thank you. First, I would like to ask

if  the  corporate tax applies to bodies or persons, such  as

management  corporations, town councils, trade, industry  and

professional associations and clubs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1197</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I would like to ask for the maid levy allowance

to  be  extended  to  single women, including  divorcees  and

widows.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I would like to ask that parents, with children

already  studying overseas, be allowed to claim double  child

relief for the remaining normal duration of the course.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong. One minute.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied):</b> I would like to ask that

the  Minister  would consider whether the relief  for  course

fees be changed and made more pro-learning so that the relief

could  be  extended to courses not relating to one's existing

profession, trade or business, as required.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, whether the amount of $2,500 can be increased

because  many  of the people who are claiming course  reliefs

are   those   who  pay  tax  and  more  likely  to   be   the

professionals,  executives  and  managers  (PEMs),   and   by

encouraging  them to reskill, they probably would  be  taking

diploma or degree courses that cost a lot more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, whether unused relief for course fees can be

carried  forward or be used by the spouse because this  would

encourage  the PEMs to attend courses using their savings  to

upgrade themselves when they are out of job.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim, you have got 2 minutes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, incorporated bodies or persons

are  subject  to the corporate rate but there is a  schedule,

and that schedule will remain but the maximum of the schedule

will now be reduced to the new corporate tax rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On maid levy for singles, I think Dr Richard Hu had

explained  last year that maid levy is meant for the  married

woman  to go back to work and therefore the maid levy is  for

married  women  with children.  Therefore,  singles  with  no

children  will  not qualify.  But divorcees and  widows  with

children would qualify.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, on the double child relief, the effective relief

is $2,000 because you still enjoy the normal child relief and

that  really translates, even at the maximum of the  personal

income   tax,   to   about  $500  in  cash  benefits.    But,

nevertheless,  the  Minister for  Finance  has  decided  that

withdrawal  of  the double child relief should  not  be  done

suddenly and he has decided to phase this out over two years.

Therefore, the double child relief would come down to  $3,000

from the Year of Assessment 2003 from the current $4,000, and

revert to the normal child relief of $2,000 from the Year  of

Assessment 2004.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the claims, I would like to tell Dr Ong Seh Hong that

we  have adjusted the amount of claim to $2,500 and based  on

the current claims, the average amount claimed per person  is

only  $1,600.  The ceiling is not causing a problem to people

who want to claim and therefore we have decided that there is

no urgency to increase the quantum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head C -

<br>4.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head C - Auditor-General's Office. Mr

Zainul Abidin, you have got 3 minutes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I beg to

move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head C of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, when the Minister for Finance raised an

amendment  to Article 148 of the Constitution, he  said  that

the  underlying rationale of this provision is  to  safeguard

the powers and independence of the Auditor-General so that he

can carry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>



out  his  duties  firmly and fairly without fear  or  favour.

Judging  from  the  report  of year 2001/2002,  the  Auditor-General's  Office  has done very well  indeed,  as  was  also

recognised by media reports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask a question, Sir. I note from the

Budget estimates that the AGO has presented its workload  and

performance  indicators,  for example,  the  audit  cost  per

million  dollars of auditable dollar, and also the  auditable

dollar  per  audit staff.  My question is whether,  in  fact,

that  is  a credible measure, and what other measures  do  we

have,  and  how does the AGO compare with other  AGOs'  work.

And, also, will the AGO take upon itself to audit expenses to

avoid   excesses  or  opulence  when  it  comes  to  building

Ministries, as the fear or concern raised by Mr Tan Soo Khoon

yesterday.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, as Mr Zainul Abidin has

pointed  out,  the  AGO's  efficiency  is  measured  by   two

performance  indicators which are based on a  proxy  for  its

audit  workload, known as auditable dollar, which is a  total

of the audited revenue expenditure, assets and liabilities of

the  auditees.  In other words, it looks at the  accounts  of

the  organisation  being audited, and it  adds  together  its

revenue,  expenditure, assets, liabilities,  its  profit  and

loss,  as well as its balance sheet.  All added together,  it

is  just a number, to give some indication of the size of the

organisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two performance indicators are the cost per

auditable  dollar  as well as the amount of auditable  dollar

per  unit staff.  The cost per auditable dollar measures  how

efficiently  AGO  operates,  and  AGO  tries  to  keep  these

indicators  as  low  as possible.  On  the  other  hand,  AGO

strives to maximise the amount of auditable dollars per  unit

staff,  as it is a measure of labour productivity.  It  is  a

rough-and-ready measure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether AGO audits for opulence, the answer is no.

It is not his job to be a censor.  It is his job to make sure

that  if  you  have built the building, the  money  has  been

properly accounted for.  But as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>



to  whether  the  building  is too  lavish,  too  opulent  or

wasteful,  that  is  management accounting,  and  that  is  a

management  responsibility.   The  Ministries  involved,  the

Permanent  Secretaries,  and ultimately  the  Ministers,  are

answerable for that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head R of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I have leave to take the three cuts together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, please.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, the legal landscape in

Singapore is going through significant changes.  The same  as

the  other  sectors  of industry, there is  a  need  for  the

profession  to restructure, or in the catchword of  the  day,

remake itself to meet changing times.  It is therefore timely

to  ask  the Minister to brief the House on the state of  the

legal system as well as on the plans to remake it.  There are

obviously some concerns that I hope the Minister can address,

and some suggestions that I hope he will consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first concern is that there appears to be a large

number of lawyers leaving the profession.  Would the Minister

be in a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>



position to let the House know why this is the case?  It  is,

of  course,  not  cheap to train lawyers.  If  lawyers  leave

practice  after  a short period, it will seem  that  we  have

wasted public money in training them in the first place.   It

is  true  that  many  lawyers appear to have  been  extremely

successful in other professions, notably, I am happy to  say,

in  the  creative  arts.   We have lawyers  who  have  become

theatrical directors, playwrights, actors, actresses and even

dancers.   Many  lawyers are now employed also in  managerial

and  other  positions  in companies.   But,  of  course,  the

concern  is  whether  there are enough lawyers  in  practice.

There are currently, I understand from the Law Society,  only

3,200 lawyers taking out practising certificates.  Given  the

growing  economy,  are they enough to service  Singapore  and

beyond?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the training of lawyers is a matter of

concern.  There is a move away from traditional practice such

as  conveyancing  into legal areas more attuned  to  the  new

economy,  such  as intellectual property law,  computer  law,

biotechnology  law.   How  is  the  Ministry  assisting   and

facilitating the training of lawyers to meet this  challenge?

In  particular,  will  there be a need to  impose  compulsory

courses  for practising lawyers, in the same way  as  doctors

are  expected  too,  to upgrade their skills  and  knowledge?

This  is  also  currently  the practice  of  many  countries,

including England, where there is a felt need to ensure  that

the  legal profession is kept up to date with the development

of laws, especially in relation to those new areas.  There is

also  a felt need to train our lawyers, who are mostly  tuned

to  litigation,  to  improve  on  their  alternative  dispute

resolution  skills, such as arbitration and mediation.   What

is being done to improve that?  Indeed, given the practice of

law  now requires individuals who are not just good in  legal

analysis, but also in other disciplines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Minister, for example, have a view on whether

we  should have law as a post-graduate discipline, as is  the

case  in  the  United States, rather than as an undergraduate

discipline?  Take a very simple example on this type of need.

If a lawyer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>



actually wants to be a patent attorney, he would need to have

a  good  grounding  in  science as well  as  in  engineering.

Similarly,  we  can see the need for non-legal  training  and

many  other  areas,  such as economics, statistics,  computer

science  or  life  sciences.  Given that this  is  the  case,

should  we  not  then look to either making law  as  a  post-graduate degree, or having double degree programmes,  started

in our universities?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I wish to raise the issue of whether the influx

of  foreign lawyers into Singapore has achieved the result of

transferring of technical know-how to our local lawyers.  The

Legal Profession Act was amended to allow local firms to have

joint ventures with foreign firms, so that there can be  such

a  transfer.  Can the Minister give us an update on the joint

law ventures with foreign firms?  Recently, we have seen some

local firms parting company with their foreign partners.  The

divorce rate, given the numbers, seems to be quite high.  Why

are  the relationships so short-lived?  Can the scheme really

be  regarded  as a success in so far as it is  unlikely  that

much  transfer of expertise could have been done in this very

short period?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, developing Singapore as an arbitration hub.

One  of  the  most  useful fiscal measures announced  in  the

current  Budget is that of the withholding tax exemption  for

arbitrators.   International  arbitrators  were  subject   to

withholding  tax  at the prevailing non-resident  income  tax

rate   of  24.5%.   To  promote  this  arbitration  industry,

payments to international arbitrators have been exempted from

withholding tax, with immediate effect.  This is no doubt  an

important  step  as it will immediately reduce  the  cost  of

international arbitration in Singapore.  Personally,  I  have

heard  from  two  well-known  international  arbitrators  who

originally  lamented that they were unhappy about  having  to

pay  this  tax,  that they would be much more  interested  in

working in Singapore if they were exempted from such  a  tax.

So I think this is actually a very good sign.  Their wish has

now been granted.  But I believe that it would be unlikely to

result in an immediate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>



improvement  in  the international arbitration  situation  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us put the arbitration scene in perspective. For

example,  the American Arbitration Association and the  China

International Commercial Dispute Resolution Centre, each  did

over  500  arbitration cases in the year  2000.   Singapore's

International  Arbitration Centre, on the other  hand,  dealt

with  very  much less, about 100 cases a year.  So  the  task

would  be  a very enormous one, and I would like to  ask  the

Minister how his Ministry, perhaps working together with  the

other relevant agencies, could put Singapore on the map as an

international arbitration centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest for one thing that, given the fact that

Singapore  companies are branching out into  the  region  and

beyond  and  doing  business  globally,  would  the  Ministry

persuade  and advocate that such companies do their  best  to

promote  the  use  of Singapore law as the governing  law  of

transaction,  so  that arbitration can then be  conducted  in

Singapore?    Additionally,  may  I  ask  whether  additional

facilities  are planned to enhance the quality of arbitration

premises in Singapore.  Because usually arbitration cases  in

Singapore  are  done  in hotels, and  there  have  been  some

reservations about the suitability of some of our hotels  for

this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, and perhaps more importantly, are we, first of

all,   training   enough   arbitrators   with   international

potential; also, training support staff necessary to  have  a

first-class  arbitration service?  For  example,  in  a  good

international arbitration, what is needed is that there  will

be  professional reporters who can record verbatim reports of

the  arbitration proceedings.  Very often, such professionals

are  not  available  in  Singapore and  frequently  costs  of

arbitration are increased because such personnel have  to  be

flown in from places such as Australia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister can give some answers to these

various concerns.

<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I would like to

ask the Minister about the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>



current  policy  with  regard to the quota  of  law  students

allowed  to  practise  in Singapore, and  that  includes  the

numbers admitted to NUS as well as the restrictions on  those

coming  in from foreign universities.  I ask this because  in

1993  there were amendments to the Legal Profession Act where

we restricted the numbers of lawyers allowed to practise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the reasons for that were two-fold.

One, it was to regulate the quality of the lawyers allowed to

practise, a reason with which I agree fully.  The second  was

the  allocation of manpower, because the concern was that too

many  people  might go into law, resulting in the  detraction

from  the other areas of the economy.  On the second  reason,

what  we have seen from the impact of the amendments in 1993,

which  was  felt  in  1997, was a fairly sharp  reduction  of

lawyers available for practice in the market.  That seems  to

have  the effect of actually driving up the starting salaries

of  lawyers  because there were fewer good talents available.

Secondly,  we  did  not at that time take  into  account  the

phenomenon  that we saw after 1997, which was the  increasing

numbers of lawyers leaving practice.

Without  meaning  to take away from the Minister's  right  to

reply  to Prof. Chin Tet Yung, I can actually enumerate  some

of  the  reasons why the lawyers have been leaving  practice.

Firstly,  there  are  those who leave  for  personal  reasons

because  they have decided that law is not their thing.   The

second  group are those who have decided that practice  is  a

little  bit  too  stressful, but they  would  still  like  to

maintain contact with the law and therefore go and become in-house counsel or some other law-related practice which is not

actually  professional practice.  The third group  are  those

who  join  foreign law firms and therefore  do  not  practise

Singapore  law but practise offshore law, either in Singapore

or overseas.  So the policy on the restriction of the numbers

appears  not to take into account this leakage.  Perhaps  the

Minister  could comment on that.  Also in commenting  on  the

numbers  of lawyers admitted to practice, would the  Minister

also let us



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>



know  whether  the  Ministry  has  taken  into  account   the

increased demand, or potential demand, bearing in mind,  that

now  there  is  actually a greater demand for  what  we  call

professional  support lawyers (PSLs).  These are  the  people

who  do  research,  for example, or carry out  administrative

functions.   They are qualified lawyers and their background,

as lawyers, is helpful but they do not actually practise law.

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the fact that we wish to develop Singapore as

an  arbitration  hub means that we need the  back-up  support

from lawyers as well.  And thirdly, the fact that we wish  to

develop  Singapore  as  an IT hub  again  is  going  to  need

lawyers.   So  I  would  be grateful if  the  Minister  would

comment on the quota of lawyers available for that.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, one of the major

concerns  has  been  the costs involved in  taking  cases  to

court.   Lawyers have never been cheap, but also they  remain

not  cheap these days.  Some of the lawyers in this House may

be able to confirm this trend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither are costs involved in bringing cases to the

courts.   Indeed,  many  Members  of  this  House  must  have

received feedback from residents saying how expensive  it  is

to  bring private action suits, enforce your rights,  and  so

on.   Singapore has an enviable reputation no doubt  for  its

efficient courts and its pro-business approach.  But all  the

kudos received from businessmen, and the like, would not make

our  legal  system  a great one if the common  man  or  woman

cannot  have  reasonable cause to use  the  legal  system  to

resolve disputes and enforce his rights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, Sir, I would like to suggest that we look

into  how we can bring justice to the heartlands as it  were.

We already have community mediation centres set up in various

parts  of  Singapore.  Can we not have a circuit of mediation

centres  or  small claims courts for settling  minor  claims,

that is, claims not over $10,000



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>



perhaps,  where  the  costs  of  hiring  lawyers  or   filing

documents would not be too prohibitive?  In fact, such courts

may  take the stance that they should not have lawyers at all

in  such  cases.  I should also like to suggest that  we  can

involve   more  members  of  the  community  in  the  dispute

resolution  process.  Right now, some community  leaders  are

already trained in mediating neighbour disputes.  It  may  be

appropriate  to  increase  their role  to  include  mediating

between,  for  example,  traders  and  consumers.   I  wonder

whether that would be something we can see in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore can, of course, be very proud of its

legal system.  Our lawyers are well trained and this has,  of

course,  been  the envy of many.  But the quest for  justice,

especially for the common man, is not an easy one and  it  is

not  a  cheap one.  It is very important therefore to have  a

legal  system that is affordable.  At the end of the day,  if

the  man-in-the-street  agrees  that  our  legal  system  can

dispense justice fairly quickly and at reasonable cost,  that

should perhaps be the most sought after kudos that one  would

want.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Sir, I thank

the  two  Members  who have spoken.  I notice  that  quite  a

number  of serious items are proposed to be raised under  the

Ministry  of Law, but the time allotted is very limited.   So

to  enable as many of the topics to be raised, I will  be  as

brief  as possible to enable answers to be given on the other

cuts  that  are  forthcoming.  And I  apologise  if,  in  the

process of being brief, I do not give complete answers and if

a  serious  point has not been answered, I hope Members  will

raise it under Questions for Oral Answer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take first the different aspects related to the

legal   profession  on  law.   First,  lawyers  leaving   the

profession.  What Prof. Chin and Ms Indranee Rajah said in  a

sense  are  related to matters of the same issue.  Are  there

too  few  lawyers today?  Why are they leaving?  Is  there  a

need to worry?  What must be done?  This is partly caused  by

the  publicity about lawyers leaving the private  sector.   I

think that, like any other job, people leave the legal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>



profession for various reasons.  And since Ms Indranee  Rajah

has  listed some of them, I will not repeat them.  But  there

are  many  reasons.   And  I  do  not  want  to  add  to  the

speculation whether it is the stress of the work, and so  on.

But  I do want to say that the legal profession is in a state

of  flux  because of the many changes that have  taken  place

within  the  global  environment  and,  indeed,  within   our

economy.   The profession has experienced a wide  variety  of

changes  and changing expectations of how the legal  services

will develop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, to some extent, I am not surprised that quite a

number of lawyers are leaving the profession in recent years.

I  think  things would settle down after we have gone through

the  period  of  redistribution  of  legal  talent  following

especially  the  abolition  of the conveyancing  scale  fees.

Should we be concerned?  What should we do?  The first  thing

we  should  do  is  to  have a better  understanding  of  the

underlying  reasons  why  lawyers  are  leaving  the  private

sector.  And this is one of the main reasons why the Ministry

of  Law  is conducting a very comprehensive survey,  together

with  the  Department of Statistics, on  the  legal  services

industry and the profession.  The response to the census,  in

fact,  has  been  very  good.  Some  99%  of  the  law  firms

responded and 75% of individual lawyers have responded.   The

information  is being collated and, I think,  for  the  first

time,  we  have an in-depth study of the nature of the  legal

industry and the profession.  Hopefully, we will then be able

to  chart  the various directions and steps that need  to  be

done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the quota of law students, Ms Indranee Rajah was

right about the rationale for these steps we have taken.  The

emphasis  is really more on quality than on the numbers.   In

this  regard,  the  Second Committee's Report  on  Supply  of

Lawyers, made only last year, made recommendations on how  we

can bring a wider variety of talents into the profession, and

these  include admitting of law students from Australia,  New

Zealand, giving the Board of Legal Education



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>



greater  flexibility in approving combined and double  degree

courses  and  in admitting, on a case-by-case basis,  quality

graduates who do not meet the normal criteria.  I should,  in

response  to  the point that she made, assure  her  that  the

Committee,  when  adjusting the NUS intake  numbers,  did  so

taking  into account the higher attrition rates in the  legal

profession.   This  is  one of the  factors  they  took  into

account.  But here, again, I would say that it would  take  a

few years before the effects on the recommendations are felt.

In  the  meantime, we may experience two or  three  years  of

negative growth in the number of lawyers.  But I do not think

there is reason to be overly alarmed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She mentioned the need for us to take into consideration

lawyers  who would be in supportive role, other than  in  the

private  practice  of  law.   I  do  not  think  there  is  a

restriction  on that.  For example, the restriction  we  have

from one of the scheduled universities, having a second class

upper degree, is a restriction on practice of law.  But there

is no restriction for non-practitioner roles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the end of the day, let me repeat what I have

said  before on numerous occasions in this House, that  I  do

not  view these figures as being cast in stone, that when  we

have  these  reviews and adjustments, we must be prepared  to

adjust to changing circumstances.  And if there is a need for

us  to  make adjustments earlier than expected, for  example,

after  we  have  studied  the  comprehensive  report  that  I

referred  to, we should be prepared, and I would be prepared,

to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for training of lawyers, a point raised by Prof. Chin

Tet  Yung,  the Law Faculty, the Law Society, the Academy  of

Law,  to  name a few organisations, do conduct a wide variety

of  courses for training of law amongst our legal profession.

There are all sorts of seminars and workshops, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question whether continuing legal education

should  be  made compulsory, I am of the view that  the  lead

should  not  come  from  the  Government.   It  must  be  the

profession itself that realises that it is in the interest of

the profession to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>



be abreast of fast changing developments in Singapore, in the

region,  in  the  world, both in law and  other  disciplines,

which have an impact on law.  So it is in the interest of the

profession  to  provide for continuing  legal  education  and

whether they would like this continuing legal education to be

made  optional, or compulsory.  I would first  want  them  to

study the matter and take an initiative.  If, after they have

studied it, they feel that amendments to the Legal Profession

Act  ought to be made, I would be prepared to entertain  this

request.  But I would rather that this approach be taken than

a  Government  decree  in  the first  place  that  the  Legal

Profession  Act should be amended to make it compulsory.   In

this  regard,  we would be prepared to have discussions  with

the Law Society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for post-graduate degrees, we have discussed this

last  year,  and  I  would like to point  out  that  the  key

considerations are to take into account scarce resources, the

need  to  prevent legal education from becoming prohibitively

expensive.   Having said that, I am aware that  the  NUS  Law

Faculty is encouraging more graduates to take law as a second

degree.   It is also moving towards allowing law to be  taken

as  part of a multi-disciplinary degree.  And in this regard,

they  are also considering the possibility of law as a double

degree.  I do not know when they will take the decision.  But

I  think  this is moving along the direction that Prof.  Chin

mentioned, and these are good moves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Prof. Chin talked about the joint law venture (JLV)

scheme.  He asked for an update, whether it was a success and

why  the  joint law venture was so short-lived.   To  quickly

recap,  the objective of the joint law venture scheme  is  to

ensure that there is a sufficient top-tier legal expertise in

Singapore to service our growing financial sector.   The  JLV

scheme  serves to achieve this by attracting more top foreign

legal  talent  to  Singapore and providing opportunities  for

Singapore lawyers to be trained with the leading law firms of

the world and, thereby, facilitate transfer of top-tier legal

expertise  to local firms.  In terms of training of Singapore

lawyers, most of the JLVs have indeed put in place



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>



comprehensive training programmes for Singapore lawyers.  And

I  think  benefits  of this objective of training  are  quite

clear.  In terms of transfer of legal expertise, because this

is in existence for just a period of 20 months, there are not

really enough opportunities for this to take place in a  very

significant way.  To compound matters, the uncertain economic

outlook in the region has also made it difficult.  But  as  a

partner from a top UK law firm recently quoted in Legal Week,

he  said,  "it started a bit slowly because of the  downturn,

but  now  the  benefits are coming through and we  are  happy

about it."   We should be better able to assess the situation

after  the  economic  outlook of the region  picks  up.   But

nevertheless,  the local law firms have been able  to  obtain

considerable intangible benefits from the JLVs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked why are these relationships short-lived?

Again,  let us remember the JLV system has been in  operation

for  about only 20 months.  It is therefore too early, in  my

view, to arrive at any final judgement on the scheme.  Out of

the  eight JLVs, only one has been dissolved.  So, that  does

not  tell us enough to arrive at a conclusion on the  success

or failure of the scheme.

<br>5.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Chin talked about access to the justice

system.   I  think we cannot disagree with him that  we  must

always  ensure that there is access to the legal  system  for

the common men.  But our position here is not as bad as Prof.

Chin  would  make it out to be.  For those who really  cannot

afford  legal  fees  at  all, there are  various  avenues  of

assistance which are available, including legal aid and  free

legal  advice at various legal clinics.  The Legal Aid Bureau

revised the means test quite recently and more people,  as  a

result,  qualify.  There has been some 15%  increase  in  the

number of cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that when we talk about cost of legal

proceedings,  there are really two components.  Firstly,  are

the  court fees, which include stamp fees paid for filing  of

court documents and so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>



on, and hearing fees.  Secondly, the fees charged by lawyers.

As  far as the costs by courts are concerned, the courts have

taken  efforts to keep court fees low.  Stamp fees  have  not

been  increased  since  1991,  and  hearing  fees  have   not

increased  since 1993.  So, there have been efforts  to  keep

them low.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for lawyers' fees, like all professional services,

lawyers'  fees are determined largely by market forces.   Are

they  too  high or too low?  Prof. Chin says the lawyers  are

not  cheap.   How  do  they  compare  with  other  countries?

According  to  Asia-Pacific  Legal  500,  "Singapore's  legal

market  is  extremely competitive.  Fees remain at relatively

low levels, particularly among Singaporean clients who, as  a

result,  receive some of the best value legal advice  in  the

world."    Compared  to  their  international   counterparts,

Singapore  lawyers  are cheap.  But that  does  not  mean  we

should not strive to reduce legal costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, let me also say that the justice system

does  not  mean  only  the courts.  We must  also  take  into

account  alternative dispute resolution methods.  He referred

to  the mediation centres and the Small Claims courts.  Since

there  are two MPs who are moving cuts on mediation later,  I

will  leave  it  to  my colleague, Senior Minister  of  State

Assoc.  Prof.  Ho Peng Kee, to deal with that shortly.   But,

overall,  I do not think the cost situation in Singapore  has

posed such onerous obstacles.  Our court fees have been  kept

low,  our lawyers' fees are competitive internationally  and,

for  those who cannot afford, there are various alternatives.

But we should seek constantly to see how we can improve it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on his point about arbitration, I welcome his

comments  about the recent Ministry of Finance's  removal  of

the  tax.   I agree with him when he says we should  position

ourselves in Singapore as an arbitration hub.  It is a matter

on  which  I  myself have spoken.  I think we  have  all  the

assets   and  advantages  to  do  that.   We  have  excellent

infrastructure, a good



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>



legal  system,  our  reputation is sound internationally,  we

have  common law and English-speaking lawyers.  He  mentioned

China.  I think we are one of the few places where there  are

English-speaking  lawyers who are familiar with  the  Chinese

language and traditions.  So we have all these going for  us.

We  have  to  harness these strengths and position ourselves.

The  removal of the tax for international arbitrators is  but

one step.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, much more must be done. He has enumerated

many   points  to  be  taken  into  consideration.   We  will

consider, and I will ask those who are following up  on  this

to  take into account Prof. Chin's ideas.  Working with other

agencies?  Indeed  we  do  so.  We work  with  the  Singapore

International Arbitration Centre, Singapore Academy  of  Law,

the  Law  Society and various other agencies in our  plan  to

develop  Singapore as an international arbitration  hub.   If

Prof. Chin wants to be involved in this exercise, we will  be

happy to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the Legal Services Working Group,

chaired  by  Solicitor-General Mr Chan Seng  Onn  and  Senior

Counsel Mr Shanmugam, will be making recommendations  on  how

Singapore can be further developed as an alternative  dispute

resolution  hub  in  this  region,  and  I  understand  these

recommendations will be examined carefully.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have several other points here, but I should allow

other topics to be raised.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How:</b> Sir, Singapore is a small country and

our  people live and work close to one another.  With  better

education, our citizens are becoming more conscious of  their

individual   rights.   At  the  same  time,  with   increased

competition and volatility in the economic landscape,  stress

in society grows.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sets the stage for an increased likelihood of

friction in many different areas.  For example, at our  meet-the-people sessions, it is not uncommon for us to come across

some  long-drawn  disputes between parties.  These  disputes,

though  not  very complex, tend to drag on and they  drag  in

other bodies, such as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>



various  Government  agencies, and then  they  go  round  and

round.   There is great effort expended on the  part  of  all

sides, but not always for commensurate benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singaporean society not to become overly litigious

in this new setting, mediation seems to be a good alternative

to  be  used.   I would like to ask the Minister whether  the

Government or his Ministry will be taking additional measures

to increase the use of mediation in dispute resolution at the

community  level,  and  will the Government  consider  making

mediation  mandatory, at least for certain types of  disputes

between   individuals  on  the  recommendation   of   certain

authorised persons and, if so, what steps will the Government

be  taking  to  develop  the manpower needed  to  staff  such

mediation infrastructure?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, along the same vein as what my

colleague, Mr Heng Chee How, has just spoken about,  I  would

like  to touch on another perspective with regard to the need

for mediation centres to be set up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than tensions or conflicts arising among

neighbours,  one increasingly common phenomenon  is  actually

the area pertaining to conflict mediation that has to do with

school-going  teenagers.   The  police  and  other  community

agencies  have very wisely recognised this and have organised

street  soccer and other games to ensure that kids  are  kept

away  from  unwholesome  activities,  especially  during  the

school  holidays.  However, my concern is that while  playing

these games, kids do get involved in scuffles and fights over

the game itself.  Since youths are more disposed to outbursts

and,  if  tensions  built up are not released  earlier,  they

actually  can  get very explosive.  This, to my  mind,  is  a

cause for concern for a community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where I would like to urge our grassroots and

youth  leaders to play a more active role in helping to  deal

with these problems.  But, as things stand at the moment, not

all  our  grassroots and youth leaders are properly  equipped

with the skills to handle these sensitive issues.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister consider setting aside more money for

the  community and social sector development agency or  other

agencies  within  the  ambit of the  Ministry  to  help  fund

courses  to  train  our  grassroots and  youth  leaders  with

awareness  and  skills  programmes?  Can  the  Minister  also

consider  some  publicity  promotion  of  existing  mediation

centres?  Lastly, can the Minister review how we can  educate

and encourage the ordinary citizens to seek the assistance of

such centres?  All these will work towards fostering a spirit

of harmony and neighbourliness in our housing estates.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I would like to propose three

areas  to promote enterprise.  First of all, bankruptcy laws.

I  would like to suggest that the Ministry look at trying  to

differentiate   between  bankruptcies  caused   by   business

failures, especially start-ups, versus bankruptcies caused by

fraudulent or criminal cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, people who fail in attempting to start companies

and  attempting to be entrepreneurs.  If we take them out  of

the  system,  it  will be a big loss, because  they  are  the

people who can come back and do a lot more in trying to start

up more successful companies later on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, on self-destruct laws, I support the call made

by Mr Raymond Lim to put in place laws which self-destruct or

have sunset clauses in them, for obvious reasons that they do

not  get  outdated and do not become a hindrance  over  time,

especially for businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, on the legal system for the new economy, while we

are advancing in technology and in many other areas, I do not

think our legal system is able to keep up, especially in  the

area  of  intellectual property, cross-border laws,  etc.   I

suggest that we try to benchmark other countries and  try  to

learn  the things that have been done by others and implement

such  things  as  quickly as possible into  Singapore.   But,

until  we  can do that, there will be issues which  we  still

cannot resolve, and I would like to suggest that we implement

a  system  of  visiting judges, where we invite  judges  from

countries



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>



with  prior experience in the areas which we need and do  not

have  right now.  We can invite such judges from time to time

to arbitrate on issues and resolve issues, and this will give

confidence  for investors to actually do more complex  things

and technology type of activities in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Wang Kai Yuen is not here. Mr

Ravindran.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, the Singapore

Land  Authority  is the biggest owner of land  in  Singapore.

Two  years ago, I made a call in this House for the then Land

Office to be pro-active in putting up land for public use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that Singapore Land Authority can be more

pro-active  in  putting  up  vacant  land  for  public   use.

Recently,  in a dialogue session with my grassroots  leaders,

it   came   across  very  clearly  that  whenever  grassroots

organisations  want to make use of State land, the  Singapore

Land  Authority usually requests a high rental or they  claim

that land is needed for other purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Singapore Land Authority to

seriously consider how they can open up State land for public

use,  particularly in the area of sports and  recreation.   I

understand  that  pressure comes from  the  Auditor-General's

Office, which demands that State land be rented out at market

prices  wherever  possible.  But my call is  that  we  should

release  such  State land, particularly those which  are  not

required immediately within the next three years, to  be  let

out  for public use so that we can encourage greater use  for

sports and recreation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my second point relates to zoning in Singapore.

Many of the State land are usually either zoned as commercial

or residential usage.  I would like to make a call whether it

is  possible to create some new category called critical  and

essential  services  such as sports  and  electricity  plants

where we do not charge the full market value so that many  of

our leading corporations, eg, PSA and Changi Airport,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>



can  compete with other big players in the world which  enjoy

cheap  land  and  other special grants from their  respective

governments.   I would like the Singapore Land  Authority  to

consider this request seriously.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How:</b> Sir, I would like to support my

colleague,  Mr  Ravindran, in calling for a  more  pro-active

use,  at  least  temporary  use, of  vacant  State  land  for

community purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are pockets of vacant State land in most

constituencies in Singapore and some of these pockets may  be

actually left vacant for fairly extended periods.  Therefore,

I  would  like  to join the call for the SLA  to  consider  a

policy of more actively and easily allowing community use  of

such lands.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, some of my

points  have  already been raised by my colleagues  who  have

spoken before me and I shall not repeat them.  I, too,  would

like to call upon the Singapore Land Authority to be more pro-active  in  allowing  vacant land to be  used  by  grassroots

organisations and other non-profit organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the Singapore Land Authority also

offers   rebates   on  charges  and  levies  for   grassroots

organisations  and non-profit organisations.  In  land-scarce

Singapore,   this   is  indeed  a  welcome  development   for

grassroots  organisations and the community.  It should  also

be  good  news for the SLA as it can now save on  maintenance

costs while the land is put to good use until it is time  for

redevelopment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for many grassroots organisations which will

have to incur costs in converting the land for community  use

and  maintaining  it, the rebates may not be  sufficient.   I

would,  therefore,  like  to urge  the  Ministry  of  Law  to

consider increasing the rebate or levying just a nominal rate

for  recognised grassroots organisations that use State  land

for   non-profit  activities  that  are  beneficial  to   the

community.  The Singapore Land Authority should also list  on

its website the areas where there are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>



vacant State land that will not be required for redevelopment

within the next three years or longer, the application  rates

that will be charged and the conditions for use of the land.

<br>5.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GROs, community organisations and members of the public

can then put forward creative and beneficial ideas and, where

applicable,  even  manage the temporary use  of  such  vacant

sites until the land is required for development.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Ho, you have 14 minutes.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Sir, I thank the Members for sharing their

concerns on Ministry of Law matters.  First, let me take  the

cuts on community mediation by Mr Heng and Mdm Ho.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those of you who were in the House four years ago

would  have  sat together with me as we passed the  Community

Mediation   Bill.   That  was  a  landmark  move,  signalling

Government's  intention to promote community mediation  as  a

means of settling community disputes.  All of us who know the

ground  will  know  that  there  are  some  of  these   minor

relational   disputes  between  family  members,  neighbours,

stallholders,  which  lend  themselves  more  to   settlement

through  mediation  rather  than litigation.   Unfortunately,

some  of  these cases end up in court.  That is no  good  for

community  bonding and social cohesion, a point that  Mdm  Ho

has talked about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, four years on, Sir, I am pleased to say that we

have made good progress in this area.  In other words, we are

on  track.  Just some statistics to cheer us up.  But  it  is

not  just the statistics, for those of us who know the ground

will  agree, we are cheered more by actual cases that we have

come across where people, through mediation, have had some of

their disputes settled amicably.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over these 3-4 years, our CMC has facilitated some 800

mediation cases.  We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>



have  set  up  three CMCs.  Sir, more cases are  increasingly

being  handled, starting from 120 in 1998 to 211 in 1999  and

last  year,  273.   Of course, we are not just  wanting  more

cases  to surface.  For we all know that there are cases  out

there  which  really should be mediated, and  these  are  the

cases  we  want to encourage to be so mediated. Mediation  is

indeed  the  way  to  go  to settle  these  minor  relational

disputes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we are cheered, what more can be done? I think

that  is  the  point that the two Members have talked  about.

This  is  sort of a wish list which answers Prof. Chin's  and

Mdm  Ho's  concerns.  The first is that we  will  proliferate

mediation  venues  on  the ground.  Besides  having  flagship

mediation  centres,  which  should  be  spearheaded  by   the

Community  Development  Councils, which  we  hope  will  take

ownership  of the process because, after all, it is  also  in

line with their aims to promote community bonding, we hope to

designate  two  or three satellite mediation  venues  on  the

ground  in  each District, working in concert with the  CDCs.

In  this way, mediation services will be made more accessible

to   Singaporeans.   Hence,  we  have  started  with   having

mediation venues now in Community Centres in Ang Mo  Kio  and

also in Eunos.  We will do more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mdm Ho has talked about training of more

grassroots leaders and volunteers.  Indeed, this is something

we  have been doing all the time.  We have trained about  200

grassroots  leaders and we will do more.  Not  only  will  we

train  mediators,  we  also  want  to  train  what  we   call

"persuaders".  They may not do the actual mediation, but they

will go to the places where the disputes had taken place  and

try  to encourage the parties to come for mediation sessions.

This  is because Singaporeans still have misconceptions about

mediation.  It is important to clear these doubts,  and  then

they  will  come.  We  will  do more  in  terms  of  training

mediators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho also talks about education efforts. We will do

more.  In fact, we have done some already.  We are happy with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>



what  has  transpired including from what I have  heard,  the

quite well-received TV series in Chinese on mediation.   But,

certainly, we need to do more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, which is an important point, we will work with

referral sources - CDCs, grassroots advisers, the police, the

courts   -   to  facilitate  and  expedite  a  process  where

referrals can be made.  I think this is important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng has highlighted a key point, a very important

point,  which  has been on our minds in MinLaw for  sometime,

which  is whether or not community mediation should  be  left

entirely voluntary.  When I moved this Bill 3-4 years ago, in

fact,  one or two MPs made this point at that time.  Because,

at  that point in time, we decided that in order to encourage

more  Singaporeans to buy in and accept community  mediation,

we left it entirely voluntary.  I remember, in particular, Dr

Vasoo  asking, "will that do the job?"  Well, 3-4 years  have

lapsed.  From experience, we should consider whether or not a

case has been made to do more, because the feedback is indeed

that  there  are some Singaporeans who want to  settle  their

disputes through mediation and they come for help.   But  the

other  party just does not want to come, for whatever reason.

We have not decided on this yet but, certainly, I will ask my

officials  in MinLaw to study what more we can do  if  indeed

that is the way to go.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I have mentioned just now the use of more

persuaders, and this is something that we must do.  On top of

that, maybe we can consider other options, some of which have

been used in other countries.  For example, whether or not to

say that if you receive a letter from the CMC, you must come.

This  is compulsory mediation.  Another would be, for parties

who  go to courts, before the courts will take up their case,

they  will  be asked to go for mediation first.  The  party's

wilful  refusal  to attend mediation sessions  will  be  made

known  to  the  magistrate and will  constitute  one  of  the

factors  for  his consideration whether or  not  to  issue  a

summons for the matter to go to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>



court.   That is a possibility.  The third is to empower  the

police to require the parties to go for mediation before  the

police  will investigate a police report.  Mdm Ho  says  that

these  are cases, especially the minor ones, which police  do

not  want  to investigate immediately - try mediation  first.

Let  me  just  say that at this point in time, we  are  still

exploring the possibilities.  We will decide over the  course

of the next 2-3 months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me end this point by saying that it is indeed very

important to create a culture of mediation on the ground, and

we  should  start with the young.  Mdm Ho has mentioned  this

and  indeed,  this  is what we are doing.  Working  with  the

Subordinate Courts and the Ministry of Education, we  have  a

peer   mediation   programme  in   our   schools.    Because,

ultimately, if we can create a mindset in Singaporeans  where

they  will  try  to  settle some of  these  minor  relational

disputes on the ground by themselves   -  if not, they  could

seek  this kampung ketua, your community mediators  -   then,

over  the  long-term, this will help create, in Singapore,  a

more  cohesive  and more harmonious society.   Sir,  we  will

certainly  start with the young and permeate this culture  on

the ground, with the help of our grassroots leaders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take Mr Inderjit's cut, which is an important

cut,  because he talks about creating in Singaporeans a  more

entrepreneurial spirit and, in particular, how we can improve

our  bankruptcy  regime to do that.  Let me  just  assure  Mr

Inderjit Singh that we do differentiate between bankrupts who

have become bankrupts because of genuine business failure and

those  who  become bankrupts through malpractice  or  are  at

fault.   In  fact,  we  take  this  approach.   Members  will

remember  that  in 1995, we introduced the discharge  by  the

Official Assignee, the section 125 process.  When we  started

off,  it  was  only  after  five years,  and  the  limit  was

$250,000.  Then, as we administered this process, we enhanced

the regime.  Now, a bankrupt, who has a debt of up to half  a

million  dollars, after three years, the OA can consider  him

for discharge.  I am glad to say that this process has worked

well.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>



Since  it  was  introduced in 1995 to 31st March  2002,  over

8,700 of such discharges have been made. The OA tells me that

he  is  ever mindful that this is something that he  must  be

concerned  about, because we want to create  in  Singaporeans

this enterprising spirit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This second chance approach is not only evident at the

point  of discharge but also at a point when the bankrupt  is

working  towards  discharge.  For example, now,  there  is  a

process  where  bankrupts who apply to  become  directors  of

companies or to manage a business, the OA can consider  these

applications.   Indeed,  he tells me that  between  September

1999  and  March  2002, he received a total of  262  of  such

applications,  of  which only about 20% were  rejected.   The

rest were either approved or withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to assure Mr Singh that our bankruptcy regime is

not  a "one-size-fits-all" approach.  He made this point when

we  debated  the  Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill  in  1999.   He

argued  that we must be flexible, we must take cognisance  of

various  factors, both in terms of how the  person  became  a

bankrupt,  as  well  as  his conduct as  a  bankrupt.   These

factors are indeed being taken into consideration through the

section  125  route,  and  also allowing  the  bankrupt  more

flexibility  in  doing business. We will do  more  for  these

bankrupts.  From 1st March this year, the OA tells me that he

has  put  in place a system to categorise bankrupts according

to  the  conduct and cause of insolvency. Those who are  more

deserving  will,  for  example,  be  given  privileges   more

flexibily.  These are available to all bankrupts,  but if you

fit into this category, for example, if you need to travel to

do  business or for any urgent matter, it will be  considered

more  favourably, or buying and selling a flat, or submission

of statements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we are also going to introduce a pre-bankruptcy

mediation service this year.  This is important because  that

will  help divert some of these potential bankrupts away from

bankruptcy.  Through the mediation services offered by the OA

officers, we hope that some of these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>



potential   bankrupts  will  not  be  made   bankrupts.    In

particular, if it is a genuine business failure, the  chances

of  success will probably be higher. This will complement the

post-bankruptcy service which has already been in place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards self-destruct laws, this is being considered

by  Mr Raymond Lim's Committee.   I do not think I will  pre-empt  him.  It is certainly a point which has arisen in  many

contexts  as we try to remake Singapore.  Let me, in  a  very

short fashion, say that it is a good point for us to say that

we  should review our laws all the time, especially  business

laws, which have short shelf lives, because times change  all

the  time.   I  want to assure Mr Singh that this  is  indeed

being  done by the Ministries.  But he is proposing something

which  should  engage our officials in a more pro-active  way

for them to be mindful whether laws should still apply.  That

can be considered by the Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards legal infrastructure, a short point will be

that we do all we can to ensure that Singapore remains on top

of  the  situation in terms of cutting edge areas.  Both,  in

terms  of  MinLaw and, in fact, even our courts, our  judges,

also  ensure  that  they know what it takes  to  be  able  to

administer the laws.  MinLaw, for example, in terms of IT, if

Members  recall in this House, we have done many things.   We

have  passed laws, and introduced electronic filing,  and  we

have done many things on  patents and other matters to ensure

that  we  are on top of this area.  For example, we  will  go

forward  and  review the Copyright Act to take  into  account

recent advances in digital technology.  Judges themselves  go

for  training.  If Members remember, 2-3 years ago, they went

for  a  life sciences course conducted by the NUS, which  was

quite   widely   publicised.   Judicial   commissioners   are

appointed to the Bench. They are practitioners who have  vast

experience and who bring these experiences with them  to  the

Bench.  The latest was Ms Belinda Ang, who was appointed as a

JC  and  now,  in fact, sits in a specially set up  Admiralty

Court.   The other move the courts are taking is  to  set  up

specialist courts.  They are also considering setting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>



up  an IP court.  Indeed, if need be, assessors are appointed

to help the judges to decide cases, as in a recent case where

Dr  A  J Nihols of Probitas Corporation was appointed  as  an

assessor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, arbitration also offers a route for parties who

want  somebody  of their own choosing, whom  they  think  can

decide  their  dispute in a fair way, they can  appoint  that

person  as  an  arbitrator. And, certainly, with  the  recent

relaxation in our arbitration regime, that will come to pass.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is on land use. Let me just say that we

have  taken  account of the feedback that we  have  received,

that SLA should do more, so that grassroots organisations can

use the vacant lands in HDB estates more easily.  Hence, what

we  have  done  is  that since August 2000,  we  gave  a  70%

discount  for  the use of these lands.  A recent  review  was

carried  out  and SLA has decided that we will move  it  even

further down.  Instead of charging market rates, April  2000,

we  gave  70%, and they only pay 30%; now, we are going  even

further  down,  so that a new system will now be  implemented

where  grassroots  leaders, who are using  vacant  lands  for

community  purposes,  will enjoy  an  85%  discount.   For  a

football  field of some 6,000 square metres, the market  rate

is  $1,500.  In April 2000, it cost $450, but it will now  be

only $150 a month.  I think this is quite affordable.

<br>5.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is to make more information available to

grassroots  leaders, and indeed to all users of  State  lands

and  premises.   SLA will start an e-portal  in  2-3  months'

time.  This e-portal will put out all the lands under the SLA

- State land, premises and buildings, designated not just for

community use but also for institutional and commercial uses.

Then  all  potential and interested users of state  land  and

premises will just have to click a button and know what is on

offer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head V of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as many MPs have said, Singapore is moving into an

uncertain future.  The main reason is the threat of  stronger

competition from the neighbouring countries such as  Malaysia

and   Indonesia,  which  are  two  very  low-cost   operating

countries.  At the same time, we also have to compete against

emerging cities like Hong Kong and Shanghai.  Then, there  is

the  looming threat of China as a formidable competitor which

is  soaking up substantial foreign direct investments (FDIs).

We  are  constantly reminded of the threat of China,  but  we

have  not  been  really told as to how  this  threat  can  be

contained.   Better still, we would like to  figure  out  how

best  we  can  ride  this huge juggernaut of  China,  as  the

Minister had said last year, as this country moves forward to

become one of the world's largest economies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for Trade and

Industry  what  are  his Ministry's views  of  the  long-term

regional and international competitiveness of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to competitiveness, we note that there are

several international independent agencies that conduct world-wide  competitive  ratings of different countries.   What  is

interesting  is that I note that different agencies  seem  to

give   different  assessment  ratings  for  Singapore.    For

example, the well-known Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)  in

its report of 16



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>



Asian  and Australasian countries covered in 1997-2001,   has

moved  Singapore  from  second  place  to  the  top  position

regionally  for the 2002-2006 period.  So, we have  overtaken

Hong Kong for the top place.  However, on a world-wide basis,

this  EIU report has moved Singapore downwards, from  7th  to

9th position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, another agency, called the World

Competitiveness Yearbook 2002, has ranked Singapore  the  5th

most competitive country, slipping three notches from the 2nd

position  last  year.   So,  both  the  EIU  and  the   World

Competitiveness Yearbook 2002 have moved Singapore  downwards

in world-wide economic rankings.  Is this an area of concern?

Are we losing our competitiveness?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, what I feel remarkable is that for a small

country  like  Singapore, with no natural resources,  a  very

small  population, a very small domestic market, and  a  very

limited  number of home-grown companies, we have consistently

achieved  high  international rankings by the most  respected

international agencies around the world.  This  testifies  to

the  excellent  achievements and hard work of the  Government

and  the people in getting ourselves to this stage.  However,

the  crucial  question is, can we continue  to  achieve  this

phenomenal growth and sterling results?  Will the  future  be

as  bright as before?  Or would it turn for the worse?   Will

Singapore be sliding precipitously downhill henceforth?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in line with the review of international

competitiveness,  I  would like to ask the  Minister  how  he

intends  to  help  reduce  the  overall  cost  structure   of

Singapore.   It  is  a  perennial  complaint  of  the   local

companies  that  the cost of doing business in  Singapore  is

just  too high.  In this respect, one of the major cost items

is  electricity consumption.  The Government formed  the  new

Energy  Management Authority (EMA) last year.   The  EMA  has

announced  a  schedule  of  plans to  liberalise  the  energy

market.   Can the Minister update us on the latest  situation

with regard to the EMA, and whether energy deregulation would

really lead to lower prices?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, among the many industries that the Government

intends to promote is the bio-sciences.  Recently, there  was

a   report  that  the  A*STAR  has  been  charged  with   the

responsibility  of promoting a biomedical hub  in  Singapore.

However,  I  am  concerned to read in press reports  that  Mr

Philip Yeo, Chairman of A*STAR, has an undisclosed budget  to

use.  Even before getting started, it is said that the centre

will  now double in size in five years.  I would like to  ask

the  Minister  if he could give more details  on  the  actual

plans  of  the  Government in the promotion of biotechnology.

What  are the real benefits that can be derived, and  whether

the  expected  hundreds  of millions,  or  even  billions  of

dollars,  that will be spent on this biomedical hub  will  be

worthwhile?

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, as my

colleague, Mr Leong Horn Kee, has stated, Singapore has  been

highly   praised  by  many  international  rating   agencies.

Despite slipping a few positions here and there, we are still

within  the  top 10 most competitive countries in the  world.

These ratings are not just mere morale boosters but they have

helped   Singapore  to  attract  the  much   needed   foreign

investments.   Going forward, however, the  competition  will

become more intense, especially with the rise of North  Asian

and  other destinations with competitive cost structure.  The

rating  agencies serve as a barometer to the global  hunters.

We must maintain our competitiveness in their views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is, how successful would we be in retaining

and  improving our international competitiveness ranking with

the new Budget?  In our effort to attract new FDIs and global

talents,   as  well  as retain existing ones,  what  are  the

specific strategies formulated to: (i) reduce the total  cost

of doing business in Singapore; (ii) address the flip side of

the  cost, which is the expected yield of business in or from

Singapore; and (iii) address Singapore's role in the region?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me briefly elaborate on each of these points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, on reducing the total cost of doing business in

Singapore.  This would include



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>



not  just the overt costs like tax, land and labour, but also

the  covert costs like the cost of living and the quality  of

life.  Why would a top talent, who is mobile, choose to  stay

in  Singapore if he is a Singaporean, or come to Singapore if

he  is  a foreigner?  Is Singapore exciting enough to attract

and retain them?  How livable is Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, on expected yield. Empirical evidence shows that

people  migrate from low-cost rural areas to high-cost cities

in  search  of jobs or yields.  Ten years ago, setting  up  a

business  in the major cities in China would cost a  fraction

of   the   current  cost.   However,  today,  the   Economist

Intelligence Unit (EIU) has estimated US$60 billion per  year

investments  pouring into China, and that  constitutes  about

70%  of all the FDIs to Asia.  Certainly, the expected  yield

in  such  places must have been perceived to  be  very  high,

despite the rising cost.  While we do not have the hinterland

or  domestic market size of our larger neighbours, we have  a

more  transparent and predictable business regime, plus  high

quality  human capital.  How can we leverage on these aspects

of  our competitive advantage to improve the yield, the  risk

reward  ratio for the global FDIs and talents?  In fact,  how

can  we  improve the balance sheets for both the company  and

the individual?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, what is our role in the region? The

Government should be praised for stretching our tentacles  to

put in place a series of FTAs with partners across the globe.

Nearer  home,  however,  we  must  do  more  to  improve  our

relationship with our immediate neighbours.  To many FDIs, we

are  still  part of a bigger region and hence, in considering

their   business  location,  they  will  also  consider   our

strategic position in our neighbourhood.  They want  to  know

if we are the gateway to any market, what is our role and our

relationship  with  our  neighbours  in  the  region.    What

strategies  do we have to achieve this?  Are we open  to  new

ways  of  doing  business?  It is often  said  that  the  new

business environment requires not just IQ but EQ and CQ.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Miss Low, you have 30 seconds left.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Singapore has been criticised as lacking

in  EQ and CQ, which is cultural quotient.  I understand that

on some trade mission teams, sociologists and anthropologists

are included to achieve a holistic approach.  I would like to

ask  if  our  Ministry is ready to incorporate  these  social

scientists  as  an  integral part of our trade  and  business

teams.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, as we move into the

knowledge  era,  the  structure of Singapore's  economy  will

undergo fundamental changes.  This, coupled with our maturing

economy,  is expected to result in (i) a slower growth  rate;

(ii)  a  greater reliance on external demand which rose  from

68% of GDP in 1990 to 77% in 2000; and, (iii) a manufacturing

sector  which  is  becoming more knowledge intensive  with  a

corresponding reduction of manufacturing jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regionally, the Japanese locomotive is declining, while

there  is  competitive pressure coming from China  and  other

newly  industrialising countries.  Within ASEAN,  Indonesia's

recovery  is uncertain and, at best, difficult.  Malaysia  is

moving away from her primary industry base and is trying very

hard  to  beat  us  in the seaport, airport,  petrochemicals,

infocomms and logistics sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newly industrialising countries, with their mass of

cheap  labour,  will focus on mainstream economic  activities

that  are labour intensive to provide jobs for their  people.

The  developed countries in the western world have plenty  of

resources   in   technology,  capital   and   infrastructure.

Singapore, unfortunately, is caught in between.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such an economic landscape, I too would like to

ask  the  Minister what is the Government's strategy to  make

Singapore internationally more competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past 35 years, we relied on foreign direct

investments  (FDIs)  and MNCs, as well  as  GLCs  to  provide

growth, with SMEs playing the supporting role. Would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>



this  tried and tested approach continue to provide Singapore

with future growth, or should we now emphasise on building an

entrepreneurial economy?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My view is that while we continue to attract FDIs to

grow  our  knowledge intensive industry, we must nurture  the

future  entrepreneurial economy.  To do the former is  easier

as  we have been successfully doing it over the years and are

quite capable of continuing.  However, to do the latter  will

be  more  tricky as the environment must be right for  it  to

take root and bear fruit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may note that Singapore's early economy has been

founded  primarily  upon trade and  commerce.   Many  of  our

pioneering  fathers  were businessmen, traders,  shopkeepers,

etc,  or  dreamt of becoming one.  They all desired owning  a

business, and entrepreneurship was in their blood.  How  then

are  we to re-create this spirit of risk-taking?  Have we got

too comfortable?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new economy with a thriving entrepreneur sector cannot

be  created  overnight.   We need the  essential  ingredients

placed  in  the right environment.  The Government should  at

least try to create this environment for entrepreneurship  to

flourish.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be these smaller companies that will find the

right  niche  industries to survive or even thrive  in.   One

such   success  story,  which  is  often  told,  is  Creative

Technology.   Singapore  certainly  needs  many   more   such

companies.

Many factors are needed to make up the right environment  for

a  successful entrepreneurial economy.  I will speak on three

major ones.  They are, one, plentiful bright ideas; two,  low

cost  of failure, including social costs; and, three,  access

to  funds.  Firstly, without bright ideas, there will  be  no

start-ups and no ventures.  We should not only attract  ideas

locally  but  also ideas from all over the world to  incubate

here.  Successful ideas will then find their market globally.

So  EDB should not only attract FDIs but also actively pursue

foreign ideas to locate in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>



Singapore.   Secondly, there is a general stigma attached  to

failure in Singapore.  This is the main cause of the aversion

to  anything  risky  among the better trained  in  Singapore.

This  mindset needs to be changed through education in  order

to  lower  or  even  eliminate the social  cost  of  business

failure.   I  would like to remind Members that, in  America,

CEOs  of failed start-ups are actually sought after for their

experience,  so  that mistakes made can  be  avoided  in  the

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is worse in Singapore is that many entrepreneurs

also  have  to  risk personal wealth in order to  fund  their

ventures.   This  could  lead to personal  bankruptcies  when

failure  occurs.  Surely, persons who contribute  their  good

ideas  should  not  be made to risk their total  savings,  or

house  as  well.   This factor is one big difference  between

Britain and America.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Half a minute more, Dr Chen.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> This leads to the requirement

on  access to funds.  The Government has set up TIF.  So far,

the   fund  has  been  mainly  invested  in  big  and  famous

international VC funds.  These are safe investments.  It  may

have  helped to kick-start the VC industry in Singapore,  but

it    does    little    to   encourage    entrepreneurs    or

entrepreneurship.  The Government should therefore look  into

how  it can take more direct equity participation in SMEs and

start-ups to encourage entrepreneurship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a word about flexibility. To compete in the

new  era,  we  must develop the skill of flexibility  without

sacrificing fundamental principles.  This skill must permeate

every  level  of  our  society,  right  from  civil  servants

executing Government policies to businessmen making  a  deal.

One of the reasons why Singaporeans are not as successful  as

the Taiwanese and ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Your time is up, Dr Chen.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> --- Hong Kongers is because of

lack of flexibility.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  I  would like to ask the Minister to please comment  on

the points that I have made.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mrs Lim is not moving. Dr Chong Weng

Chiew.

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I have two

points  to  raise.   Mr Gan Kim Yong's  call  for  an  inter-ministerial committee to ensure our competitiveness was on my

mind, and I support it.  Our statutory boards may be proud of

past  laurels  and be complacent to challenges  from  budding

competitors.   But  let it be reminded that  if  any  of  our

national  agencies fall, Singaporeans' livelihood falls  with

it as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSA employs about 30,000 workers and, if it falters, it

would  be  held  responsible for the fates  of  these  fellow

Singaporeans.  Today, SIA is more than just a private company

motivated   by  profit.   SIA  employs  about  6,000   flight

stewardesses, some of whom though are not local, we should be

concerned with their performance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans watch with concern the challenges posed to

many of our national brand names, such as Changi Airport  and

SIA.   They are wondering if our competitors would skin these

institutions alive.  Jobs are a primary concern these days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, let me reiterate my two calls.

First, setting up an inter-ministerial committee that compose

also  of private sector voices, some of whom have echoed  the

very  problems  PSA  faces today long time  ago.   Second,  a

survey  of  the competitiveness of our national brand  names,

such as PSA, SIA, MRT, LRT, Power Supply, and so on.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, fundamentally, as a

country  and  a colony with many things going for  us,  brand

Singapore  is  one  that we can be proud of,  with  its  high

regional and global awareness and attributes that businesses



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>



want.   But the brand needs to be continually reinforced,  or

it  will fade and pale in comparison when others emerge  from

the  not too far horizon.  After hearing the concerns  raised

by so many hon. Members in the Budget debate, I am reinforced

in my belief that much still needs to be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's competitiveness cannot be just left to the

private sector.  There must be an obsession to drive the cost

of  doing business in Singapore continuously downwards.   For

without  a  strong  home base, there  is  little  chance  for

survival for both SMEs and large local corporates where  they

attempt  to set foot beyond our shores.  We cannot be  merely

satisfied   with  the  small  domestic  market   within   our

boundaries.  The call to stake out the area within  a  seven-hour  plane  ride from Singapore as our hinterland  is  worth

stepping up to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I would like to ask the Minister if enough has

been  done  to  ensure the international  competitiveness  of

Singapore.   Firstly, is there adequate attention focused  on

the  sizable elements of business costs that are attributable

to  the  Government and statutory boards'  fees  and  levies?

This  must be continuously driven down.  Perhaps, we  need  a

body to be vigilantly looking at this, year in, year out,  to

ensure  a  continuous  improvement.  What  other  performance

measures that the Minister needs to put in place in order  to

achieve  this,  just  as  EDB has set  its  annual  goals  of

attracting   FDIs?   Secondly,  are  our   SMEs   and   large

corporations adequately supported by incentives and  measures

to  ensure  that  they are well-positioned  to  take  on  the

competition  when they make their forays abroad?   Is  enough

being  done  so  that companies here build up  the  requisite

intellectual  property and technology bases that  will  allow

them  to  penetrate  this extended hinterland  with  superior

product and service offerings?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the sentiments that are popularly espoused

of the largest corporations crowding out the smaller ones,  I

believe that critical scale is required to weather the perils

beyond our shores.  As such,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>



have  there been enough efforts and measures put in place  to

energise  our larger corporations to be the vanguard  of  our

overseas drive?  While we can let the market forces take  its

course  and  let winners emerge, I ask if the Minister  would

consider that a more robust approach would be to identify and

nurture  would-be  global and regional champions  and  turbo-charge  them  to  give them a higher chance of  survival  and

success.  I am not saying that we do not pay attention to the

eco-system  where smaller firms can thrive  in  the  country.

What I say is let us hedge our bets and do both.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it would be much appreciated if the Minister

could  also  give us his insights on how the series  of  FTAs

that  are  in  place  would further  enhance  our  companies'

competitiveness  in  the global league.   We  need  a  strong

external wing to complement our activities on shore  so  that

we  can ensure jobs and more jobs.  The sooner we develop and

spread the wing, the better off we are going to be.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, I would like to focus on the

unglamorous  but  nonetheless important contributors  to  the

Singapore   economy.   In  pursuing  a  knowledge-based   and

intensive  economy  and,  in emphasising  the  importance  of

employing  technology, we have actually reached  a  situation

where  many  sectors  of the old economy feel  alienated  and

ignored.   They feel that the various incentives  are  skewed

towards the new economy type businesses and are not meant for

them.   In  fact,  some  even feel that  there  are  actually

disincentives to doing more out of Singapore.   For  example,

garment  manufacturing  now runs  on  very  similar  economic

models   to  electronics  contract  manufacturing,  requiring

similar  competencies, such as the application of  technology

towards state-of-the-art equipment for Government's teaching,

labelling, packing, sourcing networks, inventory control  and

logistics  capabilities.  However, the garment  manufacturers

face limitations to employing foreign talent in designing and

cutting as these are considered as non-professional in nature

and  classified  somewhat differently by the Government.   As

such, many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>



are  forced  to  relocate manufacturing activities  elsewhere

where  there  are  lower  or  no  barriers  to  the  flow  of

expertise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Minister not to neglect

or,  worse  still, ignore the growth potential of  these  old

economy businesses and to actively think of ways to help them

leverage on our hub capabilities and grow.  The signalling is

also  crucial,  as how else can we explain the  poor  take-up

rate of vacancies in the marine sector in spite of the rising

unemployment.  The sector is perceived to be unglamorous, not

the new economy type.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on a related point, many old economy businesses

have   successfully  grown  outside  Singapore,  mostly  very

quietly and without Government's assistance.  Yet, they  have

embraced the very essence of our economic survival, which  is

to  move  beyond our finite domestic market.  They have  done

all  this,  whilst the national preoccupation, including  the

Government,  has  been  the  domestic  economy.    Sir,   for

businesses  which  have hitherto done well,  the  inertia  of

exploring  outside  the  comfort of  Singapore  is  extremely

great.   For the Government, it is our constant reference  to

our  domestic growth rate that sets the tone.  If  I  am  not

mistaken,  the  Minister  still owes  me  the  quarterly  GNP

numbers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Minister to help the

entire  economy  shift the emphasis from having  domestically

oriented supply to meeting globally generated demand.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, it has been many years since we

defined  our  strategy of developing a second  wing  for  the

Singapore  economy.  Many of our companies,  big  and  small,

GLCs  and private sector enterprises have tried to globalise,

but  with  limited success.  There are many reasons  for  our

limited success, but I will not address them here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest a simple strategy which will

greatly  improve  the  chances of success  for  many  of  our

companies as they try to globalise.  We need to help to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>



create  a  culture of partnership, a departure from our  past

practice of distrust between GLCs, big companies and  smaller

companies.   The  fact is that each company, whether  big  or

small,  has  its own areas of competencies, and also  no  one

company  has  all  the  strengths in  all  the  areas  of  an

industry.   It  is  therefore only  logical  that  we  should

encourage   all   the  relevant  companies  to   pool   their

competencies  together to form a strong alliance  when  going

overseas,  much  like  what  the  Japanese  and  the   French

companies have been doing for so many years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This could be a very important role for many of our

Government  economic  agencies who could  play  the  role  of

matchmakers  and facilitators.  Sir, the clustering  approach

will  address the size and scale issues that Mr Wee Siew  Kim

talked about just now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the long term, instead of Government agencies,

we  need the private sector to lead initiatives like building

consortiums  and cluster associations.  Currently,  the  EDB,

NSTB  and  other  agencies call the shots  for  many  of  our

industrial  groupings and consortiums.  I suggest we  reverse

the  whole thing and create a few consortiums asking  private

sector  champions to lead them, perhaps with some secretariat

support from the Government agencies initially until this can

take  off.   Some examples of such associations from  the  US

are,  first  of  all,  the Fabless Semiconductor  Association

(FSA);  second,  SEMATECH, the consortium of  big  and  small

semiconductor companies.  They have had tremendous success in

driving  the industries in the US, and I think we should  try

this approach.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir,

historically,  we  have  been very successful  in  attracting

foreign investments into Singapore and the recent tax reforms

proposed  by the Finance Minister will help in some  ways  to

attract  additional foreign investments here.   But  I  would

like  to  suggest that maybe it is time for us to expand  our

economic boundaries



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>



beyond our shores.  China has been touted as a threat to  our

economy, but I would suggest that China is not just a  threat

but also an opportunity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister therefore to

elaborate  what are the strategies that we have to  help  our

local  companies,  our  local enterprises,  to  venture  into

China.   In  particular, I would like  to  ask  the  Minister

whether  we  could  encourage the GLCs to take  the  lead  in

spearheading our thrust into China.  These GLCs, as  DPM  Lee

has  mentioned yesterday, have size and management expertise.

They  are  also  much more experienced in overseas  ventures.

They  are therefore well positioned to establish a beach-head

in  China.   Thereafter, they can then help bring  along  the

local  small and medium sized enterprises, which may be ready

to  go  abroad  but  may  need some initial  help.   This  is

probably one positive role that the GLCs can play in  helping

the SMEs here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed, for SMEs venturing into China is not an easy

task.   Take  human  resource,  for  example.   It  is   very

difficult  and  often costly to persuade  Singaporean  senior

managers to work in China.  Having identified a suitable  and

capable  candidate, we need to pay for his  relocation  cost.

We  need to give him additional overseas allowance.  We  need

to  bear  the cost of his lodging and, if he has  heeded  the

call  of  the Government and got married, we need to pay  for

his spouse's allowance and even, sometimes, compensate her if

she  needs to quit her job.  And if he follows PM's call  and

have  several children, we may also have to bear the cost  of

his  children's  education  in international  schools  there.

Sir,  going  to China is a very expensive affair.  Sometimes,

it  is  twice  as  costly  as  the  same  person  working  in

Singapore.  I would therefore like to request the Minister to

consider  providing financial and tax incentives  to  support

and   help  local  companies  to  venture  into  China.    In

particular, would the Minister consider providing   financial

and  tax  incentives to support and help local  companies  to

venture  into  China?   In  particular,  would  the  Minister

consider providing incentives to help defray part of the cost

of sending staff overseas?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>



<br>6.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Wee Siew Kim, can you take your two

cuts together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim:</b> Sir, I will take both cuts together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pull of China, both for investments and talents, can

no  longer be ignored.  The emergence of China presents  both

an  opportunity as well as a threat.  The threats  have  been

pounded  into  our awareness.  There is no need  to  belabour

them.   What is key is our response to take advantage of  the

opportunities.   While  we  are  always  talking  about   the

behemoth,  China, it may be worthwhile to hear the Minister's

perspectives  on how similar would be our responses  when  we

turn our sights at the other lurking behemoth, India.  I hope

that   the   Minister  would  elaborate  on  what   are   the

opportunities these two markets present to our companies  and

where the emphasis should be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been touted as a service hub - efficient

and  incorruptibly predictable.  We must, therefore,  have  a

role  that  these two markets can benefit from.  We  must  be

able  to  fill a value-added niche, one where we can exact  a

premium and ensure the continuous survival of our people.  It

would  be  a worthwhile goal to aspire towards having  either

China or India, or both countries, ranked alongside the US as

one of our engines of growth.  Is this achievable and in what

timeframe?   In  this discussion, I hope the  Minister  would

also  consider informing us on how our neighbours will  react

to  our  response and our confidence in staking a future  for

ourselves.  We must not assume that our neighbours will  stay

put  and not raise their ante to compete with us in these two

large markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go on to the second cut. Our neighbours,

Malaysia  and  Indonesia,  have  only  recovered  in  varying

degrees  from the aftermath of the Asian crisis.   They  have

been  key engines of growth for our economy.  In time,  these

two  neighbouring economies will be strong again, and  it  is

very likely that we will continue to have a role to play,  as

long as we position



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>



ourselves correctly in the meantime.  In addition, continuous

engagement will buy us the time as we breathe life  into  the

other  sectors  that we are betting on for the  longer  term,

sectors such as life sciences and the services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, we should not leapfrog too quickly out of this

region  and  jettison these two economies while  we  set  our

sights farther afield.  Could the Minister give his views  on

the   state   of  economic  cooperation  with  Malaysia   and

Indonesia?  What measures must we have in order that we  stay

relevant  to  their needs in spite of their many attempts  to

supplant  us?   How  can  we  extend  the  hand  of  economic

cooperation  such that, when they emerge from their  problems

and  pick themselves up again, we could grow alongside  them,

having them feel the nascent services sector along the way?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Leong Horn Kee, you can take both cuts

together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Thank you, Sir. I would like to

join  my colleagues to ask the Minister for an update on  the

various   Free  Trade  Agreements  (FTAs)  under  negotiation

between Singapore and the other countries.  In particular,  I

am  very  interested to know the status of the  proposed  FTA

between  ASEAN and China, the FTA between Singapore and  USA,

and also the proposed FTA between Singapore and Japan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been said in recent reports that FTAs will

bring substantial benefits to Singapore, such as the creation

of  more  jobs.   This is good.  It would be  useful  if  the

Minister  can  give  details on how  he  feels  FTAs  can  be

beneficial for Singapore.  In fact, it is said that  FTA  can

be  helpful  to the entire region, as it will be instrumental

in  promoting free trade practices and investments from other

developed  countries  into  our  region.   As  the  FTAs  are

expected to bring substantial benefits, I would like to  urge

the Ministry of Trade and Industry to expedite the completion

of these various FTAs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next cut is on the restructuring of MTI and its

statutory boards.  It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>



appears  from  recent  press  reports  that  it  is  becoming

fashionable for renaming of statutory boards.  Yesterday,  Mr

Tan  Soo  Khoon  mentioned  this.   For  example,  under  the

Ministry of Trade and Industry, we have read about a spate of

changes in the names of its statutory boards.  First, we read

about  the NSTB being renamed as A*STAR.  When I first  heard

this, I thought it was a new Grammy Award or a new TV series.

Next,  we heard about the creation of IE Singapore, in  place

of  the  old  statutory board called TDB.  More recently,  we

were  sprung  with a surprise of a new entity  called  SPRING

Singapore, which is actually a remake of the former PSB.  For

a  while,  I thought that the launch of SPRING Singapore  was

for a new line of seasonal fashion wear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the public look at these changes, they do not

really  understand why familiar old names like TDB,  PSB  and

NSTB  are  being  discarded.  As Mr Lim Hng  Kiang  has  said

earlier, there is brand value in some of these names.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, it is good to give statutory boards new names

to  reflect  their new roles and responsibilities.   However,

for  new  names,  we  have  to  incur  substantial  costs  on

launching  expenses  in the form of corporate  brochures  and

other  collaterals.   The Minister may wish  to  explain  why

there is this sudden remaking of the statutory boards.  There

must be a grand concept plan behind this, I believe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do note that there is one statutory board

that   has  not  been  renamed,  and  that  is  the   Sentosa

Development Corporation (SDC).  We Singaporeans have come  to

remember Sentosa as a very quaint name which has been changed

from  the previous name called Pulau Belakang Mati.  While  I

am not urging the Minister to change the name of SDC, I would

like to ask him what are his Ministry's plans with regard  to

the future development of Sentosa.  We understand that nearly

a  billion  dollars  have been spent on Sentosa  for  various

projects  to  date  and more will be  spent  in  future.   As

Sentosa is a playground for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans and a major tourist attraction for foreigners, I

hope  that  some bold and imaginative plans are in store  for

Sentosa.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, many Members have raised the

issue of the cost of doing business in Singapore, and I would

like to talk about this in the context of the competitiveness

of the manufacturing sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We really have to look into how we can lower costs to

keep  manufacturing companies invested in  Singapore.   While

the  tax measures are important, we need to address the  many

other  cost issues, including the many hidden taxes  which  I

have talked about.  With our current approach of levying such

taxes  at  source, companies are paying too much of  the  tax

payable upfront, resulting in much lower margins, compared to

equivalent  companies  in  other  countries.   We   need   to

rationalise and balance between paying tax upfront  and  that

paid at the end by way of corporate income taxes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to creatively find solutions which will

eliminate   the  view  that  Singapore  can  no   longer   be

competitive as a manufacturing centre.  This could  become  a

psychological barrier for potential investors.  Many a  time,

I  have been asked this question by many of my customers from

the  USA and Europe.  Their perception is that Singapore  can

no  longer compete in certain areas, including in the area of

semi-conductor manufacturing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, specifically for the cost of industrial land, which

is an important issue, we need to match the cost of such land

in  the  US  and Taiwan.  The differential land  pricing  for

industrial  land  approach could help, which  means  that  we

cannot necessarily price a land at market rate.  Whilst  land

price in the context of the cost of maintaining and running a

company  in  terms  of  its  operating  costs  may   not   be

significant, it is a significant upfront cost which companies

look at when they decide whether to locate their factory here

or in other parts of the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, utility taxes and utility rates are an issue,

especially for companies which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>



consume  a  lot  of energy, such as petrochemical  companies,

wafer  fabs  and also semi-conductor manufacturing companies.

We need to address this too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that JTC put in place a scheme

to  purchase  factories from businesses and then  lease  back

these  spaces  that they have acquired back to  companies  to

conduct  their businesses.  Currently, too much of  resources

are  tied up by businesses in owning properties.  This scheme

will  do  a  few things.  First of all, it will minimise  the

company's  assets which are not productive; it  will  release

cash  for  growing  businesses without indebtedness  for  the

company; and JTC should be able to lower its overall  charges

by  averaging  their cost of property, thus helping  new  and

existing tenants.  JTC can continue to build upon its pool of

properties,  which  is  their core business  anyway,  in  the

situation that they acquire these spaces from companies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, Singapore needs a business-friendly environment with minimum red tape to foster

creativity,  attract foreign investments  and  encourage  the

growth  of  enterprises.  However, we also need to  make  our

environment consumer-friendly.  Today, many consumers may not

have  the expertise or bargaining power to negotiate  a  fair

transaction or contract.  Although certain aspects of  unfair

trading  are dealt with under existing laws, they do not,  in

most  cases,  deal  explicitly with the  issues  of  consumer

protection.   Even  where  they do, our  consumers  lack  the

knowledge and awareness of these Acts, and may not also  have

the  resources  or may find it too costly to  exercise  their

legal rights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, consumers may have less information of the

products  and services than the traders.  So the  information

gap inhibits the accurate and rational decision-making.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there are limited legal remedies readily

available to consumers who wish to take action against unfair

trade   practices.   Although  some  particularly   offensive

practices,  like cheating, may be covered under our  criminal

law, many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>



errant  trading practices, such as "switch and bait" tactics,

are not clearly covered by our existing law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need for the Government to intervene to

promote  a fairer and more equitable marketplace.   From  the

consumer's  perspective,  a Fair  Trading  Act  will  enhance

consumer  protection and make the playing field  more  level.

It  will  protect both traders and consumers'  interests.   I

would  like to know the Ministry's assessment of the proposed

Fair  Trading Act, and how soon can we expect to see the Fair

Trading  Act  become  a  reality in Singapore.   I  urge  the

Ministry to speed up the legislative process.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, this cut is on competition law,

and I believe Mr Raymond Lim's EISC Committee, as part of the

ERC,  is  looking at this too, and I would like to  have  the

Minister's  view on this.  I feel that it is  about  time  we

seriously  considered the implementation of  laws  which  can

address  the  issues of unfair competition,  much  like  what

exist  in  many  developed countries.  The  law  should  help

ensure  a  level  playing  field  between  large  and   small

companies,  so  as  not  to  stifle  entrepreneurship.    The

competition  law  should  be about anti-competitive  business

practices,  such as abuse of market dominance and  collusion,

and  not  about anti-consumer business practices,  which  are

being  taken care of by CASE and also what Mr Yeo Guat  Kwang

is suggesting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many examples of competition law exist today. So we

should  pick up the best practices from around the world  and

create   our  own  laws  which  can  work  in  the  Singapore

environment.  In the context of what many Members have talked

about,  in  terms  of GLC practices, a competition  law  will

address many of these things.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, whilst recognising the

usefulness of enacting a competition law in Singapore, I have

concerns over the limitations to its efficacy imposed by  the

smallness  or size of our market.  Let me illustrate  with  a

well-known example -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>



oil   pump   prices.   How  can  we  detect  anti-competitive

behaviour  when the size of our market permits  instantaneous

price information transfer or discovery?  Will we, therefore,

be  spending precious time and money to investigate into this

and similar situations?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the larger policy level, what would be the cost of

administering   such   a  regime?   Would   anti-trust   type

investigations  slow corporate activity down  or  stifle  the

taking of initiatives for similar companies to merge for true

economies  of  scale from which consumers can  also  benefit?

Moreover, in pursuing competition as an end onto itself,  how

do  we  balance  the cost of the introduction of  competition

against  ensuring  the existence of a competitive  framework?

Take  the  case  of  the liberalisation of telecommunications

activity, where the value of telcos has been eroded not  just

here  but everywhere else, and consumer preferences  are  for

certain pricing philosophies, like calling party pays, or for

mobile  phone number portability.  At which point do  we  say

that  there has been collusion amongst the various  operators

not  to allow these features?  At which point do we say that,

for  the market as a whole, it would be better not to  accede

to  such preferences?  In other words, is competition  always

good for a small market like ours?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, even as we wait

for the Fair Trading Act to be made into law, many things can

be  done  concurrently to enhance the protection of  consumer

interests.  I will touch on three specific issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, consumer education. We are occasionally

surprised by the consumer's level and degree of knowledge  in

products and business practices.  An example is the grade  of

petrol, another is that of interest rates and late charges of

credit  card  companies.   In addition,  the  plight  of  the

elderly consumer is another key area of concern.  CASE  hopes

to work with business bodies to step up consumer education in

all these areas.  Would the Ministry consider granting more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>



support towards consumer education programmes?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, protection of customer deposits. These past

couple  of  months, we learnt about car buyers who have  paid

deposits for Skoda cars but were not able to take delivery of

their  cars.   In February, many of us were shocked  when  we

heard  of  the closure of Ken-Air and, in that instance  too,

many  customers have placed deposits for tour packages.  Last

year,  another  furniture store closed down.  Many  who  have

paid for their furniture were not able to take delivery, even

though  there  was still furniture stored in  the  warehouse.

These  are  high profile cases, and there must  certainly  be

many  other  cases  which  were not reported  in  the  media.

Should these cases not remind us that existing laws should be

amended  or  reviewed  so  as  to  give  more  protection  to

consumers?   Perhaps, the Fair Trading Act can  tackle  this,

but  should we also not consider that the customers'  deposit

be placed under a trust account?

<br>6.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a consumer body, CASE wants to work with businesses

to  enhance  the  transparency  of  business  practices.   We

believe  that there can be a win-win situation.  If  business

practices   are   transparent,  customers'  confidence   will

increase  and  there can, in turn, be more  business.  Again,

coming  back  to the example of the petrol stations,  we  see

clear  displays  of  prices at the  petrol  stations  in  US,

Australia  and  even  in Bangkok.  Such a  practice  is  long

overdue  in  Singapore.   In Australia,  consumers  see  more

information  from  the  oil  companies'  website,   including

changes  in  the international traded product price.   Again,

this is not the case in  Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we understand that the Government cannot interfere

in  the  commercial decisions of the private enterprises,  we

are  confident  that consumer interests can  continue  to  be

protected. Goods and service providers should be requested to

provide  detail  information of the product and  pricing,  as

consumers have the right to know.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Chairman,

Sir,  each  year,  CASE receives about 15,000  complaints  on

consumers   concerning  unscrupulous  and   unfair   business

practices in the marketplace. Despite the presence  of  about

70 consumer related legislations, consumers of all age groups

and  educational background are still being conned  or  given

unsatisfactory  products  or services.   In  today's  complex

marketplace,  it  is sometimes difficult to  exercise  caveat

emptor. Thus, consumers need more protection.  Sir, I wish to

seek the following clarifications from the Minister:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Are there plans to review or integrate all existing

consumer-related legislations to enhance consumer protection?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Will the Ministry consider legislating a Consumer

Protection   Act  to  protect  consumers  of  "unconscionable

conduct" of businesses?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Will an enforcement agency be appointed to ensure

fair trading practices in the marketplace?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, Singapore is

projecting itself as a shoppers' paradise. But often, we have

stories  about it being a nightmarish experience shopping  in

Singapore.  Tourists and other consumers claim to be  cheated

in  terms  of quality of products and of huge price increases

which  they paid for the goods.  Some claim even  to  be  put

under duress to buy goods after negotiating a price.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CASE itself remains an association without any real

teeth.   Many tourists from first-world countries have  often

mentioned  that they find it surprising that with Singapore's

sophisticated  legal system, with Singapore's reputation  for

being  a  clean country, they do not find consumer protection

to  be well-established in a country like ours.  Sir, I  find

this  unacceptable and I hope the Minister will  consider  to

set up a statutory body, such as a Consumer Protection Board,

which  should  have statutory powers and  duties  to  do  the

following things:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Investigate consumer complaints;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Take action against those who misrepresent or who

cheat  customers, or who put customers under duress,  or  who

attempt to sell goods to customers even though such goods are

unsolicited;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Provide a simple dispute resolution system, backed

up  with the genuine powers to sanction errant shopkeepers if

that is found to be the case;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Provide good conduct codes, both for shoppers, as

well  as for storekeepers, so that they can bargain or  trade

in  a  congenial atmosphere rather than in an  atmosphere  of

hostility; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) To provide a public forum for discussion of

consumer issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we really want to make Singapore a shoppers'

paradise, if we really want to give a good image of Singapore

as  a  clean country where trading is fair, I do support  the

suggestions  made  by  Dr Teo just now that  we  should  have

legislation  to  make  the shoppers' paradise  a  reality  in

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the

price   of  petrol  in  Singapore  is  a  concern  for   many

Singaporeans.   We have debated this issue  in  the  House  a

number of times.  Now, I have read that the benchmark,  Brent

crude has gone up to just under US$29 per barrel yesterday, I

think  we  are  resigned to the fact that we can  expect  the

retail pump prices to increase again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over a year ago, it was discussed also in this House

that the Government would look into the possibility of having

"white  pumps" in certain locations.  This would  bring  more

competition to the retail petrol business.  Just a few  weeks

ago,  the Minister told us that the matter would have  to  be

delayed because of security concerns.  However, just a  while

ago, I was a bit surprised to read in today's Business Times,

this  is  an  article  that appears  on  page  22,  headlined

"Changes  Fuelling  Concerns".  What are the  concerns?   The

concerns are from the petrol companies.  I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>



understand  that  they  have  gone  to  MTI  to  raise  their

objections to having "white pumps" in Singapore on the ground

that  "white  pumps" would not provide a level playing  field

for the retail of petroleum in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I find this very amazing because I would like to

compare  the  release  of sites for  "white  pumps"  in  this

industry  akin  to  the position taken by the  Government  to

allow  parallel  imports, because parallel  imports  do  help

bring  down  prices, in general, of any products.   Take  the

motorcar  industry, for example.  Some years ago, we  allowed

the  parallel imports to come in and that has helped to bring

down  the prices of motorcars.  If we allow the "white pumps"

to  be  operated,  it is a kind of parallel import  and  that

should help also to moderate the retail pump prices.  I would

like  to  know the Ministry's stand on this.  What  is  their

reaction to the position taken by the petroleum companies?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to also make just three more points

regarding  how  we  can keep petrol prices  at  a  reasonable

level.   One of the complaints by the petroleum companies  is

the high price of sites for petrol stations.  During the good

days, when the economy was booming, some of them bid as  high

as  $40  million  for a site.  I believe that  they  are  now

bidding  around  $10-$15 million per  site.   Many  of  these

sites,  however, were actually bid for long ago, when  prices

were much lower.  Actually, that should not be an excuse  why

retail  prices should be very high.  Nevertheless, we  should

perhaps re-examine again the use of the petrol station sites.

The  sites  are  now very large.  I understand  it  is  about

30,000  square feet.  My question is:  why do  we  want  such

large  locations?   Why should petrol  stations  be  used  as

supermarkets?   What is the business of petrol  companies  to

sell  bread,  butter, chocolates, candies and  ice-cream?   I

think  they  should  not  be using them  to  run  convenience

stores.   If  we just restrict them to selling  petroleum,  I

think they need only have half the size of what we see today.

That may be the way to bring down their cost.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just two more points very quickly. Sir, the other

question is the valorem duty.  I know this is probably  under

the Minister for Finance, but I just want to quickly say that

when DPM gave the answer to us yesterday, he did not tell the

full story.  He said that the tax valorem duty was 35%.   But

I  think  there  is  a floor ceiling of 44 cents  on  premium

petrol,  whichever is higher.  If the retail price  drops  to

$1,  we would not be paying 35 cents' duty to the Government,

but  we  will still be paying 44 cents.  Perhaps there  is  a

case now to remove the floor ceiling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, the same argument again on the three-quarter tank rule. I think it is time we reviewed it again.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, the Cost Competitiveness

Committee,  a  few years ago, identified the  development  of

SMEs  as  one  of  our  key pillars to  drive  the  Singapore

economy.   We, however, do not have concrete follow-up  plans

on  how this can be done.  The SME 21 plan has many excellent

actions  and  initiatives, but what is  lacking  is  a  clear

vision   and   direction,  and  there  is  no  clear   driver

identified.  We need a focused agency or statutory board, and

we can call that Enterprise Singapore, if you like, which has

clear  goals, responsibility and accountability, just as  EDB

has  clear  goals and measures to track progress  of  foreign

direct  investments.  Such an agency should be given  similar

goals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that we should carve out parts of SPRING

Singapore,  NSTB  or A* STAR, EDB, IE Singapore  and  form  a

dedicated  one-stop support centre to help identify,  nurture

and grow local companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, it is not clear which agency has the

responsibility  of supporting this important  pillar  of  our

economy.   Over the years, there has been an explosion  of  a

number  of incentive schemes and grants administered  by  too

many  Government  agencies.  Application procedures  are  too

complex for the smaller companies, while the bigger companies

have no problem assessing these things.  We should streamline

and cut down on the number of schemes and identify just one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>



or  two  Government agencies who would administer the scheme,

so  that  the  smaller companies will have no  difficulty  in

applying for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is that it is also about time that we

redefined  what  we  really  mean  by  "SMEs".   The  current

definition  is just too broad and it is not good  in  helping

identifying  potential  winners.   I  suggest  we  categorise

companies  into those with or without potential  growth,  and

not  just by their size.  I suggest SPRING Singapore can lead

this initiative to re-categorise our companies, so that it is

easier when we talk about the various types of companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we impose MNC type rules and criteria when

approving grants and incentive schemes for SMEs, it does  not

necessarily mean that SMEs will be better off operating under

MNC  type  of rules. We therefore should not impose the  same

criteria  for  MNCs and SMEs when deciding on  approvals  for

application  of  some of these things.  A "one-size-fits-all"

approach may not necessarily work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also suggest that in selecting Promising Local

Enterprises, the EDB enlists the help of the private  sector,

perhaps  outsource this whole activity.  As for the selection

criteria, I suggest that we re-look at them, so that  we  can

have a better chance of identifying winners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Committee of Supply discussions on the

Ministry  of Finance, I mentioned about the proposal  on  the

modification  of  the  LEFS  scheme,  where  VCs  and   angel

investors, through a hybrid system, have access to  the  LEFS

scheme.  I hope that the Minister will be able to reply as  I

did not get an answer earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to encourage mergers and acquisitions so that

our companies will consolidate and strengthen themselves,  we

should  devise the appropriate tax incentives that will  spur

such   activities.   I  believe  that  many  of  the  smaller

companies need to group or merge together in order  for  them

to effectively compete as we move forward.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</b> Sir, under the present

economic climate, many larger companies, including GLCs, are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>



refusing   or  delaying  payments  to  their  suppliers   and

contractors,  most  of  whom  are  small  and  medium   local

enterprises.  They use various delaying techniques  and  cite

all sorts of reasons, such as defects and inferior quality of

the goods sold.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These small suppliers and contractors, in turn, face

cash-flow problems as a result of the payments not coming  in

as anticipated. They cannot afford to take legal action as it

can be expensive and long drawn.  If they complain, they risk

losing  that  customer forever.  I think there is  cause  for

concern,  as  many of these SMEs are sound and  viable  long-standing  businesses with prudent management.  But  they  are

suffering  a  credit crunch now because their  customers  are

delaying  payment.  They are not asking for  venture  capital

funding,  but would like to seek some help to tide over  this

period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether any Government

agency is looking into this and whether steps can be taken to

alleviate  this problem faced by our SMEs, perhaps to  factor

their receivables and grant them credit based on the invoices

and purchase orders that they have in hand.

<br>6.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> Sir, in our quest to focus on the top

of  the  economic value chain, what measures are in place  to

encourage  the SMEs to move up the value chain and reap  from

our new economic strategies?  Not all SMEs can move up.  What

help  schemes and measures are available to ensure that those

who  cannot or are simply not in the right industry can  exit

without being discouraged from getting into business again?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To improve the transparency and accessibility of

information, I would like to repeat my call during the Budget

debate.   Could  the Ministry consider the setting  up  of  a

central  database  according to industries?   Some  of  these

databases   could   include   the   database   of    business

opportunities,  business procedures  and  business  networks.

Given that knowledge and speed are the essence of doing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>



business  in  the  IT  age, this information  database  would

greatly help these SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is yet another group of SMEs who are currently

facing  very  difficult times.  This  is  the  HDB  heartland

shopowners. With the advent of mega town centres  and  hyper-marts, many of our friendly neighbourhood ket ai or provision

shop uncles and aunties are now faced with a double whammy of

rising  costs and falling businesses.  Even worse  are  those

who  have  purchased their shops at no discount and currently

shouldering  heavy  mortgages.  For decades,  many  of  these

shopowners have faithfully served the community in more  than

just  the  business  way.   Could our  Government  show  some

compassion and help them stay relevant to the new economy or,

as  I  have  argued earlier on, help them to exit  gracefully

rather than face eviction or bankruptcy?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the above, today, shopping in Singapore

is  no  longer  interesting.  In fact, there is  very  little

distinction between one mall and another.  When we walk  into

a  mall,  we  can almost tell with one eye closed what  shops

would  come  one  after  another, be  it  G2000,  Delifrance,

Robinsons,  McDonald's, and so on.  Perhaps our neighbourhood

centres can be encouraged to adopt a special shopping  theme.

This would not only help bring life and a breath of fresh air

into  the  neighbourhood centres, but also alter the shopping

and  tourist  landscape  in Singapore.   Could  the  Minister

consider the suggestion?

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong:</b> Sir, my cut is on small and medium

enterprises  in the form of source of financing and  business

continuity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Budget has provided corporate tax decreases

for businesses, the businessmen are saying, "Well, if I don't

make  money, I don't pay tax!"  Many of these businesses  are

not making money and, despite restructuring their finances or

cutting  their costs, they are still facing a very  difficult

time.  Being nimble as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>



they are, even with a great product range or service, it does

not  mean  that they will make it through.  So when suppliers

go  bust  and default, they have the creditors, and when  the

debtors  default and do not pay them, they cannot pay others,

they too will also close up.  Also, with the consolidation of

the  banks,  the  SMEs have a tough time finding  avenues  of

finances for their businesses.  Banks that have been with the

SMEs since start-up, who understand their businesses and have

supported  them,  cannot support them anymore,  because  they

have merged with other banks.  Because of the constraints  on

risk classes, they cannot lend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Ministry of Trade and Industry, in its myriad of

assistance programmes that groomed businesses in the  heydays

when  the  economy was good, and helped start up  initiation,

also  consider  programmes to assist existing  and  promising

SMEs  in respect of business continuity during this difficult

time?   To explore this, maybe they could work with banks  to

do  some  form of business cycle financing, in  the  case  of

working capital financing.  We can call it "BCS", or business

continuity   survival   kit,   and   come   out   with   some

qualifications,  good  management, sound  business  policies,

strategies, good market and having a conservative  and  sound

financial  structure in the company, and not being  excessive

in their leverage structures.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, the Minister has visited

Batam  and talked about the profitability of companies  there

and  enjoying the Free Trade Agreement that we may have  with

the  USA.  I would like to ask him for his assessment of  his

trip  to Batam and whether there are opportunities for  small

and  medium  enterprises in Singapore  to  make  use  of  the

opportunities there.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Steve Chia is not here. Mr Zainul.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, in all my working life,

I  have  in  one  way  or another been associated  with  PSB,

formerly  NPB,  and  also SISIR.  So  I  have  a  very  close

affinity for that.  But, nevertheless, I find



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>



the name SPRING lovely and agreeable, not only because it  is

also the same name I use for my North East CDC magazine.  But

I  also gather that there are some companies which use SPRING

as an icon for innovation.  SPRING also, as you know, reminds

us  of  new  life and a refreshing approach to  things.   The

question  I would like to ask is that I know that SPRING,  or

PSB,  has  done  quite a lot of good work in terms  of  being

productive,  creative,  innovative and  improving  standards.

How  do  they  see their role in the context of  present  day

situation?  Previously, for example, they had a job  redesign

programme.   They  ended up with reducing  manpower  because,

formerly, there was a shortage of manpower.  One good example

was  the one-man operation of buses (OMO scheme).  So we  did

away  with  conductors and just have a driver  as  a  captain

managing the whole bus.  But in the present day context, when

we  are short of jobs, how do they reconcile their role?  How

do  they  help, in fact, to save and create new  jobs  rather

than  just being productive and innovative and, in  the  end,

creating more problems for our recession?

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I have just one question for

the Minister and, that is, how does cost of doing business in

Singapore feature in the list of priorities that the Minister

has?  How important is this in his list of priorities?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, the General Manager of a US-based

retail chain that used to operate in Singapore shared with me

that it was expensive to operate in Singapore, not because of

the   high  rental  or  the  high  labour  cost,  which  were

manageable.   According to him, the prices of the merchandise

on  our  supermarket shelves were high because  these  prices

were  set  by the distributors.  From time to time, he  would

buy  in bulk direct from overseas and bring in himself a  few

container  loads of, say, tissue paper, and offer this  at  a

very  special price to the customers, and still  make  profit

because his purchase cost was low.  But for most of the items

on  the shelves, he had to rely on local distributors who set

the price which could be high, as compared to the price he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>



would  be able to pay if bought in bulk direct from overseas.

But  he  could not buy all the items he needed from  overseas

directly  as he did not have a critical mass with just  three

outlets  in Singapore.  Further, if he bought too many  items

on  his own, the local distributors would be upset and  would

boycott him by not supplying the other things that are needed

to fill the shelf space.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting that the local distributors and

importers  are making huge profits by controlling the  supply

and  artificially  inflating  prices.   But  could  there  be

inefficiencies in the distribution chain or the system  which

could  be  reduced to bring about a reduction in prices?   Mr

Tan  Soo Khoon spoke about parallel importers who brought  in

cars  and  this  brought down car prices on the  whole.   Can

steps  be  taken  to  encourage  parallel  imports  of  other

products  and  to  reduce  the  cost  of  distributing  these

products locally?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our necessities can be bought at lower prices in

the  supermarkets  across the Causeway.  I am  not  convinced

that  our  land  cost  and labour cost  are  that  much  more

expensive compared to Johor Baru, to account for the  current

price  differential.  I would like to ask whether  there  are

any  indirect costs or inefficient ways of doing things  that

could and should be reduced.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, trading is a neglected sector,

because  I feel that it is not a glamorous area for  most  of

our Government agencies to handle.  I have asked a few times,

and  some  Members  have asked over many years,  and  nothing

special  has  been  done to help grow the trading  sector  in

Singapore.   I  would like to ask the Minister whether  there

are   any   initiatives  being  considered  to   help   them,

particularly in the area of financing.  Specifically, I  have

a  question on how we can make Singapore more attractive  for

third   country  trade,  whether  we  can,  by  way  of   tax

incentives, make this an attractive place.  If we do that, we

may  be  able to bring in businesses and companies from  Hong

Kong into Singapore.  Currently, we are just not attractive.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon:</b> Sir, Jurong was created as an

industrial estate in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>



1960s.   It plays an important role in supporting Singapore's

key  industrial manufacturing base.  When I suggest to remake

Jurong,  I  am  suggesting the area from Jurong East,  Jurong

Central, Taman Jurong, Jurong West and Tuas.  After 40 years,

many  of  the industrial facilities are quite old.  The  area

also lacks recreational space and parks.  The low take-up  of

HDB  housing  is  possible  proof that  people  find  it  too

inconvenient  or  unpleasant  to  live  in  the  area.   Many

companies also have to give an additional transport allowance

and provide company transport in order to convince people  to

work there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how can we create a vibrant and green Jurong

industrial  estate?   I  believe it  is  the  right  time  to

recreate  Jurong  not  through a 50-year  plan,  but  a  more

immediate  and interim plan of 5-10 years.  I would  like  to

propose the following for the relevant agencies, or maybe the

Ministry can authorise JTC to be its coordinator to implement

this masterplan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, rebuild and revitalise all industrial

facilities.  We need Jurong industrial estate to preserve its

high-tech  and forward-looking image to continue  to  attract

key industries to operate there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, build a new and extensive transportation

network into the area, like MRT, LRT, bus and taxis.  I  know

there is a task force looking into this now, but I feel  that

it is taking too long, and the task force is not bold enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, construct more recreational areas and

facilities, parks, sports facilities, such as canoeing, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, develop commercial shopping area or wet market

and  facilities.   We  should look at building  more  popular

shopping  centres,  such  as  Jurong  Point,  in  other  town

centres.

Fifthly,   improve   residential  living  environment.    For

example,  many  residents tell me that the military  aircraft

landing  in their area creates a lot of noise throughout  the

day.   But  I  support  this military aircraft  exercise  for

security reasons.  The solution may be double glazed  windows

by HDB.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Ministry to look into the

remaking of Jurong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong Kian Min, you have 2 minutes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, my cut is in relation to the

working  environment  at  Tuas.  I  was  going  to  say  that

compared to Jurong, which has matured over the years, Tuas is

even  worse than that.  But after hearing Mrs Yu-Foo, I  want

to  share her concern and elaborate on the problems faced  by

residents and workers in Jurong as well as Tuas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what plans does JTC

have  to  improve the working environment at Tuas,  and  make

Tuas  a  more  attractive workplace.  I am on  the  board  of

directors  of  a couple of companies situated in  Tuas.   Our

experience  has been that most people are reluctant  to  work

there,  even those who have been unemployed for a few months.

When  people  call  up in response to job advertisements  and

hear  that  the  company is in Tuas, they usually  give  some

reasons for not wanting the job, or they simply hang  up  the

phone.   There  is an urgent need to improve the  environment

and  amenities at Tuas to encourage workers to join companies

there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuas is inaccessible, except by private transport.

Taking a taxi from Boon Lay MRT station costs more than  $10.

The  public  bus service is poor and most companies  have  to

engage  their own bus service to ferry their workers  to  and

from  the  MRT station.  This discourages overtime  work,  as

once you miss the company transport, the cost involved to get

home  is  pretty  high.  There is also a  dearth  of  banking

facilities, recreational facilities and eating houses in  the

area.   The  roads  are dusty.  And why  are  palms  planted,

instead  of  rain  trees?  Palms may look  good  but  provide

little protection from the sun, which makes the place feel as

if it were 1-2 degrees hotter than the rest of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I still have some time, I would like to also

talk about eating houses in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>



Tuas.  I understand the Ministry of Finance has a ruling that

the  maximum term of tenancy with renewal is 9 years.   After

the  limit of 9 years, the tenancy cannot be renewed but must

be opened to tender to secure the highest price.  This can be

very unfair to the first operator who moves in to set up  the

eating  house.  He has to take on enormous risk  by  starting

the eating house from scratch with little business initially,

as  the  area  is  still under-populated.  He would  probably

suffer  losses for many years and would not be able to  break

even, much less to recoup his initial capital investment.  He

watches the factories  ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Could you ask your question, Mr Ong?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> I just want to ask the Minister

whether  he  could look into this matter and  encourage  more

people  to take risk and contribute to build up the amenities

in Tuas.
