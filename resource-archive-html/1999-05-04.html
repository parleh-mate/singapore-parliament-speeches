<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>SALE OF CHILLED MEAT IN WET MARKETS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Provision of chillers)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for the Environment

whether his Ministry will facilitate the sale of chilled meat by

retrofitting wet markets with chillers for use by meat sellers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  as announced on 23rd April 1999,  chilled  fresh

meat  supplied  to wet markets will have to be sold  in  display

chillers. This will ensure that the meat sold in the wet markets

is safe and hygienic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stallholders selling pork in wet markets will have to

install  display  chillers by 1st November 1999.  Those  selling

poultry have one year to put in their display chillers and those

selling mutton and beef 18 months to do likewise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stallholders will have to buy the display chillers

themselves.  The  cost  of the chiller, at  between  $3,000  and

$6,000,  is  not exorbitant. The investment in a  chiller  is  a

business decision that stallholders need to make if they wish to

remain in the business of selling meat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, three finance companies have informed my Ministry

that they are prepared to offer loans of between 80% and 95%  of

the  cost of the chillers, with repayment over one to four years

and interest rates of between 3.5% and 4% per annum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four suppliers of chillers have also agreed to allow

interest-free instalment payments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government on its part will spend some $6.5 million to

upgrade  electricity  supply in the wet markets  to  enable  the

chillers to operate.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister  if  ENV  would assist those meat sellers  in  our  wet

markets who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>

have financial difficulties to retrofit and install the chillers

in their stalls?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, as I mentioned just now, those

stallholders who are facing difficulties paying for the chillers

can  obtain  loans to buy the chillers.  They can get  the  loan

from  the  finance companies and, as I mentioned,  some  of  the

companies   are  prepared  to  offer  4-year  loans  at   fairly

attractive interest rates of 3.5% to 4%.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> In such circumstances, would the Minister

consider installing the chillers for them and allowing  them  to

pay by instalments?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, it is best for the stallholders to

decide  which  particular  chiller  best  meets  their  business

volume.  If they are prepared to pay by instalments, they  might

as  well  get  the  loans directly from the  finance  companies.

Assuming  they get a bigger chiller which costs $6,000 and  they

pay  over  four  years  or 50 repayments, I  think  the  monthly

instalment is very affordable.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Could the Minister

give  some  ballpark figures of the cost of the chiller  or  the

monthly  instalments vis-a-vis the monthly rental or the average

income of these stallholders?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, it depends very much on the size

of  the chiller and the length of the repayment period that they

opt  for.   If  you  take a smaller chiller  which  costs  about

$3,000,  and divide it by three years, it is $1,000  a  year  or

about  $100 a month.   Some of the stallholders sell up to about

10 pigs a day which would fetch them a turnover of about $3,500.

In  terms of the cost per month versus the turnover, I think the

cost comprises a very small percentage of the turnover.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, that is a percentage of the

turnover.  What about the percentage of the income?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, we do not know exactly how much

the hawkers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>

make.   But my assumption is that the profit level must be quite

attractive  because  there are about 1,000 stallholders  selling

pork  in  Singapore and the fact that already  107  stallholders

have  placed their orders for the chillers shows that  it  is  a

business  decision which they are prepared to take and make  and

the purchase of the chillers still makes the business of selling

pork a very viable and attractive one.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister  a  serious question whether he would start a  campaign

for people to eat more vegetables and fish?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, in my other hat, as the Minister

for  Health,  in  fact,  that is what we have  been  doing,  ie,

encouraging  Singaporeans  to live  a  healthy  lifestyle  which

includes  having  a  well-balanced diet.  This  means  not  just

having meat but also having a healthy spread of other items like

vegetables.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister

why  the  stallholders must install chillers now and not before,

and  could  chillers solve the problem of Japanese  Encephalitis

(JE)?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, in fact, the plan to move to the

cold  chain has been in discussion for quite some time  and  the

recent  episode of JE and the Nipah virus highlighted  the  need

for  us  to  speed up this plan.  Why do we need to  go  to  the

chilled  meat and the cold chain system?  Under the old  system,

the  animals were slaughtered and they were straightaway brought

to  the markets, which means there was very little time for  the

proper analysis to be carried out as to whether that pig was  in

any  way infected.  By having the chilled meat system, it allows

the  abattoirs  to  hold on to the meat after slaughter  and  it

ensures  that the blood and the internal organs can be  properly

analysed.  By having the chilled meat system we will in fact  be

in  a  better position to assure Singaporeans that the meat that

they buy from the markets is well inspected and found to be free

of diseases.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> What this really means is that in a way

consumers  have no choice in the matter.  Is it not possible  to

leave this as a matter of choice?  In other words, for those who

want chillers to be installed, by all means install chillers and

the basis of that is a possible improvement in health; for those

who want to continue to eat fresh meat,  allow them to do so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, once the meat is chilled it is

proper and best to sell it as chilled.  The reason is that  when

the meat is chilled and left in the open, especially in our very

humid environment, a lot of moisture forms on the meat and  that

actually speeds up deterioration of the meat.  So we must ensure

that the meat remains chilled up to the point of sale.

Hendra-like  virus,  is  a newly discovered  virus.   Currently,

little is known about the new Nipah virus.  Experts from the  US

Center  of  Disease  Control and Prevention,  Atlanta,  and  the

Australian  Animal  Health Laboratories are still  investigating

the  cases  in  Malaysia and carrying out more  studies  on  the

nature and epidemiology of the Nipah virus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there have been recent reports of Nipah virus

infection in dogs and goats in Malaysia, there is no risk of the

spread  of the Nipah virus to Singapore via animal hosts.   This

is because PPD has imposed a ban on the import of all

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>

mammals,  including  goats and dogs, from  Malaysia  since  19th

March  1999.   The control measures taken by PPD  are  still  in

place  today.  PPD will not lift this ban until it is  confident

that  the  import  of animals will not pose a danger  to  public

health.   PPD  and the Customs Department have also  stepped  up

surveillance  to  prevent smuggling of  meat  and  animals  into

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, PPD is also monitoring closely the situation

and  developments in Malaysia, especially the recent  occurrence

of  the  Nipah virus in Johor.  It maintains close contact  with

the American and Australian experts and the Malaysian veterinary

authorities  so  that it is kept updated of the latest  findings

and  developments  promptly.  PPD will respond  swiftly  if  the

studies   or   developments  suggest   that   other   additional

precautions are necessary in future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current ban on pig imports from Malaysia remains and we

will  resume  imports  from Johor only  when  the  area  can  be

declared  to  be a disease-free zone according to  international

standards.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung</b> asked the Minister for

Communications if he will update the House on what  non-criminal

measures  will  be  taken to deal with electronic  road  pricing

defaulters.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Communications if

he  will  consider a violation of the use of Cashcards  and  In-Vehicle  Units  as  a minor or unintentional offence,  requiring

only  the  collection of a higher rate of fees payable from  the

car owner through a monthly or even six-monthly invoice.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission to take Question Nos. 3

and 4 together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, you may.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Thank you. Sir, in March this year, during

the  Budget  debate,  Prof. Chin and Mr Chay  Wai  Chuen  raised

similar queries about the penalties for ERP violations. Most ERP

violations arise from motorists either inserting their Cashcards

improperly, or forgetting to insert their Cashcards,  or  having

insufficient balances in their Cashcards.  As it is not possible

for  motorists  to  evade detection under  the  ERP  system,  my

Ministry  agrees  that such violations are  not  due  to  wilful

disregard for our rules but to forgetfulness or carelessness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then informed the House that the Land Transport Authority

(LTA)  was  working out a scheme to allow motorists  who  commit

these   ERP   violations  to  pay  the  ERP   charges   and   an

administrative  surcharge.   I am pleased to announce  that  the

LTA has finalised the details of this scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the revised system, motorists who forget to insert

their  Cashcards  into the IUs or have insufficient  balance  in

their  Cashcards  when  passing through ERP  gantries,  will  be

required  to  pay the applicable ERP fee plus an  administrative

surcharge within two weeks of the violation.  The administrative

surcharge is currently set at $10. The LTA will send a letter to

the  motorist informing him of the violation, and requesting him

to  pay up the charges within two weeks.  If he does not  do  so

within the 2-week period, he will then have to pay a composition

fine of $70.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA will announce implementation details of this scheme

soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Dr Neo's suggestion on a monthly or 6-monthly invoice, my Ministry had considered such a central

billing  system for the collection of ERP charges and violations

when the ERP system was first designed but opted for the present

smart-card  system for several reasons.  This  is  because   the

smart-card  system  does away with the  need  for  an  expensive

central  accounting billing operation. It also  makes  motorists

more  conscious  of  the cost of motoring as  the  deduction  is

immediate each time the vehicle passes under a gantry.  Finally,

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>

current   system  using  Cashcards  also  safeguards  individual

privacy  as  details  of  movements of motorists  would  not  be

monitored.   Nevertheless,  we  will  continue  to  monitor  the

situation and refine the system as and when necessary.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister whether the current defaulters are still liable for the

composition fine or they will be treated under the new scheme?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, in order for the new scheme to come

into   operation,  changes  will  have  to  be   made   to   the

administrative  system and that will take some time.   LTA  will

require  some more time before it can implement the system.   So

current defaulters under the scheme would continue to be treated

according to the present administrative regime.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> May I ask

the  Minister about the administrative charge of $10?  Could  he

enlighten   the   House  as  to  what  is  it  for   that   this

administrative charge is levied?  Is it for sending a notice  to

the owner of the car?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, as the name suggests, the

administrative charge is to cover all the costs related  to  the

administration of this new scheme which include the tracking  of

the  offences, making sure that the motorists who do not pay the

ERP charge do so within the two weeks and if they do not, making

sure that they are issued the composition fine of $70.  All this

involves  administration, manpower, computer time  and  it  also

involves  the setting up of a total framework to make sure  that

such  a  violation scheme is not abused.  After all, the purpose

of  this scheme is to make sure that motorists do use the system

as  it is intended, which is to have an IU installed, to have  a

valid  CashCard  inserted and to make  sure  that  each  time  a

motorist  uses  an ERP-controlled road, he pays the  fee.   More

than 99% of people do that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cater to the small group of people who forget to do so,

we  have  amended the system, according to feedback from Members

of this House.  We agree that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>

under  the ERP system, nobody can escape.  Unlike the old system

where people had to put up a disc, and some who did not put up a

disc  were  not people who forgot to do so, but were people  who

were  out  to cheat the system.  And that was when a composition

fine  was imposed.  Under the ERP system, such a situation  does

not  occur, because every motorist who passes through the gantry

will  be detected.  So, on that basis, we have decided to change

the system, and I hope motorists will continue to use the system

as  it  is intended.  But if they do not for whatever reason   - forgetfulness, carelessness or whatever  -   they are not overly

penalised, as it were.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am thankful to the Minister for the

lengthy  reply  he has given, but I regret it  does  not  really

answer my question.  Would he set out specifically what is  this

administration for which $10 appears to be the  just punishment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I do not know where the hon. Member got

the  idea  of  a  punishment from.  I have just gone  through  a

lengthy reply to the Member of the House to explain to him  that

we  do  not regard this as an offence.  We regard this  as  non-payment of a fee.  We wish to collect that fee and therefore  we

have  to go through this exercise.  The process of going through

that  exercise incurs expenses and manpower, and the charge  for

this  expense and manpower is, at the moment, $10.  It could  go

up, if the cost of administration goes up.  But as far as we are

concerned,  at  this  stage,  we  are  recovering  the  cost  of

administration, plus the ERP fee.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, would the Minister

explain why he finds it fit to levy a $70 compound fine when the

current fine, I believe, is $30?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, if the letter asking for payment is

sent  out and if within two weeks,  no reply is given,  that  is

tantamount to an offence.  For such an offence, a levy of $70 is

deemed  to be the charge.  In other words, a motorist  is  given

two weeks  to pay up, failing which he is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>

deemed  to have committed an offence.  In the same way  that  he

does  not  pay  a parking charge or he does not  pay  any  other

Government  charge, he is deemed to have committed  an  offence.

And a notice of offence is then sent out.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Communications

(a)  whether  his  Ministry  has  evaluated  the  business  cost

implications  of  extending  the  electronic  road  pricing   in

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for Communications

when  the  Land Transport Authority will release the fee  to  be

charged at the new 9 Electronic Road Pricing gantries.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your permission

to take Questions 5, 6 and 7 together as they are related?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the ERP is a critical policy

instrument to manage congestion on our roads.  Together with the

Vehicle  Quota  System, they keep our roads flowing  freely,  so

that  goods  and  people do not get stuck in traffic  jams.   In

other  words, and this is in response to Mr Tay's question,  the

ERP  has  had a positive impact on business, not only in  direct

cash terms but also in terms of faster travel times that lead to

overall  lowering of transport costs.  This ultimately helps  us

to  maintain  our competitiveness as an efficient  international

manufacturing, logistics and business centre.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our vehicle population expands, in order to cater to

growing demands from business and to meet the aspirations of our

people,  the  challenge to keep congestion at  bay  will  become

increasingly more difficult.  Our choices are limited.   We  can

build  more  roads,  but  we will have  to  sacrifice  land  for

housing,  schools, industries and recreation.  This  is  not  an

option  for  most  Singaporeans.  We can  restrain  car  growth.

Again,  this  is  not  an  option  if  we  are  to  give   young

Singaporeans and those who can afford their chance to own a car.

Finally,  we can manage the traffic on our roads, by encouraging

better  use of our limited road space through ERP.  This is  the

preferred option.

With ERP, motorists are more careful about using their vehicles.

They  have  several choices.  Do they have to drive?   Can  they

take  a  bus  or  train?  Can they share a car with  friends  or

colleagues? Or can they switch their travel to a less  congested

time?  If they really need to drive at peak hours, they are free

to  do  so, and in return for a small fee, they enjoy a smoother

and faster ride.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our experience with ERP and ALS has been positive. In

1975,  when  road  pricing was first introduced,  total  vehicle

population  was 280,000.  Today, it is 680,000, an  increase  of

almost  150%.   Over  the  same period,  our  road  network  has

increased by 44%.  Trips made by public transport has gone up by

about  90%.   The bottom line is that while cars have increased,

our  roads are still free-flowing because more people are  using

public transport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, pockets of congestion are appearing in areas

outside  the CBD and along the expressways.  Moreover, they  are

spreading  from the morning to the evening peak hours  as  well.

This  is  not surprising as our vehicle population is continuing

to expand faster than our road capacity.  That is why we need to

expand the ERP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LTA will shortly announce the exact locations of the

first  seven  gantries to be implemented on 1st September  1999.

Other  gantries  will be considered when the traffic  conditions

demand them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai asked about the rates that will be charged at these

gantries.  They will only

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>

be  fixed closer to the date of implementation, ie, in September

1999, based on the prevailing traffic conditions then.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay asked about lowering charges for commercial

vehicles.  When ERP was introduced last year, the Government, as

promised, lowered  the cost of vehicle ownership.  Up-front  and

annual  ownership  taxes  such as Customs  Duties,  Registration

Fees,   Additional   Registration  Fees  and   road   tax   were

significantly   reduced.   The  majority  of   vehicle   owners,

including  owners  of  commercial vehicles, enjoyed  substantial

savings in annual road tax, ranging from about $280 per year for

cars to as much as $2,000 per year for commercial vehicles.   In

addition,  all  vehicle owners were given a road tax  rebate  of

$200 per PCU.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also helped businesses to adjust to ERP by phasing

in   the  charges  for  commercial  vehicles  over  four  years.

Currently, commercial vehicles pay only a quarter of their  full

ERP  rates,  except for the CTE, where they pay half  the  rate.

Whether  it  is quarter or half, this is still much  lower  than

what they were paying under the manual road pricing scheme.   In

fact,  owners of commercial vehicles will save about $63 million

in the first year of ERP implementation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee asked for a comparison between the ERP and the

manual  Area Licensing Scheme (ALS).  With ERP, traffic  is  now

better  spread  out with charges corresponding more  closely  to

traffic  conditions. Travel speeds in the Restricted  Zone  (RZ)

range  from 20 to 30 km per hour and on the expressways  between

45  and  65  km  per  hour.   At these  speeds,  the  roads  and

expressways are carrying close to their designed capacity  while

remaining congestion free.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ERP rates are also lower than the corresponding ALS fees.

For  example, the ALS fee for cars was $3.00 during peak periods

and $2.00 during off-peak periods. Now, with ERP, the Restricted

Zone  rates range from $1.00 to $2.50.  And on Saturdays, it  is

now free entry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government revenue from ERP today is about 60% of the

revenue under

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>

the  manual  ALS/RPS  schemes.  This  is  expected  to  decrease

further following the last rate adjustment in April 1999,  which

saw  the  lifting of ERP on Saturdays and reductions in  charges

for  some  time periods in the RZ and on one of the Expressways.

This demonstrates clearly that ERP is a traffic management tool,

not  a  revenue-generating instrument.  The objective of ERP,  I

repeat  again, is to keep our roads congestion free  and  smooth

flowing  while allowing our vehicle population to increase.   In

so  doing,  it helps to maintain Singapore as an attractive  and

efficient place to live in and do business in.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, the Minister mentioned that the ERP

system  has  led to an overall lowering of transport  costs  and

that  Government revenue has decreased to 60% of that under  the

ALS  scheme.  However, we do not know from the consumers'  point

of  view, in other words, the motorists' point of view,  whether

it  has  actually  taken  them  a longer  time  to  reach  their

destinations  because  of travelling on alternative  routes,  or

that  they  actually had to rearrange their  time  schedules  in

order  to have a reduction in terms of price.  Therefore, we  do

not  necessarily  know that from the motorists'  point  of  view

there  is  an overall reduction in terms of all sorts of  costs,

including time.  Would the Minister therefore consider  doing  a

survey  to  find  out  from motorists  how  they  have  actually

adjusted  their traffic patterns and whether they have saved  in

terms not only of cost but also in terms of time travelled?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the purpose of the ERP is not just to

spread  the  traffic.  If we take it from the point of  view  of

what Dr Lee mentioned where people are just avoiding the traffic

jams  alone,  I think that in itself is not going to  solve  the

problem.   The  purpose of this exercise is to offer  more  than

just  that  option.   There  are other  options  involved  which

include  -  and this is most important  -  either a forgoing  of

trips  because  the  trips are not necessary  or  a  shift  from

private to public transport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not done a comprehensive survey because we have

just started to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>

implement the system.  Such a survey will be part of the overall

strategic traffic studies that are done on a regular basis,  and

these  figures will come out.  But the overall impact of ERP  as

far  as direct Government revenue is concerned is that there has

been  a  reduction.   In  other words,  motorists  are  actually

keeping  40%  of  the money.  What do they do with  this  money?

Whether they decide to keep it and to travel longer distance  or

they  decide to keep it and use it for public transport or  they

decide to share a car with their colleagues and split the  cost,

that  we  do  not  know at the moment.  But we have  given  them

several  choices.  It is up to them.  And if they  believe  that

their time is not worth the money that they need to spend to pay

ERP  or  if  they  believe that a train is more comfortable  and

faster, which in some cases it is, that is also their choice.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong) (for the</b>

<b>Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, may I

take Question Nos. 8 and 9 together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> As the Prime Minister stated on 24th

April   1999,  the  Government  does  not  intend   to   abolish

scholarships,  or  to replace them with study loans  for  bright

students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore's future progress and success, it is crucial

for the civil service and statutory boards to attract their fair

share  of talent. This will ensure continued strong and  capable

public  sector leadership.  Scholars are a vital source of  such

public   sector  talent.   This  is  so  not  only  for  premier

scholarships  like the President's Scholarship, SAF  and  Police

Overseas Scholarship or OMS Scholarship, but also the many other

scholarships  offered by the civil service, SAF,  and  statutory

boards.   Many  Government-linked  companies  have  also   found

scholarships  a  good  way  to  attract  talent  to  join  their

organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the scholarship schemes have worked well. Only a

very  small  number of PSC scholars (1% of local  scholars,  and

0.2%  of  overseas scholars) break their bonds  before  starting

work.   Most  adapt  well to their working environment  and  new

responsibilities.  The agencies administering  the  scholarships

exercise flexibility in deploying scholars, taking into  account

the   individuals'  interests  and  aptitudes  as  well  as  the

organisations'  needs.   They  take  pains  to   make   scholars

understand  that in return for the opportunity to study  in  top

institutions,  they  have  a  legal  and  moral  obligation   to

contribute  something back to society.  Scholars have  risen  to

become  Permanent  Secretaries, CEOs  of  statutory  boards  and

senior SAF and Police officers.  Some have entered politics,  to

become MPs and Ministers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No student is compelled to take up a scholarship, and thus

be  bonded  to  serve  the Government.   Every  Singaporean  who

qualifies  for  admission  is already assured  of  a  university

education in NUS and NTU,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>

even  if  he  cannot afford to pay the already highly subsidised

fees.  Students should only apply for undergraduate scholarships

provided they want to pursue a course for which scholarships are

available,  accept the terms and objectives of  the  scholarship

scheme,  and are ready to commit themselves to a public  service

career. Those who are not yet certain of their minds are  better

off  studying on their own, or if necessary taking a study loan.

Then  they are free to choose their university course, and defer

the choice of career until after graduation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks already offer study loans at market rates. The

Government  cannot  justify offering  study  loans  with  public

funds,   especially  at  subsidised  rates,  to  study   abroad.

Taxpayers'  money must be used only for national  interest,  and

not  for an individual's self-fulfilment.  Students taking loans

to  study abroad have no legal or moral obligation to return  to

serve the sponsoring organisation.  Some may even feel that they

have  no moral obligation to return to serve Singapore.   If  we

replace  scholarships with study loans, we will  end  up  losing

many of our top students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government and the statutory boards will therefore

continue  offering scholarships for courses of  study  in  areas

where  the  State needs talent and expertise.  We will regularly

review  the  terms of the scholarship schemes, as  well  as  the

management   of  scholars  during  and  after  their  university

courses,  to  ensure that these continue to meet our objectives,

and  to  keep up to date with changing circumstances.   We  will

also strive to recruit more talent from other sources, including

able  students  who  did  not  take  a  scholarship  to  go   to

university, and mid-career executives who have made  their  mark

in the private sector.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Would the Minister give his view

regarding  Dr Tony Tan's comment on the practice of safeguarding

or  "cold-storaging"  job vacancies for scholarship  holders  as

being too rigid?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> It is an obligation which the

organisation  which  gives the scholarship  takes  upon  itself.

When you

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>

give a scholarship, you must also bear in mind that the scholars

are going to come back in three or four years' time and you will

have to decide where you are going to deploy him and how you are

going  to  use him.  This is not just slave labour.  This  is  a

person  who  has been educated, whom you have invested  in,  and

whom you have a responsibility to deploy to best purpose.  It is

not  a  light obligation, but it is one which the public service

has taken on and, I think, has been able to fulfill in the areas

where it needs this talent.  The point is that a scholarship  is

not  just  a one-way obligation.  The organisation awarding  the

scholarship takes on an obligation to look after the scholar and

to  deploy  him  and  use him fruitfully, and  the  scholar  who

receives  the scholarship receives the benefit because  he  gets

his  education and, at the same time, he takes on an  obligation

to come back and give his best to the organisation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> I would like

adequate  resources  and do not depend on Government  to  pursue

further studies.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Yes, there are. There are

alternatives.  They can go on their own.  They can work for some

time  before going overseas.  They can take loans.  Or they  can

go to NUS.  And there have been cases of students who have said,

"No,  thank  you very much.  We don't want the bond."   Not  all

these  students are from affluent families.  I have heard  even,

in  one  case, a taxi-driver's son, who said, "No, I won't  take

the  scholarship.  I will go on my own."  There are  also  other

scholars  I  have heard of - this may be apocryphal -  who  have

applied  for  the scholarship because they want  the  benchmark.

And  having been awarded the scholarship, the father says,  "All

right,  you turn it down.  I will pay."  Unfortunately, we  have

not found a way to sieve out such people at an early stage.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> That being the case, is there a

danger that the scholarships are given not to our best and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1305</b></font><br><br>

ablest?   Because our best and ablest may potentially come  from

more  affluent families.  Then there is a risk as to  what  will

happen   to   our  President's  Scholarship  or  other   premier

scholarships.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> That is a problem. We regularly ask

the  PSC  whether they have been able to attract good  scholars,

and  up  to  now  they  have assured us that  they  have  got  a

reasonable  share of the top students.  And the PSC alone  gives

about  150 to 200 scholarships a year.  But it will increasingly

become a problem.  We are in a different situation now from  the

time  when  I took a scholarship in 1971, when nearly  my  whole

class   went   to  university  on  scholarships,   and   without

scholarships, could not have gone to university, much less study

abroad.  That is not the situation today.  If they do not take a

Government scholarship, they can get one from EDB, MAS,  DBS  or

Sembawang,  or  so  many others who are sometimes  falling  over

themselves  to give these scholarships out. And so the  students

sometimes  feel that, "Wow!  I am a valuable talent.   There  is

such  enormous demand for my capabilities.", which  may  not  be

borne out in later life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we need to continue to attract good people in, and I

believe  that  over a period of time, we will  have  to  make  a

greater   effort  to  attract  in  people  who  did   not   take

scholarships  but  who  have  the  talent,  who  have  gone   to

universities on their own, who may have spent some time working,

and now want a change.  We must bring them in, whether it is for

a  few years on contract or on a permanent change of career,  to

have  a  greater flow-in from graduating students and  from  the

private sector.  MAS, for example, has brought in quite a number

of  people  from  the  private sector,  mid-careers,  some  from

academia,  from  universities.  And we  have  found  it  a  very

fruitful experience, because the interaction between the  people

who  are  in  the  organisation  who  have  the  experience  and

institutional memory of how things are done and why, as well  as

the  people  who  have come in without that long experience  but

with a different perspective from the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>

private  sector, has been good for both sides and good  for  the

organisation.  We need more organisations to do that.  But it is

easier for some than for others.  It is very difficult to  bring

in  a civilian mid-career and make him a colonel or a general in

the  SAF.  It may be easier with banking or with urban planning,

or even with administration.  But we have to work harder.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Will the DPM consider giving scholars

the  option  of pursuing post-graduate studies immediately  upon

graduation  from their undergraduate studies?  Because  this  is

one  potential  deterrent for them taking up  the  scholarships,

that  they  have  to  come back to serve before  pursuing  post-graduate studies.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> There is some flexibility in this.

PSC often allows scholars to do Masters degrees immediately as a

continuation of their undergraduate course.  For PhDs, they  are

more  selective, but it is not a blanket no.  It really  depends

where we think you can be valuable and whether this fits in with

our  career plans for you.  If you go on an academic scholarship

from  the  university, then, of course, you go on to a  PhD  and

come back to a teaching career.  If you go into a scholarship to

serve  in the SAF, and you say, "I want to go on and spend three

years doing a PhD.", I think the SAF will legitimately ask, "How

does this help you to serve me better?  Or will it only make you

more  reluctant and more difficult to fit into the  organisation

after  you complete your PhD, and therefore we would have to  be

more  careful in making decisions?"  But even then, we have  had

SAF scholars who have taken no-pay leave, after working for some

years,  and gone and done PhDs.  One of them is now the  CEO  of

the URA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it has been done. But the education is for the purpose

of  enhancing your ability to contribute to Singapore.  If it is

purely  self-fulfilment, then it is something which you have  to

look after on your own.

<div align="center"><b>MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Register of assets)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Prime Minister whether

he will introduce a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>

Members'  Register  for  Members of Parliament  to  declare  all

assets of whatever nature held by them or in the names of  their

spouses.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng) (for the</b>

<b>Prime Minister):</b> Sir, the Prime Minister has asked me to answer

on his behalf.  There is no need to introduce such a register.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's proposal for public disclosure of Members'

assets  is not new.  He had raised the subject in this House  on

two  occasions, in 1981 and 1985.  The then Prime  Minister,  Mr

Lee  Kuan  Yew, gave a full answer to this issue.  It  had  also

been raised on other occasions by some other Members like Dr Lee

Siew Choh and Mr Chiam See Tong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall repeat the two reasons why having Members of

Parliament declare their assets publicly is not practical.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the proposal cannot guarantee clean and uncorrupt

practices.   An MP who is corrupt will not list his assets  from

corrupt  gains in his declaration of his assets.  Unless  he  is

stupid,  he  will  not flaunt his corrupt gains by  ostentatious

living or keeping them in his name in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Government has done is to require every Minister

and  office-bearer to file a declaration of his assets with  the

Prime  Minister  at the beginning of his term  of  office.   The

declarations  are  then  shown  to  the  President.   These  are

requirements under the Code of Conduct for Ministers and Office-Holders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Prime Minister requires all PAP

backbenchers,  though  they  are not  in  charge  of  Government

policies or Ministries, to declare their assets to him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an allegation of corruption is made against an office-holder, or an MP, his declaration will be available for

investigations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can have any number of laws, regulations and

declarations to curb corruption but ultimately it depends on the

reputation and integrity of the Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>

and its commitment to tackle corruption effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason why we do not favour a public register is

that  allowing public access to Members' declarations of  assets

will  encroach  upon  their personal  privacy.   It  is  already

difficult enough to persuade able and talented men and women  to

come  forward  and  stand for election without subjecting  their

private  affairs to close scrutiny.  To require their and  their

family members' personal assets to be publicly known is to  make

it  more  difficult for able people to come forward to serve  in

Parliament.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister whether transparency

is  one of the essential attributes of an honest government  and

this  Government wastes no time in talking about  being  a  good

honest Government?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Certainly. Transparency is one of the

things that the Government firmly believes in.  That is why  the

Government has always behaved and conducted itself in an  above-board  manner.  Everything that the Government has  done  is  in

accordance  with the law.  Prying into the personal  affairs  of

the  Minister  or  the  MP  is  not  one  of  the  subjects   of

transparency.   It  is  completely  transparent  to  the   Prime

Minister what his Ministers or office holders possess.   But  it

is not within public knowledge and it is not a matter for public

scrutiny.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Are we to understand from the Minister that

the  Government's definition of "transparency" is acting  as  an

honest Government but not making it known to the public at large

that they are seen to be acting as an honest Government?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, whether the Government is honest or

not is well-documented by many agencies, whether it is PERC, WEF

or  any  other agency, studying the reputation and integrity  of

the  Government.   I  think  it is quite  well-known  that  this

Government is completely honest.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No system in the world can stop corruption if that person

wants to be corrupt.  What is most important is that the men  on

top,   ie,  the  Prime  Minister,  his  Cabinet  and  the  whole

leadership of Government, are completely above-board.  They  set

the  standard.  If the men on top do not set the standard,  then

they  cannot enforce the standard down below.  It is quite clear

that  we  have a system that works.  We have the CPIB that  also

works  very  hard  and  if there is any hint  of  corruption  by

anybody, I think the CPIB will bear down on him.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister agree that in a

democracy,  which Singapore claims it is, it is the  people  who

are  at the top, they are the masters, and the Government should

be made transparent to them?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Precisely, Sir, because the people are

the ones who elect the Government every few years.  They decided

to have a PAP Government and they have given the PAP the mandate

to rule and govern for the last 30-over years.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister please answer my

question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I do not know where Mr Jeyaretnam has

been  when  I  was answering his question.  If  he  becomes  the

Government,  he  can set the standard.  This is  the  Government

that has been in charge since 1959 and we set the standard.  The

standard  has  been that we uphold an incorruptible  Government.

And  if there is any hint of corruption of anybody, the law will

bear down on him.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> How is the public to know? May I ask the

Minister ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> How is the public to know? Let me

answer the question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister a question? I am

here to ask questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister aware that in a great many

countries, a Members' Register is in force and I think  Malaysia

has just introduced it as well?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> We all know that an assets declaration

register  is  implemented  in many countries,  in  the  US,  UK,

Canada,  Australia, New Zealand and, nearby in  the  region,  in

Taiwan.  But has that stopped corruption?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> What is the great objection to maintaining

a Members' Register?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I have been here for 10 minutes

answering his questions and he still could not understand.

<div align="center"><b>FIRES AND HAZE FROM INDONESIA</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay</b> asked the Minister for the

Environment  why  the fires and haze from Indonesia  persist  to

affect  Singapore  and what improvements can  be  expected  from

recent discussions within ASEAN.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the short spells of hazy

conditions  we  experienced over the last two  months  were  the

result  of logging and plantation fires in central Sumatra.  The

fact  that the fires persist indicates that ground fire fighting

measures  and enforcement in Indonesia are not effective  enough

even  though  we  had alerted the Indonesian  authorities  about

these fires.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent fires in Sumatra were not extensive,

nonetheless,  we  were still affected by smoke haze  because  of

winds  blowing  in our direction. The weather forecast  for  the

rest  of the year shows that the normal dry season would set  in

but  we  do not expect a El Nino drought situation like that  of

1997.   Unless  fire  fighting  and  enforcement  measures   are

effective  in Indonesia, we would have to expect some hazy  days

with air quality in the moderate zone.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last month's Sixth ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Haze in

Brunei,  Indonesia acknowledged that enforcement against illegal

burning  activities is lacking and would be difficult under  the

current political and economic climate. Their efforts were  also

hampered  by lack of a clear organisational structure to  tackle

forest fire issues and lack of funding.  The Indonesian Minister

for  the Environment has assured us of his ministry's commitment

to control such fires and has agreed to use the fires in Sumatra

as a test case to show their resolve in addressing the fires and

haze problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Brunei meeting, Indonesia agreed to adopt a zero

burning  policy and initiate dialogue with plantation owners  to

promote  zero  burning practices, starting  with  a  seminar  in

Jakarta  in  June.  Indonesia also agreed to  make  use  of  the

presumption  clause  in their law to deal  with  landowners  for

illegal burning found on their land. This "presumption of guilt"

policy,  successfully  practised in Malaysia  and  Brunei,  will

compel a plantation owner to prove that any fire on his land was

not  his  doing and that he had taken all necessary  actions  to

prevent or stop it. We hope that Indonesia will succeed in these

efforts  and mobilise the necessary resources to put  out  fires

and take firm enforcement actions against any culprit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministers are meeting again in July to take stock of

the progress made on the part of Indonesia. We will continue  to

work  closely with our ASEAN neighbours, international  agencies

and  donor  countries on programmes that would  help  strengthen

Indonesia's ability to deal with this problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, Indonesia has

made   a  request  for  assistance  and  Malaysia  has  made   a

commitment.   May  I ask the Minister what assistance  Singapore

has  given  to-date and what further assistance Singapore  might

extend in response to this request?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, when the fires first broke out in

1997, we responded immediately.  We had discussions with our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>

Indonesian  counterparts and offered assistance.   Let  me  list

some  of  the  assistance we had given.  Our assistance  so  far

included  the  following:  Firstly, provision  of  communication

equipment  and computers with Internet facilities to  help  them

improve   communications.   Secondly,   we   have   helped   the

Indonesians to set up air quality monitoring stations in  Jambi,

Pontianak  and Bali.  Thirdly, we have helped with the  training

of  Indonesian  officials on forest fires  and  haze  monitoring

using  satellite imagery.  And fourthly, we are providing  ready

access  to  the forest fires and haze monitoring system  on  the

ASEAN  Specialised  Meteorological Centre which  is  located  in

Singapore  in  order to monitor and retrieve  up-to-date  forest

fires and weather information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, so far, in terms of the equipment donation, our

contributions have amounted to over $600,000.  Over the last few

months,  we  have  also  continued  to  provide  the  Indonesian

enforcement  agency,  which is called  BAPEDAL,  with  satellite

pictures  to  alert  them  on the locations  of  the  hot  spots

whenever they are detected.  These pictures are delivered by  e-mail  and  courier  in  order to allow BAPEDAL  to  take  prompt

enforcement  and  fast suppression action  on  the  ground.   As

mentioned  by  Mr Tay, the Indonesian Coordinating Minister  for

People's  Welfare and Poverty Alleviation, Prof Haryono  Suyono,

had  indicated his interest to visit Singapore to discuss  areas

of  further  assistance  with us.   We  definitely  welcome  his

suggestion  and Singapore will be happy to continue  to  provide

assistance in areas where we have the capacity and the technical

expertise to do so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> May I ask the Minister how can Singapore be

assured  that, in giving our assistance and contributions,  this

assistance  will be well spent and spent on the fires  and  haze

for  which they are intended, that is to say, has his Indonesian

counterpart given his assurance that no corruption, cronyism  or

nepotism will hinder our help?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, so far, we have provided equipment

and training.  Our experience has been that the equipment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>

has  actually  been put to very good use.  We  are  in  constant

contact  with  them through our computers, Internet  and  faxes.

They  are receiving them and they are passing on the information

down   to   the  ground.   So  on  the  part  of  our  immediate

counterparts  in the Ministry of Environment, I can  assure  the

Member that the assistance we have provided them so far has been

put to good use.

<div align="center"><b>ILL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOLS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Minister for Education

whether  ill discipline is rising in schools and among  students

outside schools, and what measures are being taken to help  stem

such incidence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education

(Encik  Mohamad Maidin B P M) (for the Minister for  Education):

Mrs  Lim's question has got two parts.  One is on the  state  of

discipline, and the other is on measures taken by MOE to address

discipline issues in schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first part, Sir, I must say that the overall state

of discipline in our schools is good. Serious cases of breach of

discipline are infrequent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to now, since 1995, the Ministry of Education has

implemented  what  we call the Behaviour Tracking  and  Analysis

(BETA)  system.   This  system collects data  on  the  state  of

discipline  in  all schools.  For primary schools, misdemeanours

such  as  not  doing assignments and disruptive  behaviour,  and

attendance-related offences, constitute 84% of all the  recorded

offences.  In  secondary  schools,  74%  of  the  offences  were

attendance-related, namely, late-coming and truancy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BETA system, which I mentioned earlier, records up to

now  show no significant statistical change in the offence rates

from  1995 to 1997.  "Offence rates" in this case refer  to  the

number of offences per 1,000 pupils. The data for 1998 show that

the number of serious offences

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>

such as gangsterism and possession of weapons remaining close to

that of 1997, and the number of cases of substance abuse falling

from  272  in  1997  to 40 in 1998.  However, the  incidence  of

smoking has risen from 14 per 1,000 pupils over the three years,

that is, 1995-1997, to 19 per 1,000 pupils in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall offence rate for boys has remained stable over

the  years, but a worrying trend is the increasing offence  rate

for  girls in our secondary schools. Though lower than the  male

offence rates, the female offence rates have increased by 6%  to

9%  per year over the last four years, going up from 300 in 1995

to 456 in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A committee chaired by the Senior Minister of State for

Education,  Dr Aline Wong, was set up in May last year  to  look

into  the discipline situation among our girls in schools.   The

committee is finalising its recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On measures to address discipline issue in our schools,

Sir, the Ministry's philosophy in this matter is that to care is

to  discipline.   Schools  by  and  large  take  a  whole-person

approach  to discipline.  They have many programmes and  support

structures  to help promote discipline. Besides the creation  of

the  posts  of Discipline Master, Head/Pupil Welfare  and,  most

recently,  Operations  Manager,  there  is  also  the  Voluntary

Special Constabulary Scheme where teachers assume the mantle  of

law  enforcement  officers to help reinforce an  orderly  school

environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers have been equipped with basic counselling skills

and  many  spend  much  time counselling errant  students.  Such

efforts are complemented by programmes like life skills and peer

mediation.

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is well known as a clean and green city.

Tropical diseases are kept at bay, food is safe, and our

environment is clean.  We have achieved our high standard of

public health by investing wisely in environmental

infrastructure, conducting public education, and enforcing

strictly the environmental laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, our population has become more aware of the

need  to protect the environment.  However, there are still some

who, despite our campaigns and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>

urging, persist in acting irresponsibly.  They litter and  dirty

public   places,   indiscriminately   discard   their   unwanted

possessions  or  waste, and sometimes do  great  damage  to  the

environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we live in a very densely populated country, our living

environment can deteriorate very quickly if we are not  careful.

We cannot tolerate irresponsible acts that damage or pollute our

environment.  While we continue to educate the public,  we  must

also  ensure  that  we have penalties that will  strongly  deter

those who continue to act irresponsibly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore becomes more built up, construction activities

are increasingly located nearer to existing residential estates.

A  construction  site, if not managed carefully,  can  become  a

source  of  nuisance and even public health hazards to residents

and  workers  living  and  working  nearby.   A  better-educated

population  also  expects a higher standard of  housekeeping  in

construction sites.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contractors must therefore take appropriate steps to

minimise   nuisance  to  residents.   The  Bill   will   require

contractors   of   construction  sites   to   engage   qualified

Environmental  Control Officers (ECOs) to  help  them  keep  the

sites clean and free of nuisance or public health hazards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments to the Environmental Public Health

Act  will  allow my Ministry to better address these  and  other

emerging concerns on environmental public health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now highlight the main amendments and new

provisions in this Bill.

<br><br><i>Illegal Dumping</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illegal dumping of waste, mainly from construction sites,

is  becoming  a major problem and has to be checked immediately.

Not  only  is it happening more often, the culprits are  getting

bolder  too.  Whereas in the past, they used to dump  the  waste

only in remote parts of Singapore, they are now daring enough to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>

dump  even  in  built-up areas.  The indications  are  that  the

illegal  dumping  activities are now more  organised,  and  much

larger in scale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they normally operate late at night, and in

deserted  areas,  it is not easy to catch the offenders  in  the

act.   But  when we do, we must duly punish them with  penalties

that  adequately  fit the crime.  This will be achieved  in  the

amendments before us in this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 provides for the Court to grant the application

made  by  the  Public Prosecutor for a vehicle to be  forfeited,

when  it  is  proven that the vehicle has been used for  illegal

dumping.   Clause 5 increases the maximum fine to  $50,000  from

the  existing  $10,000,  for the first conviction.   Second  and

subsequent  convictions  will  result  in  a  maximum  fine   of

$100,000, and imprisonment for a term of not less than one month

and not more than 12 months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 empowers the Commissioner of Public Health to

call  up for questioning any person suspected to be involved  in

illegal  dumping,  or in the operation of an unlicensed  dumping

ground.   This  will  empower ENV officers to  conduct  thorough

investigations and bring the offending parties to court.

<br><br><i>Operating an Illegal Dump Site</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prevent any person from attempting to operate an illegal

dump  site under the guise of operating a waste recycling plant,

clause  2  has  included "recycling plant" in the definition  of

"disposal  facility".   This  will enable  the  Commissioner  of

Public  Health to license all recycling plants under section  23

(1) of the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 8, any person found operating an illegal

disposal  site  can be fined up to $50,000 or imprisoned  for  a

term  not  exceeding 12 months or both for the first conviction.

For  the second and subsequent convictions, the penalties are  a

fine  of up to $100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding

12 months or both.  The previous maximum penalties were a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>

$10,000  fine  or 12 months imprisonment or both, for  first  or

subsequent convictions.

<br><br><i>Littering</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, a Corrective Works Order (CWO) for littering

offences  is issued in lieu of a fine.  The number of  littering

cases  has been increasing in recent years and so has the number

of  repeat  offenders,  some of whom had  done  corrective  work

previously.  The CWO, on its own, is therefore not a  sufficient

deterrent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Littering is an anti-social habit, one that should not be

difficult  to  give  up.   It  is fundamentally  a  question  of

attitude.   We  have  had decades of public education,  and  the

majority    of    Singaporeans   have   responded    favourably.

Unfortunately, there is a hardcore minority who are  indifferent

to  littering, and who need to be deterred by heavier penalties.

Under clauses 5, 6 and 7, the penalties for littering have  been

revised as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the CWO may now be imposed by the Court in addition to

fines, instead of only in lieu of;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the maximum duration for CWO is increased from 3 hours

to  12  hours. Offenders can now be made to perform CWO on  more

than one day; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) while the maximum fine for the first and second

convictions  remain unchanged at $1,000 and $2,000 respectively,

the  maximum fine for the third and subsequent convictions  will

be increased to $5,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 makes it an offence to discard or abandon any

furniture, any deregistered vehicles or any other bulky items in

any public place.  The penalties will be a maximum fine of

$5,000 for the first conviction and $10,000 or 3 months' jail or

both for the second or subsequent convictions.

<br><br><i>Environmental Control Officers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the provision for the appointment of

Environmental Control Officers.  Poor housekeeping and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>

management of construction work-sites have often given  rise  to

public  health  hazards, such as the breeding of mosquitoes  and

flies,  rodent infestation, disease outbreaks, earth  littering,

dust nuisance and noise pollution.  With construction sites  now

located  increasingly closer to residential  areas,  contractors

must actively ensure that their site activities do not give rise

to public health problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 will require the occupier of any construction

site  with  construction projects worth more  than  a  specified

value  to engage qualified Environmental Control Officers (ECOs)

on  a  full-time or part-time basis.  The role of the ECO is  to

help  plan  and  monitor environmental control measures  on  the

site.   My  Ministry  will register and certify  such  qualified

persons  after  they have attended a prescribed training  course

and pass the pre-requisite examinations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current pool of safety officers, currently certified by

the  Ministry of Manpower, may expand their expertise to include

environmental  management.   They  will  need  to  undergo   the

necessary  training and be certified as ECOs.  In  this  way,  a

contractor  needs to only employ one officer on site to  perform

the  dual  role  of  safety control and  environmental  control.

Suitably  qualified persons who are not currently registered  as

safety  officers can also become ECOs.  My Ministry will  ensure

that  there  will  be sufficient numbers of ECOs  to  serve  the

industry when we launch the scheme.

<br><br><i>Recycling Burial Plots</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 empowers the Commissioner to order the exhumation

of graves for the purposes of reusing the grave plots for future

burials.  This is necessary as we have very limited burial land.

Without   this  measure,  the  existing  burial  land  will   be

completely exhausted within 14 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Singapore continues to develop and progress, our

peoples' expectations of their living environment will increase.

The  challenge of safeguarding our environment and public health

can be successfully met only with the cooperation of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>

everyone in Singapore.  My Ministry will continue to educate the

public,  and  actively  seek  their understanding,  support  and

cooperation.   At the same time, we will deter the recalcitrants

with  penalties  that  are  more  appropriate  to  the  offences

committed.  This Bill will enable my Ministry to deal  with  new

public health problems more effectively, and help keep Singapore

clean and green.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): According

to  information  given by the Ministry of  the  Environment,  in

1998,  a  total  of  8,652 summonses were issued  for  littering

offences.   Compared to the 5,152 summonses in 1997,  there  has

been an increase of almost 3,500. In 1998, there were about  580

people  who  were served with the CWO as opposed to the  376  in

1997.   If these figures are in reference to the  shares market,

many people would have made a lot of money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, there are so many people who are flouting the law.

This  is a very disturbing trend.  This will undermine our image

and  reputation as one of the cleanest cities in the world.  The

Minister has introduced this Amendment Bill to enhance the  fine

and  increase the number of hours for the Corrective Work Orders

(CWO).  I think this is very timely.  I support this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if we want to have a more effective way to

maintain  Singapore's  reputation  as  the  most  beautiful  and

cleanest city in the world, enhancing the penalties is just  one

of  the  ways, albeit an important and effective way.   However,

we  should  also  enhance our educational efforts  so  that  our

people  will learn to keep our environment clean.  I would  like

to make a few suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, education in the schools. Our National Education

has   already  achieved  some  good  results.   Otherwise,   our

environment  would  have been worse and more people  would  have

been   fined.   Through  education  in  the  schools,  we   have

inculcated in our students the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>

concept  of  keeping  our environment clean.   The  Ministry  of

Education should enhance its efforts in this direction  so  that

the  younger generation of citizens will make consistent efforts

to  keep  Singapore clean.  However, I feel that we should  have

more creative ways to educate our students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example. On one occasion a couple of

months ago, while I was standing at the roadside waiting for  my

grassroots leaders to drive me to a function,  I saw  two  young

children, presumably a sister and a brother, crossing the  road.

The  younger brother was kicking an empty can.  The elder sister

said, "Why don't you pick up the empty tin instead of kicking it

around?"   The younger brother said, "I did not throw  it.   Why

should I pick it up?"  Although it was suggested that the  empty

tin  be  picked up, the children did not do so.  In the end,  it

was the Member of Parliament who picked up the tin and threw  it

into the rubbish bin.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that we should start teaching our children about

environmental  protection from young.  In our younger  days,  we

had  lessons  in  civics.  We were told to  use  our  hands  and

participate  in  some gotong royong campaigns.  We  should  also

educate  our  students not only to refrain from  littering,  but

also  to help pick up the litter and dispose of it in the proper

manner.  Then, Singapore will become an even  cleaner city.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in the food centres. We all know that nowadays

many families have their lunches and dinners in the food centres

because  both husband and wife are working and have no  time  to

cook for the family.  I think the hygiene and cleanliness of the

food centres is very important.  But very often, we observe that

in the food centres, the stallholders would collect their plates

and  money,  and with a swipe of the cloth, push  all  the  food

remains on to the ground.  I think this is a very bad habit, and

their hygiene standard is still very unsatisfactory.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we could have a National Food Centre Cleanliness

Contest, where  the three cleanest food centres in Singapore  be

picked  and  awarded.   I think through this  effort,  we  could

encourage  the  stallholders  to pay  more  attention  to  their

hygiene   and  cleanliness,  and  thereby  creating   a   better

environment for our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, foreign workers. At present, in Singapore, we

have  a  few  hundred thousands of foreign workers in  Singapore

because  of  the  needs  in the construction  and  manufacturing

sectors.    We  have  foreign  workers  coming  from   Thailand,

Malaysia,   Philippines,  China  and  India.   They  came   from

different  cultural  backgrounds.  Perhaps they  have  different

habits and different standards of hygiene in their countries.  I

often see in some HDB worksites these foreign workers eating  at

the void decks of the nearby HDB flats, and leaving behind empty

containers and empty tins on the ground after they had  finished

eating.   They said the food leftovers were for the  stray  dogs

and  cats, and they love them.  This would certainly cause  some

health hazard to the residents there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that all contractors should take up the

responsibility of educating the foreign workers.   I  feel  that

this  is not the mistake of the workers themselves.  It is  just

the  habits that they have inherited from their own country.   I

think  we  should educate them in order to make them  understand

that  these old habits of theirs are not to be tolerated in  our

environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, junk mail. The Town Councils have employed

cleaners  to  clean up the common areas in our HDB estates,  and

the standard of cleanliness has generally improved.  However, we

still find that there are a lot of junk mails being thrown about

near  the letter boxes.  I have taken some photographs.  We  can

see that at noon time and at about 5.00 pm, the area at the lift

lobby  near the letter boxes was very clean. But by 6  pm,  that

area  was  heavily littered with a lot of junk mails, commercial

handbills and leaflets.  We have about 8,000 blocks of HDB flats

in Singapore.  If we want to clear up all these

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>

junk  mails from HDB flats, it would cost about $1 per block  of

flats.   So, we have to spend $8,000 a day, $240,000 a month  or

$2.88 million a year.  This is indeed a huge sum of money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps these companies which distribute or send out these

handbills and leaflets should go around the HDB estates and  see

for themselves how wasteful it is to send out all these leaflets

which  end  up  as litters on the floor.  Meanwhile,   the  Town

Councils  should   improve the design of the  letter  boxes.   I

sincerely  hope that if these companies want to advertise,  they

should do it through other means, rather than dumping all  these

leaflets  into the letter boxes of residents, causing a  lot  of

littering problems, and a lot of money to clean them up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as raised by Mr Heng Chiang Meng in Parliament

last  year,  we should look into the possibility of  authorising

members   of   the  public  to  help  enforce  the  regulations.

Recently,  I visited Gulangyu in the Fujian province.   On  this

island, there are no vehicles and it is a pollution free island.

When  I was there, I noticed that many senior citizens, who were

wearing  some red banners on their bodies, issuing summonses  to

anyone  who  littered,  and  even  collecting  fines  from   the

offenders on-the-spot.  I think this is a very effective way  of

controlling the environment.  On the one hand, we can  keep  the

senior  citizens and retirees occupied, and let them  earn  some

money for themselves, and on the other hand, they could take  up

the  responsibility to make sure that no one litters.  If anyone

should  litter, they are authorised to issue summonses to  these

people  and also to fine them on the spot.  I feel that this  is

more  effective than our present practice whereby a  summons  is

issued  and  the CWO executed a few months after an offence  has

been  committed.    I think the on-the-spot  fine  may  be  more

effective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister will consider my proposals.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, let me thank Mr Ang for his support

of the Amendment Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has made some very good suggestions. His point is that

whilst  enhanced  penalties are important, it  is  also  equally

important for us to educate the public, especially the students.

I  totally  agree with him.  In fact, that is what we have  been

doing  all along.  The schools have been very active in  passing

on the message to the students.  I see it in my daughters.  They

come  back with all kinds of messages.  I think the message does

sink in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the campaigns that we grew up with, like the Use Your

Hands  Campaign and all that, we can review them again.  I  will

ask  my  staff to contact their counterparts in the Ministry  of

Education  to see what else we can do to make that message  more

effective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to hawker centres, I share his concerns

too  about the cleanliness of hawker centres and hawker  stalls,

which  is  why we have come up with the grading system  for  the

individual  hawker  stalls.  But his idea of having  a  cleanest

food  centre  competition in order to encourage the entire  food

centre to be kept clean, I think, is a good suggestion.  I  will

ask  my staff to consider this as part of the programme for this

year's Clean and Green Campaign.  And we will get in touch  with

Mr Ang on his proposal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to foreign workers, yes, this is a matter of

concern  to  us as well.  I am glad to inform Mr  Ang  that,  in

fact,  we  have  been reaching out to the foreign  workers.   My

Ministry  publishes pamphlets in different languages,  in  Thai,

Filipino,  which  is  usually the  Tagalog  language.   We  have

pamphlets in the various languages and we distribute them at the

various  worksites as well.  Last year, we held  exhibitions  on

the environment at over 200 construction sites.  This will be  a

continuing  activity and we will try to get more contractors  to

come  on  board and work with us in educating the  workers  that

they have employed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to junk mail, yes, it is a common problem

throughout the whole of Singapore.  Like Mr Ang, I do  not  know

why the companies waste money printing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>

those leaflets which they know are going to be thrown away.  The

challenge is for the Town Councils to evolve a system which will

enable  the junk mail to be disposed by the residents in a  very

efficient  manner  without having to throw  them  all  over  the

floor.   I think some of the Town Councils have come up  with  a

very  good  idea  where they install a rubbish trough  right  in

front  of the letter boxes, so that when the residents take  out

the  mail and they find that it is junk mail, they just drop  it

down  into  the trough and therefore do not end up dirtying  the

whole void deck.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his last suggestion to empower senior citizens to

issue summonses and fines on the spot, I think it is a bit of  a

drastic  change  for us.  But I like his idea  of  getting  more

people  to be involved in this effort to deter littering and  to

educate  the  public.   I will ask my staff  to  work  with  the

People's  Association  to  see how we  can  get  the  grassroots

organisations  more involved in this process and, hopefully,  by

having  more eyes and more hands on the ground, we will be  able

to reduce this problem of littering in our housing estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill.  -  [Mr Yeo Cheow Tong].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;

read a Third time and passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.



<br>2.00 pm



<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Third time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members know, this Bill was referred to a Select

Committee.  The Report of the Select Committee was presented  to

the House on 19th April 1999.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee received 46 representations which

reflected  a  good cross section of views.  They  were  from  39

individuals,  one  management  corporation,  two  en  bloc  sale

committees and four organisations.  The four organisations  were

the Association of Property and Facility Managers, the School of

Building   and  Real  Estate  of  the  National  University   of

Singapore,  the  Law  Society of Singapore,  and  the  Singapore

Institute of Surveyors and Valuers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee, however, did not limit itself to the

views  put  forth by the representors but also considered  views

expressed  in this House during the Second Reading  debate.  The

Select  Committee  has accepted several useful  suggestions  and

incorporated them in the amended Bill which is before the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full explanations for the various amendments are set

out  in  the  Select Committee's Report.  Therefore,  I  do  not

intend  to repeat all that is extensively set out in the  Report

which Members would have read.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I propose to do is to highlight only some of the

changes  made  by the Select Committee as well as  some  of  the

issues considered by the Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the issue as to whether to vary the 90% / 80%

majority share value consent level.  The Committee heard diverse

and  sometimes diametrically opposing views on this issue.  Some

felt  that  90%  /  80% consent level should be  made  stricter.

Others  were  in favour of a more liberal, lower  level  consent

requirement, especially for older buildings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee has decided to keep the present

approach in the Bill, ie, the 90% consent level for developments

less  than 10 years and 80% for developments 10 years or  older.

Ultimately,  it  should be left to market forces and  conditions

which  will determine if an en-bloc sale is economically viable.

The  90%  /  80%  level  linked to  the  10  years  age  of  the

development was considered a reasonable criterion.  The  consent

level should be pegged to the age of the development as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>

it  is more likely that older developments will be sub-optimally

utilised and have higher repair bills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue concerns developments with 10 or fewer

units.  The Bill originally had excluded developments with 10 or

fewer units.  It was thought that it may not be possible in some

of  these cases to designate a clear 90% / 80% majority  because

of  the  small number of units in these developments, eg,  in  a

development with four units of equal shares, three  out  of  the

four owners would account for only 75% of the share values.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One representor proposed that the Minister or the Strata

Titles Board be empowered to decide on a case by case basis if a

development  could qualify for en-bloc sale.   Others  suggested

lowering  the consent level to 70% or allowing a sale  if  there

were  not  more  than one or two objecting unit owners  of  such

developments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee has decided to make a change so that

the  majority  owners of developments with  10  or  fewer  units

should also be able to apply to the Board provided they can meet

the  specified  consent  level  of  90%  /  80%.   However,  the

Committee  did  not  think  that this consent  level  should  be

lowered  as it would not be fair to the minority owners of  such

developments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these developments which have 10 or fewer units are

old or have large areas which are under-utilised, thus rendering

them suitable for redevelopment.  In fact, as at September 1998,

developments with 10 or fewer units account for nearly  half  of

all  strata  developments in Singapore.   Of  the  2,272  strata

developments which are freehold or close to 999 years,  47%  are

developments with 10 or fewer units.  These developments account

for  7% of the total number of units and about 80 hectares (10%)

of  the  land area.  Requiring unanimous decision will frustrate

en-bloc redevelopment of these developments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue concerns whether it should be the High Court

or the Strata

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>

Titles  Board  which  should hear objections,  and  whether  the

approach  and guidelines in the Bill for en bloc sale should  be

made  clearer  as well as expressly stated in the provisions  of

the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of MPs during the Second Reading debate as well as

some representors during the Select Committee hearings felt that

the  High Court and not the Strata Titles Board should hear  en-bloc  cases.   In the Select Committee hearings it became  clear

that  some  representors had taken this view because  they  felt

that  the general guidelines in the Bill were too broad or  gave

insufficient  guidance  on  how the Board  will  decide  on  the

objections  of the minority.  Some representors also  felt  that

even  if no objections are raised, the Board should in any  case

review the application to see if it should be approved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee felt that the Strata Titles Board and not the

Courts  would be the appropriate body to hear objections because

the objections would almost invariably be non-legal issues which

lend themselves more to mediation or counselling rather than  to

adjudication.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Committee agreed with the view expressed on the

need for greater clarity of the approach of the Board in dealing

with   objections.   The  Select  Committee  also  agreed   with

representors  on  the need to spell out in  greater  detail  the

factors  which  the Board will take into account.   Accordingly,

several important changes have been made:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, even where there is no objection, the Board must

review  every  application to the Board for  en  bloc  sale  and

satisfy  itself  that the transaction is in good  faith  and  at

arm's  length, taking into account the sale proceeds, the method

of  distributing the sale proceeds and the relationship  of  the

purchaser to any of the unit owners.  The Board must also ensure

that  the sale and purchase agreement does not compel a minority

owner to be part of a joint venture agreement with the developer

of  the  land.   This  will address concerns  expressed  on  the

safeguarding of the interests of the minority owners;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, where objections have been raised, the Board

will, where relevant, mediate.  Where mediation on objections of

a  personal or non-pecuniary nature fails, the Board cannot stop

the  sale  from  proceeding unless the Board is  satisfied,  for

example,  that the minority owner will suffer a loss,  that  is,

the  purchase price which he will receive is less than the price

he  paid  for his unit, including all allowable deductions;  the

purchase  price  also  which a minority owner  receives  is  not

sufficient  for  him to discharge a mortgage or  charge  on  his

unit;  the Board can also refuse if the minority owner is forced

to   be   part   of   a   joint  venture  agreement   with   the

purchaser/developer; or if the Board is satisfied that the  sale

is  not in good faith or at arm's length taking into account the

sale proceeds, method of distributing the sale proceeds and  the

relationship of the purchaser to any of the unit owners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deciding on a case, the Board will not impose its own

terms  and  conditions on the parties.  If the Board feels  that

the  price is too low or the method of distribution of the  sale

proceeds  is  not  equitable, it will order that  the  sale  not

proceed.  The majority owners must then address the issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me add that when the revised approach of the Board

as  I  have  outlined just now was clarified to the representors

who  spoke  on this issue, most of them agreed that  the  Board,

rather  than  the court, would be the more appropriate  body  to

mediate  and hear en bloc cases.  One representor felt that  the

Board  would  then  be  performing a  function  which  was  more

administrative than judicial.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue was the setting out in greater detail the

procedure  for service of notice on all the owners of units  and

other interested parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee has accepted the representors' views

that  the  procedure for giving notice to the owners  and  other

interested  parties should be made much clearer, as well  as  be

included in the Bill

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>

itself.  As a result, many changes have been made, including the

following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the requirement that there should be convened at least

one  general  meeting  to discuss the en bloc  sale  before  the

majority owners can apply to the Board;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) advertisement in all the four language newspapers;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) service of notice of the sale to all the owners, the

mortgagees  and  chargees  and  the  management  corporation  by

registered  post and by leaving a copy under the  main  door  of

every unit;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) affixing a copy of the notice to the door or gate of a

minority owner;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) affixing a copy of the notice to a conspicuous part of

each building in the development; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) filing a copy of the application to the Board with the

Registrar  of  Titles  and Deeds for notification  on  the  land

register.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue concerns the role of the Board with regard to

matters  of  compensation payable to the lessee  of  a  minority

owner's unit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of representors felt that the Board should decide

on the compensation payable to the lessee of a minority owner in

order  to expedite and facilitate an en bloc sale.  The minority

owner  may  be  unable to agree with his lessee on the  latter's

compensation.  The Committee agreed that the Board can determine

the  amount of compensation payable to the lessee of a  minority

owner  on  the latter's request.  The Board, however,  will  not

decide  on  the  compensation payable  to  the  lessees  of  the

majority  owners,  as the majority owners must  make  their  own

arrangements  with their lessees before they commit  to  the  en

bloc sale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One representor suggested that the Bill should stipulate

the  maximum  amount of compensation payable  to  obviate  cases

where   lessees   demand  an  unreasonable  compensation.    The

Committee felt that it is difficult now to decide on the maximum

compensation.  This is a matter on which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>

the  Board could formulate some guidelines when this issue first

arises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is a question on the composition of the Board to

enable it to deal with en-bloc sale cases.  A number of MPs  and

representors felt that the Board should have more panel  members

drawn  from a wider range of relevant occupation groups so  that

it  can  effectively perform its enlarged functions.   Sir,  the

Select Committee has amended the Bill in several ways:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to increase the number of members on the Board's panel

from a proposed 24 to a maximum of 30;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to appoint up to three Deputy Presidents instead of

the proposed two Deputy Presidents; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to give the President of the Board power, where

necessary, to appoint four instead of two panel members to  form

a  Board of five or three persons headed by the President  or  a

Deputy President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, Sir, let me say that the Select Committee

certainly benefited from the suggestions and views given by  the

representors,  some  of whom were experts  in  their  respective

fields.   I  believe that the changes which are now incorporated

in the Bill will improve the legislation and help it achieve its

objectives more effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

right of ownership of land in Singapore is no longer sacrosanct.

First,  we  have  the  Land Acquisition  Act  which  allows  the

Government  to compulsorily acquire land for general development

which, amongst other things, could mean that the Government  can

take your land and plant a few roadside trees on it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have the amendment to the Land Titles (Strata) Act

where under the law, the majority of subsidiary proprietors  can

vote  to sell the whole development.  It would appear that there

is no longer any

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>

permanency of residence in Singapore.  I wonder how this kind of

situation  squares  up with the call by the Government  to  make

Singapore a better home.  To me, a home is a place where you can

live  in  comfort for as long as you like, and not to be  tossed

out against your wishes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having spoken my feelings in regard to the amendments

in the Bill, I would like now to make some comments on it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read the Bill and agree that the minority subsidiary

proprietors'  interest must be protected.  There  should  be  no

conflict  of interest and of collusion in the en bloc  sale.   I

think  section  84A(1) is fair.  I agree that there  must  be  a

majority  of 90% or 80% share value consent level before  an  en

bloc  sale can be carried out for a building less than 10  years

old  and  more  than  10  years old respectively.   I  hope  the

Government shall stick to this majority of share values and  not

lower  the percentages to allow en-bloc sale.  It is right  that

the Strata Titles Board should not take an interventionist role.

In  this respect, I note that the issue of distribution  of  the

proceeds of sale is still largely unresolved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 84A(1) requires that there must be an in-principle

sale  and purchase agreement which specifies the proposed method

of  distribution  of the sale proceeds.  I  would  like  now  to

propose  that  the  compensation prices for each  unit  must  be

determined  by taking the average price of two valuation  prices

of  recognised  valuers.  Anyway, I note that when  there  is  a

dispute,  the  provisions in the Bill  require  the  parties  to

mediate and the Board has powers to call for a valuation report.

In  the  courts where there are disputes concerning the division

of  proceeds  of  sale  of properties, for example,  in  divorce

cases,  valuation reports are inevitably called for.  Presently,

I believe that the suggested way for the division of proceeds of

sale  is by the quantum of share values.  In my view, that  form

of  distribution  of  proceeds of sale by share  values  is  not

satisfactory.  The share value pegged to a unit or flat is  tied

to  the  land  which the block or blocks of flats or  shops  are

built.  Theoretically, should the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>

building be destroyed, each of the subsidiary proprietors  would

still  own  a  portion of the land proportionate  to  his  share

value.   The  share value of each flat or unit is  not  directly

linked  to  the  market  value of  the  flat.   Each  subsidiary

proprietor  should be compensated based upon the open  value  of

his  property.   The worth of a residential unit compared  to  a

similar size flat, in my view, should be on the open market sale

and  amongst  the  factors by which it is  determined,  ie,  its

position, the view it commands, whether it is sited in a  sunset

position,  and so forth.  As for a commercial unit of a  similar

size,  its commercial worth depends largely on where it is sited

in  the  building.  A shop that is placed at the road  front  is

certainly  worth more than one which is tucked away  in  a  fine

corner of a building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the amendment already gives power to the Board to

call  for a valuation report under section 84A(4), why not  make

it   mandatory  for  the  parties  to  decide  on  the  mode  of

distribution and incorporate it into the in-principle  sale  and

purchase  agreement?  The mode of distribution can be  based  on

the average price of two valuation reports aforesaid.  This will

stop  any  dispute  right  from  the  start  on  the  issue   of

distribution,  thus saving cost and time.  I hope  the  Minister

would consider this proposal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was pointed out to me that under the Fourth Schedule,

subsidiary proprietors can only take a vote for en-bloc sale  in

an  extraordinary meeting.  Would the Minister consider amending

clause  1(a)  in  the Fourth Schedule to include Annual  General

Meeting.   If  that amendment is made, the first  line  of  that

clause 1(a) would then read, "consider the collective sale at an

annual   general  meeting  or  extraordinary  meeting  held   in

accordance with the Act".  I hope the Minister has no  objection

to this proposal because sometimes it is difficult to convene an

EOGM.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me

this  opportunity.   Sir, may I declare my  interest.   I  am  a

member of the Strata Titles Board.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Select Committee received 46 representations. The

Minister  has  given  the  breakdown.   They  were  very  useful

representations and I am glad that the Government has sent  this

Bill  to a Select Committee.  The public input has improved  and

the  Committee has agreed to many changes which the Minister has

dealt with. These changes are to be welcomed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my only concern is that all the 46 representors who

wrote  to the Select Committee were in the English Language.   I

think  a  message  could be sent to the public  at  large  that,

despite  the  advertisements in the newspapers,  representations

have  not  been made in any of the four languages.  It would  be

useful  for  non-English  educated Singaporeans  to  give  their

input.  I am glad that the Minister has agreed to go beyond  the

practice of the High Court where the advertisement only  appears

in two languages.  We have advertisements in four languages.   I

welcome this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a proposal for the Minister. The Board members

are going to be increased from 24 to 30.  Since we are going  to

deal  largely  with the value of the property, may  I  urge  the

Minister  to consider appointing more valuers and some community

leaders  to  this panel.  I am also glad that from two,  we  are

going to have four and effectively, we either have three or five

members.   The  discretion  lies with the  President  or  Deputy

President.  This is most welcomed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My learned friend, Mr Chiam, spoke about the sanctity of

land.   I  beg to differ.  My philosophy has been that,  had  we

stuck  to  the old English concept, Singapore could  never  have

made  progress.   We are a country of limited land  size.   But,

nevertheless, we must see that our laws are framed in such a way

that  the  individual rights are protected when  a  property  is

acquired.  In this particular case, no property is going  to  be

acquired.  The owners themselves are going to agree or  disagree

whether they are going to have the proposed development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other important factor which the House is aware is

the mediatory role of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>

the  Board.   I  can assure the House that, since I  joined  the

Board,  I  have seen more often than not the cases are  resolved

through mediation.  And I am glad that the Select Committee  has

decided  to  have the Strata Titles Board instead  of  the  High

Court.   It  would be cheaper and it would also not  strain  the

resources of the High Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill has also specified the role of

the  Board.  Hence, it would be easier for the Board  to  follow

certain  guidelines  that have been laid.   The  Board  will  of

course  have to see the value of the property.  The  Board  will

also  see  that  the sale is at arm's length.  It  is  fair  and

equitable  as it is specified in paragraph 47 of the  Report  by

the Select Committee.  The Board will review a case "(regardless

of  whether there is an objection) to see whether on the face of

the  application it is satisfied that the transaction is in good

faith  and at arm's length, after taking into account  the  sale

proceeds,  method  of  distributing the sale  proceeds  and  the

relationship of purchaser to any of the owners."  This is a very

important safeguard which the Bill has introduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge the Minister to consider, when appointing

the  members,  as I have said earlier, that there is  a  broader

representation  so  that  public  confidence  would  always   be

maintained.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I spoke on the Bill at the Second

Reading  and  expressed  concerns in  four  areas.   First,  the

question  of  public  interest as  opposed  to  private  profit.

Second,  the different balance between private property and  the

idea  of communal property or communal living, which is a phrase

used by the Minister of State in the Second Reading.  Third, the

safeguards in the Bill, as it was then.  Fourth, it leaves these

safeguards to the Strata Titles Board, rather than the court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not repeat these points I have made previously. I

shall  attempt  to  look at the recommendations  of  the  Select

Committee.  Some of the concerns that I have expressed and other

MPs  have expressed have been addressed by the Select Committee.

They have gone

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>

through  a  lot  of  work  and I think they  have  put  in  more

safeguards.  This should be acknowledged and people should  feel

slightly more assured.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still, Sir, I think there are some concerns to be

raised.   In raising these concerns, I am particularly conscious

of  the fact that at the same sitting when we are debating  this

Bill, we will also debate the Singapore 21 Report and the motion

that this House endorses the vision of Singapore 21 as the basis

for  strengthening the heartware of Singapore.  I  mention  this

because  Singapore  21  asks  us to consider  the  heartware  of

Singapore  and, as part of the heartware, to make Singapore  our

home, our best home.  Singapore 21 also asks us to consider that

every  Singaporean matters.  We will of course have occasion  to

discuss  the  Singapore 21 Report and the motion in full  later.

But it is evident to me at least that some of these ideas may be

in tension with some of the ideas in the present Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Sir, let me clarify that I recognise the difference

between public good and the importance that public good must  be

placed  over private good.  But I want to distinguish the public

good  from  the  present Bill.  Public good,  Sir,  that  people

understand, and I think the Member for Potong Pasir,  Mr  Chiam,

alluded  to, is highways, infrastructure, public facilities  for

the  whole populace.  Public good is also having Singapore  with

no slums.  But, Sir, while the Bill may indirectly give a higher

density  and  utilisation of land, the  primary  driving  factor

behind  this  Bill will not be public good in the sense  I  have

defined  it,  but  rather,  private profit.   And  that  is  the

essential  starting point in recognising the difference  between

the  Land Acquisition Act, which Mr Chiam referred to,  and  the

present  Bill.   Under the Land Acquisition Act,  I  think  most

Singaporeans accept that if a house has to be taken  from  them,

or  part of a garden has to be taken from them for public  good,

they will accept.  This Bill, however, is different.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first idea is Singapore as home. Sir, I have to ask:

does it strengthen the idea of Singapore as home if we can point

not to the city skyline as a whole or to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>

Padang  in  the  heart of city, but to our own individual  home?

Does  it strengthen our commitment to Singapore when we  can  do

that?   I believe it does.  Consequently, Sir, I must also  ask:

does  it  weaken the idea of Singapore as home if, as this  Bill

allows, other people can force us to sell our homes against  our

choice?  Sir, I am particularly disturbed by paragraph 17 of the

Report  by  the  Select Committee.  Perhaps, the  Committee  was

concerned more about legal rules and the definition of the work,

as  much of the Committee's Report makes it clear that they were

not  aimed  at  dealing with the major principles of  the  Bill,

rather the greater details.  But paragraph 17 says that it  does

not  recognise the difference between owner-occupiers and  those

who hold property as investment.  That is to say, it refuses  to

see  the difference between people who see their houses as homes

and  people  who  see  their houses as cash  earning  profit  or

holding its value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take the idea of Singapore as home seriously, I think

that  while  legal matters must of course be legal  matters,  we

must  increasingly take these non-legal, non-economic  but  very

real  issues  into consideration.  And I would  urge  that  this

House  considers  this when we think about the  impact  of  this

Bill.   The  other element I mentioned of  -  that Singapore  21

may  be  in  tension with the present Bill  -  is the idea  that

every Singaporean matters.  Normally the majority should prevail

but  an  individual  or a minority must have certain  rights  or

place  under  the  sun which cannot be taken from  them  by  the

majority.  Is private property one of these rights?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I must clarify that condominium living is

not  communal  living.   As  pointed  out  in  the  Report  very

carefully, one part of condominium living is communal, one  part

is  common property, ie, the share value that accumulates to the

condominium in terms of the carpark, the facilities, the  common

areas.  But another part is completely private, and this is  the

actual delineated airspace or ground space that belongs to  that

one owner, that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>

is,  the person's home.  No one can come through the door unless

that  person says, "Yes, you can come in."  This is not, in that

sense,  like  communal property.  This is private  property  and

when  we  change  this  law, we change the  meaning  of  private

property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been made of the so-called oppression of the

minority, both in the Report and in the Second Reading.  I agree

with this.  No single person or small number should frustrate  a

basically  good  deal  for no good reasons.   However,  I  would

caution  that this should not be overstated.  No one is  stopped

from  selling  his house under the existing law.  The  right  to

buy,  sell  and alienate is preserved.  What is stopped  by  the

present  law is that one cannot do an en-bloc sale.  I can  sell

my  house,  but  I  cannot  sell my house  in  conjunction  with

everyone else, including those who did not wish to sell.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are moving then to a different balance. This must be

recognised.   And  I am not saying this balance  is  necessarily

wrong, though I think it is. Others may disagree, but the Select

Committee  has done a good job in bringing together  people  who

disagree with the Bill as well as agree.  I am not the person to

tell  the whole of Singapore what the balance should be.  But  I

wish that, with the passage of this Bill, people do see that  we

are  moving  to a different balance and that brings  me  to  the

question of safeguards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report installs profit as the safeguard and the Strata

Titles Board (STB) as the guardian.  This is a step forward.  In

the  original Bill, there was no question of this.  Now, we have

the  safeguard that where there is no profit or only  an  actual

loss,  then  the deal will not go through.  Bur we have  to  ask

ourselves:  is this still sufficient?  What if there is  only  a

marginal  profit?  Among the papers that were submitted  to  the

Select Committee, some spoke of very high profits, 30%-50%.  But

it  is  possible since prices have come off, that  people  might

make 5% or 1% if they had bought at the top of the market.  What

of  them, as compared to the neighbours who have made much more?

Will there be equity in this sense between those who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>

have  bought  at  different prices?  Is there even  transparency

when  I purchase a house, to know how much my neighbour has paid

for it?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the non-monetary but real factors must be borne

in mind - location, closest to family, cost of moving, condition

of  the  house,  whether  you have  paid  a  lot  of  money  for

renovation.  All these, as far as I understand from  the  Report

of  the Select Committee, are still not taken into account.  Let

me  then  paint a concrete but hypothetical picture and ask  the

Minister for clarification.  If I see a widow in her 60s or  70s

living now alone in a flat, it is a familiar neighbourhood, near

her  family, the sale may proceed but it gives her only a  small

profit,  can  the existing safeguards save this widow  from  the

inconvenience  of  having  to move  at  an  old  age?   Can  the

guardian,  the  Strata Titles Board, save this  widow  from  her

situation?  I would like the Minister to explain this to us.  As

far as I see it, it cannot.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the safeguard as regards the developer's blocking

vote.   Many  of  the papers focus on the issue  of  developers'

practice,  ie,  some of them retain units or  transfer  them  to

their  own holding companies.  Then they have a sizeable  block,

that  given the requirements of 80% or 90% agreement,  they  can

either frustrate the deal or try to push the deal, so it goes to

them  to  redevelop.   If I could ask the  Minister  to  explain

whether   this  question  has  been  addressed  by  the   Select

Committee.   It  seems to me that we cannot take care,  I  agree

with the Minister here, of every situation in writing this Bill.

But  we can provide general guidelines, general principles,  and

entrust this to a particular person to administer case by case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing law, this is entrusted to the Courts

under general principles of equity.  The Bill seems to me to  be

different.   It seems to be empowering a different  person,  the

Strata  Titles Board, and telling it not to look at  these  non-economic  but  sometimes very real matters.  I would  have  been

much more comfortable with the Bill if the Select

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>

Committee  had  recommended even simple wordings  such  as,  "to

consider  extenuating  circumstance  of  families  and  of   the

elderly",  and to look at individual cases in this light.   With

this, may I ask the Minister's clarifications.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I thank the three speakers for their

comments  on  the  Bill.  Both Mr Chiam and Mr Simon  Tay  began

their  speeches by restating their positions during  the  Second

Reading  of  the  Bill  about  the sanctity  of  the  home,  the

importance of property ownership and so on.  I have two ways  of

dealing  with  it.  One is to go again into all the explanations

and justifications which had been made by the Minister of State,

Assoc.  Prof. Ho Peng Kee.  But that is not the purpose  of  the

Third  Reading.  The purpose of the Third Reading is  really  to

examine  the  changes which had been recommended by  the  Select

Committee  and  not  to have another full-scale  debate  on  the

issues  or questions of principle which had been fully canvassed

and  debated in the Second Reading.  Much as I am tempted to  go

into  details on the points raised by Mr Chiam and Mr Simon Tay,

I  will not go into them except to recapitulate the points which

had been very cogently put forward by my colleague, the Minister

of State.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point is that, for those who oppose the very

principle  of the Bill  -  and the principle of the Bill  is  to

change  the  law to move away from unanimous requirement   -   I

recognise they have their reasons to do so.  If you oppose  that

basic principle, then of course, you must oppose the rest of the

Bill.   But  if  you agree with the fundamental  principle  that

unanimous  requirement should be changed to something less  than

unanimous, then you have to deal with a host of questions.  What

should  be  the majority consent level, if it is not  unanimous?

Should  it  be  pegged to the age of the development,  and  what

should  be  the  age of the development?  How do you  deal  with

objections,  financial  and  pecuniary,  as  well  as  emotional

objections?  What should be the institutional mechanism to  deal

with this?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, as amended by the Select Committee, addresses

these  issues  consequent to the principle  to  move  away  from

unanimous requirement.  We can have a divergence of views on all

these consequential matters because it will not be honest for me

to  say  that there is a perfect or correct answer  to  each  of

these  solutions.   It  calls  for  a  judgement.   Government's

response, as now modified by the Select Committee, is to  arrive

at  what we think is a reasonable and practical approach to work

out this regime for facilitating en-bloc sales.  It is really  a

facilitating  process.   It need not be the  Government  or  the

Strata Titles Board directing or instructing that such and  such

a  development should now proceed with en-bloc sale.  The regime

is  really  to  leave it as much as possible  to  those  in  the

development to decide for themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have this key feature, ie, 90%/80% consent

requirement pegged to the age of the building, ie, 10  years  or

less  and  10  years  or  more, coupled with  the  institutional

mechanism of the Strata Titles Board rather than the Courts  for

the  reasons which are spelt out in the Bill.  And the  role  of

the  Strata  Titles  Board is, again, that of  facilitating  the

process,  as  an avenue for mediating when there are  objections

and  the  situation and the type of objections are imponderable.

Some  examples were given but those are not the only ones.   The

Board  will be taking a non-interventionist approach but  we  do

spell out a few of the categories where the Board expresses  its

disapproval.  But apart from that, the Board will really take  a

mediating role.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you read the Select Committee's Report, the papers which

had  been presented and the discussions which the Committee  had

with  many of the representors, it will be evident that this  is

not  a clear-cut issue of the majority imposing its will on  the

minority.  We have a very good illustration which was brought to

the  attention  of  the  Committee where  actually  it  was  the

unreasonableness of the minority.  You had an en-bloc sale which

was frustrated by a couple who were

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>

divorcing  and  each  party to the divorce  wanted  to  get  the

maximum out of the proposal of the en-bloc sale and the majority

of  the committee decided to overcome this by coughing out  from

their  own pockets to meet the demands of one of the parties  to

the  divorce.  So it is not so clear-cut that this is  really  a

minority being run roughshod by a majority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have a point made in the Second Reading and

repeated  now,  about this question of the home, the  heartware,

Singapore  21  and  so  on.  We pointed out  during  the  Second

Reading that you have to distinguish between landed property and

the  concept of strata title development.  Mr Simon Tay referred

to actual delineated ground space.  In strata title, there is no

delineation of the subsidiary proprietor's identifiable plot  of

land.   There  is no such thing.  You have, in common  with  the

other subsidiary proprietors, a certain share value of the  land

area as well as a share value of all the common properties,  and

when  we  talk about common properties, it covers a whole  range

from  carparks, the pool, the garden, lifts, corridors, external

walls,  columns,  roads, drainage, sewerage and  gas  pipes  and

electric  cables  serving  the  development.   So  there  is   a

distinction.  When we talk about strata titles, the  concept  is

different.   You  are having an identifiable airspace  but  with

respect  to  land and other common properties, you  have  common

ownership  together with the rest of the subsidiary  proprietors

according to the share values.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if you read the Select Committee's Report, many

of the representors agreed with me, in fact, all agreed with me,

when  I  put  it to them that, in the end, it is a  question  of

balance.   The minority can say he has a right not  to  alienate

but  the majority also has a right to alienate.  So, how do  you

balance  these  two?  I think Mr Simon Tay  wants  to  take  the

floor.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Thank you, Mr Minister. You said that the

minority  has the right not to alienate, but the majority  wants

the  right  to alienate.  They still have the right to alienate,

but they must only alienate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>

their  own  property, their own share value.  They never  had  a

right to alienate theirs and their neighbour's property.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, if you look at the existing scheme,

under  section  78,  it  is possible for an  applicant  or  some

applicants to go to the court and get a court order even  though

you  do  not have 100% consent to achieve exactly what the  Bill

achieves,  except that the Bill now provides a more facilitating

method  of achieving this result.  So it is not a question  that

it  was  impossible  for  a subsidiary proprietor  or  group  of

subsidiary  proprietors where there is no unanimous consent  not

to  have en-bloc sale.  It is possible.  What we are doing  here

is  to recognise the frustrations and difficulties, to recognise

in  land  scarce Singapore, this will enable optimum utilisation

of  land.   Is it or is it not desirable to make this move?   So

that is the fundamental question which has been addressed in the

Second Reading debate.  The Third Reading here is to discuss the

improvements which have been made by the Select Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mr Chiam said that he agrees with the approach

where the Strata Titles Board will pay attention to factors such

as  is  there collusion, is there conflict of interest?  And  he

therefore  is in agreement with that approach.  He  also  agrees

with the approach of not taking an interventionist approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His main point was about the distribution of proceeds, and

here  we have a difference of views.  Mr Chiam's approach  would

be, first, for the Board itself to decide on the distribution of

proceeds.   Secondly, in conferring the power to  the  Board  to

decide, he also has a proposal which is that it should not be by

share values, but by open market value, take the average of  two

valuation reports.  I say we have a difference of views, because

the  Government's approach as well as the approach taken by  the

Select  Committee is that it is best to leave it to the  parties

to come up with their own arrangements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we take that approach? Because the factors that

will have to be taken into account can be very diverse, and Mr

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>

Simon  Tay  has alluded to that.  If you read the  Report,  some

even  talk  about customs, superstitions, feng shui and  so  on.

How  does one quantify this at the level of Strata Titles  Board

or  by  the courts, if it were to go to the courts?  Then  there

are  emotional factors.  There was this problem of  a  divorcing

couple.  How do we have objective criteria to work this  into  a

decision?  So, it is best to leave it to the proponents  of  the

en-bloc sale to negotiate and try their best to accommodate  the

objections  of the minority, and the objections of the  minority

can  be  based  on  numerous pecuniary as well as  non-pecuniary

matters.  Mr Simon Tay pointed out that there may be a  case  of

someone who recently bought the flat and spent a lot of money in

renovations.   So  it can be quite a complicated  business.   It

might  be  best  to leave it to the parties to come  up  with  a

proposal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the methods of distribution of proceeds and whether

they  are  fair or not, his point that the Strata  Titles  Board

ought to take into cognizance his suggestion, I think they  will

do  so.  But please bear in mind that the Board is not going  to

impose its terms and conditions.  It will really leave it to the

proponents of the application for en-bloc sale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam's other point was to change the Fourth Schedule so

that instead of an Extraordinary General Meeting (EOGM), it  can

be  an Annual General Meeting.  Let me explain why we have  made

an amendment to provide for Extraordinary General Meeting.  This

was  a  change  made by the Select Committee after hearing  many

representors.  The concern of the representors was  that  if  we

did  not  have a general meeting  -  let us leave aside for  the

moment  Extraordinary General Meeting or Annual General  Meeting

-   they  felt  that  individual owners can  be  pressurised  by

various  kinds  of  representations.   So  the  thrust  of  this

amendment  is transparency.  Have a general meeting.   The  next

question is: why Extraordinary General Meeting?  I think  it  is

better  to have an Extraordinary General Meeting so that it  can

be  a  special meeting.  There can be no doubt in anyone's  mind

that it is called for a special purpose.  To have an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>

en-bloc sale proposal is indeed a very significant step.  So  it

should be delinked from the Annual General Meeting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken note of his point that it is very difficult to

convene an EOGM, but perhaps that itself may be a good reason to

have  an  EOGM, because, do not forget, to have  a  90%  or  80%

requirement  is not going to be easy in any case.   So  I  would

commend keeping the Extraordinary General Meeting requirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai made some suggestions as to the future

composition  of  the  Strata  Titles  Board.   In  view  of  the

amendments for its enlargement, whether we could draw in  people

from other professions and community leaders.  I shall give this

some  thought in consultation with the President of  the  Strata

Titles Board whose views will have to be solicited.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with a specific point that Mr Simon Tay raised.

He  talked  about paragraph 17 of the Report.  I  think  he  has

missed  the  point.  This should not be read  as  the  Committee

disregarding primacy over home ownership as opposed to those who

are not having the unit for their home.  Basically, paragraph 17

dealt with the proposal by some who argued that when calculating

the  voting rights, a higher weightage be given to those  owners

who  are living in their own homes.  The first problem that  the

Select Committee had with that is you immediately would have  an

inconsistency  with  the whole structure of  the  Strata  Titles

Board where for all other matters concerning maintenance, funds,

sinking funds, decisions on whether you are going to spend  half

a  million dollars on repairing the swimming pool or putting  in

new  lifts,  all those decisions are based on share values,  and

not  whether  you  are  staying there or  not.   So  the  Select

Committee decided it is better to keep to that basic approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, you may not be living there, but why should you

have  a  lesser voting right on such important decisions than  a

person who is living there?  So what if you

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>

have rented it out?  You might have allowed your son or daughter-in-law to stay there.  So should you have a lesser voting right?

I  think  Mr Simon Tay has completely missed the thrust of  that

paragraph.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his point that individuals must have rights, I have

already  alluded to it.  This Bill is about balancing of rights,

balancing the interest of the minority whose viewpoint is to  be

safeguarded,  who  feel  that  they  should  not  be  forced  to

alienate,  as  well as the interest of the majority  who  cannot

understand why their interest to alienate should be frustrated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to his final point about emotional factors, the

approach  taken by the Board is not to adjudicate and decide  on

these matters.  We should leave it to the parties, whether it is

the  emotional aspect of an elderly lady or widow or some  other

emotional  aspects.   These  cases  are  so  numerous   and   so

imponderable that it will not be possible for the Strata  Titles

Board  to  decide on.  But it can mediate, it can recommend,  it

can  suggest.  But in the end, it should be a decision  left  to

the parties to decide.  Whether individuals or developers own  a

large chunk of the voting rights, if they own 25%-30%, then,  of

course, they may meet the requirements of the Bill, and then the

ingredients for en-bloc sale will proceed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have answered most of the questions, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>TREASURY BILLS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 3(1) of

the   Local  Treasury  Bills  Act  (Chapter  167,  1988  Revised

Edition),  resolves that the Minister for Finance be  authorised

to  borrow,  by  the  issue of Treasury Bills  in  Singapore,  a

revolving  sum not exceeding fifteen thousand million  Singapore

dollars (S$15,000,000,000).

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 25th May 1995, Parliament resolved, in accordance

with  section  3 of the Local Treasury Bills Act (Chapter  167),

that  the  Minister be authorised to borrow,  by  the  issue  of

Treasury  bills  in  Singapore, a  sum  not  exceeding  S$10,000

million.  This limit is applicable to the outstanding amount  of

Treasury bills.  As of 1st April 1999, the outstanding amount of

Treasury bills issued is S$8,940 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need for the current limit to be raised. More

Treasury  bills need to be issued to meet market demand  and  to

mop  up excess liquidity in the banking system, where necessary.

The  Monetary Authority of Singapore will be gradually  stepping

up  Treasury  bill issues to support capital market  development

efforts.   With the proposed increase in Treasury bill issuance,

the annual debt servicing cost on outstanding Treasury bills  is

expected  to  increase  from  about  S$200  million  per   annum

currently,  to  about S$260 million per annum  in  FY2003.   The

earnings  from  foreign reserves acquired,  when  the  S$  funds

withdrawn through issue of Treasury bills are recycled  back  to

the market, are expected to more than offset this interest cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed, therefore, that the current ceiling for

borrowing  by Treasury bills of S$10,000 million, be  raised  by

another S$5,000 million to a total of S$15,000 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament is requested to enable the Government to issue

the  Treasury Bills up to a total amount not exceeding  S$15,000

million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 3(1) of

the   Local  Treasury  Bills  Act  (Chapter  167,  1988  Revised

Edition),  resolves that the Minister for Finance be  authorised

to  borrow,  by  the  issue of Treasury Bills  in  Singapore,  a

revolving  sum not exceeding fifteen thousand million  Singapore

dollars (S$15,000,000,000).

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT SECURITIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Section 11(1) of

the  Government  Securities  Act  (Chapter  121A,  1993  Revised

Edition),  resolves that the Minister for Finance be  authorised

to borrow, by the issue of Government Securities in Singapore, a

further  sum  not  exceeding  one hundred  and  twenty  thousand

million Singapore dollars (S$120,000,000,000), thereby in  total

a  sum  not  exceeding two hundred and twenty  thousand  million

Singapore dollars (S$220,000,000,000).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 19th March 1992, Parliament resolved, in accordance

with  section 11(1) of the Government Securities Act 1992,  that

the Minister be authorised to borrow, by the issue of Government

securities in Singapore, a sum not exceeding S$100,000  million.

Presently,   there  remains  only  about  S$2,100   million   of

Government securities left unissued.  The Monetary Authority  of

Singapore expects to exhaust that remaining amount in  the  next

few months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that S$120,000 million in Singapore

Government securities would have to be issued over the next five

to  eight  years.   The  proposed higher limit  for  issuing  of

Government securities is part of an overall strategy to  develop

the Singapore Government Securities (SGS) market as a foundation

for the growth of Singapore's capital market, and to realise our

vision  of becoming a leading international debt hub in Asia  by

FY 2003.  An estimated 65% or S$78,000 million of the Government

securities  will be issued to the CPF Board.  The remaining  35%

or  S$42,000 million of Government securities will be issued  to

enable  financial institutions such as banks, finance  companies

and  insurance companies to meet requirements for liquid assets,

and  to  meet  the  demand  from  financial  institutions,  fund

managers and others for investment purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The planned increase in supply of Singapore Government

securities  over the next five years or more will  increase  the

availability of Singapore Government bonds to add liquidity  and

depth to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>

market,  and help to establish a benchmark Singapore  Government

bond  yield  curve  for the pricing of other  bond  and  capital

market  instruments.  A more vibrant capital market in Singapore

with  a  larger  pool  of fixed income origination  and  trading

skills, diversity of borrowers and a broader investor base, will

enhance Singapore's status as a financial centre.  There will be

spin-off  benefits through increased activities in  the  foreign

exchange, swap, repurchase and derivative markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increase in issues of Singapore Government

securities  to  both the general market and  CPF  Board,  it  is

estimated  that  the annual debt servicing costs on  outstanding

Singapore  Government  bonds will increase  from  about  S$3,000

million per year currently, to about S$5,300 million per year in

FY  2003.  However, the earnings from foreign reserves acquired,

when   the  S$  funds  withdrawn  through  issue  of  Government

securities are recycled back to the market, are expected to more

than offset this interest cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authority of Parliament is therefore sought to raise

the  ceiling  for  borrowing through  the  issue  of  Government

securities  by  a  further sum of S$120,000 million.  This  will

increase  the  ceiling from the current S$100,000 million  to  a

total  of S$220,000 million.  This ceiling is applicable to  the

cumulative total of all Government securities issued, regardless

of whether they have been redeemed or are still outstanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with Section 11(1) of

the  Government  Securities  Act  (Chapter  121A,  1993  Revised

Edition),  resolves that the Minister for Finance be  authorised

to borrow, by the issue of Government Securities in Singapore, a

further  sum  not  exceeding  one hundred  and  twenty  thousand

million Singapore dollars (S$120,000,000,000), thereby in  total

a  sum  not  exceeding two hundred and twenty  thousand  million

Singapore dollars (S$220,000,000,000).

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House endorses the Vision for Singapore in the

21st  century  as  set  out in the report of  the  Singapore  21

Committee  "Singapore  21: Together,  We  Make  The  Difference"

contained   in  Paper  Misc  2  of  1999,  as  the   basis   for

strengthening  the  heartware  of  Singapore  and  meeting   the

aspirations of Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before proceeding further, I would like to

acknowledge  ten Members of this House who were members  of  the

Singapore  21 Committee, and thank them for their contributions.

They  are Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, Mr Ahmad Magad, Mr Chan Soo Sen,  Dr

Yaacob  Ibrahim, Mr David Lim, Mr Seng Han Thong,  Dr  Lee  Tsao

Yuan, Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr Lim Swee Say and Mr Simon Tay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to thank various other Members of this

and  participating in forums, and sending in their views to  the

Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister launched the Singapore 21

Committee  in  August  1997.  Its task:  to  strengthen  the

heartware of Singapore and to develop a consensus on the kind of

society  which Singaporeans want for the future.  The  Singapore 21

Committee has completed its work and released its report  on 24th

April 1999.  Copies of the report have been circulated  to

Members of this House.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>The Need For A New Vision</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are standing at the threshold of a new millennium, one

which  will be characterised by change and uncertainty.   Beyond

the  formidable  task  of  competing  in  the  global  knowledge

economy,  there  will be challenges on many other  fronts.   The

pervasiveness of the Internet and the growing mobility of people

will  bring  a  global elite closer together,  but  threaten  to

increase  the  gap separating them from those within  their  own

societies  who  are less able to cope with these changes.   This

could lead to social tension.  And those who think that conflict

is  a  thing of the past, need only look at Kosovo today  to  be

reminded of the possible dangers.  Singapore will not be  spared

from these challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a world, political stability, social cohesion, and

the  values  and commitment of our people will be  of  paramount

importance.  Together, they make up the "heartware"  which  will

determine if we can meet the challenges ahead - whether  we  can

muster our people to defend the country, whether we can mobilise

our businessmen and workers to meet economic challenges, whether

we  can  encourage  our  people to take  care  of  one  another.

Heartware  will determine our national resilience in a  changing

world.   It will determine the tone of our communities  and  the

quality of every Singaporean's life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we build the heartware? Singapore is changing. By

the  year  2030, one in four Singaporeans will be  aged  60  and

above.   Their commitment and hard work built modern  Singapore.

Their  collective needs and concerns in their golden years  will

have  a significant impact on the Singapore of the future.   The

young will be better educated, more informed and well travelled.

They  will  be more independent and inquiring.  They  will  also

want  a  bigger  role in shaping the things  that  affect  their

lives.   To build the heartware, we will have to develop  a  new

vision  for Singapore, based on the aspirations of Singaporeans,

and  the society that they want for the future.  A vision, which

will  take  into account, our material, intellectual, emotional,

and social needs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>The Making of Singapore 21</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past one and a half years, the Singapore 21

Committee, and its five subject committees, consulted some 6,000

Singaporeans through seminars, focus group discussions, surveys,

e-mail  and other exchanges.  These Singaporeans come  from  all

walks  of  life.  They include teachers, students,  businessmen,

professionals,  workers,  volunteers in  welfare  organisations,

community  leaders  and many others.  The  discussions  revolved

around the challenges that Singaporeans will face and the dreams

that  they have as individuals, families, communities and  as  a

nation.   To  facilitate  discussion and  emphasise  that  tough

choices  may have to be made, the challenges were structured  as

five apparent dilemmas.  And these were:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) A Less Stressful Life vs Retaining the Drive;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The Needs of Senior Citizens vs Aspirations of the

Young;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Attracting Talent vs Looking After Singaporeans;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Internationalisation/Regionalisation vs Singapore as

Home; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Consultation and Consensus vs Decisiveness and Quick

Action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the discussions, and the many internal deliberations,

the  Singapore 21 Committee has identified five key ideas, which

together  form  the  Singapore  21  vision.   These  five  ideas

represent  what Singaporeans collectively desire for the  future

of Singapore. Let me go through each of the ideas briefly.

<br><br><i>Five Key Ideas</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Every Singaporean Matters. The Singapore of the

future  must  be  one  where  people  matter  not  only  in  the

collective  sense,  but  also at the  individual  level.   Every

Singaporean  is important.  Every Singaporean has a contribution

to make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the individual level, Singaporeans must set their own

goals  and strive to be the best that they can be.  They  should

also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>

embrace  the spirit of lifelong learning.  At the community  and

societal  level,  the definition of success  should  be  widened

beyond  academic and material achievements.  Anyone  trying  his

best  and  contributing to the nation, whether in  traditionally

recognised fields such as business, medicine and law,  or  other

areas  like  sports,  entertainment  and  the  arts  should   be

applauded and encouraged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second idea is Strong Families as Our Foundation and

Our Future.  The family has been the cornerstone of our society.

Strong  families  have enabled our children  to  grow  up  in  a

nurturing  environment and ensured that  the  elderly  are  well

looked  after and enjoy dignity and respect.  It is through  the

family  that  values are passed on from one  generation  to  the

next.  It is within the warm embrace of strong families that the

needs  and  aspirations  of  both the  young  and  the  old  are

fulfilled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore 21 survey has shown that Singapore families

are  generally  sound.  However, they are also under  increasing

stress.   Families are getting smaller.  The number  of  working

adults  per  elderly person is shrinking.  In most  cases,  both

parents  have  demanding jobs and have  little  time  for  their

children.  What should we do?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The correct response lies not in transferring the family's

role  to  another institution, but in strengthening  the  family

unit  itself.  At the individual level, Singaporeans  must  take

time  to  nurture  their own families.   At  the  community  and

national  levels,  support must be provided  for  families.   If

priorities have to be re-assessed and some sacrifices made, they

should be done.  As we prepare to meet the challenges ahead, the

family  unit will be an integral part of the solution.   It  is,

and must remain, the fundamental building block of our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third component of the Singapore 21 vision is

Opportunities  for  All.  The vision is for Singapore  to  be  a

place of opportunity for all, both Singaporeans

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>

and  foreigners; a cosmopolitan city where people come  together

and  spark  new  ideas and opportunities; at the  same  time,  a

country  committed to helping its citizens realise their fullest

potential;  and a spirited society, where those who  have  tried

but did not succeed are encouraged to try again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent Straits Times survey, most Singaporeans agree

that   having   foreign  talent  is  good  for   Singapore   and

Singaporeans  as foreign talent will generate new  opportunities

and  add  to  our  economy's competitiveness.  Singaporeans  are

prepared  to accept the need for foreign talent at the  rational

level.   The  next  step is for us to similarly  accept  foreign

talent  at  the emotional level.  At the personal and  community

levels,  Singaporeans  should not  feel  threatened  by  foreign

talent  but  should  welcome those  who  come  to  Singapore  to

contribute to our development.  Most of us have recent immigrant

roots ourselves.  And those who come to Singapore, who share our

dreams  and are committed to our vision, we should embrace  them

as citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth idea is The Singapore Heartbeat. In an

increasingly   borderless   world,   it   is   imperative   that

Singaporeans  have a strong sense of belonging to Singapore  and

share a common vision.  Singaporeans must feel passionately that

Singapore is where we belong, where our roots are and where  our

future  lies.  Wherever we may be around the world,  our  hearts

must  beat  in tune with our fellow Singaporeans, with  whom  we

share a mutual responsibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the idea of Active Citizens who Make the

Difference.   The  Singapore 21 survey found  that  Singaporeans

want  to  be involved and consulted on issues that affect  their

lives.  This is an encouraging sign.  In an increasingly complex

world,  no  one, including the Government, has all the  answers.

Greater involvement of the people will lead to better solutions.

It  will  also result in greater ownership of the final decision

and outcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But beyond giving their views on public policies and

issues, Singaporeans must be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>

more  involved  in  creating the kind of  society  we  want  for

ourselves  and our children.  Participation need not be  at  the

national  level  on  weighty national issues. Participation  can

make  a big difference, perhaps make the biggest difference,  at

the   grassroots  level  to  themselves  and  to  their   fellow

Singaporeans.   Where possible, Singaporeans  should  be  active

citizens   who   take   ownership  of  problems   within   their

neighbourhood, community and society.  By offering feedback  and

ideas,  Singaporeans have a greater sense of  participation  and

ownership, by becoming actively involved in putting their  ideas

to  work,  they  share in the responsibility  for  the  outcome.

Active  citizens will form a people sector that will  complement

the   public  sector  and  the  private  sector  in  a   dynamic

partnership.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I have just described are the five

key ideas that make up the Singapore 21 vision.  Singapore 21 is

not  the Government's concept on what Singaporeans should do  in

the  next century.  It is what Singaporeans collectively  desire

for  the future.  The five key ideas are not "good to haves" but

essential  ingredients in building the heartware of our  nation.

They  cannot  be achieved overnight, nor will they  be  easy  to

achieve.   But we must strive towards them because the Singapore

21  vision will be crucial to Singapore's continued survival and

success in the new millennium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In developing and articulating the Singapore 21 vision, the

Singapore  21  Committee  has drawn upon  the  combined  wisdom,

experience and aspirations of many Singaporeans.  The  Committee

would  like  to thank all of them for their participation.   The

endorsement of the Singapore 21 Vision by this House will enable

us   to  move  into  the  next  and  more  difficult  phase   of

implementation.  This will require the unified response  of  all

Singaporeans  -  the public sector, the private sector  and  the

people sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, instead of continuing to make a long

exposition on what

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>

Singapore  21  is, I think it is more important to give  Members

the opportunity to come forward and say for themselves what they

feel Singapore should be in the 21st century.  I look forward to

support from Members of this House for this vision. And  I  look

forward to hearing your ideas on how we can realise this vision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE 21</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

to  register my whole-hearted support for the motion standing in

the name of the Minister for Education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As both the Prime Minister and the Chairman have stressed,

Singapore   21   is  not  the  Government's  concept   of   what

Singaporeans should do in the next century.  Neither  is  it  an

economic  blueprint.   It is what some 6,000  Singaporeans  have

expressed as the Singapore they want for the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister has elaborated, Singapore 21 highlights

five key ideas which initially appear to be so obvious.  But are

they really that obvious?  Are these key ideas merely motherhood

statements?  I believe the acid test is the extent to  which  we

apply  these evergreen ideas as guiding principles for our lives

as an individual, as a society and as a country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many may ask what is the relevance of Singapore 21 to

the crisis.  Is Singapore 21 a vision that can be discussed only

when buoyant economic times allow us

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>

that  luxury?  No, it should be a set of guiding principles that

we  adopt  regardless of the economic situation.  I believe  the

challenge  is to consistently live by these principles  and  not

just during a crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we do not start from a zero base and the Singapore

21 spirit is already being felt.  Allow me, Sir, to elaborate on

how  directly  relevant  this is to  the  current  crisis.   The

recession  from  the regional turmoil has injected  a  sense  of

reality  to  the  vision.  Our response as a people  illustrates

beautifully  how  ideas  and concepts  can  be  translated  into

practice and demonstrates the extent to which we relate to  each

other, our community and Singapore at large.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the crisis has evoked a sense of national pride

and  collective  will.  Sir, the cost-cutting measures  were  no

doubt  driven by the Government but they relied heavily on  each

and  every  Singaporean's conviction and will to, firstly,  bear

some  pain in order to regain our competitiveness and, secondly,

to contribute towards Singapore's ability to progress beyond the

crisis by agreeing to be reskilled and upgraded.  Of course,  we

are  not  out of the regional woods yet but a nation of mentally

prepared  and willing Singaporeans is a necessary and meaningful

prerequisite.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the crisis has heightened our sense of

responsibility towards each other.  The people sector comprising

many  self-help,  voluntary  and  community  organisations   are

already in full swing, reaching out to Singaporeans in need in a

variety  of  ways.   For  example,  many  Community  Development

Councils  are  already  assisting  retrenched  workers  in   job

searches  while  others help out with basic essentials  such  as

meals and groceries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most recently, on May Day, some 60,000 Singaporeans under

the  `Love Singapore' banner, walked to raise funds for some  24

charities  as  the  crisis has made fund  raising  a  challenge.

This, to me, is a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>

moving tribute to how when the going gets tough, the tough  goes

walking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the crisis has caused us to revisit the values we

know  so  well.   Sir, many a family is facing the  pressure  of

coping   with  the  crisis,  particularly  if  there  has   been

retrenchment or prolonged unemployment.  Family members  tighten

their belts in a collective effort to reduce household expenses.

Frequently,  extended  family members  chip  in  with  financial

assistance and, more importantly, moral support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was particularly touched by a retiree's response to how

he reacted to his son's plight when the latter had to settle for

a  less-paying job.  He reassured his son that, firstly, he  was

willing to forgo his monthly allowance, and, that secondly,  his

respect and love for his son remained the same as long as he had

tried his best.  This thoughtful father is prepared to adapt  to

changing circumstances and has done a great deal to relieve  his

son's stress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even without the crisis, most Singaporeans already

experience  a  certain  amount  of  stress  brought  on  by  the

increasingly  competitive global marketplace and  fast  changing

technology.   As  we  know, stress is not necessarily  bad.   An

athlete  will  be  quick  to tell you  that  without  subjecting

himself  to  punishing  goals, he would not  be  able  to  break

records.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the causes of stress can be traced to a narrow

definition of success.  How often do we subconsciously  look  at

others  through  glasses that count in dollars  or  through  the

houses  that  they own?  As a society, our history has  revolved

around  building  a vibrant economy in a short period  of  time,

thus  leading  to  a  lot of emphasis on economic  and  material

achievements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, we have unwittingly defined success very

narrowly,  only  by  good grades if you are a  student  and  the

ability to make a lot of money if you are a working adult.  This

narrow  definition of success in turn affects our self-worth  or

self-esteem.  And low self-esteem will lead

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>

us  to  think  that  we  do not matter to our  family,  friends,

community or even country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that children can easily feel unworthy.

For  example,  it  is one thing for parents to  encourage  their

children  to work hard for good academic results; it is  another

to condemn them because they are not as bright as their cousins.

At  one  focus group discussion which my Subject Committee  had,

although there was consensus that society as a whole must  widen

the  notion  of  success,  there was  some  resignation  to  the

inability to change collective mindsets.  I believe this is  not

something  a  campaign  can  address,  although  obviously,  the

Government  can help influence and change mindsets.   It  really

begins  in  each  and every one of us as we are  the  collective

judge  of  how we view each other.  Mindset changes may  take  a

long  time  but raising awareness to the need for  a  change  is

definitely a good starting point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the close of my speech where I would like

to  urge  all  Singaporeans to assume collective  ownership  and

responsibility for the Singapore 21 movement.  For it is when we

feel   responsible  for  our  own  destinies  that,  with   some

facilitation  by  the Government, we can hope  to  remain  truly

cohesive as a nation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, let me speak on the

topic  "Every Singaporean Matters".  In an age of globalisation,

where  nations face tremendous pressures from outside, there  is

also  a  tremendous transference of values that we, as  a  young

nation, have to contend with.  The debate that we face today  on

the  recommendations  of the Singapore 21 Committee  is  crucial

because  we  need to prepare now for the future.  I commend  the

Singapore  21 Committee and all participants of the  discussions

organised  by  the Committee for coming up with  this  document.

What we have before us is not just a collection of views of  the

Committee, but the collective wisdom of many, many more  people,

about 6,000 in all, who care about the development and future of

our society.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rise therefore to support this motion. The

recommendations put forth raise further questions on how we  can

obtain the best future for Singaporeans, transcending all levels

and  across all boundaries that separate us as individuals.  The

preparations  we  make  today  are  our  legacy  to   the   next

generation, and with the steps we take now, we must ensure  that

future  generations  applaud our actions in  ensuring  not  only

their survival but also their prosperity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The range and complexity of issues arising from a world

without  borders impose challenges that require us to  form  new

attitudes  as  we are forced to address issues - issues  brought

about  through the transference of outside values, that we never

had  to  face  before.   This is the cost of  progression  to  a

knowledge-based  industry, a progression that  is  necessary  to

ensure us a place in the international economy and community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the call for foreign talent echoing through the past

few  years,  especially in the past few months,  at  a  time  of

economic  crisis,  some  of our people  have  been  afraid  that

Singaporeans  would be marginalised in the Government's  bid  to

attract  foreign talent.  We should not take lightly the  recent

emotions  raised by this spectre which came bubbling up  to  the

surface when Singaporeans were losing jobs.  I appreciate  their

concerns.  Somewhere, if our people do not understand, then  the

message  put out has gone astray, so we have to give our  vision

greater clarity and transparency, and areas of friction have  to

be addressed.  We have to answer difficult questions; what do we

mean  by foreign talent, should remunerations of foreigners  and

Singaporeans of equal talent differ, are the goodies provided to

attract  foreign  talent also available for Singaporean  talent,

what  kinds of foreign talent do we need, are controls in  place

to  ensure that "riff-raff" of the world are sifted out and what

are these controls.  These are just a few of the questions which

need to be clarified.  In the end, the phrase "Every Singaporean

Matters" must be believed by the people because we can only rely

on ourselves to make sure that we matter.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is quite easy to ask questions and raise concern but

it  is  not easy to find the solutions.  On the issue of foreign

talent,  we  have to help Singaporeans see the big picture  too.

To  start  with, the number of foreign workers is controlled  by

the quota system.  So, the majority of workers in Singapore will

always  be Singaporeans.  Foreign talents are brought in not  at

the  expense of Singaporeans.  Instead, we need foreign  talents

to  help  enhance our competitiveness and competitive  edge  and

create even more jobs for Singaporeans.  I suppose we need to do

a  little bit more work to convince Singaporeans that we do need

to welcome foreign talents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what our labour movement is doing, together with the

Government  and  the employers federation,  is  to  help  create

skills  among  Singapore workers, especially the  older  workers

with  low  skills,  so  that they remain relevant  and  able  to

function in the knowledge-based economy.  To me, this is how our

society  tries to meet the needs and protect the basic interests

of  the  older Singaporean workers, for the best welfare we  can

extend to our fellow Singaporeans is to create jobs for them and

enhance  their  employability.  In this respect, I  applaud  the

Government's decision, announced by the Prime Minister on Labour

Day,  to give more funds to NTUC's Education and Training  Funds

(ETF)  and  Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP)  so  that  more

Singaporean   workers   can   benefit   from   skills   training

opportunities.  Sir, it shows that we do care for our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Singaporeans are to believe that each and every one of

them  matters, then the voice of each sector of society must  be

heard and taken seriously by society and by the Government.   We

must be respectful of each other and each sector of the society,

respect  for  them  as  being  a  group  of  intelligent  fellow

citizens.  If we mean to tell people that they matter, they must

be  informed  first before certain actions that can affect  them

are  taken.  Take SingNet's scanning of the vulnerability of the

computers of its 200,000

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>

Internet  subscribers without first telling them  about  it.   I

appreciate  SingNet's explanation, but somehow,  there  is  this

feeling  that customers should be the last to know.   Sir,  this

must change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then take the case of Tampines Town Council's decision to

charge  $300 per session to a group of women who exercise weekly

at  a  public  park in Tampines.  If the town council  needs  to

charge a fee to cover some maintenance costs, it should consider

a  reasonable fee.  And if it is true that the town council  had

wanted to charge as much as $300 per session to the group of 40,

then  I think it is much too much.  I believe there is no racial

undertone here.  And there should not be any such thing.  But we

are  talking about people in the age group and racial background

who  are most vulnerable to the heart and related illnesses, who

need  to  exercise,  and should be encouraged  to  do  so.   The

Residents' Committee of the area can help them organise  better,

and  these  such  groups need to be told of their responsibility

and  obligations  in  using  public  places  like  the  park  in

Tampines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whether the Straits Times has sensationalised the

matter or not, it is something that must be ironed out.  What we

need  to  do is therefore to include, and not to exclude people.

It  will help make our people feel that they do matter,  and  we

are  serious about strengthening family and social cohesion.   I

can  only read out the reaction of a 16-year old youth  on  this

matter  to remind ourselves of the need of not losing  sight  of

the  big picture.  Mr Safarudin Abdul Rahman was quoted  by  the

Straits  Times to have said, "Relax-lah, this is an  open  space

for  public use.  What's this talk about one people, one nation,

one Singapore?".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as recommended by the report, we have to widen our

definition of success but how we are going to do that has yet to

be  looked at.  One of the crucial areas where social change can

occur is in our schools because it is there that we prepare  our

children  to  become  the citizens of tomorrow.   Our  education

system   has   been  geared  towards  examinations   and   paper

qualifications and, therefore,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>

society sees paper qualifications as the ultimate measurement of

success.   How  are we going to change this?   This  is  a  very

important question.  We are going in the right direction when we

start  to  look into making project work one of the requirements

of  university  admission.   We can go  further  by  looking  at

introducing  project  work  and open book  examinations  at  the

different  levels of streaming.  These encourage more  thinking,

analysis  and creativity than the kind of examinations  we  have

today which only encourage rote learning and a blinkered vision.

We  have to look into the best teaching methods in the world and

work this into the training of our teachers.  We could also look

into  giving our teachers wider exposure in different styles  of

teaching  by  exchange  programmes  with  schools  in  different

countries.  At the same time, it provides our teachers  with  an

international  outlook that they pass on to  the  students  they

teach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can also look into increasing the number of and

improving  the  standards of specialty  schools  that  we  have.

Singapore has the potential to become the regional hub for  fine

arts because of our centrality in the region and because we have

the  resources  to  ensure  quality  education,  facilities  and

facilitators.  We can talk about Government financial support to

set up facilities, to pay world-class lecturers and to subsidise

genius  but this kind of aid will never be able to achieve  what

it  has  set  out  to do.  All the money in the world  will  not

persuade  Singapore and that each and every one of them  matters

in  the blueprint of Singaporean achievement.  What is crucially

needed  is  acceptance,  acceptance  of  Singaporeans  that  are

different.  We recognise only those who have made it in terms of

financial  gains or reputation and all the recognition  that  we

give to those who excel also gives rise to a sense of failure in

the rest.  What makes a musician successful to Singapore society

-   only   when   he   is  recognised  as   a   great   musician

internationally.  Are the other Singaporean musicians  failures?

Have they not succeeded in their own terms?  We cannot be afraid

that  if we stop the continual praising of those who have become

the best internationally, that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>

rest of Singapore will stop striving to be the best!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other level, the self worth of any individual can be

strengthened  by  his family.  To have strong family  bonds  can

ensure  an  individual's success in any field and his confidence

to  take different paths in his life.  Failure can only be  felt

within when your family designates you a failure, but this  will

never happen in strong families that recognise the worth of each

family member.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lynchpin of any strong family normally revolves around

the  woman, perhaps contrary to the belief of society.   In  the

roles of wife, mother and daughter which sometimes occur at  the

same time or in different phases, women determine whether family

holds together through each period of stress.  Much more has  to

be  done  to assist women in the workplace.  It is not only  the

setting  up  of flexible working arrangements for women.   There

has  also  got  to be a change in the way our society  looks  at

women who work.  Women are sidelined in their careers once  they

demand   flexible  working  arrangements,  as   if   these   are

intolerable conditions to be imposed on the company.  This  goes

to  the  roots  of the way our society is structured.   I  think

probably  it  is time for us to look into how we  look  at  this

issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at our older workers, we have extended the

retirement  age to 62, as our people live longer and  in  better

health.  We also need to find ways and means to allow our  older

workers to continue working with dignity and self-respect.   The

Government should look at other ways of persuading companies  to

keep their senior employees beyond the mandatory retirement  age

of  62.  One way is perhaps to look at reducing company tax with

every such worker whom the company continues to employ.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, overall, when we look at the achievements of

Singapore, we have developed most in the economic realm.  Though

the Government has done everything possible to ensure that these

achievements profit every citizen, it remains a fact  that  some

have succeeded

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>

better  than others, and that there is a marginalised sector  of

Singapore  society  which  has not  integrated.   What  we  have

achieved  in  economic  terms must now be  supported  by  social

integration and cohesiveness, especially when we are faced  with

the homogenizing effect of globalisation.  It is from the values

of our society that we define ourselves as a nation, rather than

an economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this

opportunity to clarify some of the points that were made  by  Mr

Hawazi  just now.  I do so because I do not want this  issue  to

take  a  life  of its own, especially when the facts  are  quite

contrary to what has been reported in the Straits Times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very good story, sensational in many respects and,

in fact, if it were true, then I think it would lend credence to

the views of some people that some parts of Government are still

very  bureaucratic  and  very unreasonable.   But  let  me  give

Members  of this House the facts, and then we can take  it  from

there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Member of Parliament for Tampines GRC. The festival

park in question is in my constituency and, therefore, I think I

am  in a very good position to give Members the facts.  First of

all,  the  group in question has been exercising in the festival

park  for  the last two years with no problems, no payments,  no

complaints.  So the question of payment of any amount  does  not

arise  at all.  So, what happened?  Two weeks ago, there  was  a

letter of complaint that reached the Residents' Committee.   The

Residents'  Committee had to act on that complaint  because  the

resident complained that when she wanted to join that group, she

was  not  allowed  to  do so.  The Chairman  of  the  Residents'

Committee together with other members then approached the  group

in  question, asked for clarification, suggested that they  join

together.   There was an exchange of words, I believe, arguments

ensued, heated words were exchanged, and they parted without any

solution.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was kept informed of the situation. My worry, frankly,

was because the group in question was a group of Malay women.  I

wanted  to  make sure that the group would be able  to  continue

with  their  activities in a way that does not exclude  anybody.

So when the group met me about two weeks ago, after the incident

with  the RC, I suggested to the group that they should register

their  intention to use the park with the Town Council, so  that

we  are able to make sure that the park is properly managed  and

that  there  is no clash of activities.  I also told  the  group

that  they  are  free  to  use the park without  any  charge  on

condition  that they allow members who wish to join them  to  do

so.   I have heard nothing more from the group, until I saw  the

report in the Straits Times which took me entirely by surprise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? Obviously, the group must have been unhappy

with  their altercation with the RC and went to the press.   The

press  asked  a  few  questions of the Town Council.   The  Town

Council  answered a few questions, such as, "Do people  have  to

pay  to  use  the  park?  Do people have to pay  to  use  public

facilities?"   The answer is "Yes".  "How much do they  have  to

pay?"  Amounts that range from $10 all the way to $300, if it is

a very elaborate affair like a wedding.  Lo and behold, a report

comes out that you either pay or go away.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this was a very serious matter which was of great

concern  to all of us.  First, because we do not want to exclude

anybody.   But, second, we want to make sure that the facilities

in  the  constituency are available for use  by  all  residents.

After all, the residents are paying conservancy fees to the Town

Council  and  the  Town  Council  has  to  make  sure  that  the

facilities are properly used.  But it is a municipal matter.  It

is  not a big issue.  And we thought we had resolved the matter.

Until  it became a big issue because the issue now is a question

of  paying $300 or go away.  There was never any question  about

payment.  There was never any question about asking the group to

go  away.   All  that  was  asked was  to  make  sure  that  the

activities  of the group are regularised and that the  residents

are allowed to join in.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has become an issue that has caught a lot of people's

attention.   It has become an issue ranging from whether  people

should  pay  to  use  public facilities, to  why  one  group  is

discriminated  against.  I think it should not be  an  issue  in

this  debate, and this is the reason why I would like to clarify

this  point.   It  is a municipal issue which should  have  been

resolved.  Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the reporters and

the newspaper in question decided to blow it up and turn it into

a big issue.  The facts I have put before this House are what is

known  to  me.  Unfortunately, it may have stopped a good  story

from  being written.  I have made the clarification  twice.   On

Sunday,  I  made this clarification.  A small report  came  out.

Some  of  you may have missed it, but the newspaper  decided  to

follow  up  with  another  story today.   I  have  made  another

clarification this afternoon to the reporter.  Since  Mr  Hawazi

has raised it, I am making another clarification, and I will see

what  happens  tomorrow.  But let us not get distracted  from  a

serious  issue before this House, which is a debate on Singapore

21  which talks about what Singaporeans want Singapore to be  in

the next century.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall

focus  my speech on national issues and stay away from municipal

issues!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise to support the Committee's efforts in charting

a  new  paradigm  -  to secure Singapore's success in  the  21st

century.  In particular, I am happy to note that there has  been

an  extensive  consultation  process  across  a  wide  range  of

individuals and institutions.  Indeed, this goes to strengthen a

key  element  of  our success thus far, and  that  is  consensus

building.  It is important as we move into the  information  age

in  the new millennium, that we not only continue but also widen

our  net  for  feedback gathering in this  spirit  of  consensus

building.  This will ensure that Singaporeans can both feel  and

play  a  direct  part in the future of our  country.   It  makes

Singaporeans responsible for their destiny, and strengthens  our

cohesiveness and unity as a nation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed heartening to note that the S21 Committee has

continued  to stress the value of strong families as foundations

for  our  future  success.   This  has  been  the  hallmark  and

underlying strength of our society since independence.  With the

rapid  progress and modernization permeating through our society

today,  it is critical that the family should continue to  be  a

source  of  strength, and that we do not go  down  the  path  of

unbridled   individualism  leading  to  social  alienation   and

dislocation of individuals, as is happening in other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There remains a source of concern that the rapid and fast-changing Singapore society today, with its many stresses and

burdens  on  the  individual, has led to  fragmentation  of  the

family unit over the years.  Now, we are striving to refocus the

definition  of  success  in  terms of  economic  well-being  and

material wealth.  We are extending it to other enviable pursuits

like   job   satisfaction,  the  arts,  culture  and   community

activities.  We are also encouraging Singaporeans to embrace the

knowledge-based  economy  (KBE),  and  to  engage  in  life-long

learning,   develop  an  interest  and  participate   in   civic

activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the midst of all these, it is timely to remind

ourselves that we have to continue to uphold the pre-eminence of

the  role  of  Asian family values, even as we  move  towards  a

radical   transformation  of  our  societal  values  in  future.

Positive  values such as filial piety, respect for  our  elders,

ethics,  honesty, integrity and nuclear families should continue

to  play  a  significant  role in our  lifestyles  in  the  next

millennium.   The  basic building block of our  society  has  to

continue  to  be  the  family  and  not  the  individual.    The

individual  can grow and express himself in the KBE environment,

but  only as far as the bonds of family, the community  and  the

nation remain intact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that all the goals that form part of the S21

Report  are  necessary  for  our  future  success  in  the  next

millennium.   My question is: is what we have laid  out  in  the

Report enough to enshrine the family as the fundamental unit  of

our society and secure the primacy of our family based

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>

values?  Indeed, one of the recommendations in the Report,  that

the  Government could encourage flexible work arrangements, such

as part-time work, working from the home and job sharing deserve

more  emphasis.   As the biggest employer in Singapore,  perhaps

the  Government  should lead the way.  I would like  to  suggest

that the Government consider introducing flexible work hours, or

even  a  5-day work week in certain non-critical public services

in  the  next  millennium.  This would also serve  to  encourage

employers  in  the private sector to follow suit and  to  change

their  reward  and remuneration system to one of efficiency  and

productivity,  as  opposed to time spent in the  office,  as  is

currently the arrangement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More flexible working hours or a 5-day work week has not

impeded the productivity of USA, for example, which is currently

the most productive nation in the world.  It has served well  to

present  the individuals there the opportunities to  spend  more

time  pursuing  civic and community activities,  engage  in  KBE

activities through continuing education, and develop interest in

arts  and culture.  More importantly, for Singapore in the  next

century,  it  would allow more opportunity for  Singaporeans  to

spend  time  with their family such as for leisure  pursuits  to

build up intergenerational bonds.  I would like to suggest  that

although  this  concept of a 5-day work week may be  radical  to

Singapore, it would tie in and allow for the gradual achievement

of  the  goals in the S21 Report, which as a package involves  a

series   of   changes  in  mindset,  personal   evaluation   and

lifestyles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am conscious of the fact that Singaporeans have been

conditioned  for many years to think of success in economic  and

material terms, and also to look to the Government to solve most

of their problems.  This has led to a curious paradox that there

is  a "dependency effect" where the general population generally

expects the Government to step in to solve problems at both  the

personal

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>

and  the social levels.  I am certain that every Member of  this

House   would   have   encountered  this  in  their   experience

interacting with residents.  And it is ironic that at  the  same

time,  these residents also complain that the Government is  too

nannying and interventionist.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore timely to encourage Singaporeans, as

reflected  in the Report, to take responsibility and  pride  for

their  lives  and  their community.  It is  also  worthwhile  to

stress  and  encourage a culture that allows  for  greater  risk

taking.  Instead of just recommending that society gives  second

chances,  and  be more tolerant of failure, I believe  that  the

Government   could  also  play  a  greater  role   than   merely

encouraging Singaporeans to pursue alternative interests in  the

arts or sports.  The Government and the civil service could give

greater   recognition  for  mature  degrees   when   considering

employment,  for example, and also consider revising  bankruptcy

laws to make it easier for an individual to turn failure into  a

success.   As an example, an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley  who

has had many failures is not viewed as a failure but indeed as a

very  experienced person, as he has had accumulated a wealth  of

failures    and   experience.    In   addition,   to   encourage

entrepreneurship in Singapore, the Government could also  review

the  prohibition  of registering offices or  businesses  in  HDB

dwellings,  so  as  to  allow  for wider  proliferation  of  KBE

business  activities, and greater opportunities for families  to

interact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Singapore of the 21st century, we can easily

envisage that a large proportion of our citizens would be living

abroad  at  any  one time.  They could be away  on  business  or

posted  overseas as our companies regionalise or even globalise.

They  could  be pursuing academic studies or even be on  holiday

abroad.   They could have retired and choose to reside overseas.

Singaporeans  would be highly mobile in the  next  century.   In

order to make Singapore the home where the family, community and

societal  bonds are meaningful to these people and to  encourage

them wherever they are to have the heartbeat of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>

Singapore,  we  have  to allow for greater civic  and  community

participation  at  all levels.  The spirit of inclusiveness  and

consensus  building that created this report has to be  extended

to  those living abroad.  In time we may even consider reviewing

our  immigration policy to allow Singaporeans who had previously

left  to  return  home, as they may then identify  and  want  to

contribute to Singapore's continued success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the recommendations of this Report.

However,  I  am  somewhat concerned that  there  is  a  lack  of

concrete  implementation strategies.  Although there is argument

that  society will only move as fast as it is ready to do so,  I

believe  that  the Government's role to nurture society  in  the

right  direction is significant.  In this respect,  I  therefore

recommend  that  the  Government consider commissioning  a  full

review  of how the recommendations of this Report can be adopted

and  implemented  by the civil service and the  many  Government

agencies  and  the  Community Development Councils  as  well  as

through  the private sector.  This will ensure that we  can  put

our  first  foot  forward  in the door towards  the  success  of

Singapore 21 when the new millennium starts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Community Development (Mr Abdullah

Tarmugi):   Mr  Speaker, Sir, at the Committee of Supply  debate

earlier this year, I had outlined to Members of the House  three

developmental  thrusts that my Ministry would  pursue  to  build

social  capital  for the future.  To recap,  we  will  intensify

efforts  to build strong and stable families.  The S21 reaffirms

our  belief that the family is a fundamental building  block  of

our  society.  My Ministry is fully committed to this philosophy

and   vision.   Second,  we  must  anticipate  and  address  the

challenges  of  our  ageing  population.   And  third,  we  must

strengthen  the  social service sector as part of  the  national

effort to build a dynamic and vibrant people sector.

<br><br><i>MCD's Commitment to S21</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five Key Ideas developed by the Singapore 21 Committee

will give my Ministry fresh impetus in these three

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>

areas  of  focus.   Collectively, the five  Ideas  articulate  a

concrete  yet  robust  vision of the kind of  society  that  our

policies  must strive to realise.  Indeed, many of my Ministry's

core functions are aligned with what S21 seeks to achieve.   Our

rehabilitation programmes for juvenile offenders, the protection

we  give  to  victims of family violence, and the assistance  we

provide  to the less able and less fortunate members of society,

all  support the idea that Every Singaporean Matters.  The basis

for  this  assistance has been that everyone deserves  a  second

chance  and  should  be helped to become a responsible  citizen,

contributing to our nation.  The guiding philosophy remains that

people should be helped to help themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally important, MCD has, over the years, forged a close

partnership  with  voluntary  welfare  organisations,  self-help

groups,  religious  organisations and other  civic  groups  that

provide  social services.  Many are involved in the  running  of

welfare homes, halfway houses, family service centres, day  care

centres  for  the  young  and  old,  and  other  social  service

facilities.  They serve their fellow Singaporeans tirelessly and

selflessly, regardless of race, language or religion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our experience with the people sector also suggests that

when  the community and the Government work in close partnership

to  serve  the community, we reach more individuals and families

better  than either party could on its own.  Services  would  be

provided  with  greater  compassion and be  more  meaningful  to

recipients.    However,  this  partnership  has  not   developed

overnight.   It  requires  a  high  level  of  co-operation  and

collaboration  on  both sides and a mutual  respect  honed  over

time.   It  also demands a common vision and a shared commitment

among a wide spectrum of civic groups from diverse backgrounds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is committed to developing and

strengthening  new  partnerships with  the  people  sector.   We

believe that this is important not just because we rely  on  the

people  sector to provide core social services, but also because

the people sector is an important

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>

arena  to  bond  Singaporeans and to shape  a  sense  of  shared

responsibility and ownership for our collective welfare.

<br><br><i>MCD's S21 Initiatives</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the course of this year, my Ministry will launch three

initiatives to signal our commitment to making the S21 Vision  a

reality.   First, in the area of developing active  citizenship,

we  will  spearhead  the establishment of  a  national  body  to

promote  volunteerism  as  a  way of  life  in  Singapore.   The

National Volunteer Centre as it is tentatively called will be  a

promotional and resource centre for individuals and corporations

who want to be part of the volunteer movement in Singapore.  The

Centre  will  work  with  volunteer activists  to  involve  more

Singaporeans  in community and social service,  and  enable  our

citizens  to  play  a  more direct role in  serving  the  public

through a bottom-up process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in the area of strengthening families, MCD will

hold  a  series of public forums in June and July this  year  to

discuss  the findings of the recently completed National  Survey

on the Family.  Through these forums, we hope to generate public

interest  and discussion on family issues close to the heart  of

Singaporeans, and in the process, identify policy  measures  and

specific programmes that will help to make the Singapore  family

stronger and fulfil its care responsibilities better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the elderly front, we will launch a Stakeholder

Consultation Programme to tap on the views of service  providers

and key partners serving the elderly population.  This programme

will  help  to  ensure  a thorough and comprehensive  review  of

eldercare services and will form an integral part of the Elderly

Services  Masterplan review the Ministry will  be  carrying  out

later this year.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, we can expect the people sector to grow

in the years to come

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>

as   a  greater  diversity  of  civic  organisations  come  into

existence.   Each  of these new civic organisations  will  bring

with them their unique identities - their own raison d'etre, and

their  own  strengths.  With increasing numbers, we should  also

expect  a  more  diverse and more vibrant people  sector.   This

diversity need not be viewed with alarm or alacrity as  long  as

we  are  united by a common national vision.  Instead, we should

see  this  as  the maturing of Singapore society and  a  growing

desire on the part of Singaporeans to contribute to their  wider

communities.  By harnessing the resources of the people  sector,

and  by  forging new partnerships with the new pairs of  Helping

Hands, I am confident that we can build a stronger, more vibrant

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  has  said  that  we are on  the  threshold  of  a  new

millennium.   We  are  indeed a new generation  of  Singaporeans

forging  into that millennium into a bold new future of our  own

making.   It is an exciting prospect and the first step in  this

long  journey  has  begun with the release of the  Singapore  21

report.   In reality, it is the report of not just the Committee

but  of the thousands of Singaporeans who have contributed their

views.   It  is  a  well-thought-out vision,  and  deserves  the

unwavering  support and commitment of all of  us  in  Singapore.

But  the report is only a sketch outline which needs filling up.

This  may  be  why  some  people  have  unfairly  called  it  "a

collection of motherhood statements".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For acronym loving Singaporeans, the report begins aptly

with  an acronym - "KBE".  Pre-independence, it would have stood

for  "Knight  of  the British Empire".  In the  early  years  of

independence,  it could have stood for "Kneel before  you  eat".

Many  Singaporeans were so poor they did not  know  where  their

next  meal would come from.  And they could only kneel and pray,

or  beg.   In  later  years it probably  stood  for  "Kiasu  but

efficient".   Not all of us are proud of these antecedents.   In

the new millennium, we want "KBE" to stand

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>

for  something dignified, grand and meaningful.  The report says

it  stands for "Knowledge-based Economy".  I hope it stands  for

"Kindness blossoming everywhere".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindness and graciousness are two very rare commodities in

any modern urban society.  They are rare because the practice of

it  has  been forgotten.  City life is stressful, lonely, quick-paced  and  cold.   City life is to be endured  because  of  the

material benefits it brings to the family.  But city life in the

end  is  dehumanising.   The  city  inhabitant  is  a  faceless,

anonymous  digit  in the crowd.  He lives only for  himself  and

ensures  that whatever he does is to guarantee the  survival  of

his  family  and  his kin and himself.  In such an  environment,

kindness  and graciousness do not grow.  In such an environment,

the  buffet tables get swiped clean two minutes after  they  are

laid  out  but mountains of wasted food are left to  be  cleared

later.   Queues are for jumping, free textbooks are for grabbing

and waiters and maids are for venting out the frustrations.   It

is  a  heartless and compassionless society and  nothing  to  be

proud of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the nick of time comes this report, this vision - before

our  community becomes too much like the ugly, urban  society  I

have  just  described.  A knowledge-based economy is  one  which

values  everyone and gives everyone a role and a place,  a  name

and  a  face, kindness and grace.  In a knowledge-based economy,

there  is  no  job  that is despised.  Even the humble  cleaning

worker,  the  waiter,  the  plumber  and  the  taxi  driver  are

knowledge workers, not just the IT men.  Prime Minister  Goh  in

his  May  Day Rally speech three days ago has already  mentioned

the  cleaner  and the taxi driver.  Today, let  me  mention  the

plumber and the waiter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the plumber. He is a mere plumber if all he can do

is to tighten a faucet.  That we all can do.  Hence, we get very

incensed  when we call the plumber into our homes  for  what  we

think is an emergency and he charges us $100 for tightening  the

tap.  The plumber is a knowledge worker, however, if he is able

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>

to  ascertain the whole cause of the so-called emergency on  the

telephone  and  give  good  advice without  home  visit  to  the

householder who really has only to tighten the tap.  The plumber

is  a knowledge worker if he not only looks at the dripping  tap

but is able to give the householder some tips on what she can do

in  future  to  prevent a recurrence of her  problem.   In  many

developed countries, such knowledge worker plumbers can earn  as

much  as  university professors and no one could  quibble  about

their  fees.   The  S21  message must be  therefore  that  these

plumbers  and  anybody  like that are as highly  valued  as  the

scholar and the PhD.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the waiter. In our society, tradition and social

history  have  always put the waiter down at the bottom  of  the

hierarchy  of workers.  The waiter holds a low image of  himself

and  quickly  hops away to another job, even if it  is  a  lower

paying  job, when he can.  It does not help that the  restaurant

owner  who employs him uses him as an excuse to make more money.

How  so?  I refer to the often questioned but never objected  to

practice  of  putting peanuts and pickles in front of  you  even

though  you  did  not  ask for it and to charge  you  exorbitant

prices thereafter.  I refer too to the practice of the so-called

"service   charge",  a  compulsory  10%  charge  on  your   bill

irrespective of whether any real service has been rendered.  And

all  these charges are supposed to go to the waiter, but  seldom

end up in his pocket.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A knowledge worker waiter deserves good pay. The ordinary

waiter  who  waits  listlessly should be paid  a  minimum.   The

knowledge  worker,  however, who helps his  customer  to  choose

dishes which suit his pocket and taste, who is able to tell what

ingredients  are in the dishes he serves, who can indicate  what

sauce goes with what meat and what tea or wine with what meal  - that  waiter should be handsomely paid.  For that to happen,  we

must do away with the service charge and hidden charges like the

peanut  and  pickle  payments.  Nobody who gets  paid  the  same

irrespective  of  what he knows and does is  ever  going  to  be

encouraged to build up his knowledge and improve himself.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.34 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a developing nation, we need to strive to do excellently

in  everything we do - whether it be waiting at tables,  turning

taps,  teaching,  nursing or governing.  We need  to  constantly

remind ourselves not to slacken when we work or others will take

our  places.  Our workforce has been ranked number  one  in  the

world  for 19 years consecutively not without reason.   Yet,  we

know that work is not the be-all and end-all of human existence.

Our  workers  are not simply cogs in a well-lubricated  economic

wheel.   Man does not live by bread alone.  We have seen to  the

building  of recreational facilities, theatres, sports  stadiums

and  entertainment centres for the worker to use in his  leisure

hours.   These  are  not enough if he has no  time  for  leisure

either because he works too long since he has to earn enough  to

keep  the family going, or because the work week is unduly long.

These are not enough too if the costs of the facilities and  the

pleasure  spots are too high.  There is a need for us  to  build

more  and  better facilities for our residents and to constantly

upgrade and improve them instead of letting these facilities run

down  to obsolescence.  Of course, we cannot have our population

go  soft and interested only in working less and playing all the

time.  A proper balance between working hard and playing hard is

needed.  And here, I support Mr Chew's earlier call that  it  is

time  to  review  the  51/2-day work week and  the  11-day  only

national holidays - policies we adopted when we were fighting to

establish ourselves in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more free time, our people can relax and improve the

quality  of  their family lives and families will  be  stronger.

There will be healthier workers and less money spent on sickness

and  disease.   With more free time, there will be  more  active

citizens.   Volunteers will be more forthcoming to help  out  in

the  charitable,  grassroots, community and civic  organisations

that we have.  In developing the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>

people  sector, more civic involvement and greater participation

of  the  citizenry (and that includes corporate citizens)  -  we

need  to  realise  that time and energies are limited.   On  the

other  hand,  we  need  to pass the message  that  everyone  can

contribute,  however little he thinks his talents  or  resources

are.   We also need to expand the definition of what is a worthy

cause.   Many people do not find it difficult to volunteer  time

and  effort  or  donate  money  to charitable  causes  like  the

National  Kidney  Foundation  or the  Singapore  Cancer  Society

because these are what I call "natural charities" which  tug  at

the  heart.  But for society to function, there are other causes

which  require workers and monetary support too.  There are  the

Residents'  Committees which work to build bonds and  friendship

amongst neighbours; and the community centre workers who  labour

to  provide inexpensive leisure and cultural programmes for  the

populace.   Indeed,  there  are also  the  people  who  are  our

watchdogs to ensure that we vigilantly upkeep the quality of our

environment  and  nature reserves, the safety of  our  food  and

consumer  items,  the protection of consumers from  manipulative

marketeers and investment con-men.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can Government do to promote the people sector and

encourage these meaningful civil groups?  There we have  lessons

to  be  drawn  from  our very efficient and capable  network  of

grassroots  organisations.  How did we build this up so  quickly

and  so well?  More generous Government funding is a key factor.

More recognition for the workers is another and this recognition

does  not  have  to  take  the form of material  benefits.   The

Consumers' Association of Singapore, which I head, is a case  in

point.  Every year, the Government gives us a grant capped at 13

cents per head of population.  And in practice, this comes up to

less  than  $500,000 a year.  Three quarters  of  this  go  into

salaries.   There is very little left to do the actual  work  of

cost  monitoring and consumer protection, even  though  we  have

very  strong support from the NTUC, the unions and co-operatives

on  this matter.  I have asked for more from the Government.   I

have a formula based on consumer

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>

spending index and I hope that this can be done.  Of course, the

Prime  Minister  has  been  very generous  in  offering  CASE  a

Government  grant  of one to one match.  But in  the  two  years

since that generous offer, we have hardly raised more than  half

a  million  dollars.  In a good year, it is already hard  enough

for  heart-tugging charities to raise money.   But  in  the  two

years  or  so,  we  have  raised little partly  because  of  the

economic crisis.  It will take forever at this rate to raise the

$5  million we need to match the $10 million endowment fund that

we have planned for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leads me to my last point and with that I will end.

Fund   raising   is  an  important  activity  for   many   civic

organisations.   We  cannot depend solely on the  Government  to

fund  these  activities of course, or to ask the  Government  to

help  these  plans  work.   Ultimately,  we  need  an  army   of

volunteers and responsible businessmen who will gladly give some

of  their time and resources to help make sure that the thriving

market  economy  we  have  does not slide  unwittingly  into  an

exploitative  and  lubricious one,  where  the  wolves  and  the

heinous  are  always  lurking to sell  you  useless  gadgets  or

ostrich  eggs  (or perhaps buy shares off you) at  a  ridiculous

discount because they play on your vulnerabilities.  I  call  on

my  fellow  Singaporeans to answer the call to come  forward  to

make  their lives count.  At the end of life, it is not how much

you  have  earned  that  counts, but how  many  lives  you  have

impacted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that note, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise

to  speak in support of the motion standing in the name  of  the

Minister for Education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As first impressions go, one of the very first must be the

attractive  cover - showing four young children.  We can  deduce

from  this  that it must be a long-term plan.   We  do  not  see

pictures   of  skyscrappers,  MRT  trains  and  ultra  high-tech

factories - we can deduce from this that the Committee  was  not

looking

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>

into the economic well-being of Singapore.  It presupposes it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we look at the title "Together, we make the difference",

the  two bigger words are "We Make" - suggesting that the future

is  in  our hands; it is up to us to put in the effort.   As  we

turn  to  the inside covers, we find hundreds of names  -  every

Singaporean  contributor matters, and deserves  acknowledgement.

No  contributor  too unimportant, no idea too insignificant,  no

stone  too  small  to leave unturned.  It is a heartening  first

impression.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as reports go, it is a slim volume, yet it says a lot.

It  is  said to be a compass, not a blueprint, and yet, it  does

not look like a simple compass, pointing in all directions.   It

points  in  a  certain  direction - that of  a  Great  Singapore

Society.   This  social compass contains  five  values  that  we

should support, values that have already been elaborated  on  by

the  Minister.   These values are in addition  to  the  ones  we

already  have,  ie,  meritocracy, strong and  clean  government,

racial and religious harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the idea that "Every Singaporean matters" together

with  the  idea of the "active citizen" are likely  to  be  much

discussed - for they require a change to the current mindset  of

the  people, including those in the public sector.  For example,

one suggestion is to look at "success" more broadly from the one

based  on academic and material achievements.  According to  the

view  of the Committee, "there is no job too low that excellence

cannot  dignify".   Embracing  this  idea  would  lower  stress,

increase   self-worth  and  presumably,  make  for   a   happier

individual.   The  dilemma  between a less  stressful  life  and

retaining  the  drive is partly resolved  by  this  means.   You

should  drive  only  as  far as your  abilities  can  take  you.

Failure, it is suggested, is an option - and an opportunity must

be  given  for  trying again.  Not only must second  chances  be

provided for the new generation of technopreneurs, we must  also

provide  second chances to workers - to retrain, to be put  into

new jobs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This message is particularly important. But it is not easy

to   deliver.   Not  only  must  the  people  be  convinced  for

themselves, it must also extend to their aspirations  for  their

children.  Several years ago, a concerned parent came to see  me

bringing in tow his daughter who, despite her excellent  grades,

was  not  offered a place in the Law Faculty.   They  wanted  to

appeal.  Every time I asked the daughter why she wanted to  read

law,  the father interrupted, and gave many reasons.  It got  to

such a stage that I asked the father for permission to speak  to

the  daughter  alone.  Without her father present, the  daughter

spoke eloquently - on why we should not offer her a place -  she

was  more interested in Art and Design.  But her father  thought

that  there should be a lawyer in the family, having had a  hard

time  with  lawyers in the course of his business  dealings.   I

then  told  the father that, unfortunately, the appeal  was  not

successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recounted this incident to show that the task of changing

the mindset is likely to be an onerous one.  And that much of it

may  lie  with  parents' aspirations of  what  they  want  their

children  to  be.   So  it is likely to  be  a  major  exercise,

probably  taking  a  couple of generations for  Singaporeans  to

adjust to this new idea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee rightly points out that the lead to be taken

by  the Government is critical.  The curriculum, the scholarship

schemes, the resources to cater to the unusual and extraordinary

talents  that  may  otherwise lie hidden.  These  require  major

resources  and commitment.  To take a simple example,  the  move

away from simply transferring information to one where each  and

every  child must be brought to give of his or her best requires

a  much  smaller  staff/student ratio. It  requires  experienced

teachers  - teachers who can recognise the talents in  each  and

every child.  Yet, this is the way that we must necessarily go.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several other examples can be mentioned to re-adjust the

mindset.  The Gifted Programme should also be used to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>

take  in  those  who have talents in music, or art,  or  poetry.

President's Scholars can be selected for arts or music  courses.

Overseas   Merits  Scholars  can  be  sent  to  various   famous

institutions of music or art to develop their undoubted talents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At home, regional centres of arts and drama should be set

up  to  bring  such talents closer to the people in the  various

estates.   As  many of the Members in this House have  observed,

nothing  brings more pride to a parent than to see  his  or  her

child  performing on stage.  It is at the time when they  choose

their career that they make objections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the S21 Committee is not setting any

deadlines, or providing any detailed plans or targets.  That  is

a  matter for the Government, and for the Members in this  House

to note.  In the weeks and years ahead, we can expect that there

will  be  opportunities  in this House to  debate  these  issues

further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Committee deliberated for over a year, held many

meetings,   obtained   feedback  from  over   6,000   interested

individuals,  active citizens.  I believe  this  House  and  the

people  of  Singapore owe a great debt to the Committee  members

and everyone who were involved in the exercise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has identified the values that would make the

pursuit  of happiness for each and every Singaporean a  reality.

Reading the report, I am reminded of an intriguing question once

posed by a political scientist.  He asked, "How can we construct

a  society  so that anyone, no matter what his gifts, can  reach

seventy,  look back at his or her life, and be able to say  that

it  has  been  a  happy  life, filled with  deep  and  justified

satisfaction?".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the five values point that way. How? Because by

pursuing these values, it is possible for anyone to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) I was a good parent to my children, and they are good

to me;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) I was a good neighbour, an active citizen;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) I always did my best, according to my gifts and

abilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these are achievable by anyone, unlike fame, wealth or

material success.  It also emphasises the point that the pursuit

of  happiness  is  a  social concept -  that  we  need  to  have

participated in the social order to achieve happiness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The happiness of every Singaporean can be realised, if we

take  these  values  seriously  - the  Government,  the  people,

everyone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for those reasons, I strongly support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, last year, I heard of Singapore 21

being  mentioned, but did not really know what it was all  about

until  I  received a copy of the glossy Singapore  21  Committee

Report, with plenty of coloured pictures and printed words  with

double  spacing, which makes them easy reading.  I  notice  that

the  Singapore 21 Committee was initiated by the Prime  Minister

and  was  headed by a Minister.  The five subject sub-committees

were all having co-Chairmen who were all PAP MPs, except for two

who  were  NMPs.   It  is  copyrighted  by  the  Government   of

Singapore.   My  reaction to the report is that  it  is  another

piece  of  government  publication to make the  Government  look

good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five subject sub-committees have approached some 6,000

people  and must have collected a lot of feedback but I  believe

no Opposition members or representatives were interviewed.  Some

of these feedback must have been quite controversial because the

government  is  not  willing to accept them,  for  example,  the

voting  rights  of  Singaporeans  when  they  are  abroad.   The

Government refuses to accept the feedback which calls on  it  to

allow  Singaporeans  who  are abroad  to  vote  at  the  General

Election.   Obviously,  the  Government  views  this   kind   of

suggestion as not being advantageous to it.  For those  who  are

abroad,  my feeling is that, given a chance to vote, they  shall

probably  vote  against the government.  On the  one  hand,  the

Government tells the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>

people  that  "Every Singaporean Matters" and wants Singaporeans

to  believe  that.  But, in reality, the Government  refuses  to

implement a policy to show that "Every Singaporean matters".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cite another example to show that the Government does not

care for the minority or marginalised people.  A few years back,

I   asked   the  former  Minister  for  Education  to  implement

compulsory  education in our educational system.  He refused  to

do  so.   His  excuse  was  that every year,  only  about  2,900

children  do not attend school at all out of a cohort  of  about

50,000  children. The Minister said that it was  not  worth  the

Government's  while to have a whole section in the  Ministry  of

Education to police and enforce a policy of compulsory education

for  those  children.  If the Singapore Government really  cares

for every Singaporean, then it will not abandon nearly 6% of our

school  children  who  do not attend school.   I  am  a  staunch

believer  that  every  Singaporean counts.   If  the  Government

believes that too, then it must immediately implement the policy

of compulsory education in our school system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to "Every Singaporean matters", I agree with

the  subject committee's call to the Government to lead the way.

The  Government must call upon all its employees, whether in the

Government  departments, polyclinics, hospitals  or  the  police

force,  to  show respect for every individual.  Only  by  taking

this  attitude can the Government demonstrate to the people that

it really believes in "Every Singaporean matters".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, despite the fact that it has invested a large

part  of  its budget in education, there are still about 700,000

of  its  workforce  who  do  not have secondary  education.   If

Singapore  is  going  to  be  a  land  where  opportunities  are

available  to  all,  the  Government  must  make  available  the

opportunities  to  workers  who  have  missed  their   secondary

education  to complete their secondary education.  I  have  seen

two cases at my meet-the-people session where Singaporean adults

have only primary six education.  They

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>

wanted  to  continue their studies but just  could  not  find  a

Government  school that will take in over-aged  students.   They

could  enrol in a privately run school, but the fees were rather

high.   I  believe that the Government should revive  the  night

schools  to  cater  for  over-aged  persons  to  further   their

secondary education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever it is, the Government must make available real

opportunities  to  all Singaporeans to train themselves  to  the

fullest  of  their ability, especially to the older Singaporeans

who,  for  whatever  reasons, have  missed  the  opportunity  to

complete  their  secondary education the first  time  round.   A

second, or even a third chance should be made available to them.

Whilst   the  Government  wants  to  promote  a  knowledge-based

economy, there is a proportionately large number of our  workers

who  still do not have secondary education.  This anomaly sticks

out  like  a  sore  thumb.   The Government  should  solve  this

problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Communications (Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):  Sir, Mr Chiam has, usual to

his  characteristic  style of taking  a  swipe  at  the  report,

started very well by commenting on the coloured pictures and the

double spacing.  To suggest that the report is another piece  of

Government  publication is to insult all Singaporeans  who  have

contributed  to the report.  I think he owes an apology  to  the

Singaporean public because this report is a culmination  of  all

the  efforts that we have put together for the last year  and  a

half  to  cull  feedback and opinions on how Singapore's  future

should  be.   We  also  asked  all Singaporeans,  including  the

Opposition Members, to provide their responses and feedback.  In

fact,  Mr  Low  Thia  Khiang did submit a report  and  his  name

appears  in the report.  Had Mr Chiam been vigilant and open  to

Minister  Teo's request for feedback, he would have submitted  a

report  and his name would have appeared in it and he would  not

have criticised the report altogether.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised several other points regarding voting overseas

and  compulsory education.  I think we have to bear in mind that

at  the  end  of the day when we solicit feedback, it  does  not

necessarily mean that all feedback must be implemented.   It  is

true,  as  RAdm Teo has mentioned in his interview,  that  there

were heated discussions in the subject committees about overseas

voting  and  other feedback that we have received.  But  in  the

end,  what was important was that we arrived at a position as  a

Committee, not as a Government, that this is not something which

is  desirable.   If someone truly has a stake in  Singapore,  he

would come back and vote in Singapore and not overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked about "Every Singaporean matters" and it is time

for  us  to  show respect to every individual and he  wants  the

Government to provide the lead.  This is very unusual.   He  has

always  asked  the  Government not to  intervene  but,  in  this

instance, he wants the Government to intervene.  I think we have

done  our best through the campaigns that we have started.  MITA

has  a  movement called the "Small Kindness Movement" to  ensure

that  in  the interaction between members of the public and  the

public  sector,  kindness, graciousness and courteous  behaviour

are  shown  towards our public.  I think the movement  is  quite

successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for workers training, it is obvious that the Government

has  taken  every effort through the NTUC's SRP to  ensure  that

those who did not avail themselves of the opportunity to receive

a   decent  education  be  given  a  second  chance  to  upgrade

themselves to get the skills required to be world ready, and  to

be  ready  for the knowledge-based economy which is  coming.   I

think  the  onus  is on the workers to avail themselves  of  the

opportunities.  Recently, PM Goh, in the May Day Rally,  further

committed  to workers training by giving more money to  NTUC  so

that  they  can run more of the SRP programmes to reach  out  to

more  workers.  I think the Government has done their fair share

to ensure that all Singaporeans have enough opportunities.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may, Mr Deputy Speaker, move on to my main point.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I just want to inform the Member

that we have no compulsory education in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> I stand by the same position given by

the former Education Minister  -  I presume he meant Dr Tony Tan

and  also the current Education Minister, RAdm Teo Chee  Hean  - that  it  does  not serve us well to have compulsory  education.

The  numbers are small and I think given the thrust that we have

in  Singapore, very few parents would opt out.  And even if they

do  opt out, they do go to an alternative system.  At the end of

the  day,  there  is no reason for us to have an  administrative

mechanism  to ensure that the 2,900 students receive  compulsory

education.  As the Minister said, what are you going to do?  Are

you  going to arrest the parents because they do not send  their

kids  to  school?   We have to better utilise our  resources  to

serve the greater good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RAdm Teo Chee Hean, in one of his many e-mails to the

Singapore  21  Committee members, referred  to  us  as  his  co-conspirators.   I  am  one  of the co-conspirators.   It  was  a

conspiracy but of a very different kind from those which we have

lately  heard  of  in  the papers.  It was an  openly  held  and

transparent conspiracy which everyone in Singapore was involved.

And  I think for many, it was a liberating process which allowed

them to discuss and think about how our nation will develop  and

evolve.   Many heeded the call of our Prime Minister  to  search

for, and develop, the "heartware" of the nation because how  our

nation  grapples  with  its  own  challenges,  constraints,  and

strengths mattered to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me first to thank the many Singaporeans that my co-chair, Mr Chan Soo Sen and I met in the many focus group

discussions  for their candid views and suggestions.   We  spent

many  nights listening to stories and suggestions.  Some stories

were  poignant.  One polytechnic student, for example,  told  us

how she is already facing the challenge of having to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>

take  care  of both her parents and grandparents.   Others  told

stories  that  reminded us of the strong  gotong  royong  spirit

which we, as Singaporeans were, and, I believe, are still famous

for.    To  me,  this  exercise,  though  time  consuming,   was

necessary,   because  we  needed  to  hear   from   Singaporeans

themselves how they felt about the dilemmas posted to them.  For

me,  this  exercise proves that Singaporeans have a lot  to  say

about  their  country and, more importantly,  that  Singaporeans

care  about  their country.  We have put in a lot of  effort  to

elicit wide-ranging participation and views.  Let us build  upon

this effort in inclusiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we started the S21 exercise about a year and a half

ago,  we  were mindful of the trends and challenges  facing  our

society.   We  have an aging population; there are calls  for  a

more  relaxed lifestyle; increasingly, Singaporeans  leave  home

for jobs overseas, while many foreigners settle in Singapore  to

work;  and  there  are  indications  that  our  upwardly  mobile

population  wants  to  play a greater role in  nation  building.

Casting  these  trends as dilemmas forced people to  think  hard

about   the  choices  that  will  need  to  be  made.   In   the

discussions,  forums and seminars which we conducted,  we  found

ourselves going over old ground.  I realise that for  us,  as  a

nation,  to move forward, we have to look backwards and re-learn

the  lessons  of the past.  The values, strategies  and  visions

which  have served us well thus far are still relevant  and,  in

fact, very important for us to move into the 21st century  as  a

nation.  The emphasis on family, meritocracy, consensus,  multi-racialism, hard work and perseverance remains central to our S21

discussions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore 21 process is, therefore, a work in progress.

It  is  an iterative exercise in nation building.  We have  been

able to improve the material well-being of our people, to create

jobs,  to  build homes, and to give pride to a people of  a  new

nation.   Now,  it  is time to deal with the  emotions  and  the

attachments that we, as a people, have for this country, what we

call  and what Dr Lee Tsao Yuan calls the "Singapore Heartbeat".

How do we make our people feel for our country and their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>

fellow  citizens?  This is the challenge of Singapore 21 and  of

every Singaporean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the five key ideas of Singapore 21. But I think

these  ideas  must be tempered with the basic realities  of  the

Singapore  that we know today.  Some have argued that  the  five

ideas  amount  merely to motherhood statements.  I would  rather

see them as statements that reaffirm our basic core values.   In

our  eagerness to infuse the nation with a new sense of optimism

and  enthusiasm,  we cannot afford to forget the  strengths  and

constraints  that continue to define our life as a nation.   Our

proved  policy  and  programmes aimed  at  ensuring  that  every

community  progresses  and retains their own  cultural  identity

cannot  be  undermined.  The concerns of the various communities

cannot  be glossed over.  Our emphasis on meritocracy and multi-racialism  must  remain the cornerstone of our  existence  as  a

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, one of the key ideas which have

attracted some attention is that of active citizens.  We want to

build a civic society, but we have always had a civic tradition.

There are many groups and civic organisations which have emerged

and  have  done  their part to develop a civic movement.   These

groups provide grants, welfare services and run other programmes

because they believe that it is for the public good.  Today,  as

we  encourage more Singaporeans to be active citizens,  we  must

continue  to  emphasise the need to take heart the interests  of

the  larger Singaporean community.  Being active means different

things to different people.  Some may volunteer their time to  a

charitable cause while others may actually start a new  movement

to address problems such as child or spousal abuse.  Many others

also  contribute by giving ideas and suggestions, as can be seen

by  the  many  articles that appear in the forum  pages  of  the

Straits   Times.    So   there  are  ample   opportunities   for

Singaporeans  to be active and to be a part of  the  process  of

nation  building.   Many Singaporeans have  laboured  and  given

their best to help meet the needs of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>

others.  For example, we are seeing in the Malay community  many

undergraduates and even JC students giving free tuition to those

who  need  it.    They  do so because they want  to  help  their

community and help the nation.  These are active citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Singaporean is important to us, and everyone matters

to us.   But everyone has the duty to put his best foot forward.

We  will continue to need to balance the needs of the individual

against  the needs of the nation.  In a family, everyone matters

and  everyone  is  important.  But most of us would  agree  that

parents  should not go out of their way to reward  a  child  who

makes  no  effort to fulfill his potential and  who  refuses  to

contribute  to  the  family's well-being.  Indulgence  spoils  a

child.   Yet,  at  the same time, most of us  would  agree  that

overly  strict  and over-bearing parenting approaches  kill  the

creativity  and  the spark in a child.  Hence, everyone  matters

because everyone gives his best to the nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other social arrangements in Singapore, the

institution of the family is being reshaped by very broad social

trends.   In  particular,  we are seeing  a  shift  from  multi-generational  families towards nuclear ones.  These  changes  in

the  family form will no doubt have an impact on the  types  and

number of tasks performed by the family, but they need not spell

the death of the family as the centre of emotional well-being of

its  individual  members, or as a "place  to  come  out  of  the

storm".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in the US, I was amazed at how the American

students  would find all sorts of ways to get back  home  during

Thanksgiving to spend time with their families.  It was not  the

turkey  dinners and the cranberry sauce which pulled them  back.

It  was  the  sense of family and the ties which these  students

have  with  their parents and siblings which brought  them  back

together  every  November  for this annual  ritual.   Similarly,

parents   in  the  US  make  sure  to  attend  their  children's

graduation.   It  is a proud moment for the  family  to  have  a

member  receiving a degree.  These displays of family  affection

belie the strength and robustness of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>

institution  of  the  family.   Families  will  need   to   make

adjustments to the changing demands of society.  But  we  cannot

afford  to lose that sense of the family as a place of  support,

nurture and renewal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it is the family that shapes the community. How

a  child feels about himself depends largely upon how he is made

to feel about himself at home.  It is the home that provides the

comfort  and  the  solace for facing failure and  the  sense  of

triumph  when a child has achieved something.  It is the  family

that  provides  the safety net for the child to  experiment  and

fail  and try again.  It is the family that is most tolerant  of

failure  and  most able to nurture the child.  Our  parents  are

more  firm than our teachers and also more forgiving.   A  child

grows up according to the values and the signals he receives  at

home.   If his family values excellence and hard work, the child

will invariably have those values in him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the family also provides a zone of comfort for

our old.  I have met many older residents of my estates who want

their children to live near them.  Some may want to live near so

that  they can help take care of their grandchildren.   In  this

way, they transmit the values which will help our young and also

our  families.  Others help the family stay strong by  assisting

in  some household work.  I believe our older citizens help  out

because  they  believe  that it is the  right  thing  to  do  to

strengthen the family.  In return, many young parents understand

that  the  responsibility of taking care of their  aged  parents

essentially  lies  with them.  This sharing of  responsibilities

between  the  young  and the old has proven  to  be  successful.

Hence,  as  the family comes under stress, we must  continue  to

find  ways  to  ensure that these roles continue to  take  place

albeit in different forms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As more Singaporeans seize the opportunities abroad, the

family   will   come  under  increasing  stress.    Yet,   these

opportunities  will  provide  the material  comfort  which  many

families  yearn  for.   Many families, no doubt,  will  need  to

perform  a  balancing  act, as they pursue these  opportunities.

But my one sense is that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>

family  ties are indeed very strong in Singapore.  We must  make

sure  that  the  ties continue to be strong  as  the  forces  of

regionalisation and globalisation will bring new  challenges  to

the institution of the family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, S21 means different things to

different  people.   My  colleague, Mr  Inderjit  Singh,  and  I

chaired  a  feedback session on S21 recently.  We had calls  for

greater  creativity in schools, changes in our education system,

and balancing the needs of Singaporeans and foreign talent.  But

along  with  these calls, there was a sense that we  should  not

throw  out  the  baby  with  the bathwater.   Participants  want

changes  in the education system but do not want to imperil  the

strengths of the system.  They acknowledged the need to  recruit

world-wide, as this will boost our own local talent.   In  other

words,  the  participants knew that we need to  tread  carefully

with  S21  so  that we will not undermine what we have  achieved

thus far.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, S21 has been an interesting and

rewarding experience for me.  It has helped to remind me of  the

core  values and ideas that hold this nation together.   It  has

helped me to place the key ideas in the context of a larger  and

wider  spectrum  of  ideas and values  which  have  shaped  this

nation.  As we begin to innovate and find new ways to strengthen

the  social  glue  that binds as a nation, we cannot  forgo  the

strong  traditions which we have built over  the  years.   I  am

confident  that  the key ideas of Singapore 21,  taken  together

with   our   commitment  to  ideals  such  as   multi-racialism,

meritocracy, honesty, hard work and a sense of excellence,  will

provide  a  powerful framework for our nation  building  effort.

Thank you.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  I  am very happy to join in the  debate  on  the

Report  of  the Singapore 21 Committee headed by RAdm  Teo  Chee

Hean.   This  is the Report put up by the Committee  after  more

than  a  year of hard work, collecting information and views  of

the people from all walks of life in Singapore.  Once this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>

Report  is endorsed by this House, everyone in Singapore  should

work  hard  to  translate  the vision  into   reality  and  turn

Singapore into a dynamic international metropolis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Report of this Committee refers to strong families

as  our  foundation and future.  This is very  important.    The

survival of a country depends very much on family cohesion.  The

family  is  the basic building block of society.  If we  have  a

sense  of belonging to the family, we will also have a sense  of

belonging  to the nation.  We all know that it is not  just  the

house  or physical building owned by the family, but it is  also

the  emotional and blood bonds,  feelings and care that make the

house  a home or a family.  It is this common sense of belonging

to Singapore, the common vision that we share, our commitment to

such vision that make us as a country and a nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At times, we may be overseas, but our heart is still with

Singapore.   So  if  every Singaporean can  strengthen  his  own

family  cohesion,  it  will also help to  enhance  our  national

cohesion.   A  small  country  like  Singapore  will  become  an

international metropolis.  I am very optimistic about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee's Report wants to turn Singapore, and

Singaporeans,   into a higher level of economy,  technology  and

greater  prosperity.  But if the people are unable  to  maintain

their  own family cohesion, to preserve their own family  values

and  traditional cultures, to maintain religious  tolerance  and

racial  harmony,  we will become the rootless floating  duckweed

when we enter this state of international metropolis.  Our lives

will be empty.  We will have no direction.  So I feel that every

Singaporean  must  build his own family  cohesion  as  early  as

possible, spend more time with their family members, and try  to

strike a balance between our pursuit of  material lives and  our

efforts to promote the  growth of our family.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always tell my children that even if one day they can

become outstanding Singaporeans, their basic values must not  be

shaken or changed.  My children graduated from NUS and have gone

overseas  for further studies.  I want them to accept  the  good

values,  good culture, and good technology from the west.  These

will  be  of great help to them when they eventually  step  into

society  to  earn  a  living.  But I want them  to  continue  to

preserve  the traditional values of their own culture, including

the five core values of Singapore and the traditional values  of

the  Chinese  culture.   I  am  glad  that  my  children,  while

accepting the future challenges of life, have not changed  their

values.  I have told them that when they have given full play to

their  talent,  they  have succeeded, their  material  life  has

changed,  they can have a big house, a big car, even a  Porsche,

their life, thinking and values should never change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, a year and a half ago, I bought a

Porsche  Boxster.   I believe many people were  very  surprised.

They  felt that the Porsche Boxster was simply out of tune  with

this  old conservative fellow like me.  Perhaps, Porsche Boxster

gives one the impression of being contemporary or trendy.  But I

like  sports cars because I appreciate them as a piece  of  art.

But  I  have not changed my values and thinking just  because  I

have  bought a Porsche.  My children feel that at their age  and

without  a  strong economic foundation, they should  not  own  a

Porsche  or  enjoy  an expensive sports car  like  this.   Their

thinking is correct.  So I spoke in jest to the agent of Porsche

that  the  marketing of Porsche should not just be targetted  at

the  young people, they should start giving publicity to  create

the  impression  that those who have the means, the  middle-aged

people,  should  also  drive Porsche.  I think  the  agent  will

seriously consider my suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have given this example so that we can accept a new

culture,  new  technology, new science and even a  new  material

life, but we must always preserve our own values.  Singapore  21

vision wants to transform us into a dynamic metropolis.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>

The  standard of material life of Singaporeans will be  upgraded

to  a  higher  level.   Materially, it is a  good  prospect  for

Singapore  and it is what our Singaporeans want to pursue.   But

we  must ensure that when the material life has changed, our new

generation of Singaporeans will be corrupted, and their original

fine traditional values will not be changed.  So I would like to

remind  the Government that when we are pursuing this  Singapore

21 vision, we must continue to inculcate in our young people the

five  core  values.  Otherwise, when the 21st century  comes  to

Singapore,   Singapore  may  have  succeeded  in   becoming   an

international  metropolis but it will  also  become  a  rootless

duckweed  or  a  kite without a string attached  -  aimless  and

disoriented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we also encourage our old people to look

after  their grandchildren.  When their parents are out at work,

more  often than not, the young children are being looked  after

by  the  maids.  In the developed Singapore, young parents  will

continue  to  work  outside to maintain their  family  life  and

economy.  Grandparents will naturally become the best choice for

looking after their grandchildren.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After I became a grandfather, I began to realise the joy

that I have in spending time with my grandchildren.  I feel that

older  people can continue to work and contribute to the family,

the society and the country, especially when most of the elderly

people  are  very  healthy and strong.   If  you  want  them  to

completely retire at 55 or 62 years old and do nothing, I  think

it  is  a waste of manpower to Singapore.  So whether it is  the

Government  departments or private sector,  we  should  consider

encouraging older people to continue working.  If they prefer to

stay  at  home,  we should encourage them  to look  after  their

grandchildren.  It is a good arrangement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always tell my wife that while I have been quite

successful in my business, my success pales in the face of  what

she has done in looking after and bringing up the children.   So

I hope that she will be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>

able  to  make  good  use  of  her experience  and   methods  to

continue looking after the grandchildren.  I feel that our third

generation  can  also  grow  up  to  succeed  like  our   second

generation.  I think that will be an ideal situation.  So I hope

that  the  Singapore 21 Committee will continue to preserve  the

fine  traditions of Singapore, and that is, we must  look  after

both the spiritual and the material aspects of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the S21 Committee has also stated

that  everyone in Singapore matters.  We must be  more  open  in

looking  at  success, not just to measure success  in  terms  of

economic  or academic achievements.  I agree with this  view  of

the  Committee.   In  the  past, we were stressing  elitism  and

scholarship, scholars and successful people.  I do not deny  the

importance  of  elitism.   I  do  not  deny  that  scholars  are

successful  people.   But  if  we  over-emphasise  elitism   and

scholars,  we  are  actually  hurting  the  pride  of   95%   of

Singaporeans.    Because  we  cannot   deny   that   these   95%

Singaporeans  who  are  neither  elite  nor  scholars  are  also

successful people in their own ways and they may also  have  the

potential  to  become outstanding people one of these  days.  In

other  words,  if  we over-emphasise elitism, scholarships,  the

success of scholars, and so on, 95% of Singaporeans will feel or

be made to feel that they are failures.  Therefore, if a country

or  a company is facing difficulty, the responsibility will rest

on  the shoulders of only a few people.  Most Singaporeans  will

not  share  such a responsibility or participate in solving  the

problem.   I am glad that this Committee has taken an open  view

on  the  criteria for success.  I hope that we will not use  the

same  kind  of  mindset or measure as the only  way  to  measure

success of a person.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I can be said to be a rare species

in  Parliament because I am the only non-graduate among all  the

Members of the ruling Party in this House.  Although I am not  a

graduate,  in  my past few years in Parliament, I think  I  have

performed  equally  well on the same kind of  work  done  by  my

colleagues in this House.  I always feel that although I may not

be a graduate, I want to do as well as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>

the  graduates.  So my pressure is greater because  our  society

has  this kind of mindset about elitism and scholars.  I am  not

one of the elites and I am not one of the scholars.  I have been

relying  on  my  hard work, my pragmatism to work  hard  and  to

achieve my success, and I am proud of my own achievements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I entirely agree with the S21

Committee  that everyone matters in Singapore.  That is  a  very

important point.  To me, every Singaporean is important  to  the

country.  Every  Singaporean can also play  his  own  role,  and

contribute  to the success and development of Singapore.   As  a

matter of fact, anybody can become a successful person, be it  a

hawker,  a  driver, or an ordinary  worker.  We must  let  every

Singaporean  give full play to his own talent and potential  and

let  the society, the country, his own family, benefit from  his

talent.   While we are marching into the 21st century,  we  must

exercise more tolerance to accept the failures of other  people.

We  must  continue to encourage those who are not successful  to

continue  to attempt.  That will make Singapore more  successful

in the 21st century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the S21 Committee mentions about

the   Singapore   heartbeat,  to  make  all  Singaporeans   feel

passionately about Singapore.  With more intensive globalisation

and  regionalisation, more Singaporeans will  go  overseas.   To

ensure that when they are overseas, their hearts are still  with

Singapore   and  regard  Singapore  as  their  home   and   make

contributions  to  Singapore,  we  must  strengthen  our  social

cohesion.   The Ministry of Education has decided  to  introduce

National  Education to our primary schools.  I think this  is  a

very  wise  move.   If  everybody in Singapore  understands  the

history  and the thinking of our leaders in Singapore,  the  new

generation  of  Singaporeans will  be  able  to  understand  the

challenges  facing  us and will also be able to  appreciate  our

vulnerability in this environment.  This will be very  important

in  building  up  mutual confidence within the  people  and  the

country.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Committee to urge Singaporeans overseas to

have  more contact with one another, and to form more friendship

clubs among themselves.  More Singaporeans overseas will be able

to  exchange ideas to help each other, to meet together so as to

promote  and  celebrate  our  own  festivals  and  our  cultural

heritage.  I hope that our TCS network would facilitate overseas

Singaporeans  with the means to access our TV  programmes,  news

reports   and   bulletins,  and  all  kinds   of   entertainment

programmes.   TCS should simplify its procedures for application

and  payment of fees.  Through these TCS channels,  we  will  be

able  to unite them together to enhance their cohesion with  the

country  in Singapore.  Today, we cannot just depend  on  laksa,

mee  siam, roti prata, bak kuh teh and Teochew fishball or  char

kuay  teow,   to  retain  the  emotional  ties  of  Singaporeans

overseas.   Because  when I was in Shanghai, Melbourne  or  Palo

Alto  in the United States, I could easily enjoy the local  food

in the open-air Singaporean restaurants.  Therefore, in the 21st

century,  like in the past, if we were to  depend  on  Singapore

food  to  retain  our roots, that would not be enough  and   not

realistic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it is also mentioned in the Report that

we must let Singaporeans cultivate the international vision from

young  and  encourage our students to cultivate  the  spirit  of

adventure. I would like to stress the meaning of venture spirit.

Many  people  say  that entrepreneurs should  have  the  venture

spirit  but  the so-called "venture" has normally  been  wrongly

perceived  as a kind of "big stake gambling".  I think  that  is

wrong.   I hope that our schools would inculcate in our students

the  venture  spirit.   We  should have  very  special  ways  of

teaching.   I  feel  that venture spirit  is  something  out  of

boldness,  it  is a kind of courage, and a kind of optimism  for

future  vision.   It  is a kind of ideology;  it  is  not  50-50

gambling, not fatalism but a sure-win kind of spirit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with this kind of spirit, when we are creating or

endeavouring to achieve something, we train our entrepreneurs to

make a decision.  At times, it takes some very strong nerves  to

make major decisions that determine our fate in the future.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>

When  we  are facing adversity, we must be able to use  all  our

efforts  and  talent to overcome it.  So we must  have  a  great

ambition  in our career and business, and translate our ambition

into  reality.   It is not empty talk.  It is not  just  talking

without  doing  it  or just dreaming.  So you  can  say  that  a

genuine  adventurer is both a dreamer and a realist, because  he

is  able  to translate his imagination into reality.  Later  on,

after  the  children  have  grown  up,  when  they  start  their

enterprises or when they have to make some major decisions, they

will  not treat the venture spirit as a big-stake gambling or  a

life-and-death battle in life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the S21

report.  However, while we strive to realize our vision for  the

21st  century, we must never lose sight of the five core  values

and  the  excellent traditional cultures of the  various  races,

racial  harmony, religious tolerance,   the vulnerability  of  a

small  country, and the support of a clean government.   I  hope

that  in the 21st century Singapore, the successful Singaporeans

will  continue to help the less successful Singaporeans to  make

them feel the warmth of society and let them feel that Singapore

is  a  place  that  they want to live in.   This  will  be  very

important to the cohesion among Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to quote the late paramount leader of

China, Deng Xiao Peng who called upon the 1.2 billion people  of

China  to  learn  from Singapore.  He said, "We must  adopt  the

strategy of "grabbing with both hands".  With one hand, we  grab

the materialistic civilisation, and with the other hand, we grab

the  spiritual civilisation."  I hope that even after we go into

the  21st  century, Singapore will remain a model for China  and

other countries to emulate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I stand to applaud

the  excellent  work done by the Chairman, the  members  of  the

Singapore 21 Committee and all those who have contributed to the

very   comprehensive  report  on  how  we  may  strengthen   the

"heartware" of Singapore in the 21st century.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five areas of study revealed many important

observations  and I am glad that the Committee has  put  forward

many apt and appropriate responses to them.  Sir, if we can  act

constructively  on the various recommendations  offered  by  the

Committee, Singapore would definitely be an even better home for

its people in the next century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly drawn to the section on "Strong families:

our  foundation and our future" and I cannot agree more with the

"Subject Committee Recommendations" which say,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With an ageing population, there will be fewer working

adults to cater for the aged parents.  To ensure that this  does

not strain the family too much in the future, some messages must

be taught and absorbed now:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Lead a healthy lifestyle to prevent illness in old age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Save for old age. Plan our finances now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. No one is too old to learn. Focus not on what we

cannot do, but on what we can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The elderly are not a burden, but a resource. Whatever

our age, we can still contribute."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like us to go on to the

next  steps  and translate the recommendations into reality.   I

would suggest some further ways to translate the recommendations

into  practice in this area.  I felt that for us to realise  our

set  targets  and ideals, careful planning, good management  and

critical  follow-up must be put in place.  We  must,  therefore,

set  up the machinery for committees with dedicated members, who

have  clear  visions of our needs, to follow and  implement  the

above recommendations through one of our Ministries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On "leading healthy lifestyles", island-wide dissemination

of   information  on  healthy  living  and  preventive  care  is

required.  Provision in this area is very much lacking  now  and

should  be  given much more emphasis if we were  to  attain  our

goals.   In the past, there was more emphasis on providing  care

for  the  results  of  ailments.  The more correct  path  is  on

preventing the onset of ailments in the first place.   We  must,

therefore, put constructive ideas to work and reap the resultant

benefits.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1401</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On "saving for old age", apart from re-enforcing the

mindset  of  self-reliance upon retirement,  providing  for  and

encouraging  participation in different types of  insurance  and

annuity  packages for old age savings should  be  enhanced.   To

encourage  more people to save for this purpose, the  Government

should  seriously consider tax exemption on interest  earned  on

annuity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On "no one is too old to learn" and the "the elderly are

not  a  burden but a resource", a lot will depend on how we  can

change  the  mindset  of  the people, and  on  the  creation  of

opportunities  and making these opportunities available  to  the

elderly.   Many of our elderly want to continue contributing  to

the  society  and  are willing to learn.  They, however,  cannot

find  the  avenues  to do so.  I suggest that  we  identify  the

vocations  that  are suitable for them, create,  or  even  leave

niche areas for them to fit in.  We may then also have to create

the channels to train them.  If I may say so, there is no reason

to exclude them as part of the future knowledge-based economy of

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beseech this House to

wholeheartedly  aim for the "Singapore - Our Best  Home"  dream.

The  many recommendations made by the Singapore 21 Committee are

but  a foretaste of this dream.  Nevertheless, it is a dream  we

can  realise.  Yes, we can realise this dream with a people  who

are  focused  on a vision and are willing to work and  chase  it

with a united and wholehearted effort.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, I rise in support of the motion standing  in  the

name of Minister Teo Chee Hean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mid-80s, the Government developed Vision 1999 which

was  the blueprint the second generation leaders embarked on  to

make  Singapore a global city and to bring about high  standards

of living and material well-being for all Singaporeans.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1402</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, we have achieved much of what they had set out

to achieve, and much more.  We are admired the world over by our

perceivably miraculous economic achievements.  Sir, in spite  of

our  material  and economic success, or perhaps because  of  its

over-emphasis,  we  have  not  given  sufficient  attention   in

developing  the heartware  of Singaporeans, as the Minister  has

pointed out in his opening address.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we rank among the top few countries in the world,

in  terms of GNP per capita, we have a long way to go before  we

improve our social norms, like keeping our public toilets  clean

or being more considerate in how we stuff our plates in a buffet

meal.  Although we have one of the world's most successful  home

ownership programmes in the world, we have a lot to do to deepen

the  rootedness of Singaporeans.  Although we have an  able  and

honest Government in power for many years, we have much to do to

generate active participation of Singaporeans in civil life  and

in community development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is therefore timely that the Singapore 21 Report

has  been  tabled  in Parliament.  I would like to  congratulate

Minister  Teo  and his committee and all Singaporeans  who  have

contributed  for their excellent, comprehensive, innovative  and

thought-provoking report.  While the report reaffirms our ideals

of   meritocracy,  racial  harmony,  strong  leadership  and   a

Government free from corruption, it articulates a vision of five

ideals for every Singaporean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch just on one ideal which, to me,

is  indeed very important in shaping future Singapore, that  is,

building stronger families.  We are all aware of the concept  of

a family unit as the building block of society.  Strong families

would  lead  to  stronger social fabric and stronger  Singapore.

And yet, the family unit and each constituent family member will

be pulled apart in different directions in the years ahead.  The

dilemma has been well described in the report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, the working parents. Although as individual

Singaporeans, we have all

become  more  affluent,  our pursuit  for  more  affluence  will

certainly be stepped up.  We have become slaves of technology  - the pager, the handphone, the computer, the e-mail  -  all these

have  made  us do much more in much less time.  All  these  mean

that, as an individual, we will work harder than ever before  to

better  ourselves to become more affluent so that  our  families

can  have  it better.  Ironically, the very desire to do  better

for  ourselves and our families pulls us away from our families.

Working  harder  means less time spent with  the  family.   When

husbands   and   wives   spend   less   time   together,    more

misunderstandings  occur and carried to  its  extreme,  divorces

will increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, children. With society's emphasis on education and

rapid  advances  in IT, it will make growing up for  children  a

stressful  experience.  The peer pressure and  competition  will

mean  that parents will need to spend much more time with  their

children.  When parents cannot be around because of their  work,

their   children  will  be  open  to  more  influences,  perhaps

undesirable  influences,  in this era of  Internet  and  digital

convergence.  Our moral fabric, our Asian values, our traditions

can indeed be diluted and perhaps disappear altogether.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the elder parents. The elder parents will find

themselves  in  retirement villages in a  world  of  their  own,

fending  almost for themselves as their children are  busy  with

their own careers or their own nuclear family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the S21 Committee makes broad recommendations as to

how  everyone,  individuals, society  and  the  Government,  can

contribute  and do their part in building strong families.   But

what  is  going  to  be extremely difficult  to  do  is  whether

families  can  find  the balance between  building  careers  and

affluence  with building a strong and caring family,  against  a

backdrop  of  economic  and  social  pressures  that  exist   in

Singapore.   And this is the crux of the issue.  Our Government,

and  quite  rightly  so,  has pushed for  economic  success  and

excellence  in  every  sphere of activity for  more  than  three

decades.  Could we in the near future let

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1404</b></font><br><br>

up  and  say it is good enough to run in the second  league?   I

think it is not going to be that simple.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agree that individuals and society must do their

part, I think the Government must steer the move to build strong

families  with the same vigour it has demonstrated  in  building

our  economic success.  This would mean that fundamental changes

to  policies and radical approaches would be necessary.  Various

Ministries  presently cater to different aspects of family  life

in   Singapore.    For   example,  the  Ministry   of   National

Development, through HDB, caters to various needs of housing for

families, looking into multi-generational flats, and so on;  the

Ministry of Health looks at family healthy lifestyle, and so on;

the  Ministry of Education looks into the needs of children; the

Ministry of Manpower, among other things, is looking into how to

provide flexible work arrangements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not enough for each of these Ministries to work

in  isolation  to  tackle different aspects of  family  life  in

Singapore.   What  is  necessary is to  initiate  bilateral  and

multilateral  inter-Ministry committees so that various  aspects

of  family life can be looked upon from a holistic point of view

as   policies  then  can  be  formulated  in  building  stronger

families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore 21 Committee, as the Chairman has

explained,  does not set any milestones or targets and  for  the

reasons  he  has explained, and we agree with him.  But  I  feel

that  building  strong families is a very important  aspect  for

Singapore's  continued success and existence.  I would  like  to

urge the Government to follow up the Singapore 21 Report with  a

Family  21 Committee so that more concrete and targeted measures

can  be  worked  out  and we can take Singapore  into  the  21st

century  with  stronger families which will lead to  a  stronger

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, I rise to register

my strong and wholehearted support to the motion standing in the

name of the Minister for Education

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1405</b></font><br><br>

and  the  Chairman of the Singapore 21 Committee, RAdm Teo  Chee

Hean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Co-Chairman of the subject committee on Less Stressful

Life versus Retaining the Drive, I have had the benefit of being

part  of  the Singapore 21 process.  It has undoubtedly  been  a

very  rewarding and enriching process as the dozen or so members

of  the  committee deliberated and argued passionately with  one

another over the dilemma.  Discussions held with focus groups of

people  from  a wide range of backgrounds were also intense  and

sometimes even heated, but at the end of the day, it was  always

all smiles for everyone.  Why?  Because all participants knew it

was for Singapore and its future.  The key idea that came out of

our  discussion was "Every Singaporean Matters".  Let me briefly

share with this House what led to this idea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Committee recognised that Singapore, as a small nation,

is   inextricably  tied  to  the  global  economic  system  and,

therefore,  has to meet the challenges of competing  within  the

constraints of the new global arena, or perish.  Thus, Singapore

has  no choice and the economics of survival is, and will always

be, Singapore's key priority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Singapore has not only survived economically, but also

actually flourished against the odds, is a legitimate source  of

pride  for Singaporeans.  Singapore can now look beyond survival

and aspire towards being a world-class city.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This phenomenal success, however, has come with a cost - stress. Singaporeans complain about information overload,

pressures  on  time and the sense that they are losing  control.

Mrs  Lim  Hwee Hua, my co-chair in this Committee,  has  earlier

spoken  about stress faced by children and students  in  school.

Adults  too  are  subject to stress both as a worker  and  as  a

parent.   Added stress comes from having to juggle  these  roles

within time and energy constraints.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stress also comes from what some people term "the system"

in Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1406</b></font><br><br>

These  include a preference for paper qualifications  over  work

experience, the equating of staying late with working  hard  and

older workers feeling threatened by younger ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy on attracting foreign talent is also felt as a

source  of stress.  While Singaporeans appreciate the  need  for

talent  at  the  national  level,  they  cannot  help  but  feel

threatened at the individual level.  Lower educated Singaporeans

fear  their  jobs  may be lost to lower-priced, better  educated

foreigners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who took heed of the Government's encouragement

to  go  regional, added stress comes from the need  to  re-align

family  commitments  and schedules, and  adapting  to  an  alien

culture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At home, the pressure faced by school-going children

translates  into  pressure  on  the  parent,  especially  during

examination times.  Adults also face the pressure of keeping  up

with  the Joneses, for instance, making sure that their children

keep  up  with  the  rest,  matching  Reebok  with  Reebok   and

Montessori with Montessori.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a citizen of this country, Singaporeans subject

themselves to high expectations from the State itself.   Regular

exhortations by leaders to excel are cited as sources of stress.

Then,  there is also the feeling that the individual Singaporean

is   being  forced  into  prescribed  moulds,  which  in  a  way

reinforces the sense of helplessness among some Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A survey conducted by the Singapore 21 Committee indeed

found  that more than half of Singaporeans feel keenly and  were

anxious about the rapid pace of change here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a general consensus that success is defined too

narrowly   in   Singapore,  based  on  academic   and   material

benchmarks.  And as individuals derive their sense of self-worth

from  these  benchmarks, the resultant effect  is  stress.   The

narrow  boundaries  of  these  benchmarks  unfortunately  cannot

accommodate many people.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1407</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on the positive side, this narrow definition has

helped to maintain our country's competitive edge by the pursuit

of  excellence  in the academic sphere and at the workplace,  it

has  also led to some undesirable social consequences.  Some  of

these  ill  effects  include  being an  unforgiving  society,  a

culture  of risk aversion, under-utilisation of talent  and  the

loss of buzz.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It results in people unconsciously applying a narrow view

of the achievements of others by virtue of they themselves being

narrowly  judged of their own success in life by others.   There

is a lack of diversity and a tolerance for second chances.  As a

result, passion in what one likes or enjoys doing is compromised

for  something  which  is accepted as a  conventional  norm.   A

potentially  first  rate violinist becomes a  second-rate,  say,

economist instead!  People become afraid to take risk because of

fear of failure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in our pursuit of a knowledge-based economy where

creativity, innovation and technopreneurship are encouraged, the

old way we look at success is no longer relevant nor healthy for

Singapore.  We need a new mindset in how we look at success.  It

must  extend  beyond  material and academic success  to  embrace

achievements in all fields of human endeavour, so that people do

not treat the pursuit of material life as an end in itself.   No

job, whether it is a cleaner or a gardener, should be viewed  as

too low where one cannot apply knowledge and excellence to it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As individuals, we need to realise that stress and drive

are  not  at opposite ends.  After all, not all stress  is  bad.

Like cholesterol, we should optimise good stress and get rid  of

the  bad.   We  need to learn to de-stress and  not  succumb  to

distress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to be passionate in the pursuit of our own goals

and  have the courage to choose our own path, even if it is  one

which is not frequently travelled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall being fascinated by Sir Edmund Hillary, the first

man to conquer Mount

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>

Everest,  when I was a student.  By coincidence, his achievement

is  being disputed in the papers today.  His passion, dedication

and  obsession  to  his pursuits - which included  climbing  the

highest  mountain  in the world at 28,028 feet,  the  height  at

which modern jetliners today typically cruise - often struck awe

and  admiration in me.  Today, of course, we have our  very  own

Khoo Swee Chiow who, as if conquering Everest was not enough, is

now  intent on leading a team of Singaporeans to the South Pole.

Then,  there was David Bellamy, the botanist.  I used  to  enjoy

watching  him  on television, either picking up  some  worms  or

fingering  some leaves in some off-the-beaten-track places.   It

was  evident  that both had natural passion for what  they  were

doing.   Because of that, watching them at work became enjoyable

too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Sir Hillary and Bellamy, having a sense of passion for

what  we do is now a quality which we need to cultivate, as  the

new  millennium draws near.  Our country's dependence  on  human

resources makes the need for passion even more pertinent.  If we

couple  working hard with a strong passion in whatever  work  we

undertake,  the result can be astounding.  Because with  passion

comes not only dedication but also creativity and the desire  to

innovate, and be different from others.  Passion which  is  akin

to  "intense  interest" paves the way for  "true  expertise"  to

eventually  emerge, as Prime Minister Goh puts  it.   Being  the

best we can be then comes quite naturally.  This is what we need

in our pursuit of a knowledge-based economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with this, if our society could begin appreciating

unconventional  accomplishments, such as those who  successfully

climbed  Everest  or  become a renowned violinist,  and  if  our

Government  helps lead the way in propagating the  message  that

talents  and  abilities  are  not  just  confined  to  top-notch

scholars  or  bankers, and if we begin to  readily  accept  that

failure  opens doors to successes and there is room  for  second

chances  in  our pursuits, then there is hope that  we  can  get

individuals  to  unleash  the  best  in  whatever  areas   their

potential leads to.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>

There  is hope that everyone could believe that each has a  role

and part to play and their contribution, no matter how small, is

valued.   Then  there is hope for Singaporeans  to  accept  that

"Every Singaporean truly Matters".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have just briefly spoken on one of the key ideas of

the  Singapore 21 Vision - Every Singaporean Matters.  I am sure

my  other  counterparts  from the Singapore  21  Committee  will

elaborate  on  the  other four.  As the Prime Minister  stressed

during its launch about two weeks ago, unlike Vision 1999,  this

is  the  people's vision and not one crafted by the  Government.

It  is  forceful,  comprehensive and  inspiring,  motivated  for

change forged by 6,000 serious Singaporeans who have gone beyond

material and academic pursuits to emotional, spiritual, cultural

and social fulfilment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Asad Latiff puts it, it is a product of social

tripartism  -  a  partnership between the  public,  private  and

people sectors, what if I may call, a new tripartism formula for

the  21st  century.  This is where we need to  construct  a  new

model to harmonise the three sectors in such a way that we  pull

and  involve each and every Singaporean so that each  and  every

one of us could make the difference.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, we have forged the new Vision for the 21st

Century  but to make the difference we must now act on  it.   In

conclusion,  allow  me to quote Joel Arthur Barker,  a  renowned

futurist.  He said, "Vision without action will remain a  dream.

Action  without vision just passes the time.  Vision with Action

can  change the world."  Let us together make the difference for

Singapore.

<div align="center"><b>ILL DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOLS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Minister for Education

whether  ill discipline is rising in schools and among  students

outside schools, and what measures are being taken to help  stem

such incidence.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>State Of Discipline In Schools</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall state of discipline in our schools is good.

Serious cases of breach of discipline are infrequent.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE has implemented the Behaviour Tracking and Analysis

(BETA)  system in schools since 1995.  The system collects  data

on  the  state of discipline in individual schools.  For primary

schools,  misdemeanours  such  as  not  doing  assignments   and

disruptive    behaviour,   and   attendance-related    offences,

constitute  84% of all the recorded offences. In  the  secondary

schools,  74%  of the offences were attendance-related,  namely,

late-coming and truancy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BETA records show no significant statistical change in

the offence rates from 1995 to 1997.  "Offence rates" refers  to

the  number of offences per 1000 pupils. The data for 1998  show

the   number  of  serious  offences  such  as  gangsterism   and

possession of weapons remaining close to that of 1997,  and  the

number  of cases of substance abuse falling from 272 in 1997  to 40

in 1998. However, the incidence of smoking has risen from 14

per  1000 pupils over the three years 1995 -1997 to 19 per  1000

pupils in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall offence rate for boys has remained stable over

the  years, but a worrying trend is the increasing offence  rate

for  girls in the secondary schools. Though lower than the  male

offence rates, the female offence rates have increased by 6%  to 9%

per year over the last 4 years, going up from 300 in 1995 to 456

in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A committee chaired by the Senior Minister of State for

Education,  Dr Aline Wong, was set up in May last year  to  look

into  the  discipline  situation among  girls  in  schools.  The

committee is finalising its recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Measures To Address Discipline in Schools</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry's philosophy is that to care is to discipline.

Schools by and large take a whole-person approach to discipline.

They have many programmes and support structures to help promote

discipline.  Besides  the creation of the  posts  of  Discipline

Master,   Head/Pupil  Welfare  and,  most  recently,  Operations

Manager, there is also the Voluntary Special Constabulary Scheme

where teachers assume the mantle of law enforcement officers  to

help reinforce an orderly school environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers have been equipped with basic counselling skills

and  many  spend  much  time counselling errant  students.  Such

efforts are complemented by programmes like life skills and peer

mediation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, discipline of students is not just the

responsibility   of  schools.  Parents  must  remain   primarily

responsible for their children, particularly outside  of  school

hours.  While the Ministry does not have data on  ill-discipline

outside  school, schools do work closely with the  Neighbourhood

Police Posts through the NPP-School Link-Up Scheme. Many schools

also  mount  before-and-after-school programmes  to  keep  their

students gainfully engaged in school activities.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately though, schools need the support, co-operation and understanding of parents and the community to

insist  on  good  discipline. With the  benefit  of  advice  and

feedback  from COMPASS - the Committee on Community and  Parents

in  Support  of  Schools, the Ministry  will  work  towards  the

greater  involvement of parents and the community  in  promoting

good discipline in and outside the school environment.

<div align="center"><b>INCIDENCE OF CRIME BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

whether  the  incidence  of  crime  by  illegal  immigrants   or

overstayers has risen over the last twelve months and what steps

are being taken to keep such incidence in check.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incidence of crime by illegal immigrants and

overstayers  has  remained low.  In 1998, the number  of  crimes

committed by immigration offenders was about 250.  This is about

0.5% of the total number of seizable offences reported in 19981.

Of  the 1929 foreigners arrested for crimes in 1998, 210 (10.9%)

were  illegal immigrants and 46 (2.4%) were overstayers.   These

immigration  offenders were mostly involved in  minor  offences,

such as shoplifting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not practical to devise specific measures targeted

only at the immigration offenders involved in crime.  Hence,  my

Ministry's  approach  is  to deter and  take  tough  enforcement

action against all immigration offenders in Singapore.  In  this

regard,  we have enhanced the penalties in the Immigration  Act.

Immigration  officers  have stepped up their  vigilance  at  our

checkpoints,  the Coast Guard has intensified  its  patrols  and

surveillance of suspicious activities at sea, and the Police has

conducted islandwide raids at suspected places of refuge.   This

has  led  to  a  record high of 23,000 in the  total  number  of

illegal immigrants and overstayers arrested in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Home Team will maintain its enforcement efforts to

ensure   that  the  immigration  offender  situation   and   the

associated crime problems remain firmly under control.

<div align="center"><b>FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for National

Development whether there is any danger of the foot and mouth

disease spreading to Singapore from Malaysia in view of the

recent outbreak of the virus in Negri Sembilan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foot and mouth disease (FMD) is a serious viral disease

affecting  cloven hoof animals such as cattle, pigs,  sheep  and

goats.   However, FMD does not affect humans and is,  therefore,

not  a  health  risk to the general public.   I  would  like  to

clarify that the Foot and Mouth Disease is totally unrelated  to

the human disease called Hand-Foot-and-Mouth disease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have managed to keep Singapore free from FMD over the

years  even  though  it is endemic in the region.   To  maintain

Singapore's  FMD free status, the Primary Production  Department

(PPD)  allows cloven hoof animals to be imported from  FMD  free

sources  only.   As for Malaysia, PPD only allows  imports  from

accredited  farms  in  the  FMD free  areas.   Upon  arrival  in

Singapore,  the animal consignments are inspected for  signs  of

disease.  In addition, animals, such as dairy cattle, brought in

from FMD free countries for breeding and production are required

to  go  through  at  least 30 days of on-farm  quarantine  in  a

specified isolated area.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is free from FMD. I see no reason why we cannot

maintain this position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current ban on the import of pigs, cattle, horses,

dogs,  cats and other mammals from Malaysia imposed by PPD since

19th  March  1999  for the pig problem will  also  be  effective

against  the  spread of foot and mouth disease  to  the  animals

here.
