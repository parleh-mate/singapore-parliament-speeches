<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia</b> asked the

Minister  for  National Development and Communications

whether  it is proposed to construct bus-bays and  bus

shelters along Avenues 1, 3 and 6, Ang Mo Kio, and  to

provide a bus shelter at the temporary bus terminus at

Ang Mo Kio New Town.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang (Senior Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng Liang) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Sir, there are already six bus-bays

and  two bus shelters along Avenue 3 and Avenue 6  Ang

Mo  Kio. In addition, the Public Works Department will

be  constructing four bus shelters along Avenue 1  and

Avenue 3 this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Works Department is also looking into the

possibility  of providing a temporary bus  shelter  at

the temporary bus terminus at Ang Mo Kio New Town.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia</b> asked the Minister for National

Development and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>



Communications  what  sort of recreational  facilities

are being planned on the vacant site in front of Block

214,  Avenue  3,  Ang Mo Kio, and when  they  will  be

ready.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Sir, there is a

proposal  to  turn the vacant site in front  of  Block

214,  Avenue  3,  Ang Mo Kio, into an open  field  for

outdoor  games. The construction of the open field  is

expected to be completed by the middle of this year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, in addition to

the playing field to be constructed at the vacant land

fronting  Block  214, is there any  plan  to  build  a

sports complex in the Ang Mo Kio constituency?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, the vacant land referred to

by   the  Member  for  Ang  Mo  Kio  is  actually   in

Neighbourhood II of Ang Mo Kio New Town. However,  the

HDB  will be looking into the construction of a sports

complex in Neighbourhood III. The area for this sports

complex  is under clearance at the moment, and because

it  is  heavily encumbered it will take some time  for

this  project to be completed. However, it is expected

that tenders will probably be invited sometime towards

the end of this year, and it is hoped that this sports

complex would be ready by 1980.

<div align="center"><b>(Industrial development)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia</b> asked the

Minister  for  National Development and Communications

if  he will enlighten the House on the different types

of  industries planned for the industrial site in  Ang

Mo Kio New Town and when construction is expected to be

completed;  and  whether the Housing  and  Development

Board  will liaise with the Economic Development Board

on  the  possibility of setting up  factories  in  the

area.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Sir, approximately 100 hectares of

land has been set aside for industrial development  in

Ang Mo Kio New Town. Generally, the type of industries

to be set up should not pose any pollution problem and

should provide job opportunities for the residents  in

Ang Mo Kio New Town.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cater for the small industries, terrace factories

for   metal   workshops,   carpentry   workshops   and

engineering  workshops will be constructed  in  stages

from  this year 1977 to 1979. Some vacant sites  will

also be set aside for leasing to light industries. The

specific  types  of  industries  will  depend  on  the

recommendation of the Economic Development  Board  and

the  acceptance  of the various relevant  Authorities,

such  as Anti-Pollution Unit, Public Health Department

and Factory Inspectorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board is liaising

closely  with  the Economic Development Board  on  the

development of these industrial sites.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head N (cont.) -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head N be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead ADA 1101*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Dr Ong

Leong Boon.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1975 13,966 accidents were reported to the

Workmen's  Compensation Section. Of these, 3,278  were

reported  under the new Act which came into  force  in

that year. When the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1971

was  repealed and the 1975 Act came into being,  among

other   things,   the  new  Act  included   industrial

dermatitis  and noise-induced deafness as  compensable

diseases.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>



This  was  in  line  with  the  Ministry's  policy  to

continue  in  its  effort to improve  the  health  and

welfare  of  workers and to bring the  legislation  in

line  with  the  modern  working  environment  -  that

utilises chemicals and other irritants that can  cause

serious  skin  ailments if workers are  not  protected

against  them  through barrier creams  or  appropriate

gloves.  In addition the high noise levels in  certain

manufacturing sectors could probably deafen workers if

they are not adequately protected with ear protection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of this legislation, Sir, I

believe  that some cases of industrial dermatitis  and

noise-induced deafness must have been compensated. The

latest  Ministry of Labour annual report.  1975, does

not  carry  any figures of compensation paid  out  for

these  two  compensable diseases. Perhaps  it  is  too

early  for such cases to have emerged, as the law  was

only  then  three months' old. But as the 1976  annual

report is not available (I do not know whether  it  is

still  being printed or being prepared), I would  like

to  know  the latest figures of compensation paid  out

and  the  number  of cases concerned, separately,  in

respect  of  these  two  diseases,  since  they   were

included in the Schedule to the Workmen's Compensation

Act as compensable diseases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister also enlighten the House whether

these  workers obtained alternative employment or  are

still  employed in the same establishment  where  they

contracted the diseases? If they are still employed by

the  same employer, are they in the same jobs as  they

were prior to contracting these diseases?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Sir, I am raising the

question  in relation to the workings of the Workmen's

Compensation Act. As we know, the patients, i.e, the

workers, are submitted to medical examination and  the

extent  of permanent or temporary incapacity  is  then

certified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here a copy of the Workmen's Compensation

Guide  and  a  copy  of the medical  report  (standard

format)  upon  which  doctors  have  to  fill  in  the

particulars. I am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>



suggesting  here  that  the  present  format  for  the

operation  of the Workmen's Compensation  Act  is  not

sufficient and does not give a clear-cut indication as

to  the workings of the Workmen's Compensation Act. It

is  not my intention to question the quantum of  award

for  workmen's compensation. Neither am I  questioning

the guidelines for the award for specific loss of limb

or  part of it, although I have my own reservation  on

some   of   these  guidelines.  I  am  referring,   in

particular, to this format which the certifying doctor

will  have to fill in, and this can be improved if  it

could  be  better tabulated in terms of  temporary  or

permanent loss. On top of this, in the interest of the

injured  person, a form of Compensation Medical  Board

should be established. This would then allow for  more

equitable,    more   expert   and    fairer    medical

certification  for  injuries  sustained  or   diseases

contracted  during employment. We know at the  present

moment,  all  and sundry among the medical  profession

attend  to  workmen's compensation. This  ranges  from

expert  professors  and  consultants  to  very   young

doctors who have barely one year's medical experience.

I  could  quote examples where a workman who  deserved

only  5%  compensation award was granted 60%.  On  the

other  hand  the injured person who deserved  30%  was

given just 5% compensation. Therefore, in the interest

of  the  injured person, may I kindly suggest  that  a

Workmen's Compensation Board be established.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are insufficient guidelines provided for other

elements  like emotional or ethnic characteristics  of

the  injured  person. This is important  because  very

often  if  an  injured person knows  how  to  play  up

certain residual symptoms, he or she tends to get away

with  more  awards.  I  therefore  suggest  that  some

guidelines in this direction be provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other matter, which we are all familiar with, is

that   the   injured  resort  to  cultural   medicinal

practitioners. Very often we do face this problem  and

as  a  result of mismanagement the result of treatment

is  appalling,  and  yet  the same  person  comes  and

expects to be compensated for this. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>



think  some guidelines too should be provided in  this

direction. I am making this request, bearing  in  mind

the  interest of the injured person and  in  the  name

affair play.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Sir, may I first deal

with  the points raised by the hon. Member for  Potong

Pasir.  Briefly,  the  Member is  concerned  with  two

matters,  that  is, industrial dermatitis  and  noise-induced  deafness. For the benefit of Members  of  the

House,  industrial  dermatitis  simply  means  a  skin

disease.  So  I prefer to use this term  from  now  on

instead   of  using  the  technical  term.  Industrial

dermatitis  and noise-induced deafness were  added  to

the  list  of compensable occupational diseases  under

the  Workmen's Compensation Act, 1975.  It  came  into

operation on the 1st October of that year.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On skin diseases, the Ministry has not conducted any

survey  recently  but the figures of notification  for

the   past  two  years  for  these  two  diseases  are

available, and for the information of Members they are

as follows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 9 cases of skin diseases in 1975 and 187

in  1976.  For  noise-induced deafness,  no  case  was

registered  in  1975 and 912 cases  were  detected  in

1976.  Hon.  Members  should not be  alarmed  by  this

figure as I will explain further on this. 870 of these

were early cases and only 42 cases were what we regard

as  proper cases. So do not be alarmed with  the  high

figure.  The reason for the increase in the number  of

skin  diseases  confirmed  in  1976  was  due  to  the

compulsory   reporting  of  these  cases  by   medical

practitioners under the law. Prior to that, there  was

no  requirement. So there might be cases that did  not

come  to the attention of the Ministry of Labour. Most

of  these  skin diseases were due to the  handling  of

engineering oil or some raw materials, about 56.7%  of

them  resulted  from the handling of engineering  oil;

10.7%  from handling of resins; 8.6% due to  solvents;

another  8.6% due to handling of fibreglass;  2.1%  on

cement; 2.1% on paint; and the others about 11.2%



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A programme of prevention has been developed and the

main  task  of  this programme was  the  education  of

workers  to  minimise skin contact with the irritating

and  allergic  substances through the  use  of  proper

protective  covering,  such as  protective  clothings,

aprons,  gloves, face shields and other barrier  cream

which  the Member for Potong Pasir mentioned  earlier.

To  launch  this  programme the Ministry  printed  and

distributed  3,500 copies of a pamphlet on  industrial

skin  diseases in two languages, namely,  Chinese  and

English,  and 1,800 copies of this pamphlet have  been

distributed to the various industries with known risks

of  industrial  skin diseases, such as the  electronic

factories, woodworking where they deal with a  certain

kind   of  adhesive  gum,  cement, paint  and   other

factories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are probably aware that industrial skin

diseases are by and large a transient kind of disease.

They are temporary in the sense that the condition may

last  for  only  a few days to a few  weeks  and  very

rarely  result in residual disability. Once the worker

is  detected  and is removed from the contact  of  the

offending   substance   or  is   isolated   from   the

environment, his condition invariably improves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the great increase of 912 cases of

noise-induced deafness reported was largely due to the

introduction  of  the  mobile  audiometric   screening

programme for the noisy industries. It was started  in

May  1977. The screening programme covered a total  of

1,731  employees from 33 shipyards and  942  employees

from  20 other noisy industries, such as the bottling,

cement  and  concrete  pipe-manufacturing  factories,

etc.  By the end of 1976, a total of 912 noise-induced

deafness  cases were detected. The majority  of  these

cases were in the early stages and only a small number

of  42  cases were severe enough to attract  workmen's

compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has developed a hearing conservation

programme as a preventive measure to control noise-induced deafness. The main emphasis of this hearing

conservation programme, which has been widely

publicised, is to educate and persuade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>



workers  to put on hearing protectors while  at  work.

Noise   control  is  carried  out  only  when  it   is

considered  technically and economically  feasible  by

the factories. Pamphlets on noise-induced deafness  in

three languages. Chinese. English and Malay, and  also

a  booklet on the hearing conservation programme  have

been published and distributed free of charge to those

industries with the risk of hearing loss. About  3,000

of  the  pamphlets  have  been  distributed  to  noisy

factories,  such  as  shipyards, textiles,  metal  and

other manufacturing establishments. Over 600 copies of

the  hearing conservation programme booklets have been

distributed  to  shipyards, metal  can  manufacturing.

woodworking, textile and other factories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage. I might wish to draw a line that the

hearing conservation programme is distinct from  noise

pollution  control. In the United States,  there  were

arguments  as  to whether 90 decibels  should  be  the

accepted norm instead of 85 decibels. So there  was  a

research  trying  to  reduce 90 decibels  down  to  85

decibels  and  they discovered that  for  every  point

reduced  from  90  to 85 decibels it  would  cost  the

industry somewhere around US$2 billion. I do not think

Singapore  has reached that stage to mount that  noise

pollution  control  which is quite distinct  from  the

hearing conservation programme. So we are launching on

a  more practical approach to this problem rather than

throw the problem out of its proportion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to give the hon. Member some statistics

on  the  number of cases of industrial dermatitis  and

also  the  amount of compensation paid.  They  are  as

follows:-

</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now deal with the hon. Member for Kim Seng.

The  Workmen's  Compensation Act  provides  sufficient

basis  and guidelines for the award of loss of earning

capacity  in respect of permanent incapacity  suffered

by  our workmen as a result of injuries while at work.

The First Schedule to the Act specifies the percentage

to  be  awarded  for the loss of use  of  the  various

members  of  the body. The listing in the Schedule  is

very  comprehensive and covers even the loss of  parts

of  a  member,  that  is, for  example,  the  loss  of

phalanx.  There  is  therefore no difficulty  for  the

doctor to make an award for such injuries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I agree with the Member that there are

certain  types  of injuries, such as  those  involving

fractures  or  internal injury which cannot  be  quite

easily  determined as to the loss of capacity. It  may

be  possible to have differing medical assessments  on

the  loss  of  use of the part concerned.  Where  such

differences of opinion occur, although very rarely, it

is  the  practice of the Ministry to refer the injured

workman  for  a final assessment by a specialist.  The

Ministry  is  aware  of  the need  for  uniformity  in

medical assessment for these types of injuries. It is,

in  fact, taking steps to seek the assistance  of  the

Ministry  of Health to draw up guidelines for  doctors

to  follow  on the same basis as those listed  on  the

First Schedule of the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether or not we should constitute a board or

panel. I think the objective is the same. Rather  than

set up another administrative barrier, which may cause

delay to compensation being awarded, I think the  main

objective is to ensure uniformity. I will bear in mind

the  Member's suggestion, which is a good one. We will

look into that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of an injured workman who refuses

treatment, the Workmen's Compensation Act provides for

suspension  of  his  right to  compensation  until  he

offers  himself  for a medical examination.  The  hon.

Member has mentioned that there are a few cases  where

the  injured  worker,  having  submitted  himself  for

treatment, subsequently stopped medication and  sought

the treatment of physicians of traditional methods who

are registered medical.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>



practitioners.  I must say that this  is  a  dangerous

practice  and  the  injury may be aggravated,  and  if

confirmed by the doctor treating him, might result  in

legal  complication and the objection by the insurance

company  on  the quantum of the final compensation.  I

would  appreciate  that if such  cases  do  occur  the

doctor  treating the worker should refer the  case  to

us.  So  far,  there are very, very  few  such  cases,

fortunately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the other irregularity mentioned by

the Member about the differences in the sensitivity to

pain  experienced by different workers, with different

cultural backgrounds, some workers cannot bear to  see

the  sight of an injection needle, it must be  pointed

out  that  workmen's compensation, unlike  the  common

law,  does  not take into consideration such  factors.

The compensation awarded under the Act is based solely

on  the  objective yardstick of the  loss  of  earning

capacity.   Subjective  factors  such  as   pain   and

suffering should not be included in the assessment  of

compensation to be paid under the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have answered the questions raised by the

hon. Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, one point of

clarification.  The  Senior  Parliamentary   Secretary

mentioned  that  the  booklet was published  in  three

languages.  I want to know what are the languages  and

whether Tamil is included.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I am very sorry, Sir. The three

languages    are   English,   Chinese    and    Malay.

Unfortunately,  we left out Tamil because  we  believe

most  of  the Tamil workers do read English.  And  for

reasons  of  cost and coverage, we believe  the  three

languages would suffice to cover the entire workforce.

If  there is a need in some particular industry  where

Tamil  workers  are in the majority, we  will  produce

future booklets with Tamil in mind.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, three points of clarification.

First,  the  Senior  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the

Minister for Labour stated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>



that the noise level of 90 decibels was considered  in

the  United  States  and after  some  discussion  they

decided not to belabour this particular problem due to

its  cost. But I do believe that noise levels are  not

the only ones to be considered but also exposure time.

Maybe  the  Senior  Parliamentary Secretary  had  just

missed  It  out  inadvertently. I believe  it  is  six

hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point with regard to noise-induced

deafness, the quantum of compensation paid out has not

been  answered  by  the  Parliamentary  Secretary.  He

mentioned  about 2,000-plus workers were  screened  by

the audiometric testing facilities at the Ministry.  I

believe   there  are  24,000  workers  in  about   400

factories  with  high  noise  levels.  How  does   the

Ministry intend to cover all these. And when  they  do

so,  will the levels of noise-induced deafness and the

quantum of compensation shoot up to a fantastic  level

that could frighten us?



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, the accepted noise level in

the  United States should not be taken as a yardstick

for  our purpose. In fact, the problem in the  United

States  has  grown beyond the question of  protecting

the  workers.  As I have said, there is a  difference

between   noise   pollution   control   and   hearing

conservation.  We  are adopting hearing  conservation

but  not  noise  pollution  control.  In  the  United

States  this problem has grown far beyond  the  scope

of  industrial  health.  It has  become  a  political

issue  where  even a politician running for a mayor -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Can the Parliamentary Secretary

cut it short?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, as to the question of the

amount of compensation paid. I am afraid that up  till

now  no compensation has been paid to any of those  42

cases. They are still under medical assessment. To  be

fair  to  the  workers, we need to observe  them,  and

until such time when the doctor is satisfied that they

deserve  a  certain  percentage of compensation,  they

shall be paid according to the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was not talking

about  noise level. I was talking about exposure time.

Could  the Parliamentary Secretary clarify this point?

When  he  spoke about 90 decibels, that is  the  noise

level, but exposure time is important too.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> The question of different exposure

time  and  different  levels is rather  technical  and

complicated. It is not necessary that a person must be

exposed  for six hours to 90 decibels. It is  exposure

time and the frequency of the exposure. I do not think

I  should  involve the House in this highly  technical

argument.  If  the  Member  insists,  I  can   produce

statistics but I do not think it is fair to the  House

to proceed along this line.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg leave to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head N be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AGA 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Senior Parliamentary

Secretary has answered most of the questions  which  I

had  intended  to  raise under  subhead  AGA  1101,  I

propose   therefore  to  touch  on  just  one   point.

According to the 1975 Annual Report of the Ministry of

Labour,  15 out of 25 granite quarries have installed

permanent dust control measures. What steps are  being

taken  to  ensure  that the 10 other granite  quarries

introduce these permanent dust control measures?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the function of

the  control  of granite quarries has been transferred

to  the PWD. I am afraid I am not able to provide  any

answer  to  that without notice. That function  is  no

longer the responsibility of the Ministry of Labour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I notice that the

Industrial  Health  Unit, now  called  the  Industrial

Health Department, is still monitoring dust levels  in

granite quarries. So



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>



could   they  make  recommendations  to  the   correct

Ministry concerned?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Industrial

Health  Department monitors the health level,  without

the  power to insist that the quarries should  install

certain  gadgets or equipment. Discussion is going  on

between  my  Ministry  and the  Ministry  of  National

Development as to how previous regulations and control

which  were transferred to them can again be, shall  I

say, revived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is excellent. I

beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head N be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AHA 1101* (*The  same amendment also stood in the name of Mr  P.

Govindaswamy).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this subhead I would like to touch upon

industrial accidents. Although this question has  been

raised many a time in the past in this House, and  the

Ministry   has  been  urged  to  take  more  effective

measures   to   reduce   its  occurrence,   industrial

accidents continue to recur now and then. According to

statistics,  there  were  4,252  cases  of  industrial

accidents in 1976 and in 1975 there were 3,827 showing

an  increase of 425 cases. In 1975 there were 67 fatal

cases, whereas in 1976 there were 62 cases, showing a

slight  decrease. Just about a week ago  there  was  a

serious industrial accident at the Senoko Power  Plant

in  Sembawang which resulted in three deaths and three

wounded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is worth mentioning is that among industrial

accident   figures   for  the  building   construction

industry, those relating to HDB worksites rate quite a

high  proportion. According to Volume 2, No. 8 of  Lao

gong zhi shi (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) the Chinese equivalent of the

"New Worker" published by the Educational Publications

Bureau,  in 1975 there were 651 industrial  accidents

in building sites, of which 155 cases involved



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>



the  HDB, and from January to July 1977 there were 177

accidents  involving HDB worksites, among which  there

were  16  fatality cases. This shows  that  there  are

still  many  shortcomings and  loopholes  in  the  HDB

worksite  safety  measures.  There  should   be   more

stringent control and supervision. The supervisory  or

managerial   officers  should   have   been   severely

reprimanded, because it is not a small matter that  so

many  precious lives have been lost and so  many  able

bodied persons have been seriously incapacitated.  Had

there  been  better  safety precautions  taken,  these

unnecessary losses would have been avoided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of safety precautions. I remember that

some  two  years  ago  the Institute  of  Occupational

Health  and  Safety was set up to look into industrial

health  and safety and related matters. Now after  two

years  of  research they must have some  valuable  and

concrete proposals to make. I would like to know  what

are  the  results of the last two years and  what  are

their recommendations. When will these recommendations

be put into effect to reduce industrial accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, other than the shipbuilding industry which

shows a decreasing number of accident cases, there are

still   many   serious   accidents   involving   other

industries,  particularly  the  building  construction

industry. There were 698 cases last year. This  is  an

area  which we should pay attention to. Since we  have

various  industrial safety provisions, they should  be

stringently carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister explained that there was a shortage of

inspectors  and  the funds allocated  by  the  Finance

Ministry  were not sufficient. I am quite in  sympathy

with  the  Minister. However. I feel that  this  is  a

matter of life and death. It is not a small matter  to

be  treated lightly. The Ministry concerned should try

its  best  to get more funds from the Finance Ministry

in  order  to employ more inspectors. The Inspectorate

now  has  77 permanent officers, including inspectors,

in  relation to tens of thousands of factories. I feel

the number is too small. More inspectors



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>



should   be  recruited,  in  order  to  ensure  better

industrial safety.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support

the  Member for Sembawang. He has produced  facts  and

figures which I want to talk about further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What safety measures are being introduced in

factories,  worksites and shipyards?  There  does  not

seem to be a reduction in the number of fatal cases at

these  places. There seems to be too much  complacency

on  the part of the employers and the Labour Ministry.

During the last one year, there have been a number  of

fatal  accident cases in shipyards and  worksites.  It

looks  as  though life is cheap in these places,  very

cheap.  Lately, the accident involving a mobile  crane

at  the  Senoko  Power  Station worksite  could  be  a

typical   example  of  a  possible  lack   of   proper

supervision, and the overall careless attitude to life

at  worksites.  Human  life is cheap'  Despite  safety

campaigns, which are sporadic at the most, there seems

to  be no reduction in accidents involving the loss of

life  and  limb at shipyards, worksites and factories.

The  safety units and factory inspectorate must really

expand and wake up!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a shortage of inspectors and they cannot

sufficiently enforce safety measures at the worksites.

Everywhere  buildings  are coming  up, shipyards  and

other worksites. There are not enough inspectors.  The

Labour   Ministry  should  increase  the  Inspectorate

staff.  Later we will then see whether there  are  any

more accidents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact the

shortest  answer  to these two proposals  is  yes,  we

welcome  more staff. Definitely it will do us a  whole

world of good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before I deal with the specific points raised by

both   the  Member  for  Anson  and  the  Member   for

Sembawang,  perhaps I might take this  opportunity  to

enlighten  the  two  Members  on  certain  statistical

information which they might have read from the  Press

from  time to time and on which they might have  based

their  observations.  The  Member  for  Sembawang  has

quoted the correct



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>



statistics. Could the Member for Potong Pasir,  please

take  note? This is very important, as I will  explain

now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state of industrial health and safety cannot be

measured merely on simple statistics on the number  of

cases  and  the number of fatalities alone. There  are

other  factors  which must be taken into consideration

in  order  to obtain a proper assessment of  the  real

situation.  A  detailed  explanation  might   be   too

academic for the purposes of discussion in this House.

Therefore,  I  think it would suffice  to  state  that

other  factors,  such as the severity rate,  frequency

rate,  number of man-hours worked, number  of  workers

and so on, are all important considerations.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The random quoting of statistics in the mass media

appears  to have swayed the views of some hon. Members

as   well   as  members  of  the  public;  hence   the

observation  that the state of industrial  health  and

safety  in  the Republic appears to have  got  out  of

hand.  I have previously explained in this House  that

there  is a difference between the statistics  of  the

workmen's   compensation  figures  and   the   Factory

Inspectorate  figures. Briefly, for working  purposes,

the  Ministry defines "industrial accidents" as  those

reportable   under  the  Factories  Act.   Take,   for

instance, the total number of fatalities in  the  last

few  years: 88 deaths in 1974, 67 in 1975  and  63  in

1976. Members can see a gradual decline. These figures

appear  to be roughly one-third, more or less, of  the

total   fatalities   reported  under   the   Workmen's

Compensation    Act   which   covers    non-industrial

establishments, that is to say, no licence is required

or   the  need  to  report  in  accordance  with   the

provisions of the Factories Act. For this category.  I

will  broadly  classify  them as  "other  occupational

accidents"   which  include  white  collar   or   non-industrial workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the definition is necessary and important

because  very often the term "industrial accident"  or

"accident at work



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>



site" is used which, if left unclarified, might result

in  the psychological resentment and resistance of our

young  workers  in entering the industrial  sector  or

taking on blue collar jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Members for Anson and Sembawang have raised

certain  questions  regarding  industrial  safety  and

health.  May  I  take the Member for Anson  first.  He

asked what measures of safety have been introduced and

implied that my Ministry has been complacent in regard

to  industrial  safety and health programmes.  In  his

statement   during  the  debate  on  the   President's

Address, my Minister has already informed the House of

the  measures  that my Ministry has taken  to  improve

industrial  safety and health. These measures  include

the setting up of safety and health standards, stepped-up   enforcement,   training  of   safety   personnel.

supervisors and workers and the promotion  of  greater

safety  and  health consciousness among employers  and

workers. As a result of these measures, there has been

an  improvement in safety and health in our  shipyards

and slight improvement in the construction work sites.

The Member for Anson may wish to refresh his memory by

looking up the Hansard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson referred to the accident at the

Senoko  Power  Station.  I  believe  the  Member   for

Sembawang  also raised that point. A crane  which  was

stuck  in  the  rut  overturned  while  it  was  being

manoeuvred into position. The accident occurred during

salvage    operations    to   upright    the    crane.

Investigations showed that the crane overturned  as  a

result of several factors. Firstly, the ground was  at

an  incline and it was not suitable to bear the weight

of  the  crane which was a heavy equipment.  Secondly,

the  boom  - I wonder whether the Member for Sembawang

understands  what the boom of a crane is.  It  is  the

hand  of the crane used for hoisting. The boom of  the

crane  was  raised  and opened up so  to  speak, thus

adversely  affecting the stability of  the  crane.  To

make  it  worse, two mechanical shovels were  used  to

free  the  crane from the rut (rather stupid  I  would

say)  one pulling from the front and the other pushing

from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>



rear.  It was not a synchronised movement. There  were

two  operators  working  on  two  separate  mechanical

shovels,  one  pulling  and  the  other  pushing.  The

movement   was   not  synchronised,  power   was   not

synchronised, very unfortunate, and this  resulted  in

the crane overturning. There were some workers working

around and the accident took place as described by the

two   hon.  Members.  Sad  to  say,  Sir,  there   was

supervision  at  the  site by an  engineer.  Obviously

there  had been some error of judgment. I do not  wish

to   comment  further  on  this  as  my  Ministry   is

investigating  into  the  case  and  is  contemplating

taking appropriate action. So I think I should refrain

from commenting further on this particular case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while industrial safety and health has improved

in  the construction worksites and shipyards, I  agree

with the Member for Sembawang that there is still room

for   improvement,  especially  in  the  case  of  the

construction  industry. The number  of  fatalities  in

worksites  dropped from 36 in 1975 to 32 in 1976,  but

the  number of minor accidents increased from  651  to

698.  The Ministry will concentrate on two major types

of  accidents, that is, workers falling  from  heights

and  also workers struck by falling objects,  to  make

construction worksites a safer place to work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main objective of the proposed setting up of the

Institute  of  Occupational Safety and  Health  is  to

centralise   the  various  ad  hoc  arrangements   for

training  of safety personnel. At the moment, training

is  conducted by several agencies and it is  difficult

to  maintain consistent standards due to the frequency

of  the  courses as well as the change of instructors.

This  is  not to say that the standards are  low,  but

this arrangement is rather haphazard and unhealthy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the present arrangement appears to meet the

existing requirements, it is considered inadequate  in

the  long run, taking into consideration the type  and

the   number   of  industries  with  more   and   more

sophisticated machinery, the handling of raw materials

with  chemical  and other dangerous  content.  I  must

assure the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>



Sembawang   that  this  proposal  is  being   actively

pursued. An indicative five-year development  plan  is

being  worked  out  and the matter will  be  taken  up

shortly with the relevant authorities for approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must caution though at this stage that the

Institute must be realistic in its approach and should

not  take  on other responsibilities that may  not  be

immediately relevant to the industrial scene.  As  the

Institute gradually takes shape, other functions  such

as  consultancy  and research can then  be  added,  if

deemed expedient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three safety and health exhibitions have been

organised in the past. The first was in 1974  for  the

construction  industry. The second  in  1975  for  the

shipbuilding  and repair industry. And  the  third  in

1976  for  the woodworking industry. These exhibitions

have  created  among employers and workers  a  greater

awareness of industrial safety and health problems  in

their  respective industries. These exhibitions  have,

therefore, in that sense assisted us in making work in

the industries more safe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Members touched on the staffing of the Factory

Inspectorate.  The Factory Inspectorate can  certainly

do  with more field officers. For the present level of

operation,  the number of field officers  is  adequate

when  stretched to the limit with back-up  systems  of

safety officers and safety committee down at the plant

level.  The Factory Inspectorate continuously  reviews

the  methods of operation to streamline our inspection

and  to  ensure  high quality of work and  also  wider

coverage.  Hon.  Members may have  observed  that  the

Factory   Inspectorate  field   officers   have   been

significantly augmented in the past years. In 1973 we

had a total of 36 field officers in the establishment,

whereas  there  are now a total of 55 in  the  current

establishment. The rate of increase in the field staff

of  the  Inspectorate  compares  favourably  with  the

increase  in  the number of factories registered  with

the  Inspectorate. There were, 4,880 factories in 1973

as  compared  to 5,747 (not 10,000 as the  Member  for

Sembawang  said earlier) by the end of 1976.  However.

the  Ministry  will continuously review  the  staffing

position of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>



the Inspectorate and will make requests for more staff

as  and  when there is an increase in workload or  the

level of operation is stepped up in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I just touch on two other points raised

by the Members for Sembawang and Anson. The Member for

Sembawang  quoted  statistics  of  construction   site

accidents. I have got the figures here. In  1976,  the

total  number of accidents at all work sites  is  698,

out  of  which 241 took place in Housing Board  sites,

representing  34.5%.  On the cases  of  fatalities  or

death  cases, out of 32 death cases the Housing  Board

sites took 21 or 65.6%. The Housing Board has now  got

its  own  Safety Department with trained officers  and

they  are setting up their own enforcement and  safety

standards  at  their sites. I believe they  have  been

doing  good work, and I am informed that the  HDB  has

also  inaugurated  its  own  disincentive  scheme   by

imposing penalties on their contractors who are  found

to  have  flouted  safety rules. I believe  that  with

action  on  the part of the Housing Board, the  safety

standards  in  HDB construction sites  will  certainly

improve in the future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view of

the  detailed  reply given by the Senior Parliamentary

Secretary, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head N be reduced by

the whole sum in respect of subhead AHA 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I fire the first salvo, Sir, at the Factory

Inspectorate,  may  I  be permitted  to  give  them  a

bouquet   where   the   shipbuilding   and   repairing

industries   in  Singapore  are  concerned.   Accident

statistics have dropped tremendously in this area, and

I  believe that it is because of the good work of  the

Factory  Inspectorate. But I must hasten to  add  that

without  the  assistance of very able  personnel  from

outside the Factory Inspectorate, such a record  might

not have been possible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the building industry is concerned, I am

afraid  that the Factory Inspectorate has  been  quite

fast  asleep.  Accident statistics have been  hovering

above  600  and  shot  up last  year,  close  to  700.

Fatalities have been over the 30 mark - 34 in 1974, 34

in  1975  and  32  in  1976.  I  believe  the  Factory

Inspectorate  has  not grasped  the  problems  in  the

building   construction  industry.  It  is   something

intricate, something that they will need to go  deeper

into,  maybe seek help from outside as they have  done

in   order  to  contain  the  accident  rate  in   the

shipbuilding and repairing industry. I am hoping  that

the   hon.  Senior  Parliamentary  Secretary  to   the

Minister  for Labour will be able to give  this  House

some   concrete  measures  planned  by   the   Factory

Inspectorate to ensure that this condition will not be

repeated  when we meet again this time next  year  and

debate  as to whether the Factory Inspectorate  should

receive   the  sum  as  allocated  in  the  Main   and

Development Estimates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me touch on another point. While agreeing

with  the  Senior Parliamentary Secretary  for  Labour

that  knowledge  of accident statistics  alone  cannot

alleviate  the accident incidence and severity  rates.

statistics will reflect the safety or otherwise of the

working  environment and enable Government,  employers

and workers to put to use tripartitism that exists  in

most  working places towards ensuring a safer  working

environment.  Whilst not wanting to be  too  technical

for  the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Labour.  I

must say that statistics is an important arm to assist

in reducing the number of accidents in working places.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past years the Ministry has produced monthly

statistics  which  are  made available  to  employers,

trade  unions  and workers, and any one interested  in

seeing  accident  incidence rates dip.  Unfortunately,

the  Ministry has decided to sweep the dust under  the

carpet,  so  to  speak.  It  stopped  issuing  monthly

reports containing statistics. No, I am not asking for

the  American  National Standard  statistics  under  Z

16.1. Gross statistics alone will be sufficient and it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>



will  not  entail too many able-bodied  men  from  the

Ministry  of  Labour to work out these  statistics  so

that people like us and others, who are interested  in

ensuring  that  workers do not end up maimed  or  dead

will be able to come together and Sort out the problem

that  we  face either in the factories or in  building

sites  to  ensure that accident incidence  rates  have

actually   dipped.   I  feel  that  statutory   safety

committees - it is a good thing it has been introduced

into   the  law  -  will  be  able  to  utilise  these

statistics  for the benefit of workers who  would  not

otherwise  have  been injured. Unless  they  know  the

working  environment, know the conditions that  exist.

know  the  hazards that exist and once  these  hazards

have  been spotted, they can control them and  prevent

their recurrence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, the American

Standard   Z  16.1  does  not  give  us  the  accident

statistics.  It  is  a  format  to  teach  us  how  to

calculate man-days lost. They call it ANSI Z 16.1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I first deal with the Member's question on

statistics. The Member for Potong Pasir has queried on

the  reason  why  the Ministry has stopped  publishing

these  monthly reports. I presume the Member  is  more

interested  in  statistics on accidents alone  because

this  report also contained other information. I  wish

to  say  that the Member appears to have been mistaken

when  he  stated  that we have ceased  publication  of

these  statistics. The Ministry has decided to  change

the frequency of this publication from monthly to six-monthly. So if the Member could wait until June, I can

assure him that a copy will be sent to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The publication of the Monthly Report first started

in  1955. Unfortunately, for the last two days I  have

not  been  able  to  uncover the thinking  behind  the

origin  of this Monthly Report. This is rather an  odd

procedure.   No   other  Ministry  publishes   monthly

reports.   In  view  of  the  shortage  of  supporting

clerical staff, the Ministry has been considering  for

some  time  the  need  for  the  continuance  of   the

publication of the monthly report, which involves  the

cutting  of  stencils,  proof  reading,  printing  and

binding.   Senior  officers  are  also   involved   in

preparing and vetting of the draft



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>



departmental   reports  before  compiling   them   for

production which, again, would mobilise a good  number

of  officers  for a week or so. It is a  very  labour-intensive piece of work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is a need to keep a close tab on the

situation,  such  as  in the  case  of  the  two  most

accident-prone  industries, the building  construction

and  shipbuilding  and repairing  industries,  monthly

accident statistics are compiled and submitted for the

information of the two advisory committees  under  the

Ministry. These committees, with representatives  from

interested parties are established by the Ministry  to

look  into  ways and means of preventing accidents  in

these two industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir may be aware that there

are  representatives from the unions, namely PIEU  and

NTUC,  in these two committees. Nevertheless,  if  the

Member  for  Potong Pasir is interested to  have  NTUC

representatives on these committees  or  to  have  the

statistics, we would supply all the data to him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Monthly?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Well, if the Member is persistent,

monthly  it  will be, but only to him  or  any  other.

Member  here who is interested. We find that it  would

be a useless exercise to publish these reports because

only about 1% of the people read them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, I share the concern of the Member for

Potong  Pasir  regarding the safety situation  in  the

construction  industry.  As  stated  by  the  Minister

during  the  debate on the President's Address,  while

the   accident  frequency  and  severity  rates   have

improved,  the  safety situation in  the  construction

industry  needs  further  improvement.  I  assure  the

Member  that we know what we are doing. We  have  been

monitoring  the  situation and  the  increase  in  the

number   of  accidents  is  mainly  due  to  a  better

monitoring system, as we have repeatedly said  in  the

past.  There is a committee looking into this  problem

with  representatives from the Singapore Institute  of

Architects, the Singapore Institute of Surveyors,  the

Institute of Builders and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>



Association  of Consultant Engineers. The  Member  can

see  that  this committee is highly specialised.  They

are  people  who  know exactly what they  are  talking

about.  There  is  no  question of  the  Ministry  not

knowing how to handle the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one point which I wish to leave to the

Member  for  Potong  Pasir  to  think  about.  It   is

extremely  difficult to convince the  contractors  and

their workers because they are not that organised. The

workers  are  not unionised, so the NTUC cannot  reach

them.  With  the educational level of the contractors.

from illiterate to semi-literate, it is very difficult

to  deal  with them; unlike the shipbuilding  industry

where we deal with more enlightened people. So this is

the  problem that will haunt us in the next few  years

until  we  find  ways  and means, either  punitive  or

otherwise, to bring them in line with the thinking  of

the Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, from his answer the Senior

Parliamentary Secretary has grasped the problem, but I

hope  that  he  can filter this down  to  his  Factory

Inspectorate. I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $9,783,950 for Head N ordered to stand part

of the Main Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $799,000 for Head N ordered to stand part of

the Development Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head Q -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ngeow Pack Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ngeow Pack Hua (Boon Lay)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AAA 1004* (*The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs.

P. Govindaswamy. Teong Eng Siong, J. F. Conceicao, Ch'ng Jit Koon, Ho See Beng and Dr Ong Leong Boon).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the debate on the President's Address in

this  House, the  Minister for Culture  made  a  very

important announcement to this House, namely, that the

Government intends to amend the Newspaper and Printing

Presses  Act so that no one without approval would  be

allowed to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>



own more than 3% of the shares of a newspaper company.

The  intention  of the Government is to  see  that  no

newspaper  is  being controlled by any  individual  or

family.  This  amendment  will  greatly  affect  local

newspapers,  particularly  the  structure  of  Chinese

Newspapers.  I  would  like the  Minister  to  further

explain,  if possible, the contents and the objectives

of this amendment Bill. When the Bill is presented for

Second Reading. I will speak further on this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the Government is very concerned about

the  development of newspapers. This is a good  thing.

We all agree that a newspaper is a very important mass

medium  and it should not be made use of by a  handful

of   people  working  against  the  interests  of  the

country. On the other hand, we must also remember that

the  newspaper  can  contribute  much  to  a  country.

However,  the  Government's concern is more  from  the

negative angle rather than from the positive angle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a medium of communication, one of the important

functions  of a newspaper is to disseminate  news  and

views. With regard to relations between the Government

and  the  people,  it is a newspaper's  duty  also  to

publish  Government  policies and  activities  and  to

reflect  the views of the people. However, I must  say

with  regret  that  the Government  has  not  actively

helped newspapers to disseminate news. Two years' ago,

when  debating  the  Budget  not  a  few  Members   of

Parliament  criticised the newspapers for the  paucity

of  news  and  the low standard. Some  even  said  the

newspapers knew only to print the Ministers'  or  MPs'

speeches.  The low standard of newswriting is  due  to

the  low standard of language education. However, this

is  not what we are discussing here. The main question

is  whether  a  newspaper can offer a good  supply  of

lively  and  significant  news  to  its  readers.  The

difficulty of newspaper reporters now is the  question

of   getting   news   particularly   from   Government

departments



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>



which  merely  treat the newspapers as  a  medium  for

publicising   Ministerial  statements.  If   newspaper

reporters  go  out  of  their way  to  get  news  from

Government departments, they will invariably meet with

objection. We seem to have formed the habit  that  the

Ministers  must  be high on top and  inaccessible  and

that  civil servants know only to carry out their work

according to rules and regulations and they  are  out-and-out  bureaucrats. All enquiries by  reporters  are

met  with  the  answer  "No comment".  Many  important

departments  have got Public Relations Officers.  What

are they doing? They only know how to write letters to

the  press  to answer readers' enquiries. To newspaper

reporters' news enquiries, they either disregard  them

or try to be' evasive or equivocal. In the Ministry of

Culture, we do not even have a PRO.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me quote one example. Not long ago, the

Ministry of Education decided to abolish the automatic

promotion  system. This is a very important  decision.

However,  the  Ministry was extremely  embarrassed  in

having  to  make such a decision. So much so  that  it

tried   to   do  it  stealthily.  When  the  newspaper

reporters came to know about this decision, they  made

enquiries  at  the  Education Ministry.  However,  the

officials  in  the Ministry tried to be equivocal  and

gave  two versions to two different newspapers causing

unnecessary  confusion. In the end, people  interested

in education suffered and not the newspapers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that newspapers are owned privately and they

are  not  under the direct control of the  Government.

However,  the Ministry of Culture has a duty  to  help

journalists in their work, which will also benefit the

Government.  The PRO in every department  should  have

something more practical and meaningful to do and  not

just   to  write  letters.  Some  years  ago, various

ministries  used  to  have "meet-the-press"  sessions.

Now,  there seems to be none. I remember when I was  a

newspaper reporter, the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister  for  National Development who was  also  the

Chairman  of  the  Urban and Rural Services  Committee

used to have this kind of meet-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>



the-press  sessions  regularly,  when  the  whole   of

Singapore  knew about the URSC activities.  I  do  not

know  why he does not have any more of these meet-the-press  sessions. Is it because he has nothing more  to

say or has somebody not allowed him to speak?



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a country like ours, Government activities

are   one  of  the  main  sources  of  news  for   the

newspapers.  If the Government were to  cut  off  such

source  of  news, it would not do  any  good  to  the

newspapers  as well as to the Government. I  hope  the

Ministry of Culture will take the initiative to  solve

this problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to touch on the news handled by

Television Singapore. By "news" I mean there are  news

items  and views. In this regard, the Chinese  section

is  doing  better  than the English  section.  In  the

Chinese  section, there is the programme called  "News

Magazine"  which  is  quite successful.  However,  the

English section does not have such a programme. It has

more  programmes  on entertainment than  on  news  and

education.  RTS has very little time for  daily  news.

Although  there are two English news bulletins,  there

is  only one news bulletin each for the Chinese, Tamil

and  Malay sections. The news broadcasts in  the  four

languages  could not include late news, such  as  MPs

speeches  as at 7 p.m. here. The Chinese Section  does

not  include  it in the news telecast. I suggest  that

both Channel 5 and Channel 8 should broadcast the late

news  briefly  in  all  the four  languages,  English,

Chinese. Malay and Tamil, before closing time. RTS  is

Government-owned and operated, therefore it should  be

a  means  to  educate and to entertain our people.  In

Hong  Kong, the television station is privately owned,

yet their news broadcasting time is more than ours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I want to talk about the news readers. We must

be careful in the selection of news readers. If a news

reader  appears  too often on television  and  becomes

well  known, then if he suddenly becomes an opposition

candidate, it will be very embarrassing to all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>



of us. I believe the Member for Serangoon Gardens will

agree  with  me. Therefore, I suggest RTS  should  not

engage any more guest news readers in future.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of

Culture seems to be obsessed with the formation  of  a

Western  style symphony orchestra. May I ask: is  this

symphony  orchestra really necessary? We should  first

and  foremost  develop our own Asian  music,  art  and

literature  and not be inclined towards the  West  for

our cultural development. It seems that very little is

being   done  by  the  Ministry  of  Culture  in   the

development of Asian art, music, dance and literature.

And what little development there is, is the result of

the  initiative  and  interest of a  few  hard-working

people who had to struggle against great odds in  both

financial and material matters. Should we not  develop

good  Chinese, Indian and Malay music and painting  in

keeping with an Asian concept?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the Ministry of Culture doing to

encourage Art among our youngsters? The Young People's

Gallery  has  become a museum piece of late.  The  few

outdoor exhibitions were so poorly patronised that  it

is  high time the Ministry of Culture did something to

coordinate its efforts with the Ministry of Education.

Credit  can be given to the Ministry of Education  for

taking the initiative to open a sales centre at  Hotel

Premier. This is really commendable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have in the past been talking so much about

the  concept  of  a Singapore culture of  our  various

races.  What efforts are being made in this direction?

There seems to be very little motivation and drive  in

this effort. We do not seem to get many programmes  on

the Singapore culture. Even the National Theatre Trust

of late does not seem to be in the limelight. What has

happened  to the Trust in its promotion of a Singapore

culture?  I  feel  that  more  quality  programmes  on

Singapore  culture  should  be  organised  at  various

levels  and distributed locally and abroad so that  we

can  be  culturally identified by others in  a  better

light.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, every year

when  Parliament meets to discuss matters relating  to

the  Ministry of Culture, the subject of  culture  has

always  been  a  very  hot  topic.  This  shows   that

everybody  is very interested in culture and  it  also

shows  that  everybody  is  very  concerned  with  the

development of our culture and art. Of course, culture

and  art  is very important to the nation  and  it  is

particularly important to the spiritual  life  of  our

people.  If  we  do not have sufficient cultural  food

then the life of our people will become lonely, devoid

of  spiritual  and cultural content. We will  be  like

people living in the desert. Since culture and art  is

so  important  to  the cultural life  of  our  people,

therefore we must regard the promotion of culture  and

art  as a pressing need and an immediate task to bring

our people to the oasis of their cultural life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since our independence, cultural and artistic

activities   in  our  country  have  never   been   as

progressive or active as our economic progress.  There

are  several reasons which I would like to  enumerate.

First,  the  Ministry  of Culture  has  not  fixed  or

formulated  any  definite objective in  the  field  of

promotion of culture and art. Although the Ministry of

Culture  has stressed that it intended to promote  the

cultural  and artistic heritage of the various  ethnic

communities  in  the country, no concrete  steps  have

been taken to effect such a decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Ministry of Culture is lacking in

experienced  artistes. The Minister admitted  this  on

the  15th  of  this month in this House. What  is  the

reason  for the shortage of experienced artistes?  The

main  reason is that the pay is too little. We  expect

people to give more value than they are paid for. This

is  not  the  way  to  raise  our  cultural  standard.

Obviously, at present it is not possible to  get  such

dedicated  talents.  The  Ministry  should  give  more

reasonable  awards, in order to get good talent.  This

is  a prerequisite to the promotion and the raising of

the standard of culture and art.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the Main Estimates of the Ministry of

Culture, the allocation for the financial year amounts

to $47.7 million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>



whereas  for the Development Estimates the  allocation

is $10.4 million. There is a decrease of $3 million in

development  allocation. Would it affect the  cultural

and  artistic development? I remember the  Member  for

Katong  raised this question in this House  two  years

ago,  and  the  reply  by the Minister  was  that  the

solution  to the question of culture and art  did  not

depend  on  any  amount of money and culture  and  art

needed nurturing over a long period. It is, of course,

true  to say that the amount of money spent on culture

is  not  the criterion to the standard of culture  and

art. Nevertheless it is one of the necessary boosters.

It  is  all very well to say so, but if people engaged

in cultural and artistic activities are not reasonably

paid,   how   can  we  expect  them   to   give   good

performances?  This  situation  has  taken  place   in

respect  of  TV  programmes. For instance,  for  a  TV

script the payment is $99, whereas the producer  would

get  $50. [Interruption]. This is too little. How can

we  expect to get a good standard of programmes?  This

is  the reality of things. When we talk of "from  each

his best, and to each his worth", in the field of art,

particularly  in respect of the RTS and its  artistes,

they  should  also  have  their remunerations  raised.

Otherwise  how  can we expect them to  produce  better

quality stuff for our TV and Radio programmes?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we should open up more training classes for

our new artistes. On 23rd February, in this House, the

Minister  in  reply to my question said that  at  that

moment there were already courses for the training  of

local artistes. One was meant for adults and the other

for  children. Of course, this is a very good plan.  I

hope good results will be achieved so that in the  not

too distant future we will be able to see better local

programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we should encourage civic and artistic

organisations  in our community to  take  part  in  TV

programmes.  The  President has  pointed  out  in  his

Address   that  we  should  develop  our   traditional

cultures  and  arts. If that is so,  we  must  try  to

formulate  plans to effect this. We could  investigate

how many artistes are available. There could be many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>



elites who are capable in this field whom we have  not

discovered.  We should organise them and make  use  of

them  so  that they can contribute their best  towards

the development of culture and art.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, as regards cultural and artistic

organisations in our community, we should  allow  them

more  time and opportunity to perform for TV and radio

so  as to encourage the promotion of local talents  in

culture  and  art. There is another question  I  would

also  like to ask the Minister and that is whether  he

would   consider  filming  newsreels  on   our   local

activities  reporting on the various  aspects  of  our

life  and  progress so that our people can  understand

our own situation and progress better.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture and Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Science and Technology (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may  I  be  permitted  to reply  to  the  first  three

speakers before the other Members speak?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, during the debate on the

President's Address I have laid down the policy on the

restriction  of  ownership  of  newspaper   companies'

shares. I have stated the principle, the objective and

the  reasons for such action. There is really  nothing

more for me to add now. As regards the details and how

they  are  to be implemented, I think it  is  best  to

leave  it  to  the  legal draftsman. We  have  already

instructed them to work out an amendment based on  the

principles laid down in the policy speech.  This  will

be presented to the House in due course, and I am sure

the  Member will be able to read all about it when  it

comes up for the First and Second Readings.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding public relations officers and the

spokesmen  for  the various Ministries.  I  share  the

sympathy  which the Member for Boon Lay  has  for  his

fellow  journalists about their difficulty in  getting

information  from  the  public relations  officers  in

Government Ministries and departments. This is nothing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>



new.  He  may wish to know that even our RTS reporters

have experienced the same difficulty. Unfortunately my

Ministry has no control whatsoever over this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Publicity Division of my Ministry receives

through  its Press Section policy speeches  and  press

statements  issued by Ministries and  departments  for

release  to the press. It also helps to arrange  press

conferences  for them. For instance,  the  one  by  G.

Raman  and  Arun  Senkuttuvan  was  arranged  by  this

section.  However,  the Publicity Division  is  in  no

position  to obtain information for reporters  if  the

Ministry  concerned  is  reluctant  to  release   such

information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always a tug of war between the journalists

and  Government officials. On the one hand, it is  the

duty   of   Government  officials  to  see   that   no

information of a sensitive nature should fall into the

hands  of  unauthorised persons. If there is any  news

story  at  all,  it would be issued by the  department

concerned.  They  will wait until the  most  opportune

time  to issue it, in which case every journalist will

get a copy of the statement. On the other hand, it  is

the  duty  of  a journalist to dig out any information

there  is  from a Government department, so as  to  be

ahead  of  his rival journalists. So there  is  always

this  conflict  of duty and interest.  The  Government

official is in a dilemma. If he leaks out a story,  he

is  in  trouble, he will lose his job. If he  releases

the  story and it does not get good coverage from  the

newspapers, he is also in trouble and  he  will  also

lose  his job. So there is a constant battle  of  wits

and  manoeuvring skill between the two. I do not think

the  journalists should expect us to fight the  battle

for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it is fair to blame the Ministry of

Culture for the low standard of the newspapers. It  is

not  true  to say that Ministers are sitting  in  high

places  and ignore the people from the low -  gao  gao

zai  shang (). This is not true. Being  elected

MPs  and elected Ministers, we meet the people all the

time.  In fact, we create the opportunity to meet  the

people. We canvas,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>



we  go  round, and we meet the lowest of the low.  The

way  the  criticism was directed at us is very unfair.

But  if  the newspaper boys want to see the  Ministers

every now and then in order to confirm or deny a story

or  even to create a story for them, then I think  the

Ministers are wrongly paid. They should not  be  doing

that. It is not their job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The production of News Magazine in English had to be

suspended in August 1974 owing to a serious  shortage

of  staff in the English News Editing Unit. Of the  12

posts  of  News editors and sub-editors in  the  Unit,

only  eight were filled at that time. Since  then  the

position has not improved. Production of News Magazine

in English will be resumed when the English Unit has a

full complement of staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the Member for. Boon Lay that

all  the  candidates selected for permanent and  part-time  appointments in the Department  of  Broadcasting

are  security-screened before assuming duty.  Although

they  are  all  right when we employ them,  we  cannot

guarantee  that they will not do foolish things  later

on.  Mr  Harry  Crabb is one of them. Mr  Harry  Crabb

joined  the Department of Broadcasting in  1960  as  a

temporary Broadcasting Assistant, and was promoted  to

Programme  Assistant  in 1964. He  resigned  from  the

service  in 1971. Later, he was re-engaged as a  part-time  newsreader until July last year. I may add  that

good news readers are not easily found. So RTS has  to

engage  part-time  news  readers.  News  readers  will

invariably become familiar to households over a period

of   time.  However,  familiarity  is  different  from

acceptability.  The  fact  that  Mr  Crabb  lost   the

elections,  notwithstanding his familiar  face,  shows

that he is not acceptable to the voters. Otherwise Pte

Lau Teik Soon, the Member for Serangoon Gardens, would

not  be  here.  I  think the people of  Singapore  are

sophisticated  enough  not to go  for  familiarity  or

popularity  of candidates, but to examine the  records

and  achievements of a party before  they  cast  their

votes.  I  am,  therefore, not in  the  least  worried

whether  members of the opposition party are  familiar

faces. Indeed, familiarity without substance may  even

breed contempt.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson seems to be very impatient in

seeing  a  Singapore culture coming  into  being  and,

indeed, I would be if I were his age. But this  matter

takes time. It may take years or even generations  for

it to take form. There is no way we can hasten it. Mao

Tse-tung  tried to do it when he started the  cultural

revolution.  But  look at what happened  to  him.  His

widow was discredited and the Cultural Revolution  has

fallen  into disrepute. There is no culture and  there

is no revolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in Singapore it is the policy of the Government

to  preserve the inherited Chinese, Indian, Malay  and

Western  cultures  and  to  give  them  the  necessary

encouragement for their harmonious development into an

identifiable culture of our own. We favour  no  single

culture but allow the blooming and interaction of  all

our   inherited   cultures  so   that   eventually   a

distinctive Singapore culture will emerge. We  want  a

hundred  flowers to bloom and our only regret is  that

there are not so many flowers around. For him or  even

for  me,  it may be a bit slow. We may not be able  to

see  the  full bloom of its glory. But if  we  do  the

right things now, those who come after us will be able

to  enjoy  the  benefits.  As  the  saying  goes,  the

forefathers planted the tree, the children  enjoy  the

shade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not obsessed with the idea of forming a

Western style symphony orchestra. If there are  enough

talents and musicians to form one and if it is  within

our budget to do so, we will form one. If not, we will

let  things  lie.  There  is no  hurry.  There  is  no

advantage in forcing something down the throats of the

people  if  they  are not ready for  it.  But  in  the

meantime  we  have a Chinese orchestra formed  by  the

People's  Association Chinese orchestra, of  which  we

are proud as it enjoys a large following.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of ASEAN art, music, dance and

literature. I agree that steps should be taken for  us

to  learn and appreciate more of the cultures  of  our

ASEAN  partners. It must be remembered, however,  that

ASEAN  is only ten years old. But despite this,  there

have been frequent visits of artistes, painters,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>



photographers   from  member-countries.   Steps   have

already  been taken at official levels,  such  as  the

ASEAN  mobile  art  and photographic  exhibition,  the

ASEAN  exchange  of  radio  and  television  artistes.

exchange of radio and television programmes, the ASEAN

film festival and the ASEAN literary award, to promote

an  awareness of the rich cultural diversities as well

as similarities of member-countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is incorrect for the Member to say that the Young

People's Gallery has become a museum piece. From April

last  year to February this year seven exhibitions  of

students'  work were organised, and these  exhibitions

attracted over 100,000 visitors. The hon. Member  may

be  interested to know that for the rest of this  year

another six exhibitions are being planned. Besides the

Young  People's Gallery, the exhibitions held  in  the

National  Museum  Art  Gallery and  the  other  public

galleries continue to attract large numbers  of  young

visitors.  My  own Ministry's open air art  exhibition

for   the   young   held   quarterly   also   provides

opportunities for our young budding artists. More than

2,000   young  artists  have  participated  in   these

exhibitions.  The on-the-spot drawing exhibition  held

in   the   Zoological  Garden  was  also  a   success,

attracting  more  than 2,000 young  participants.  The

National  Theatre  Trust together  with  the  National

Theatre  Club  has  been  promoting  various  cultural

activities.   Besides  maintaining  a  permanent   art

gallery  at the Theatre's foyer, the National  Theatre

Trust  organises song writing competitions,  open  air

concerts and classes on music and dances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me stress again that the evolution of a

Singapore   culture  is  a  long  and   time-consuming

process.  We can encourage it but we cannot direct  it

in the same way that we direct economic development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has said that we lack

artistes.  Yes, we do lack artistes because there  are

very  few  people in Singapore. So we  have  very  few

artistes  here.  We  do  not  have  a  large  base  of

population from which to tap our talents. But  in  any

case,  if there are talents from other places, we  are

very glad to accept them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> Taiwan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> They are not artistes. We do not

consider them as artistes. They are entertainers. They

come and go.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding training of the staff, we do have training

for the artistes in the television and radio services,

but  we  must  bear  in mind that  training  is  being

undertaken  by  full-time staff  in  the  Broadcasting

Department  who, apart from their normal duties,  have

to  undergo this training. The training of artistes is

a  very  time-consuming process. I do agree  with  the

Member  for Sembawang that fees for artistic  services

rendered  on  our radio and television  are  low  when

compared with other stations. But we have taken  steps

to revise the scales of payment and to improve certain

rates. But whatever improvements that are going to  be

made   will  have  to  relate  to  the  annual  budget

allocation for such fees; in some cases to the  salary

scales of permanent staff carrying out similar duties.

There  is  provision for payment of up to $149  for  a

good  30 minutes of a TV drama script and $500 for  an

outstanding  one. The crux of the matter is  that  the

quality  of  the  script submitted  does  not  justify

payment in excess of the $99 mentioned.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the development of traditional cultures, I would

like  to  assure the Member that radio  services  have

provided     ample    opportunities    for    cultural

organisations  to  perform in their  programmes.  Even

with  a  predominantly local nature of its production,

our  radio services rely very heavily on local talent.

They  are also given opportunities to perform  on  TV.

From  1975 up to the present, there were 18 series  of

cultural programmes produced on television using local

talent,  and  no  less than 19 cultural  organisations

drawn from the four language streams were featured  in

the RTS programmes last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the RTS staff doing their own talent

scouting,  organisations are welcome to  write  in  if

they  think they can contribute to radio or television

programmes  and  those found suitable  after  audition

will be given opportunities to perform.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has also suggested that we

should  resume our old practice of producing films  or

newsreels  for screening in cinemas. When we  produced

newsreels  in  those  days,  TV  had  not   yet   been

introduced  and  the cinema then was the  only  visual

medium  within  the reach of the general  public.  But

since  then, TV newsreel has made the cinema  newsreel

obsolete. What happens in the morning can be  seen  on

TV  in  the  evening. Since TV newsreel is  much  more

effective  than cinema newsreel, it seems a  waste  of

money to continue producing newsreel for the cinemas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Govindaswamy. You were not here when the Minister

made his reply. How can you raise your points now?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Never mind. I was told about it.

I  am  getting old and before I die I want  to  see  a

Singapore  culture.  When  can  we  have  a  Singapore

culture?  After how many years can we form a Singapore

culture? I urge the Minister to be quick about

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, two

areas  where it has been feasible to stress  practical

cultural development has been the area of visual  arts

and  music.  With the reorganisation of  the  National

Museum and the establishment of the Art Gallery there,

encouragement for the development of the  visual  arts

has  for  the  time being risen to  a  fair  level  of

satisfaction.   The   Minister  has   indicated   with

statistics that this has been so and he has  described

and  I agree with him the extent of the activities  in

the  sphere of development of appreciation of the arts

and activity in the visual arts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time to stress the ordered development of a

music  policy  for Singapore. Sir, I speak  along  the

lines  of  what  I am familiar with and  that  is,  of

course,  music derived from the West, but I would  not

like  in  any  way to exclude music that has  our  own

local and indigenous origin. The ground seems fruitful

for  music  development. To serve as a  base  we  have

quite  a number of musical activities organised  by  a

fairly large



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>



number of bodies including the Ministry of Culture and

its  divisions, such as the National Theatre Trust and

the  RTS,  the Ministry of Education's ECA  unit,  the

Institute  of Education, the University of  Singapore.

as  well  as private musical organisations. Orchestras

in  sporadic  operations include the  Singapore  Youth

Orchestra,   the  Singapore  Schools  Orchestra,   the

University  of Singapore and, of course, the  People's

Association  Orchestra  that the  Minister  mentioned.

Music  making  is quite a widespread activity  and  it

seems  to  me that when the Minister spoke  about  the

availability of appropriate numbers, perhaps if  stock

is taken we will find that we have reached a situation

where  there are appropriate numbers. But activity  in

the   music  area  seems  to  lack  overall   national

direction. This is perhaps because there has not  been

previously  an adequate articulation of a  policy  for

music.  In  fact,  there  has  not  been  an  adequate

articulation of a policy for culture until perhaps the

last year or so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Until the Member for Katong's

suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> I am glad that the Minister has taken

note  of  what we have suggested, not only the  Member

for Katong but other Members too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think such a policy should aim at

involving as many people as possible especially  young

people  in the various forms of music making  such  as

performing  in  orchestras,  small  ensembles,  bands,

choirs,  and here of course, in relation to  Asian  as

well  as  other forms of music. Secondly,  the  policy

should aim at raising the level of music participation

and performances so that, thirdly, this may contribute

to  the  establishment of national  performing  bodies

like  the  National Choral Society or even a  national

symphony  orchestra.  The development  of  a  national

symphony  orchestra  is  without  prejudice   to   the

development of Asian instrumental groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moves towards the establishment of a symphony

orchestra  have  been  aborted because  of  cost.  The

Minister  has talked about cost two years ago  and  he

still keeps



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>



talking   about  cost.  However,  it  is   with   some

imagination  still  possible to establish  a  national

orchestra, on an economic basis of a core of full-time

professionals  plus  others  consisting  of  part-time

musicians.  This is not an original idea. In  fact.  I

got this idea from the Ministry of Culture itself. The

Ministry  of  Culture  has been thinking  along  these

tines and I am sure the Minister is aware of this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No action!



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Yes, no action. This is the point. The

Minister  for  Culture has my sympathy in  his  uphill

struggle   to  get  financial  support  for   cultural

development  of  this  kind  but  still  the  onus  is

defintely  on  his shoulders. He is the  Minister  for

Culture. The onus is defintely on his shoulders, and I

would urge him to use his powers of persuasion to  get

support from his Cabinet colleagues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Wrong support!



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> He has got our support but apparently

he  has not succeeded in fully getting the support  of

his  Cabinet  colleagues and this is the  point  I  am

making.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that must be brought up, and this

again hinges on finance, is that an orchestra needs  a

place   in   which   to  practise   and   perform.

[Interruption]  If the acoustics are good  and  if  the

place  is  acceptable,  certainly.  I  recognise   the

impracticability of asking presently for a new concert

hail.  This  is  completely out of  the  question,  of

course. But we should look into the possibility and  I

think  it  is  feasible of restructuring the  Victoria

Memorial Hall despite the fact that that was the venue

for  the  foundation of the Party, for the purpose  of

serving  as  a  concert hall. I believe  the  acoustic

possibilities for orchestral presentation are good and

such   a   provision   would   give   focus   to   the

implementation of a music policy. I am not asking that

all  this should be done overnight although the Member

for Anson has sounded a note of urgency. [Interruption].

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I think the Member for Anson  should

not  listen  to  the agitation that is  going  on  his

right. I have stated yesterday that I have the highest

regard for the Member for Anson.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said, these steps cannot be done overnight

but  steps towards achieving a good outcome  in  music

development  in Singapore would be quite  relevant  in

view of definite possibilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that to place a music development

policy  on  an  even  firmer basis,  the  Ministry  of

Culture   should  cooperate  very  closely  with   the

Ministry of Education as this will greatly enlarge the

base  in respect of those who would either participate

in music making or could form an appreciative audience

for such activity.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon is not here. Mr Ho

See Beng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I often notice that

newspapers and some publications in Singapore  do  not

seem  to  have  a clear picture of our nation-building

policy  which encompasses none other than (1)  pursuit

of  internal  security  and (2)  economic  prosperity.

These  two  charted courses are the major outlets  for

the  survival of over two million people of Singapore.

Yet,  Sir,  two of the local Chinese papers  and  some

publications have often been found publishing workers'

complaints about suppression by employers, even  about

abject  poverty, about having no money to seek medical

treatment  when they fall ill. Sir, writings  such  as

these run counter to our national policy because:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) they create confrontation between employers and

employees, between the rich and the poor;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the occasioning of employer/employee

confrontation gives rise to the communist  concept  of

class conflict in their anti-Government subversion;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the presence of the concept of class conflict

generates    hostility   between   employers    and

employees and between the poor and the rich;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) consciousness of hostilities affects our

internal  security and deals an instant  blow  to  our

industry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instability at home will weaken Government's control,

cause  industrial unrest and result in investment  and

productivity  sliding downhill. Sir,  if  we  fail  to

maintain  the  foundation of a stable  government,  if

investments  do  not  come  forward  and  productivity

remains  stagnant, our economic growth will slow  down

immediately. Our two million people will then  lose  a

firm hold on their means of livelihood. This situation

will then afford a good opportunity for the communists

to  seize  power and enslave our people. Our  national

policy admits of no class conscious communist ideology

to  use  our  newspapers to poison our youths  because

this would jeopardise the security of our country  and

the  survival  of our people. It is  as  morbid  as  a

poisonous rose.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before passing this budget, I wish to raise

this  solemn  question. Apart from issuing publication

permits  to  the  newspapers,  does  the  Ministry  of

Culture ignore this kind of writing or does it prevail

upon  the editors to refuse to publish any more  these

class-conscious      writings     about      so-called

"employer/employee"  and  "rich/poor"   confrontation?

Besides,  our Ministry of Labour accepts the  workers'

complaints  against the employers. There is absolutely

no  oppression by employers to speak on.  As  for  the

poor  having  no money to seek medical  treatment  and

having to wait for their death, this statement is even

more absurd. The General Hospital gives free treatment

to  patients who are genuinely penniless and to  those

receiving  public  assistance.  Our  workers'   living

standard   here  cannot  match  with  that  of   their

counterparts  in  the United States. But  compared  to

those in China, they are living in paradise here.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I rise to raise a small

issue.  This  regards  the issue  of  permits  by  the

Ministry  of Culture for staging wayang shows,  puppet

shows, sing-song sessions, etc, for festivities.  This

is  particularly  relevant  during  the  Seventh  Moon

Festival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the necessity for the Ministry of Culture

to regulate these festivities by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>



requiring them to have a permit issued for staging the

show,  and the attendant problems of traffic flow  and

noise pollution. We are familiar with the problems  of

the applicant who has to go through a number of stages

before  he  could  finally  have  a  wayang  show   to

commemorate Tua Pek Kong's birthday. We know that  the

applicant  has  to  go  and see his  local  Member  of

Parliament  for recommendation. For one, I cannot  see

what relevance the Member of Parliament has got to  do

with Tua Pek Kong's or Kwan In's birthday. I find this

quite perplexing. In the course of one year, I am sure

the  Member  of  Parliament would have  to  deal  with

something  like  20  to  30 applications.  Hence, the

necessary  recommendation. Members of  Parliament  too

are required to say, "No" or "Yes", Quite honestly,  I

do  not  know what guidelines there are for me to  say

"No". I adopt the policy of saying "Yes".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area where the applicant has to go

through  is  the  Housing and Development  Board  Area

Office,  where I am told the Area Officer is  supplied

with a very well documented list of approved sites for

staging of these shows. Very often we know that  these

approved  sites are not necessarily the most  suitable

sites for staging these shows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, he has to run along to see the traffic

police  officer.  Eventually having gone  through  all

these  obstacles,  he  turns up  at  the  Ministry  of

Culture for the permit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is, the list of approved sites has been

drawn  up  by the Ministry of Culture. To my knowledge

there  was no prior consultation with the local Member

of  Parliament. It is obvious that some of these sites

were  just  convenient sites, convenient to  the  Area

Officer,  convenient  to  some  planners  but  without

having a realistic understanding of the needs of these

various  temples or their followers. HDB Area Officers

tend  to  adopt a rather inflexible attitude  when  it

comes  to approving a request for staging such  shows,

in  spite of the fact that certain sites might be more

suitable  but  because they do  not  fall  within  the

approved list they are automatically turned down. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>



therefore  have a situation where a temple  celebrates

its  great  occasion at one place and  the  wayang  is

staged some three or four blocks away. This reminds me

of  the  effort by Government many years ago to  clamp

down   the  firing  of  crackers  by  insisting   that

everybody goes to a community centre to fire crackers,

not  realising  the irrelevance of cracker  firing  at

community  centres  and the significance  of  cracker-firing to the Chinese community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I therefore humbly suggest to the Minister that

a  review  of the approved sites be made and  this  be

made on the request of the local Member of Parliament,

and  also a more flexible attitude be adopted  by  the

relevant authority with better understanding and  that

the  Member of Parliament's recommendation for seeking

the permit be unnecessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Hwang, do you want to say something?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, this is just a point of clarification. In the Minister's reply to the Member for Boon Lay,

he used the expression, "The lowest of the low." I

do not know exactly what he meant to imply, but I

certainly loathe to think that one of our Ministers

could be thinking of class distinction or class

consciousness, in terms of high class or low class,

especially when we are a party committed to striving

for a more just and equal society, bearing in mind

what the Member for Khe Bong has just said. Perhaps

the Minister would care to clarify what he exactly

means by "lowest of the low".



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, may I clarify the point

mentioned  by the Member for Jalan Kayu? When  I  used

the  phrase "lowest of the low", this is in  reply  to

the phrase levelled at me - gao gao zai shang (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). Since there is this description of me sitting on the top of a very high mountain, therefore, there must

be  somebody down at the very low base. But I  do  not

mean  that every one is low or that there is this kind

of  people in our society or that there is this  class

structure.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>



What I mean is that we as elected Members are ordinary

citizens,  whether  we  are Ministers  or  Members  of

Parliament. We pay income tax. We are equal before the

law and we drive our own car and so on. In our society

actually there is no such thing as low or high  class.

But  since there is a reference by a Member that I was

sitting  on  the high top of a mountain,  therefore  I

must  refute this thinking that we are sitting on  the

"high side" and ignoring the people on the "low side".

I am sorry that I have given the Member for Jalan Kayu

the  wrong impression but this is really in  reply  to

what the Member for Boon Lay has said just now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must come back to the Member for Anson. When I

made  reference  to  his  age,  I  did  not  mean  any

disrespect. In fact, it is an Asian custom to  respect

people  who are old. They are supposed to be  wise.  I

respect  him for his wisdom and his wit. But I  cannot

promise quick action, as he said, in culture.  I  must

say  that there is no such thing as "instant culture".

There  is  instant coffee or even instant Asia.  I  am

sorry there is no instant culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very much concerned with the development of

music,  as  the  Member for Katong has said.  But  the

formation of an orchestra is not just money alone.  We

did have an idea of starting an orchestra. In fact, on

two occasions we wanted to start an orchestra but they

failed  very  miserably. The success of  an  orchestra

depends  on  many  things. First,  we  must  have  the

talent. We must have enough talented musicians and  we

must  also  have the audience to enjoy the  music.  We

must also have a proper place for it to perform. We do

not have all these.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong mentioned that we have enough

musicians. I beg to differ from his opinion.  Yes,  we

have  enough  musicians. We have enough  pianists  and

enough  violinists,  because when parents  send  their

children  for music education they seem to prefer  the

violin  or  the piano. But an orchestra  is  not  just

formed by pianists and violinists alone. There must be

many other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>



kinds  of musicians in an orchestra to make the  music

pleasant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards conversion of the Victoria Memorial Hall

into  a  concert  hall, I do not know  whether  it  is

possible. Apart from the fact that it is the  site  of

the  first meeting of the PAP, it means that it  is  a

monument  of  historical  interest  and  therefore  it

should   be  preserved.  But  my  own  view  is   that

converting the Victoria Memorial Hall into  a  concert

hall may pose many problems. I do not know whether  or

not the acoustics there is a problem, but I am sure it

is  very expensive to carry out such a conversion.  It

may  well  be  cheaper to build  a  new  concert  hall

somewhere  else  instead  of converting  the  Victoria

Memorial Hall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Khe Bong is annoyed that some people

write  irresponsible letters to the  press  when  they

want something done. I must inform the Member that  we

are  not  in the habit of calling up newspaper editors

and  telling them what they can or cannot do or print.

My  Ministry cannot be responsible for what the  press

publishes.  It will also be difficult for us  to  keep

tab on all the articles that appear in our newspapers.

My  Ministry will only intervene in cases of distorted

reporting   on  sensitive  issues.  Newspapers   which

indulge in reporting which subsequently proves  to  be

inaccurate,   false   or   misleading,   are    acting

irresponsibly. If they persist in doing so, they  are

creating  a  credibility  gap between  themselves  and

their  readers, and it is up to them to  answer  their

readers. But I do not want to go into the question  of

class struggle again with the Member for Khe Bong.  Do

we ignore this kind of writing in the press? No, we do

not  ignore  them. We monitor them. We  know  what  is

going on.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be interesting to some of the Members here

but I must say that this is one way the communists try

to  create public opinion. When I was young, I used to

do  this  kind of thing. I used to write many letters,

not  just one, to the press to create a public opinion

in order to prepare the masses



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>



for  a  revolution. But those were days long gone  by.

But  I  can see that the present generation of  letter

writers to newspapers are not many and they are also a

bit  childish. As we monitor them, we know  what  they

are doing and we would take note of them and deal with

them when the time comes. But to call them up whenever

there  is a nasty letter appearing in the press  would

not help solve anything.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of wayang sites raised by the Member

for  Kim  Seng. I would like to inform the House  that

the  list  of  approved wayang sites was drawn  up  in

conjunction  with  the  Police  and  the  Housing  and

Development Board in 1975 in an effort to reduce noise

pollution  and  traffic  congestion  that   is   often

associated with the staging of wayangs. This  list  is

constantly being revised, and there are at present 693

approved sites on the list.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng may wish to know that my

Ministry has all along been sympathetic in considering

applications  for  wayang licences.  On  a  number  of

occasions  wayangs are allowed to be staged  at  sites

not   on   the   approved   list,   provided   special

arrangements can be made by the organisers  to  reduce

noise pollution and traffic congestion. As the Housing

and  Development Board is the competent  authority  to

comment  on  the suitability of wa yang sites  in  its

estates,  it is only logical for my Ministry to  refer

such  applications to them for consideration.  But  in

many instances we are faced with the choice of whether

to  please the residents in the housing estates or  to

please the wayang organisers or the Tua Pek Kong. I am

sure  the Member will agree with me that when it comes

to  a  decision  of this sort, it is obvious  that  we

should  let the residents have as much peaceful  sleep

as possible and leave the Tua Pek Kong alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been the practice to seek the consent of the

owner of a site before a wa yang licence is issued. In

the  case of housing estates, since the Housing  Board

is  the  owner, it is only appropriate that we  should

seek the consent of the Housing Board before a licence

is issued. How would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>



the Member feel if I were to issue a licence to hold a

wayang in his garden without his permission?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the need to go to an MP for approval. I think it

is  wrong  to say that whenever an applicant  wants  a

wayang  licence, he must go to the MP.  I  think  what

happens  is that when his application is turned  down,

he  goes to the MP. Like any other applications  which

are turned down, whether it is for a wayang licence or

any  other  licence, the applicant  will  normally  go

straight to his MP. In fact, there is no necessity for

the  MP to approve the wayang site. But in some cases,

an  MP  writes in to recommend that a certain site  be

approved for a wayang because, in his capacity  as  MP

of  that  constituency, he is more familiar  with  the

site and that he would be able to tell whether or  not

the  wayang there would cause noise pollution  to  the

residents. So in this respect the MP's recommendations

are also taken into consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, when I said "quick action",

I  mean  that it will take them 10 years. The Minister

replied  that he cannot promise quick action.  When  I

say  "quick" it means he will take another  10  years.

That is what I mean.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir,I rise to inform the

Minister  that  he  is mistaken because  this  is  the

experience of all MPs in Housing Board estates.  Their

recommendation is a must before permission is  granted

by the HDB Area Office for the staging of such shows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second point is exactly the point I was trying

to  put  forward: that the Ministry of Culture  refers

the  matter to the Housing and Development Board  Area

Office.  The Area Office tells me that they are  quite

happy  to  issue permits for certain sites  but  these

sites  are  not  on  the list of  approved  sites  for

staging the shows. So it is a case of the Ministry  of

Culture  passing  the  buck to the  HDB  and  the  HDB

passing  the buck back to the Ministry. I do not  know

who  is  right and who is wrong. Perhaps the  Minister

might like to explain.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> May I just deal with the problem

of wayang sites again. When an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>



application  is made for a wayang to  be  held  on  an

approved  site,  nobody  bothers  about  getting   any

approval  from  the MP or the Housing and  Development

Board, because  it  will normally  be  approved.  The

problem  arises  only when the wayang organiser  wants

the wayang to be held somewhere other than an approved

site, say, somewhere in front of a house or next to  a

certain  block of building. In such a case the consent

of  the  residents  must be sought. Otherwise  the  MP

himself  will  be  in trouble because  if  the  wayang

causes  disturbance  to the residents  living  in  the

block  of flats or nearby, then they will complain  to

the  MP.  So to respect the rights of these residents,

it  is always our practice to consult either the MP or

the  Housing  Board  officials because  they  are  the

people who would know whether or not the wayang to  be

staged on a certain site would cause a disturbance  to

the  residents.  Therefore, in  these  cases  we  must

ensure  that the residents are not seriously disturbed

by these wayangs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, just a point of clarification. I would like to confirm

what  the  Member for Kim Seng has said. It  is  quite

customary for MPs to give approval before a permit  is

given,  for  one very important reason, i.e.  I  think

many  people  who  organise  these  wayangs  are  non-residents. Some of them are professionals. They strike

up  a  deal with the residents, shopkeepers or hawkers

and  say, "All right, we will organise a wayang  show.

but  how  much will we get as a matter of profit?"  To

eliminate  this malpractice, invariably the  HDB  Area

Officers always ask for the MP's recommendation before

official approval is given.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Just to clarify. Sir. When I talk of a

music  policy, of course the development of  different

types  of  musicians would be part of this policy.  We

need  not  have an orchestra of 101 pianos  or  things

like  that.  I mentioned that we wanted to  raise  the

level  of musical ability. May I point out that  there

are  so  many school bands in Singapore. We  certainly

cannot get a person



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>



who  is  playing  in  a school  band  to  play  in  an

orchestra, but we can pick out the good ones. And this

is  part of a music policy: to encourage the good ones

and  award them scholarships to develop their  talents

in  different  instruments and then  put  them  in  an

orchestra.  I think we want the Education Ministry  to

act  in  concert with the Ministry of Culture so  that

this  kind  of orchestration may lead to the  kind  of

orchestra I was talking about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding Victoria Memorial Hall, perhaps instead of

just  dismissing  the suggestion, the Ministry  should

find  out whether it is feasible to convert it into  a

concert  hall  as it may be cheaper than spending  $10

million to $15 million on an entirely new place for  a

concert hall.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, in answer to the Member for

Toa Payoh, it is not a matter of passing the buck.  We

do  not  pass the buck to the MP. In fact, we  respect

the  rights  of  the  MP.  If  the  residents  in  his

constituency   are  disturbed,  they  would   normally

complain  to him. Therefore, we have to ask  the  MP's

opinion  whether  we should allow  the  wayang  to  be

staged on the site applied for. If the MP thinks  that

the  residents would be disturbed, then he  would  say

"No".  But if he thinks that it would not disturb  the

residents,  then he would say "Yes". I hope  that  can

satisfy both parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Victoria Memorial Hall, we are - not dismissing

the idea from the Member for Katong. I was only saying

that  in my opinion it is probably cheaper to build  a

new  one. Of course, I will ask my officials  to  find

out  what  is  the cost and whether it is feasible  to

convert it into a concert hall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orchestra, as I have said, is not just a matter

of  money and the need for an audience. Our "Music for

Everyone"  series is doing just that -  to  create  an

audience so as to make our people attuned to this kind

of  music. But there is always the problem as to  what

sort of music should be promoted because if we promote

the  wrong music it will not enjoy the support of  the

people.  In many instances, we found that the  Chinese

orchestra is a more popular one. Because of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>



that,  do we have to spend all our money on developing

a  Chinese orchestra? These are the problems that  are

troubling  us, and  I think they are  not  very  easy

problems. With all the help from the Member for Katong

and others interested, we will try to solve them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ngeow Pack Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ngeow Pack Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, although I am

not  happy  with the reply given by the Minister, the

reply  given  to  the Member for  Khe  Bong  is  quite

satisfactory. So I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head Q (cont.) -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the debate just now the Member

for  Boon  Lay  and the Member for Khe Bong  spoke  on

newspapers.  I  would  like to  say  a  few  words.  I

sympathise with the Minister for Culture. We know that

Culture  is  not an easy responsibility.  As  "half  a

newspaper man". I understand this problem. I know that

in  an  open  society it is easy to be  influenced  by

others but not easy to influence them. No matter  what

we say, no matter what we do, the Minister for Culture

is  always  blamed  for it. So we can  expect  further

blame put on him in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyday when I read the two different newspapers in

two languages, I get two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>



kinds  of  feeling.  The Chinese paper  gives  me  one

feeling  and  the  English  paper  gives  me  another.

Recently  an English newspaper carried many  pages  of

writing  about a multimillionaire, how  he  tackled  a

film  star  and  how  he came to acquire  wealth.  The

Chinese  newspaper  on  the other  hand  talked  about

social  problems  and  traditional  virtues  such   as

respect  for  the  old. So in  my  mind,  I  have  two

contradictory ideals. If this were allowed  to  go  on

without  checking our society we will have  a  lot  of

trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture intends to amend the

Newspaper  and Printing Presses Act. I  do  not  agree

with  the  Member for Boon Lay that it would adversely

affect the newspapers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ngeow Pack Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ngeow Pack Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On a point of

clarification, Sir,I did not say that  the  amendment

would adversely affect the newspapers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

take back what I have just said. But the principle  of

amending this Newspaper and Printing Presses Act is to

forbid  anyone  to  hold more than 3%  shares  in  any

newspaper. That is to say, unless there are 17  people

in  the  family and all the 17 people have  3%  shares

each  in the same newspaper, this family will  not  be

able  to  control the newspaper. What I want to  point

out  is  that the Minister for Culture should consider

whether  this  will actually achieve the  aim  because

other   than   the   question  of   newspaper   bosses

controlling  the  newspaper,  some  journalists   with

ulterior  motives  could also write  anything  in  any

newspaper  or  publication here or abroad  influencing

thousands of people. Our Minister for Culture has just

mentioned that these journalists could write all sorts

of  articles.  We can control them internally  but  if

they  write in the foreign newspapers what can we  do?

Recently,  some people were detained by  the  Internal

Security  Department.  Some of  them  belong  to  this

category  of journalists. Some of them have  the  same

ideology  as their bosses and they could be under  the

instructions  of the bosses. But some others  actually

acted contrary to the instructions of their bosses and

they might be infiltrators. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>



would  like to point out that while the original  1974

Newspaper and Printing Presses Act could not make  the

newspapers abide Government's policies, even with  the

amendment I doubt whether it could achieve the desired

aim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now some Members of Parliament, including the

Member for Boon Lay have commented on the work of  the

RTS in diverse manner. I feel that when the workers in

the RTS produce programmes, they usually copy what the

Westerners are doing. What I mean is this. The foreign

professional artistes can perform better than some  of

our  amateurs.  For  example, programmes  like  "Enjoy

Yourself"  and  "Under The Same  Roof"  are  Cantonese

films which are imported are quite popular, of course.

So  our  TV  producers tend to copy and  they  produce

films  like  "Chinese Variety Show" and  "The  $50,000

Question".  These programmes are in Chinese.  When  we

compare  locally produced programmes with the imported

ones,  we  feel  "dead",  "angry",  or  "our  domestic

flowers are not as fragrant as the wild flowers". Some

Members of Parliament have remarked that we should not

pick  the  wild flowers. Some people like the "Guthrie

Hour".  This  programme is all right. Of course,  this

could  be  better  than some of the  other  programmes

produced  locally.  I do not know  whether  the  other

Members of Parliament agree with me on this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. When considering these

points,  the Ministry of Culture should "look  at  the

major  points and work from the minor points", in  the

promotion  of various cultural activities.  Take,  for

example,  our  annual  Chingay procession.  I  do  not

understand  what it means. Why is it  not  called  the

Zhuang  Yi  procession" or some other  transliteration

instead of Chingay procession? This is a far cry  from

the correct tenor of our Minister for Culture when  he

stated  last  month  in this House  that  we  have  to

"remove  the weeds to preserve the essence". Then,  to

keep  alive these old traditional things might not  be

too good for us.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already

stated   in  my  speech  during  the  debate  on   the

Presidential  Address that we are not seeking  further

control  of  the  press. The object  of  the  proposed

amendment is not to control the press but to  redefine

the  ownership of newspapers so that no single  family

or a single minor group can own a newspaper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with the press is not whether or not we

should  control it. In fact, we do not want to control

the  press.  We  want it to be a free and  responsible

press.  But we have to be constantly alert so that  no

communists or pro-communists can infiltrate  into  the

press  and  make  use  of it to disseminate  communist

propaganda. No matter what we do or no matter what law

we  pass,  it can never be perfect and, therefore,  we

have  to  be  alert. We have to monitor  the  kind  of

articles that is being published in the newspapers  in

order to get an account of what the situation is  with

the press, and I think we are doing just that. We know

what  the press is doing and how it is being operated.

But  I  think it is wrong to say that we seek  further

control of the press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of TV programmes, the Member for

Henderson  said  that  we  are  lavishly  copying  the

foreign productions from Hong Kong and Taiwan. This is

not true because when we produce our own programmes we

normally have our own local artistes and local writers

to  write  out the scripts. However, the form  may  be

similar  to  those  programmes which  we  import  from

abroad.  But then TV programmes are more or  less  the

same,  whether they are produced in Taiwan, Hong  Kong

or   even  in  Singapore.  A  great  number  of  these

programmes  that we acquire from Taiwan or  from  Hong

Kong  are  mainly  of  an  historical  interest.   For

instance, the Romance of the Three Kingdoms  and  the

Rise of the Tang Dynasty are of historical interest. I

think it would give our people a very good opportunity

to  learn  about  the history of China, or  for  that

matter the history of other countries, if we are  able

to get those programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible for us as yet to achieve the same

standard of production as the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>



foreign  programme  as the funds  and  the  number  of

professional script writers and artistes is greater in

Hong  Kong  and  Taiwan. They even pay  more  for  the

production.  As  a  result  the  standard   of   local

production  is  not as good as that in Hong  Hong  and

Taiwan.  But  surely the Member for Henderson  is  not

suggesting  that  we should therefore  stop  producing

dramas  or that even if we continue to produce  dramas

which  are directly related to our milieu and  reflect

our values, aspirations, and problems, we should never

produce  them in this form. I think we are  trying  to

produce these programmes in the best way we can. I can

assure  him that we are not really copying or lavishly

imitating what the foreign artistes are doing.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word "Chingay" is a transliteration of the

Chinese characters zhuang yi (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) in the Hokkien

dialect. Zhuang means "makeup, hua zhuang (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). Yi

(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) means "art". So translated literally, it means the

art  of  making-up.  In fact, this  procession  is  to

commemorate a festival which originated in Penang. One

authoritative definition of Chingay is that  it  is  a

sort  of a carriage borne on the shoulders of men.  It

is a gorgeous representation of some historical scene.

This  Chingay  procession  is a  religious-cum-secular

festival  originally held in Penang,  usually  in  the

middle of every first lunar calendar month dating back

to  the second half of the last century. As time  goes

on  the  occasion  became more  and  more  festive  in

nature.  Eventually  items in the procession  included

giant   triangular  flags,  colourful   lanterns   and

banners,  musical  bands, decorative  floats,   stilt

walkers, troupes and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is not happy that the three Chinese

legendary  figures Fu Lu Shou are being  presented  in

Chingay.  I  do  not  agree  with  him  that  this  is

feudalistic in nature. What is the meaning  of  Fu  Lu

Shou (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)?. Fu means good living, presumably. Xin guang

ti pan (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) that means "a very broad waist". But

I  do not think that that is a good thing nowadays. Lu

is good opportunity in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>



life.  Shou  is "long life". Now, what is  wrong  with

having all these?



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Nothing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> In fact, it is a kind of symbol

everyone  would aspire to. In fact, this is  what  all

good  governments  should be - to provide  the  people

with  good  life, good opportunity in life, jobs,  and

long  life,  health. This is what  a  good  government

should be. And what is wrong in projecting these three

legendary  figures even though they may  be  very  old

custom? This is exactly the kind of tradition we  want

to  preserve.  We  want  to  symbolise  this  sort  of

aspiration.  These are very effective symbols,  and  I

think it is worthwhile having them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai:</b> Sir, a point of clarification. I

only spoke on Lu - Fu Lu Shou. Lu is not so simple  as

mentioned by the Minister. If he refers to the Chinese

dictionary,  he  may  go  deeper  and  find  that   it

describes a man too ambitious for powers, for a higher

position. Well, basically I am saying whether we  want

to  copy  the right things from foreign countries  and

discard the bad things. Like the word Chingay, if  the

Minister agrees that Chingay is right, well, it is  up

to  the Minister to decide. But if the Minister  says,

"Better  correct it to Zhuang Yi procession"  or  some

other  transliteration, it is up to  the  Ministry  of

Culture to decide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of this I beg leave to withdraw the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead BAA 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Sembawang has just raised a

point on the production of documentaries for screening

in  our cinemas and the Hon. Minister has replied that

it  is not considered. However, we must recognise that

there  is  a  constant  need to  promote  and  develop

national    consciousness    among    our    citizens,

particularly  our young, through the mass  media  like

TV.  Documentary  films  or  newsreels  depicting  our

national



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>



development,  health and safety measures, educational

and  cultural activities, are from time to time  shown

on  TV.  But  all  of us know that TV  programmes  are

screened  at fixed times, and these times may  not  be

convenient for all home viewers to tune in to.  Or  on

the  other  hand,  if the titles are not  sufficiently

attractive   enough,  viewers  could   miss   a   good

programme.



<br><br>5.53 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to reach a wider audience and also at the

same  time to achieve good impact, may I suggest  that

the Ministry of Culture make it compulsory for cinemas

to  screen such documentaries and newsreels  that  are

from  time  to time made available by RTS. After  all,

most  of the cinemas, or I should say all of them,  do

screen   documentaries  and  newsreels  from   foreign

countries  which  in some cases have no  relevance  to

Singapore at all. With the revenue thus collected from

these   documentaries  and  newsreels,   perhaps   the

Ministry  of Culture could further develop and  expand

its  publicity services to cater to the needs  of  our

young citizens.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir,I beg to differ from the

Member for Toa Payoh that the cinema reaches a  wider

audience. In fact, I think it is the other way  round.

Television and radio together would reach a far  wider

audience  than the cinema. The number of  TV  licences

31st December, 1976

309,276,  and  an estimated number of 940,000  viewers

watch  television on any one night. Moreover.  70%  of

the population tune in daily to radio broadcasts. Thus

television  and  radio have become the most  effective

means  through  which  publicity  programmes  can   be

transmitted. So when the documentaries are screened on

television, I think at any one time we would  be  able

to  reach the majority of the people. Also if it  does

not  reach  them  at  all, the documentaries  that  we

produce which are meaningful and of good value are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>



usually  repeated. So the chances of the  audience  or

the people missing them are actually very small.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it is possible to make it compulsory

for the cinemas to show the newsreels or documentaries

produced  by RTS because the RTS produce  only  16  mm

films.  All the cinemas are screening 35 mm films,  so

it  is not possible for them to screen the 16 mm films

made  available  by RTS. If we do not  produce  35  mm

films for our documentaries, it is not possible for us

to compel the cinemas to screen them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already stated in my reply to the Member

for Sembawang, since television has already taken over

this  function, I think it is more economical  to  let

the RTS handle this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I do not

quite  agree  with what the Minister has said  -  that

since  we have TV newsreels, there is no need for  the

cinemas to screen newsreels and documentary films.  My

point  is that the TV audience and the cinema audience

are   quite  different.  The  films  screened  in  the

cinemas,  because they are 35 mm films, will  leave  a

deeper impression on the audience. As regards the  TV,

most  of  the  people may not bother  to  watch  these

programmes. They are interested in feature  films.  If

we  screen  or telecast some local documentary  films,

many   of   them  will  not  watch  such   programmes.

Therefore, if these documentaries are screened in  the

cinemas,  then the people will be more  aware  of  the

developments going on in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would

just  like  to  reply  to  one  point  raised  by  the

Minister.  He has given some statistics on the  number

of  TV  licences and so on. One of the points  he  has

missed is this. Whatever documentaries or newsreels we

produce,  a lot depends on the title. If the title  is

unattractive enough for the home audience, they  will

not  tune  in.  For instance, whenever TV  news  or  a

documentary  comes on, some families just  switch  off

and  wait  for the next feature programme.  I  do  not

think  he  can base his argument on the number  of  TV

sets owned by the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned by the Member for Sembawang, if these

documentaries  are shown in the cinemas, there  is  a

ready  audience and the impact is very  much  greater.

But  I accept the Minister's explanation that the size

of  the  film  matters in producing documentaries  and

newsreels. In so doing, I would like to beg  leave  to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead CAA 1101* (*The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs

Ahmad Haleem and Ch'ng Jit Koon).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is encouraging to learn that there will be

more colour TV programmes in the near future. However,

the  chief  complaint  from  almost  every  viewer  of

popular   English  programmes  is  the  indiscriminate

manner   in  which  the  advertisements  are  inserted

between  the programmes. One or two is tolerable,  but

more than 10 is unthinkable. And most of the time  the

advertisements  are inserted during  an  important  or

exciting part of the story. Most probably the Minister

may say that it is for revenue purposes. Yes, I accept

that. But the advertisements should be screened before

or after a programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not only irritating but reduces the enjoyment

of  a  programme.  I would therefore strongly  suggest

that  advertisements be screened  before  or  after  a

programme or once during a programme.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If RTS says that we are better off in this respect

compared to other countries, then I think they may not

be  right  because other countries have two  stations,

that is, commercial and national. There should not  be

too   many   commercial  advertisements  in   our   TV

programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Tamil section of RTS still leaves much to

be  desired.  The Tamil films are still shown  on  two

different  days at a late hour instead of  one  single

day.  The excuse that Tamil films are too long  to  be

shown on a single day is a lame one. Further, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>



aggravate  the  situation,  there  seems  to   be   no

punctuality  in screening times. Sometimes  the  films

are  screened  as late as 15 minutes past  the  stated

time. I thought RTS possess a crystal clock.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I brought up this matter during the last Budget

debate.  I am very fed up about this. Somebody  shouts

at  the  sun. What is the use of shouting at the  sun?

The sun does not care. The one who shouts will suffer.

Although  I  bring this matter up at every session  of

the  Budget debate, no action has been taken.  I  feel

that  the Minister has got no power. On paper  he  has

the power but not in action. There must be somebody in

the  RTS  who  is  victimising the  Tamil  programmes.

Somebody  must  look  into  this  matter.  Maybe  some

officers need to be called up to pull up their socks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children's programmes are insipid as one can

think  of.  The viewers are tired of seeing  the  same

scene  of  children  gathering  round  an  adult   and

following the same rigmarole. Cannot the producers  be

more   imaginative?  Perhaps  some  of  the   imported

programmes  could  be  a  guide  for  producing   more

creative programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it appears that there is no outdoor shooting

for  Tamil  colour TV programmes as we  have  for  the

other  language programmes. Why is this so?  Why  must

RTS  be  victimising  the Tamil  programme?  I  cannot

understand. After all the Tamil people are also paying

Income Tax and paying the same amount of licence fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the shooting of Tamil programmes is done

mostly during the weekdays. And on Sundays the studios

are  not  made  available for the  shooting  of  Tamil

programmes  because  the other groups  are  using  the

studios.  If  the studios cannot be used  on  Sundays.

then  how  can the Tamil section get the artistes  who

may be available only on Sundays because of the nature

of their work? If this goes on, the Tamil section will

never progress.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to know what method is used

in  the selection of singers for the Tamil programmes.

It  seems  that during auditioning there  is  no  band

present  and  the selection is made at the  whims  and

fancies of the auditioners. Thus when the artistes are

selected  and  when they are actually  performing  the

accompanying   band  at  times  finds  difficulty   in

following the artistes who had been auditioned without

a band.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no wonder that the standard of production of

Tamil programmes is so poor. Something must be done to

encourage  better  quality programmes  for  the  Tamil

Section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally. Sir, there is a lot of emphasis on

bilingualism  by  the  Education  Ministry.  Why   not

introduce some programmes on TV in the later  part  of

the  evening to cater for working adults? Then we will

be   educating  a  nation  of  youngsters  and  adults

together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is that when you tune to the Tamil

radio  wave  band you cannot get the Tamil  programme.

All  over  Singapore the radio broadcast in  Tamil  is

very  poor. That is also a form of victimisation! When

the  Tamil  people  tune to the  Tamil  section, they

cannot get the programme. The broadcasting section  in

the  Tamil network is very poor. All the time  we  are

fighting  with  the  RTS  and,  therefore,   the   RTS

purposely do this. This is because the Minister has no

power.  Let  us see what happens to what I speak  here

today.  Tomorrow  you will see the result.  They  will

still `victimise' the Tamil programme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, I would like

to  draw the Minister's attention to the use presently

made  of  the intervals between television  programmes

which  are  not taken up with advertising commercials.

Usually  this  interval  time  is  about  one  or  two

minutes'   duration  during  which  nobody  wants   to

advertise.  This interval is normally filled  in  with

films  on  fishes, flowers or girls singing  songs  of

Singapore.  That  is all right. But  if  you  keep  on

seeing it four times a day, it becomes monotonous.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that to stimulate interest - the Member

for  Toa Payoh said there was no attraction to  coming

programmes - the RTS make a 10 or 15-second extract of

the  programmes  that are to be  shown  later  in  the

evening, the next day or the next week. This  is  just

like  the  Akan Datang in the cinema. In this  way  it

will  stimulate  interest. The title  of  a  programme

might not appear to be very interesting, but if the TV

could  show something interesting in Akan Datang  more

people  might watch the programme. And if  advertisers

think that more people will watch the programme,  they

will  want to advertise, and therefore there  is  more

revenue  for the RTS. Maybe the Tamil programme  might

then  not be so badly victimised. There will  be  more

money  and the local TV production might benefit  from

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the extracts, I think the RTS could show

more  filmlets. I think they do a very good  job  with

the  "Save  Water"  campaign where we  see  Bobo,  the

elephant, saving water. The same thing could  be  done

for  the  campaign  against drugs. We  also  have  the

police campaigns such as "Don't road hog" and "Keep in

lane". But what does "Don't road hog" mean? RTS  could

make  a  10  or  20-second filmlet to show  what  road

hogging  means. For 15 seconds you can do a  filmlet.

But  there seems to be no such shows of an educational

value for our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They could also use it as a public service. If there

is an announcement for a public service, the RTS could

put  it down on a piece of card and screen it over the

TV.  But  there is nothing on this. Nobody  shows  any

interest. Nobody reads and nobody does anything  about

it.  If they can have a little film to show the people

that  there  is a cultural show coming  up,  a  quick,

little excerpt of one or two scenes from the show will

create  a little interest. All this could be  done  by

RTS.  I  am sure it will be very well received by  the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to come to the presentation of news

and  newsreel. There has been some improvement in  the

presentation but it still leaves a lot to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>



desired.  They  seem  to  be  bankrupt  of  ideas   of

presenting  the news. You can switch off  the  TV  and

listen to the news on radio; it is just the same.  All

you  see  on  TV  is the news reader reading,  looking

down,  now looking up, and quickly looking down again.

The news presentation over television should be better

than what we get from the radio. If it is the same  as

on  radio, we might as well not have news presentation

over TV. They need only say. "For news, please tune in

to  Radio  Singapore." Then the film clips. When  they

say something about a news item, use the film clip. We

do  not  want to see the same stuff all the  time.  We

have  a  situation where if something is happening  in

the Middle East or in a town in Thailand, for example.

140  km  out of Bangkok, out comes a map of  Thailand,

but it shows "Bangkok". But where is this town that is

140  km away from Bangkok? Nobody knows. It just shows

a  map  of  Thailand. Where is Bangkok?  What  is  the

point?  They  might as well not show the  map.  Nobody

knows.  If  they  want  to show something,  then  show

exactly  where  it is. Show an arrow pointing  to  the

town and say. "This is the town of Chulat" or whatever

it  is.  Then we will know. If they just want to  show

Thailand, they might just as well forget it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes when listening to a news item, the news

reader reads about one topic and in the same breath he

or  she  continues with the next topic, and I  say  to

myself, "What relevance has this item got to the first

one?" Suddenly I realise that he or she is on the next

news  item.  Maybe  an  educational  programme  or   a

training could be given. After every topic he  or  she

should wait two or three seconds, and then carry on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is that the news readers look as

though  they have just returned from a funeral.  There

is  no smile. They should at least put on a smile.  If

it  is a sombre piece of news, he looks sombre, and if

it  is a happy news he looks happy. At the end of  the

programme he says, "That is all for the news  tonight.

Good  night."  And smile. But they do not  do  such  a

thing. They look as if they are zombies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last point, Sir, We have this background music.

Do  not  tell me that we have no talent on  background

music. I think it is not a question of talent but just

a  simple  question  of laziness.  In  every  newsreel

someone  just picks up an LP and just change from  one

music  to  another  with no regard to  what  is  being

shown. I once saw a newsreel showing the tragedy of an

earthquake, and the background music was like  cowboys

fighting  with the Red Indians. One day my family  was

watching  a Malay drama programme, and I was  speaking

to my grandmother. I was there and I was listening. It

was  a  Malay  drama  programme.  It  was  not  a  sad

programme.  Neither was it a happy programme.  It  was

just  a  normal scene. The background music was "Jesus

Christ  Superstar!"  This is a  Malay  programme.  The

music  has no relevance at all. It seems that somebody

just  picked up a musical record from the library  and

just  played. He did not care what music ought  to  go

with  the  programme. If they want to make a programme

interesting,  the background music should  create  the

right atmosphere. There is no atmosphere at all to the

local Malay drama programmes. That is probably one  of

the  reasons why local production has failed. One does

not  anyhow  play  any  music he  likes.  I  hope  the

Minister  will  look into this, and it does  not  cost

very  much  to  make an improvement.  I  do  hope  the

improvements will be evident.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Sir, RTS and the

National  Theatre Trust occasionally run  song-writing

competitions.  The  winning entries  are  occasionally

played  over TV Singapore as interludes. This is  very

commendable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say songs sometimes cheer our hearts - if they

are lively. Some songs make us feel romantic - if they

are  love songs. Songs also touch our hearts - if they

are sad songs. Songs can arouse feelings of patriotism

and strengthen our unity as a nation - if the music is

stirring   and   the  words  express  adequately   our

aspirations and national pride.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other countries, people have national songs or

folk  songs that unite them. Whether it be in time  of

war  or  peace, in the battle field or in  the  cafes,

they sing these songs with such gusto and feeling  and

feel good after that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, because we are a multicultural society

with a comparatively short history, we have so far few

songs  that  we can call our very own.  As  a  result,

whether  it  is a group of national servicemen,  youth

groups of the People's Association or groups of  trade

unionists, when they sing, they sing songs from  other

lands  that have no significance or relevance  to  us.

These  songs  may  help them let off their  steam  and

exuberance,  but  they certainly  do  not  stir  their

hearts  and  spirit  as one united  people,  as  proud

Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, song writing competitions should be

encouraged.  The winning entries should  not  only  be

played  over TV Singapore as interludes, but  also  be

distributed  to  schools, national  servicemen,  youth

groups,  trade  unionists, etc, and  all  should  be

encouraged to sing, so that a time will come when  all

Singaporeans will have in common, Singapore  songs  to

sing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> May I begin with a reply to the

Member    for    Anson's   first    query    regarding

advertisements on television by setting the matter  in

perspective? The TV Commercial Service was inaugurated

in  January  1964. The rationale for it was explicitly

stated by my predecessor, now the Foreign Minister, in

his  speech at the inauguration ceremony. Of the three

ways  of  financing television, television advertising

was  considered  by  my predecessor  to  be  the  only

practical  and  relatively painless way  of  financing

television without making undue demands on the pockets

of  the viewer or of the taxpayer. The position  still

holds good today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TV commercials are not indiscriminately

inserted   into   programmes.  Almost   all   of   the

entertainment  programmes that  are  acquired  by  RTS

have, in fact, built-in commercial breaks or junctures

designed by overseas



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>



producers of the programmes themselves. We do not make

the  breaks.  The  breaks were already  there  in  the

films,  Maybe  the  commercial  comes  in  during   an

exciting moment but it is already there. We do not put

it there. Naturally, when the producer makes his film,

he wants the viewers to watch the commercials during a

very exciting scene.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A one-hour programme has normally about six such

built-in    breaks   for   the   insertion    of    TV

advertisements. In a half-hour programme. RTS works on

a maximum of two such breaks for advertisement and not

more  than 7-8% of the total weekly transmission  time

is   given  to  commercials  or  advertisements.  This

compares to the 17% to 25% devoted to commercials  in

the  case of other stations. If he thinks that we have

too  many  commercials, he should take a look  at  the

other  stations. I should refer him to an  article  in

Sunday, 6th March, 1977. It is entitled

"Where TV is really commercial", and I quote:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bangkok: In most countries when a commercial

interrupts a television programme the viewer has  time

to whip out to the kitchen and grab a cold beer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Thailand, he has time for a shower. Often, he can

also  take  a shampoo. And still have time to  go  for

that beer."



<br><br>It went on to say that a viewer with a stopwatch timed

a  show "The Six Million Dollar Man" and he found that

the  show ran for about 48 minutes but the commercials

went  on  to about 35 minutes. And there was a  boxing

show.  The  whole of the boxing show came to  only  45

minutes  but  there were 63 minutes of commercials  in

that  45  minutes of boxing. That is really commerical

TV that you find in other stations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have stated in this House last month, no

commercials or advertisements are allowed in the  News

and   in  informational  and  educational  programmes,

although  commercial interest or inquiries  have  been

made  in this direction. As for the commercials  being

inserted   only   before  or   after   or   in-between

programmes, I think the advertisers have to  be  given

some  measure  of return in terms of  the  money  they

spend on TV advertisements. This would be an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>



assurance  that  there  are  viewers  to  watch  their

advertisements when they come on. It is no use  having

it at the beginning or at the end when TV viewers just

disappear after the programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson seems to have a kind of complex

that  he  is being victimised. I can assure  him  that

this is not the case. I am not a person who would like

to  victimise anyone, least of all our Tamil  friends.

He was talking about the lack of Tamil films or that a

Tamil  film  is  broken up into  two  parts.  But  the

problem is this. The average length of a Tamil film is

always  very  long,  sometimes 2 1/2  hours  running  and

sometimes  three hours or four hours. If  we  were  to

show  the  Tamil film in a single evening, then  there

would  be no other shows except that Tamil film.  This

will  be  unfair,  and we would be  victimising  other

viewers.  If  we  continue to  do  this  we  may  even

antagonise other viewers.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, on a point of

clarification. Tamil films are usually shown  late  in

the night. Although the film lasts 2 1/2 hours or 3 hours

many  parts  are being cut. So the full  film  is  not

being shown. There are some parts which are cut,  e.g.

where songs are sung. We are not victimising the other

viewers.  When a programme is fixed for 10 o'clock  it

must  be  shown at 10 o'clock. If it is scheduled  for

10.15 then it must be 10.15. But when it is fixed  for

10  o'clock it is not shown until 10.20 or 10.30. What

is the RTS doing?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I will come to this point about

punctuality.   Punctuality   is   given   very   great

importance  by  RTS.  Where  programmes  are  delayed,

normally   it  is  because  of  special   reports   or

Parliamentary  reports which affect the starting  time

of  the  programmes that follow. Sometimes  Parliament

sits  but in the case of the last President's Address.

Parliament sittings were extended for two days.  There

was  no  prior  planning  for  this  because  the  RTS

schedule is normally fixed two weeks ahead.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I am not talking about the

President's Speech or Parliament sittings. During week

days when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>



there  are no Parliament sittings. I notice  that  for

the  last two programmes although it was fixed for  10

o'clock  it did not start until 10.15 or 10.20.  I  am

not objecting to the Parliamentary report.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I am only just quoting this

as  an  example. It is not only just the Parliamentary

report.  There may be some other show which  comes  up

unexpectedly, for instance, a football match or a more

exciting show. This has to be inserted apart from  the

normal  schedule and, therefore, the timing is  upset.

But   such  changes,  whenever  possible, are  always

conveyed  to  the press for reflecting  in  the  day's

schedule. And if the changes cannot be conveyed to the

press in time they will always be publicised on TV  as

often  as  possible.  We try very  much  to  keep  our

programmes  on time but sometimes it goes  beyond  our

control and we have to go beyond the scheduled time. I

can  assure  the  Member for Anson  that  this  is  no

victimisation. This is purely because something  crops

up apart from the normal schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to his criticism on a lack of outdoor

shooting facilities for Tamil programmes, I must point

out  that  outdoor filming facilities are limited.  So

priority  is  given to news coverages and  documentary

films,  The materials shot are then used in  news  and

newsreel  and documentary films produced  in  all  the

four  languages, including Tamil. A news  magazine  in

Tamil,  mainly  made  up  of film  materials  shot  on

outside location, is also produced monthly. There  is,

therefore,   no   question   of   discrimination    or

victimisation  at  all.  It is  inevitable  that  most

productions,  irrespective of languages,  have  to  be

carried out on week days as there is only one Saturday

and one Sunday per week. We cannot make it any more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The convenience of artistes is taken into

consideration  as  far as possible in  scheduling  the

recording  dates of programmes. Children's  programmes

and  family  magazines  in  Tamil  are,  for  example,

sometimes shot on a Saturday afternoon or on a Sunday.

For  other types of TV productions in Tamil, we  often

go out of our way to arrange for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>



recordings  in  the  evenings on  week  days  whenever

artistes are unable to come in the day. Apart from the

above,  it is to be noted that the production crew  in

our studios are entitled to have at least one rest day

per  month,  either on a Saturday or on a  Sunday.  So

therefore  there are even fewer Saturdays and  Sundays

to go round.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singers for Tamil programmes are selected and

auditioned  by a panel of three judges.  A  singer  is

tested and auditioned basically for voice quality  and

ability  to  sing with the required tone,  rhythm  and

correct pronunciation, and therefore there is no  need

for a band to accompany the singer.

However, before a programme is recorded, the singer is

given  ample  time to practise with  the  band  during

rehearsals  at  the studios. The quality  of  all  the

programmes  depends  very  much  on  the  standard  of

available artistes, including singers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion from the Member for Telok Blangah

that RTS should utilise some of the interlude time  to

show trailers or excerpts of forthcoming programmes is

a  good  one. In fact, this is being done on a  modest

scale  through slides and announcements of outstanding

entertainment programmes or other special  events.  To

prepare  trailers on a more elaborate scale  which  he

has   in  mind  would  require  more  production   and

technical  efforts  and  facilities  which   are   not

available  at  present. Attempts during the  last  two

financial  years to obtain two posts  to  back-up  and

improve  our  present  TV gathering  and  presentation

units  were rejected. Until such time as the necessary

staff  are  provided, the present  modest  methods  of

advance publicity will have to continue. In any  case,

we will try to vary and improve these interludes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member that the effect which simple

traffic  slogans or other subjects have on TV  viewers

might  be  limited. However, when these  are  combined

with   other   media,   the  total   impact   can   be

considerable, The RTS is at present planning a  series

of 13 programmes in all languages.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>



dealing  with road safety, including lane  discipline.

These  will  be  telecast sometime  between  June  and

August  this  year in support of the  lane  discipline

campaign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with him that our news reading should

be more visualised. In fact, this is being done on TV.

Therefore, during a Parliamentary report if  the  name

of  a  Member is mentioned his picture will appear  on

the  screen.  But  the normal practice  of  using  map

graphic  is to pinpoint the cities or towns  mentioned

in  the  news. This is not possible for a  very  small

village or town which cannot be located in the  atlas.

But  this difficulty is overcome by resorting  to  the

use  of  a  cross  to indicate the  last  location  in

relation  to  a  better known city or town.  At  other

times the RTS have used arrows to pinpoint locations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, background music for the news. Regarding news

items, sometimes the time factor has to be considered.

When an important newsreel comes into the hands of our

producers they always like to show it on the screen as

quickly  as  possible. In some cases  it  may  not  be

possible  for them to locate the appropriate music  to

accompany  the newsreel. But in any case, I think  the

suggestion is a good one and our producers  will  look

more closely into this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein has spoken on song writing

competition. We are doing our best to popularise songs

composed by Singaporeans for song writing competition.

I  believe these songs will help develop our  national

identity and instil a sense of patriotism in our young

people.  We are asking the Ministry of Education,  the

People's Association, the SAF Drama and Music  Company

and  the  Institute of Education to  popularise  these

songs.  Moreover, these songs will shortly be  printed

in   a   booklet  for  distribution  to  schools   and

organisations. In fact, a local music school has  been

using some of these songs for teaching and examination

purposes. However, given some time we should  be  able

to build up a repertoire of local music and songs. But

we  should  remember that great songs of  the  various

countries were not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>



written  overnight. Very often they  were  written  by

unknown writers and because they reflected the  common

experience  and  aspirations of a people  they  became

popular and handed down from generation to generation.



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi (Kampong Kembangan):</b> Mr

Deputy  Speaker,  Sir, I would  be  grateful  if  the

Minister  could give some clarification, particularly,

on  the points raised by the Member for Telok Blangah.

I  think  the  hon.  Member has raised  very  relevant

points  regarding the reading of news over television.

I  am sure most of us would agree that RTS could still

improve  on  the  format  of  news  presentation  over

television. I was thinking, for example, that we could

encourage  the telecasting of opinions on  major  news

items,  Perhaps,  there could be  short  telecasts  of

discussions  on a particular point by local  notables.

It  is not a debate. The idea of news presentation  is

not  just to say that something has happened.  If  the

RTS  could try to telecast short excerpts of  opinions

on a particular item, it would be educational and more

than just a factual report.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> There are newsreels.



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Newsreels are a separate

matter. I have also been considering for some time why

RTS  needs  to always summarise the news items  before

the  news begin and then make a further summary at the

end of the news. I do not know the rationale for this.

If the Minister could consider reviewing this we could

save a few seconds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

Member  for Kampong Kembangan has made some very  good

suggestions. But regarding the telecasting of opinions

by  people  to  accompany the  news,  the  problem  is

whether we can get the people to come forward to  give

their  opinions. Local people are reticent on  matters

concerning  local affairs. In many  cases  it  is  not

possible  for  us to get the right type of  people  to

come forward to give their opinions. Especially during

a news telecast, when the news of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>



morning  or the day has to be read in the evening,  it

is  not easy to find immediately the persons belonging

to   the  relevant  discipline  or  people  who   have

something  to  say  about a certain  subject  to  come

forward and give their opinions on that subject  which

is about to be telecast in the news service. But if we

are  able to find these people, of course, it is  good

to telecast them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for the news summary before and after the

news is read is this. This has been the practice for a

long time. The summary is to give those who switch  on

to  the news a little late to know what has been  read

so  far,  and the summary at the beginning is to  tell

them  what  to expect. If from the summary  they  find

that  the news would be of no relevance to them,  they

may  switch it off. The summary at the end of the news

is to let them know the news items they have missed if

they switch on too late.



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

if  I  may be allowed to comment further. In the first

place,  the points summarised before the news  do  not

cover all the news items being read. They may just  be

covering 40% of the news items. So to say that the pre-News  Summary is to enable persons to anticipate  what

would be read in the news items does not seem to be  a

good explanation as to why the summary is given at the

beginning of the news. Secondly, I do not really think

it  means much to those who came late for the news nor

do  I believe that they really benefit by getting  the

summary  at the end of the news. I would like  to  say

that  I do not suggest in any way that we should  stop

the reading of the summary at the beginning and at the

end of the news. But I think it is good for us to just

ask  what  the rationale is, Even if this has  been  a

long  practice, do we really need to continue it? This

is all I ask.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have

already  said that it was a summary. Sometimes  it  is

necessary  to  give  a headline since  it  is  a  news

service. The newspapers usually have headlines.  Items

which  are summarised at the beginning and at the  end

of the news are the more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>



important  news items and are given headlines.  In  my

opinion, this format is a good one. I do not think the

practice should be discontinued.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  has  not answered my question correctly.  He

has  sidetracked the issue. Most probably  my  picture

will  not be shown on the TV tonight. Because I always

attack  the  RTS, they never show my face. However,  I

beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Dhanabalan (Kallang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead CBA 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for Culture whether

there is any in-house system in RTS that evaluates and

monitors programmes from the technical angle  so  that

the  many instances of technical lapses and unintended

humour  will  be  reduced.  Some  examples  of   these

technical lapses have already been mentioned far  more

dramatically, complete with music, by the  Member  for

Telok  Blangah. I think we are all familiar  with  the

news  programmes which have been touched upon quite  a

bit, and with the mistakes that are often presented on

the screen, for example, a map of the Middle East when

the  headline refers to Vietnam, or the picture of the

wrong  person  being shown. One of  the  Members  here

swears  that he once saw, instead of a picture of  the

Minister  of  Defence, a character  from  the  "Adam's

family". I do not know whether .RTS was trying to pass

some subtle message to the Minister of Defence, but  I

think it was probably another technical lapse. I think

there  are  too many technical lapses and an  in-house

system of evaluation and monitoring would help.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sports telecast is another area where there are

quite a few lapses. It is a very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>



popular programme and very often we find that  at  the

most  dramatic moment instead of seeing the action  on

the field, we see something else. For example, once  I

saw  a  hockey  game where Singapore  was  scoring  an

equalising  goal and instead of seeing the  excitement

in  front of the goal mouth, I saw the excited picture

of  the Minister. I think there are some psychologists

who  make  it a point to study the reaction of  people

watching an event. But I think most of our viewers are

more  simple minded and would rather watch the  event.

So  I hope that there is some monitoring system and  I

would like to hear from the Minister what is happening

on this particular score.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, some of the errors committed

by   our   TV  producers  and  cameramen  are   purely

accidental  and not due to a lack of knowledge  or  of

training. Nevertheless, it is my view that the RTS  is

now  large enough and sophisticated enough to  justify

the setting up of a staff training unit or school. The

training  school  will  enable all  newcomers  to  the

profession to receive proper training before they  are

actually put on the job. At the same time, older hands

can  be put through refresher courses to update  ideas

and techniques from time to time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many national broadcasting stations in this region

have broadcasting training centres of their own. It is

only in this way that technicians and production staff

can  thoroughly  master the tools of their  trade  and

learn  how  to use all the sophisticated equipment  to

the  best  advantage.  Training  facilities  must   be

similar to but separate from the studios and equipment

used for the daily output of programmes. To close down

studios  for training too often not only disrupts  the

normal  flow  of  essential  producion  but  is   also

uneconomical.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it is not the Ministry of Culture that needs to

be convinced of the necessity of a training school for

our broadcasting staff. It is someone else and we will

try  to convince them. The time to set up the training

unit  or centre could not be more opportune than  now.

We have the building which was recently vacated by the

staff now housed in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>



the  new Radio Centre. We have the redundant black and

white  cameras  and related equipment. Basically,  all

that  we need is a small staff to run the school, some

funds  to  refurbish  the old building  and  for  some

installation and modification work to be carried  out.

But  if we delay this too long, the cameras which  are

at  present  serviceable will through disuse  rust  to

such  an  extent that they may eventually have  to  be

written off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, training is carried out on an ad hoc

basis  and while the trainee is in service and on  the

job.  Some of the key members of the production  staff

have  been  sent  to  stations  and  training  centres

overseas  to  upgrade their knowledge  and  learn  the

latest techniques, particularly in colour. Upon  their

return  these  officers run sessions for the  recruits

and  others who need training. But all this has to  be

done  in  addition  to  the  senior  officers'  normal

production and supervisory duties. From time to  time.

RTS also obtains the services of experts from overseas

through  the Colombo Plan scheme to carry out training

sessions.  For the duration of these sessions,  normal

production facilities and studios have to be  diverted

for training purposes. Until such time as the proposal

for a training school is approved, I am afraid we will

have   to   tolerate  this  unsatisfactory  situation.

However,  as I have said before, most of these  errors

and mistakes are of an accidental nature. This is most

noticeable in a programme which is telecast live, such

as  the  news.  But in a pre-recorded programme  where

there is opportunity for rehearsing and editing, these

errors are not so common.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, does the Hon. Minister not

realise that accidents do not happen? They are caused.

I  am sure the Member for Kampong Chai Chee will agree

with  me. So if they are caused, something can be done

about them. I do not see why we have to tolerate it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I do not understand what the

Member meant by "caused". We do not deliberately cause

these errors to happen. All these happen by accident.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Just a small point, Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir.  When the Minister spoke about training, he might

perhaps explore the possibility of collaboration  with

CEPTA.    Although   CEPTA   is   orientated   towards

educational  TV, still the techniques are similar  and

there   could  be  some  economies  derived   out   of

collaboration in this respect between the Ministry  of

Culture and the Ministry of Education.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, CEPTA is devoting more time

to  educational TV, and therefore I think it is unfair

to  expect  CEPTA to spend some of its  time  for  the

training of our technicians or our producers.  In  any

case  CEPTA has been of service to us, but I  do  not

think it is a solution.



<br><br><!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Sir, in view of the Minister's

explanation, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead FAA 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I love to go to the Museum. I have been to the

National  Museum many times. But, until very recently,

the exhibits seem to be the same as they were 20 years

ago.  In the last couple of years there seemed  to  be

some changes. I saw that money was being spent, and  I

thought we were going to see something fantastic.  But

all  that I can see is that the old exhibits have been

rearranged. They put the exhibits in different places,

trying  to  confuse  the  public,  but  with   a   few

additions. Nothing much. I am interested to  see  what

the  countries around us are like, what their  histroy

is like, what happened during the Stone age in Malaya.

etc.  But  I  regret to say that there is  a  lack  of

exhibits purely of Singapore origin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160 years ago Singapore was rediscovered. Before

that  Singapore existed, so it was never  founded.  It

was rediscovered. There is a lot of history before and

after  this  period. And yet when  people  go  to  the

Museum  they  see  nothing very much about  Singapore.

Visitors to the Museum expect to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>



see  a  potted history of our country and yet they  do

not see any. When they go to the Museum, they want  to

know  who built Singapore. Personalities who are  well

known  in Singapore should be highlighted. And  so  do

our  cultures. We are mainly of immigrant  stock.  Our

forefathers came from various countries.  Why  can  we

not  show  in our Museum what Singapore was like  when

our  Chinese, Indian, Malay or Arab forefathers  came?

How they were dressed, their hairstyles, customs, life-styles,  and traditions. These are valuable  reminders

to our present Nouveau Riche, the new rich generation,

of  the humble and hard beginnings of our forefathers.

This   will  encourage  a  sense  of  pride   in   our

achievements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure many people do not really know that

Singapore  was  really much smaller than  what  it  is

today.  Reclamation was not done only in the  last  15

years or so. There were reclamations even before that,

like Beach Road which was actually sited on the beach.

Such items in our Museum can tell what it was like  to

be  in  Singapore. We could show the wild  animals  in

those  days, like tigers, wild boars, roaming on  this

island. We can show visitors what Singapore was before

and what it is now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to read about the local content of the

Second  World  War, and I find that all  the  colonial

powers, the mak salehs, get all the publicity of  what

they did during the war. There was very little written

about our own people. How about the Museum telling us,

and  showing  exhibits  of what actually  happened  to

Singapore  during  the  war?  There  were  the   local

celebrities,  and the legal system. We  can  show  our

famous  leaders, judges, lawyers, what they  did,  and

the  various  personalities who have helped  to  build

Singapore,  the big Chinese towkays who  created  this

country. All these are not being shown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When students studying Singapore history go to our

National  Museum,  they should be able  after  two  or

three  visits to assimilate the knowledge of the whole

history of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>



Right now, if someone goes there, he learns nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again tourists and floating population can get a

look  at Singapore in microcosom - everything for  them

to  see, the growth of Singapore, how it grew  from  a

village  into a city. My forefathers used to  live  in

Kallang  village and they used to work as  rollers  of

rokok  daun  (leaf cigarettes). All these  things  and

what our forefathers were like could be shown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that I like to know whether the

Ministry proposes to have several museums in Singapore

-  a  science  museum, a natural  history  museum  and

historical museum. Because I have seen quite a lot  of

the  natural  history exhibits being removed.  Are  we

going to have it? If so, where and when is it going to

be opened.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Science Centre.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, perhaps the

Member has not been to the Museum recently. If he  has

been  there.  I  am  sure he will find  something  new

there,  something different. So it is not  correct  to

say  that the displays in the National Museum are  all

the  same throughout the year. The National Museum Art

Gallery which was officially opened on the 21st August

last  year  has held art exhibitions continuously.  So

has the Young People's Gallery which is devoted mainly

to  student  art.  In  addition, the  three  renovated

gallery  rooms  for the University  of  Singapore  art

collection were opened to the public in the middle  of

March  last  year. On the ground floor,  the  National

Museum  has  displays pertaining  to  the  history  of

Singapore from the period of Temasek to the 1930s.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the final phase renovation of the National

Museum  there are plans to provide a gallery  for  the

chronological history of Singapore and another gallery

to  illustrate the growth and development of Singapore

City.  Even now the displays in the old galleries  are

changed  from time to time. For example, a display  of

the costumes, garments, tapestries and other artifacts

used



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>



by  the  Straits Chinese of Singapore in the 19th  and

20th centuries has just ended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Museum is worth many visits in the

year, especially for its exhibitions. At least 262,000

people  visited  the  National  Museum  in  the   last

financial year. What the Member wants to see seems  to

be  an increased number of exhibits, but this can only

be  acquired in time. But if there are no  new  museum

pieces  discovered, how can we create  them?  We  have

already  dug up the whole of Singapore as a result  of

the  urban renewal development, but so far we have not

come  up with anything worth exhibiting in our Museum.

I am sure if there are, they would have been exhibited

in our Museum. The stuffed animals have all been taken

over  by  the Singapore Science Council. I am sure  he

will  find  them  there. It is not  possible  to  have

several  museums in Singapore because  it  is  already

quite difficult to keep up with just one museum. I  am

sure  we  do not have the resources to keep more  than

one.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, just a point of information.

There  are a number of museums already. There are  the

Arts  and  Anthropology  Museum,  the  Science  Centre

Museum and the Sentosa Maritime and Gun Museum. We are

quite  well  stocked with museums.  Perhaps  I  should

suggest  to  the Minister for Culture that he  revives

the  Advisory Committee that used to help him with the

Museum.  The Member for Telok Blangah could be invited

to  be a member of this Committee. I remember I was  a

member of this Committee at one time but after we have

finished  our  work  the  Minister  closed  down   the

Committee.  This  reminds me of the Malay  expression:

Lepas jambatan buang tongkat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, I go to the Museum very often.

I  am  aware of the various art exhibitions  and  that

there have been improvements. But what I am saying  is

that  the improvement is just a redistribution of  the

old exhibits. I remember what it was 20 years ago, and

now  I see it is the same one redistributed. There was

the  nyonya exhibit. I went to see the nyonya  exhibit

and all the art exhibits. What I am saying is that I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>



want  to  see the history of Singapore as I  walk  in.

That  is  what  I  want to see. And that  is  what  my

children  and other people's children and the students

want to see. They do not want to see exhibits one at a

time.  Do you expect everybody to go and see just  the

nyonya  clothes? Not every one in Singapore  could  go

and  see  the exhibit four or five times a year.  They

may be able to go there only once or twice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, I had the fortune or

misfortune  to  serve  in the same  Committee  as  the

Member  for Katong. The Member for Telok Blangah  said

that  the  Museum  appeared to be nothing  new  but  a

rearrangement of exhibits. The Museum has  been  there

for many years and the arrangement was there for those

many  years that it only conformed to the old display

technique.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I understand is that the Museum is now

undergoing renovation to upgrade and update itself  in

the  style,  manner and artistic display of  the  very

valuable exhibits. Maybe the Member for Telok  Blangah

is  under the misconception that it is a simple  means

to  deceive  the public. I can assure the Member  that

being quite associated with the Museum myself, that is

not  the case, First, it has to get itself geared  up,

update  itself and then we can talk about  whether  or

not we should have a department to show the history of

Singapore.  But  now  and then, exhibitions  like  the

nyonya  dress and so on will highlight one  particular

aspect  of  the  history  of Singapore  and  that  the

cumulative  effect will give us a better indepth  than

just  walking into the Museum and declare that "I have

emerged  from  the history of Singapore."  It  is  not

possible  at this stage to put everything together  in

the  very constricted area of the National Museum.  If

the Member for Telok Blangah spends three hours in the

Museum  and declares that "I have been to the Museum",

I  think he is not being honest with himself. That  is

not  the way to see a museum. I will have to spend  at

least  one week if I want to understand every  exhibit

in our Museum alone. However, in etiquette, the Member

for Telok Blangah might think it

is.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, the Member for Kampong Chai

Chee has already spoken what I am going to say. So all

that  I  am going to add is that a museum is a museum.

It  is not a china shop. A museum isa place where  all

the  old  things of historical value are being housed.

Since  we  do not have so many things of a  historical

value,  we  have  to do with the old  ones  which  are

already there. In a china shop, of course, we can have

a  new display every week or whenever a shipment comes

in. That is another matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Advisory Committee of the Museum has done a very

good  job.  Of course, we are not the kind  of  people

that would be accused of guo qiao chou ban (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)

which means "After we have crossed the bridge, we will

take away the plank."



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> I was only joking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> We are not that kind of people.

We  appreciate their services very much and we  would,

when  the  time comes, again invite them, if they  are

still interested in it, to sit in the Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, I am not entirely happy with

the answer, but I withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead GAA 1101* (*The same amendment also stood in the name of Dr Ong

Leong Boon).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this subhead I would like to pose two

questions. Firstly, in the past one year I have  found

that  the Film Censorship Board has not been stringent

in  its  censorship of films. They  have  become  more

liberal  in  their  censorship, resulting  in  certain

undesirable films being screened in the cinemas,  such

as  those violent, phantasmic, nonsensical and obscene

films.  All  these undesirable films are having  their

way in Singapore and are causing an adverse effect  on

our   people,  particularly  the  youths.   They   are

detrimental to the welfare of our youths. We know that

our youths are still in their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>



formative  years and are susceptible to all  sorts  of

bad  influences. These undesirable films will lead our

youths  astray and degenerate. This is very dangerous.

For   example, those  nonsensical,  obscene  or   sex

pictures will influence the youths to tease or  molest

women  and  girls even in public. Other films  are  so

phantasmic   and  monstrous  that  will   kindle   the

superstitions of the audience. Some action  films  are

very  violent and bloody in certain scenes. All  these

will leave an indelible influence and will cause a lot

of harm to our people, particularly our youths.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there has been a continued manifestation

of  such bad trends in our society. We can find  from

the  statistics of the Health Ministry that there  are

youths  both  boys and girls under 14 years  who  have

contracted  VD and the number of juvenile  delinquency

cases  is  increasing  year  by  year.  We  have   the

responsibility  to provide a healthy  environment  for

our  people  to  live and grow in.  Ours  is  a  young

country. About 60% of our population is under 21 years

old.  They are our priceless asset. Whether they  grow

up  healthily or degenerate into a decadent generation

will  affect the future of our country. Therefore,  we

should  not  neglect this aspect of  our  affairs.  We

should consider this matter seriously and impose a ban

on all such undesirable films. I hope the Minister for

Culture  and  his  officials will  persuade  the  film

distributors  and  agents to buy  only  those  healthy

films  with  educational significance  for  screening,

otherwise  they  would  not be approved  by  the  Film

Censorship  Board. Since cinema films  enjoy  a  large

audience,  business  must be very lucrative,  and  the

film  distributors and agents can buy and  show  those

good films and still make a profit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is: in the past one year how

many  films were banned from public screening and what

categories  did they belong to? What were the  reasons

for banning such films?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I have listened with great

admiration and interest to the Member for Sembawang on

his views



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>



regarding film censorship. However, I thought it would

be  fair  for me to stand up and perhaps moderate  his

enthusiasm to censor films to the extent that  he  has

advocated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that films that blatantly advocate sex,

violence, crimes, political or racial overtones should

be  banned  without hesitation. What I am saying  here

is,  in  effect, that if censorship is to be exercised

it   should  be  exercised  cleverly.  If   the   Film

Censorship  Board  decides to cut parts  away  from  a

film,  this should not be overdone to the extent  that

the  film loses its artistic content completely,  that

it  is disjointed and the language becomes incoherent.

If  such  deletions  of a film are  necessary,  a  ban

should be imposed totally, and not reducing a two-hour

film  to  just one hour. I think the public deserve  a

better treatment. The public should not be cheated  by

the distributors.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to add here,

however,  that the Film Censorship Board must  realise

that different films cater to different sectors of the

population. Therefore, in a sense, films that  may  be

acceptable  to  one sector may not  be  acceptable  to

another.  I know that arising from this argument  that

there   could  be  conflicting  interest   and   hence

difficulty in terms of allowing certain films through.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note with great interest that recently a

certain film called "One flew over the cuckoo's  nest"

was  allowed. I think this film was allowed  after  an

appeal and a certain amount of publicity was given  in

the  press.  I  personally would like to  applaud  the

Ministry  of  Culture for allowing this film  to  come

through  because there are many factors which one  has

to  consider in exercising the axe. I wish to ask  the

Minister that with the passing of that film,  does  it

therefore indicate that the Film Censorship  Board  is

now  undergoing  a  period of  liberalisation  of  its

attitude or approach towards film censorship,  or  was

the film allowed purely because of press agitation?  I

must  confess  that since that film was allowed  there

were  many  other  interesting films which  have  been

shown in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>



cinemas  and, in fact, over Television Singapore.  The

public  has  responded very favourably. I  notice  the

language   is   free   and   simple   with   lots   of

monosyllables, words which we commonly use  and  hear.

And  the bare facts of life made barer and the  beauty

of  body and flesh given display in its full glory. In

a sense, it is a refreshing change.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come back to the point regarding the different

sectors  that  films cater. Would it not be  possible,

therefore,  for  the Ministry of Culture  to  consider

classification of films? If the Film Censorship  Board

feels  that a certain sector of the population  should

not   see   these   movies  they  can  be   classified

accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a final comment, I would like the Minister to

enlighten  this House as to the banning of  a  certain

film about the episode at Entebbe Airport, a film that

I  thought  depicted  victory of resolve  over  bully,

discipline over madness.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is not

easy  to  please everyone. The Member for Kim Seng  is

happy to see some relaxation in censorship but, on the

other hand, the Member for Sembawang deplores this and

is  sad  to  see such relaxation. Films  is  always  a

popular  topic for debate and it is perhaps  the  most

popular entertainment for Singaporeans and it is  also

a profitable commodity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Film producers will produce films that can draw

crowds, and  after some time when a certain  type  of

film  has  lost  its  attraction,  they  will  produce

something else. So you have films on the supernatural,

ghosts,  vampires,  and  so on.  But  such  films  are

generally  unrealistic  and they  provide  a  kind  of

escape  for the ordinary people and nobody  will  take

them  seriously.  To prohibit the exhibition  of  such

films  would be an exaggeration of their influence  on

the  cinema goers. We have had our days when  we  were

young.  We  all grew up in the days when  these  films

were  popular, but it does not mean that  we  are  all

ghost-fearing  or  vampire-fearing people.  It  really

does  not  affect us at all. Even then all  the  films

portraying the supernatural and those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>



depicting  sex are carefully scrutinised before  they

are allowed public exhibition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the Government does not import or

produce  films,  we are not in a position  to  select

films  for  the people. I think it is also unwise  to

tell  the exhibitors that they should show or  import

only  a  certain  type of film. On the  contrary,  we

should encourage the cinemas to show as many types of

films  as  possible so that the people have a  better

choice of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards young people indulging in sex, I do not

think  it  is  because  of films.  Sex  comes  to  us

naturally. I do not think it is because of films that

cause  these  people to indulge in sexual activities.

The Member for Sembawang wants to know the number  of

films  banned  last year. The number of films  banned

last  year  is  73.  Forty of them  glorified  crime.

violence, gangsterism or drug addiction; 23 were  sex

exploitative or morally objectionable; 9 were  banned

for  political reasons; and one on religious grounds.

It  is  not  correct to say that we are relaxing  our

criteria  on film censorship. It has always been  our

policy  to  see that films shown in our  cinemas  are

decent, healthy and of good taste. But the judging of

a  film differs very widely from person to person and

also  from time to time. It is very difficult to  lay

down  in  detail  whether a  particular  scene  or  a

particular  word should or should not be allowed  and

therefore   we  have  this  kind  of  difference   in

treatment. Very often, a film has to be judged in its

entirety  before a decision is made as to  whether  a

particular  scene  should be  cut.  No,  we  are  not

relaxing  our  censorship on films. Perhaps  you  can

describe what you are seeing as a more sensible or  a

more  enlightening approach in film  censorship.  But

when  a film is cut, care is always taken to see that

cuts are not noticeable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the classification of films, we have

considered this matter. If I remember correctly, when

the  Member for Katong came to this House he was  the

first  to raise this matter. We have considered  this

and our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>



feeling  is that it is not a very good idea  to  have

film    classification.   If   we   do   have    film

classification then there should be a  lot  of  films

which are of artistic value but which cannot be shown

to  the  younger population. But unfortunately  there

are  not so many of this kind of films. Most  of  the

films that are supposed to be rated X are actually on

sex   exploitation.   It  is  more   an   erotic   or

pornographic film than an ordinary film  made  in  an

artistic  way.  So there is really  no  advantage  in

having  film classification in Singapore  because  we

would  then have a lot of films coming into Singapore

which  are of no value at all. If the Member for  Kim

Seng  has been overseas - I am sure he has - he would

know that in most of the cinemas in Europe or the USA

where  X  films  are  shown, in many  instances,  the

cinemas are practically empty. So you can see that if

we do have classification in Singapore, after a while

I  am  sure our cinemas will also be empty after  the

people  get  tired of them. This would  really  be  a

waste of the facilities. It would be a better idea to

let  them  show decent films and films which  are  of

good  taste so that everyone, not only the grown-ups,

can enjoy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of the film which was banned it is

entitled "The Raid on Entebbe Airport". It was banned

on  political  grounds. Because of the representation

made  by  certain  embassies in  Singapore  and  also

because of other considerations, we have decided that

it should be banned.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I just

want  to clarify or rebut one point. This concerns  X

films  which  the Hon. Minister said  that  shown  in

European  countries  or in America  the  cinemas  are

virtually  empty. I think that is exactly  the  point

that is perhaps worth noting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human curiosity is such a powerful element that

if  you  should  prohibit people from seeing  certain

things or certain features or certain films, then the

desire, the wish, the wanting, to see that particular

film is even greater. Likewise, the human anatomy. It

so  happened  that  thousands of years  ago  somebody

decided  that certain parts of the human body  should

be hidden, and since



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>



then  history  records man's curiosity  to  see  those

parts  in  their full glory. May I suggest, therefore,

that  if history were to be re-written and I had  some

part to play in this, I would say. "Hide the big toe".

And I tell you every human being today would be crying

and wanting to see the big toe in its full nakedness!



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Is the Member for Kim Seng

suggesting that we should open up some kind of  nudist

colony  in  Singapore  so that more  tourists  can  be

attracted to Singapore? I do not think that  in  order

to satisfy the curiosity of the people we should allow

this kind of film because knowing the end result would

be  empty cinemas, why do we have to do this? Why  not

put  them to better use? Why waste the equipment?  Why

waste the time of other people?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I just want to record that I

feel  very sorry that the Minister has missed my point

altogether.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, although the

reply  from  the Minister is not very satisfactory.  I

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (a) of subhead AAA 3020* (*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr J. F. Conceicao).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been told by the Minister that the

cultural  policy  of the Minister is  to  improve  its

present  range  of  cultural activities  to  meet  the

growing demand for more sophisticated programmes. This

means that we need to have more money, but the fact is

that  the  contribution to cultural organisations  has

been  drastically  reduced. In  the  Addendum  to  the

Presidential Address at the opening of this Session of

the  Fourth  Parliament, the Minister for Culture  has

stated, and I quote [Hansard, Vol 36, cols 42 - 3]:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Apart from sponsoring competitions, exhibitions and

performances, the Ministry will provide financial  and

other   forms  of  assistance  to  deserving   amateur

cultural groups.'



<br><br>Sir,  in the light of his remarks I would like to  ask

the Minister the following questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, why is there a reduction from $186,500 for FY

76  to  only $10,000 for FY 77? Second, what  are  the

criteria  for  contributing  financially  to  cultural

organisations? Third, how many cultural  organisations

have  received this contribution? Fourth, how can  the

Ministry  help promote and improve cultural activities

with  much  less  money as budgetted  here?  Sir,  the

budget  here  is not in line with the  policy  of  the

Ministry of Culture as spelt out in the Addendum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would

like to inform the hon. Member for Delta that the  sum

earmarked  for  contribution to cultural organisations

has   always  been  $10,000.  Although  the  provision

appears to be higher in some years the additional fund

was   actually  meant  for  renovation  work  to   our

theatres.  For  example, in  FY  76  out  of  $186,500

provided  in  the  subhead,  $176,500  was  used   for

rewiring  and installation of fire fighting  equipment

at  the  National Theatre. The balance of $10,000  was

used  for  contributions  to  cultural  organisations.

There is no reduction in the provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three criteria are used for approving grants. The

organisations applying for the grant should be active.

The   project   should  have  some   merit   and   the

organisation is in need of financial support. In  1976

grants were given to the National Junior College Drama

Society,  the  National Theatre Club, the Experimental

Theatre  Club, the Nanyang Academy of Fine  Arts,  the

Alumni  Association,  Sri  Warna, the  National  Book

Development  Council and the Stage Club. The  National

Theatre   Club  was  given  a  grant  of  $5,000   for

organising  a  wide  range of  activities.  Grants  of

between $500 and $1,000 were made to the other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>



organisations to assist them in carrying  out  various

cultural  activities, including the staging  of  plays

and   cultural   shows,  organising  a   workshop   on

bibliographical  standards and an art exhibition.  The

Member   would  appreciate  that  cultural   promotion

requires the support not only from the Government  but

also  from members of the public, civic and commercial

organisations. The small grants given by  my  Ministry

are  a  token  expression of Government's support  for

healthy cultural activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that the Ministry of Science and

Technology has got to do a lot of research work before

any  recommendations are implemented in the  field  of

science  and  technology  in  the  interest   of   our

Republic. I believe that through the efforts  of  this

Ministry  some  studies have been done on  alternative

sources  of energy, like solar energy and the  monsoon

winds,  which  could in a way be useful to  Singapore.

May I know what are the findings?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides this, may I also know what are the other

major  scientific  and technological  experiments  and

studies that have been and are being carried out,  and

what  recommendations have been made so  far  by  this

Ministry to the various authorities concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are local personnel given ample opportunities to be

trained in research work in foreign countries  in  the

field of science and technology, so that we can fulfil

our desire of being the brain centre of this region?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Department of Scientific Services is, by

name an important one and it is managed by a staff  of

144  persons.  Under the Medicines  Act,  one  of  the

functions   of   this   department   is   to   provide

microbiological testing of pharmaceutical products for

the  Ministry of Health as well as the private sector.

It would appear that this department caters mainly for

the Health Ministry. What about its functions to other

Ministries?  I feel that this Department  should  also

extend its services to the other Ministries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as part

of its efforts to promote scientific and technological

development,   the   Ministry   encourages    research

activities by local researchers both in Government and

in  the  tertiary institutions through  the  award  of

research  grants. Such grants are awarded for research

on  selected topics which are beneficial and  relevant

to  our  needs.  Besides studies  on  energy  sources,

research   grants  have  been  provided  for  research

projects  in other fields such as engineering studies,

pollution   control,  applied  chemistry,   biological

studies and on technological



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>



development  of specific industries. The  findings  of

the   researches  are  made  available   to   relevant

Ministries   or   departments   for   their   use   as

appropriate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such research project undertaken by the

Mechanical Engineering Department of the University of

Singapore  is  the  possible use  of  solar  and  wind

energy. Preliminary results indicate that it would  be

technically  and economically feasible  to  use  solar

energy  for  the production of hot water for  domestic

purposes.  Utilisation  of  solar  energy   for   air-conditioning  and  refrigeration,  though  technically

feasible,   will   not   be  an  economically   viable

proposition.  Similarly, in the case of the  study  of

wind  energy, it was found that it may be possible  to

utilise  wind energy for the production of electricity

on  a  small scale to power light beacons but the wind

force  was not strong enough for any large scale power

generation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The training of local personnel in foreign countries

is  in  general  coordinated  by  the  Public  Service

Commission. The Ministry is directly concerned only in

training  of  manpower in the use and  application  of

nuclear energy and ample opportunities are provided to

train suitable local personnel in this area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Department of Scientific Services, it

provides  a wide range of scientific back-up  services

to  several Government Ministries and departments  and

not  just  to  the Health Ministry. For  instance,  it

examines  food  samples  and  water  samples  for  the

Ministry of the Environment, urine specimens  for  the

Central  Narcotics  Bureau,  the  hospitals  and   the

Police, exhibits connected with crime for the  Police

and   liquor  for  the  Customs  Department.  It  also

provides  document examination services and  radiation

protection services for several Government departments

as well as firms in the private sector. The department

has   been   providing  services  in  the   field   of

pharmaceutical  products  for  the  Ministry  of   the

Environment, the Ministry of Defence and the  Ministry

of  Health.  This  is  now being further  extended  to

pharmaceutical firms in the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Minister for Social Affairs one of his main

duties  is to look after social welfare work.  Briefly

he  has  the  duty initially to help those unfortunate

people in our society. Therefore, to be a Minister for

Social Affairs, the first condition is not whether one

can  do  it or capable or not capable but whether  one

has  sympathy. Sir, after these few years I have  come

to  this  conclusion.  I feel that  the  Minister  for

Social  Affairs is one without sympathy.  To  be  more

frank,  I feel that he is a bit like what the  Chinese

saying  says,  "One  with  a  stony  heart."  To  many

unfortunate  events in the society he has always  been

lethargic.  If  we read the newspapers we  can  always

find  that  there  are reports of  frequent  tragedies

taking  place  in  our  society.  Just  as  the  Prime

Minister  has  said, if you do not  read  the  Chinese

newspapers, you do not understand what is happening in

our   society.   We   have  frequently   come   across

unfortunate  incidents  happening  suddenly  to   some

families, the breadwinner of a family suddenly meeting

with some tragedy, being killed at worksite or due  to

some  other events, so that members of the family  are

left alone, high and dry. Overnight, the old and young

are  left  helpless, with their livelihood going  from

bad  to  worse.  So;  has  the  Government  taken  any

immediate practical steps to help such people? No,  to

be  frank.  Not only this, the HDB has also threatened

to evict them because of arrears in rental and the PUB

has  also  threatened  to  take  action  against  them

because of arrears in payment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>



of  PUB supplies. Recently, there was an unprecedented

tragedy  of  a family, a widow and her daughter.  They

burnt  themselves to death in an HDB flat  because  of

difficulty  in  looking for any means  of  livelihood.

Does the Minister know about this?



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very often local newspapers, particularly the

Chinese  newspapers, have been  taking  the  lead  in

organising relief to help such people. This is done as

part of their social duty to render good services. All

along, the  response from members of the  public  has

been spontaneous. Many people have donated generously,

many anonymously. Only our Social Affairs Ministry  is

apathetic  to such social tragedies. Normally,  it  is

the  Government that should take the lead. But it  now

appears  that the Ministry of Social Affairs seems  to

be  taking the attitude that such tragedies are merely

some  isolated  family tragedies and  it  is  not  the

business of the Ministry. I think it is the Ministry's

duty. The officers concerned also should not just work

to  rule  and  be  contented with merely  engaging  in

investigation  and doling out some  little  amount  of

money  to such victims, and that is all. There  should

be  a  contingency `und to meet such a  situation.  If

such  a tragedy happens, the Ministry concerned should

immediately take action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been talking about the traditional good

virtues of Eastern people. Let me point out one  which

is  to look after the orphans and widows and to render

them assistance. This is the usual expectation on  the

Government by Oriental people. Why is the TV programme

Pao  Ching Tien, that is Justice Pao, so very popular?

It  is  because we Orientals all look up to him to  be

not  only  just, but also humane and with warmth.  Our

Minister  for Social Affairs obviously cannot  measure

up  to  the  stature of Justice Pao but  at  least  he

should  take the lead in this matter. The Ministry  of

Social  Affairs should initiate relief action in  such

cases at least negotiate with the HDB or the PUB to be

more  flexible in dealing with such unfortunate people

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>



should not leave it to the Members of Parliament alone

to take up this responsibility.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, I  do not quite agree  with  what  the

Member  for  Boon Lay has said - that our Minister  is

"one  with  a  stony  heart". On the  other  hand,  he

appears to be a very kind person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of the Social Welfare Department is to be

in  charge  of  social welfare and to  render  welfare

services  to needy people. All along it has  done  its

work  quite well and I have no adverse comment to make

against it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch upon the social welfare of the

aged. This matter is receiving popular attention  now.

I would like to draw the attention of the Minister for

Social  Affairs to my views on this. On the matter  of

providing welfare care for the aged, I know  that  the

department concerned has been encouraging civic mutual

aid  organisations to set up small scale homes for the

aged  to accommodate destitute old people. This  is  a

good  move. I feel that these civic organisations  are

very willing to take up part of the responsibility  in

looking  after the old and the destitute. But  I  feel

that  many  civic  organisations are  not  quite  able

financially  to  take up the entire  burden  for  this

task.  In order to carry out their work, there is  the

need  for  substantial amounts of  money  to  buy  the

necessary equipment and the facilities required.  Also

there is the need for a constant source of finance  to

meet recurrent expenditure. So I would like to ask the

Minister  whether  he  will consider  allocating  some

funds   as   allowance  to  assist  those   mutual-aid

organisations which run homes for the aged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in order to assist the livelihood of the

aged, will   the  Minister  consider   raising   the

retirement age? At present it is at 55 years. Although

some  people  have  reached 55 they  are  still  quite

healthy physically; because of the changing times.  In

the  past, people who lived up to 70 years  old  were

rare. Nowadays the situation is different.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>



There  are  many people who have reached 70 years  and

are   still  healthy.  So  we  should  reconsider  the

retiring age. Maybe the Minister says that it  is  not

under his portfolio but a matter for the Minister  for

Finance  to  decide.  But I say  he  could  start  of!

something  in  this  respect in  his  department.  The

Minister  can  take the lead in doing something  about

his department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the question of the aged has aroused the

interest of the public. In order to enable those  aged

people  who  have  contributed to our  society  to  be

treated and looked after better. I would like  to  ask

whether  the Ministry concerned will start a  campaign

to  respect and love the old people and to  teach  and

instil  a  sense  of respect for the  aged  among  our

younger generation.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think

the previous Members have spoken regarding allowances.

I  am  going to speak on sports. I spoke about it last

year  and  I  am going to speak on sports  again  this

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all agreed that the objective of sports

promotion  in  Singapore is the mass participation  of

our  people  in  sports. This is more  important  than

producing champions. But then we must at the same time

try  our best to improve the standard of our sportsmen

and   sportswomen.  This  is  evidently  seen  in  the

selection of the Sportsman and Sportswoman of the Year

as  it appears that there is no keen competition  from

the  various sports associations for this annual grand

title  during  the last few years. However,  I  wonder

what  encouragement and incentives are  given  by  the

various sports associations and Government leaders  to

our  stars  who  represent our State for international

meets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that in most cases, very little

encouragement  and  incentives  are  provided  by  the

sports  associations  for  our  players.  Many   State

players  from  the  various sports  associations  have

mentioned that in some instances the officials of  the

associations  do  not give proper guidance  and  moral

support  which  they  are  supposed  to  give  to  the

players. I believe the main problem is finance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>



Besides the Football Association of Singapore which is

now  more or less financially stable, the other sports

associations need adequate financial backing.  Perhaps

sponsorship  by  various firms could  be  a  solution.

Potential  players who represent the State  should  be

given  incentives  like time-off for  more  meaningful

centralised    training,   sports    aids,    monetary

incentives, participating in more international  meets

and even more newspaper publicity for encouragement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the present Chairman of the Singapore Sports

Council  and since he took over the administration  of

the SSC he has got a proper control of the Council. He

himself makes it a point to check and attends  to  all

matters pertaining to sports. This is remarkable.  But

then  the  SSC  has got no control on  the  individual

sports   associations  which  are  supposed  to   give

encouragement to their members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister himself is a keen supporter of sports.

Sir,  you can see him attending many sports functions.

He  is at the National Stadium to support our national

soccer  team  whenever the team is in action.  He  too

should  be praised for the interest shown. However,  I

hope  that he would use his good offices to  see  that

the players are properly treated and that the standard

of the game is improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Stadium is no longer a "white

elephant" as it once was. We now regularly hear of the

"Kallang Roar" of the soccer fans. Perhaps it  is  the

roar  of  the capacity crowds which may have  produced

the  cracks in the structure of the Stadium. May I ask

what  is being done to minimise the danger that  these

cracks present? There is a craze by most Singaporeans,

both  male and female, to support our national  soccer

team  in  action at the National Stadium.  The  paying

crowd  numbering thousands come out in full  force  to

cheer our national team. This is indeed remarkable and

because of our local support, our players' performance

too is glorifying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is a need to discipline some of our

local fans. In the recent World



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>



Cup  series, the fans played their part very  well  in

cheering the teams.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police has now formed a permanent unit of

hundreds  of National Servicemen under the  charge  of

the Reserve Unit to control the crowd. But then during

some  of the matches of the Malaysia Cup series,  even

the police had some problems in controlling the crowd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were occasions when some mischief makers threw

missiles  onto  the pitch, onto the  players  and  the

referee. This I think should be definitely stopped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheering and booing is a common thing in sports

which is acceptable. But the throwing of missiles onto

the  field is a very dangerous act and is not  healthy

in  the light of sports promotion, though the fans may

show their colours here. But what would be the fate of

our innocent players when they go for return games?  A

typical example is the match against Pahang last  year

which  should  be a lesson to our local fans,  I  also

note  that  some  of our mischievous  fans  boo,  pass

uncalled  remarks  and spit at some  of  the  visiting

players when they are leaving the stadium. This is, in

fact,  not healthy. I therefore suggest some  sort  of

strict measures be introduced like banning some of the

offenders from entering the stadium for sometime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the grounds outside the National Stadium still

seem  unsafe despite my pointing this out a few  years

ago. Too many accidents have occurred, particularly at

night when thousands of people rush out of the stadium

after  a match and some have to cut across the grounds

and open drains. And if accidents should occur at that

time,  there  is  the problem of getting  medical  aid

immediately  because of the heavy traffic leaving  the

stadium.  Something must be done to cover up the  many

open drains which are around the stadium.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that 30 squash courts, 70 tennis

courts but only three football pitches are provided in

the  master  plan. I wonder why there are  only  three

football pitches. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>



squash  and tennis courts will cater for the  affluent

members  of  our  population.  Since  we  are  placing

emphasis on mass participation, what we need  is  more

football  pitches  because a football  pitch  if  used

properly will serve more people and it helps to  solve

part  of our social problems particularly amongst  the

young.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Farrer Park football pitches are being well

utilised  every  day so much so that  when  the  newly

erected  lights  at  the  nearby  tennis  courts   are

switched  on some people take advantage of the  bright

lights  to play football at night. Why should  we  not

light  up the football fields too? I am sure it  would

benefit  many office workers to play soccer at  night.

Perhaps  we may succeed not only in letting our  young

citizens  spend their energy wisely but  also  produce

future soccer stars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, badminton seems to be dying a natural death.

What  is really going on? Why is there such a lack  of

interest  in badminton? Our standard of badminton  was

very high at the time when it was a very popular game.

more  popular than soccer, but it has gone  down  very

badly,  particularly  after the  Thomas  Cup  went  to

Indonesia. Something must be done to revive this  game

and other games too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opening of the Fitness Park is a good move. This

Ministry could liaise with the Ministry of Culture  to

introduce a daily fitness programme over TV to serve a

greater  part  of  the  population  who,  for  various

reasons, may not be able to go to the fitness park.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Minister for Social Affairs is also

responsible  for  religious  matters,  I   take   this

opportunity to ask him about the alternative  site  at

Toa Payoh for the building of a Hindu temple which  is

at  present  sited in Somerset Road. This  alternative

site  about  5,000 sq. ft. seems to be too  small.  It

seems that it can accommodate only a chicken coop, and

moreover  it  is  next  to a big  monsoon  drain.  The

locality  is very bad for a Hindu temple. As such  the

site  was  not  accepted and the matter  is  still  in

abeyance for quite some time.
