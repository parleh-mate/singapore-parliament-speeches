<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>OPENING OF PARLIAMENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Delay)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock</b> asked the Prime Minister why was

the Opening of Parliament delayed for more than four months.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there has not been any

undue  delay in the Opening of the New Parliament.  The  time

between the General Elections and the Opening of Parliament



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



in  the previous and the present instances was similar, being

144  days and 142 days respectively, or just about 20  weeks.

In  the  earlier two general elections in 1988 and 1991,  the

interval was slightly shorter, about 18 weeks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a reasonable period of time between the General

Elections and the Opening of Parliament is necessary to  take

stock of the tumultuous global and domestic developments, and

to  prepare  policy positions and plans for our new  term  of

office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before the Opening of Parliament on 25th March, the

Prime  Minister, the Ministers, the PAP Members of Parliament

reached out directly to our community leaders and the  public

to  discuss  the actions against the terrorists in Singapore,

the  new  terrorist threats that we faced, communal  and  the

tudung  issues, as well as economic challenges we face.   The

Government  also  very  quickly set up  the  Economic  Review

Committee  to review our economic policies to revitalise  the

economy,  and  remake Singapore.  So the Government  has  not

been  tardy since the General Elections.  In other words,  we

have not been sitting on our hands.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I

ask  the  Minister  whether we could convene  Parliament  one

month after the General Elections, so that Parliament can  be

operationally  ready  in case there  are  urgent  matters  to

discuss?   I  am sure Members of this House are  fully  aware

that  many  issues happened after the General Elections,  and

this  House  has  got  no opportunity to  discuss  all  these

issues.   Therefore, I would request that  following  General

Elections in future, at least a month, we should all be sworn

in and this House will be ready to tackle urgencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question, Sir, is whether this is going to be

the trend.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I do not think we can predict what

would  be the trend in the future because nobody can tell  us

what is going to happen in the future.  While we can set some

rules, I do not think we should be so rigid as to say that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



we  should  meet  immediately one  month  after  the  General

Elections  (GE).  There could be many reasons why  we  cannot

meet  immediately.   But  if there are  important  or  urgent

reasons  that we have to meet immediately after the GE,  then

there  is  no doubt that the Government will seize  upon  the

opportunity  to do so.  But, here, we cannot commit  that  in

future  we will have a sitting one month after the GE.   Much

depends  on  the  circumstances.  I think  the  less  we  tie

ourselves  down with rules, the better it is.  We  should  do

what is necessary, what is useful, and what is important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, immediately after the GE, there are many issues

to  be  settled.  Many of the programmes that the  Government

put up before the GE are ideas that we should pursue, and  we

need  time to thrash them out; we need time to think  through

the  major issues, and in this instance, for example, the key

challenges we face today are economic restructuring  and  the

new  threat  of  the terrorists.  So these are  the  two  key

challenges  and therefore these are not issues  that  we  can

immediately come back to Parliament after the GE and  settle.

We  cannot solve the problems even after the Budget.  It will

take  some time for issues to be studied and to come out with

programmes to resolve some of them.  We cannot resolve all of

them even in the Budget in May.

<div align="center"><b>LAND RECLAMATION OFF PULAU TEKONG</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Impact on Malaysia)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</b> asked the Minister for

National Development what is the situation regarding the land

reclamation off Pulau Tekong and its possible impact  on  the

Malaysians.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there have been many reports in the

Malaysian media alleging that our land reclamation works  off

Pulau  Tekong and Tuas will impact Malaysia in various  ways.

We are surprised by these recent allegations since



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



our  land  reclamation policy is not new.  Given  Singapore's

small  size, it has been our long-standing policy to  reclaim

land from our territorial waters so as to meet the demands on

land use.  I will address these allegations in my response.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is concern that our works may encroach into

their  territorial  waters,  or somehow  shift  the  boundary

between  Singapore  and Malaysia.  We have  stated  that  the

reclamation works are carried out entirely within our  waters

and  that  there  is no encroachment.  The reclamation  works

also  cannot  change the territorial boundary  in  the  Johor

Straits.   This  boundary was defined by  fixed  geographical

coordinates  since 1995 in an Agreement that was  signed  and

ratified by Singapore and Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern raised is that the reclamation works at

Pulau  Tekong  will affect the shipping lane to Pasir  Gudang

Port  by  making  the shipping lane narrower  and  shallower.

Sir,  this  is not the case.  The existing shipping  lane  to

Pasir  Gudang  Port  lies in the deep water  channel  between

mainland  Singapore and the islands of Pulau Ubin  and  Pulau

Tekong.   Ships going to our Sembawang Wharves also use  this

shipping lane.  The current reclamation works at Pulau Tekong

will  not  reduce or otherwise affect the existing  width  of

this  shipping lane.  The shipping lane is not made shallower

by  the reclamation works.  The Maritime Port Authority (MPA)

regularly  monitors the siltation levels within the  shipping

lane  to  ensure  that the channel remains  deep  enough  for

navigation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Tuas, our reclamation works are about 7

km  away  from the shipping lane to Tanjung Pelepas Port,  so

there  is  no  possibility that our reclamation would  affect

access to Tanjung Pelepas Port.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to address allegations that the

reclamation  works at Pulau Tekong will increase the  current

flow in the Johor Straits, cause flooding in Johor and affect

the  fishermen's  catches.  Hydraulic modelling  studies  are

done for our reclamation works to assess the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



impact  of  reclamation on currents, tidal  flows  and  water

quality.   They  indicate that the reclamation  at  Tuas  and

Pulau  Tekong  will  not  have  an  adverse  impact  on   the

surrounding waters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, water quality in the Johor Straits has also

been jointly monitored on a regular basis by our Ministry  of

the  Environment  and Johor's Department of  the  Environment

(DOE) since 1991.  The results show that the water quality in

the   Johor   Straits  has  remained  unchanged  even   after

reclamation works have started.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has acted within its rights and

obligations  under  international law  in  carrying  out  the

reclamation  works.  During his visit to  Malaysia  in  March

this  year, DPM Lee had indicated that if the Malaysians  had

concerns  about  the effects of the reclamation,  they  could

send  us  a  note  and we would consider it.   The  Singapore

Government is still waiting for a note from the Malaysians to

understand their concerns more fully.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, notwithstanding the

legality  of Singapore's reclamation works, there appears  to

be  a  perception across the Causeway that we ought  to  have

consulted before we undertook these works.  May I ask whether

there  is any basis for such a request or expectation in  law

and  also  whether this observation of Rule No.  1  has  been

bilateral.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, to answer Mr Iswaran's question,

let me first explain to the House why we reclaim land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a small country. We are about 680 sq km.

We  need  land.  When Habibie said that we are a  little  red

dot,  he  was not too far off the mark.  If you look  at  the

map,  you  will  see Singapore in relation  to  Malaysia  and

Indonesia.  Malaysia is about 330,000 sq km.  So we are  less

than 1%, about 0.2%, the size of Malaysia.  Our population is

growing.   Our need for land for schools, factories,  housing

is  growing.  That is the reason why we have to reclaim land.

Without  reclamation,  we would not have  Marine  Parade,  we

would  not  have East Coast Parkway, we would  not  have  the

airport.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



Without  reclamation,  we would not have  Jurong  Island,  we

would not have space for industries.  Without reclamation, we

would  not have Marina South to expand our CBD.  So  that  is

the  reason why we have to reclaim land.  We are  not  a  big

country like Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, our reclamation is not a secret. We do not do

reclamation quietly and sneak it through and suddenly we have

the  barges going to Pulau Tekong to reclaim land.  Our plans

are approved in Parliament, in this House.  They are reviewed

in  all our concept plans.  In fact, the reclamation of Pulau

Tekong  was reviewed in the 1991 Concept Plan, 11 years  ago.

The concept plans are revised every 10 years, and in the 2001

Concept  Plan  which we released last year,  the  reclamation

plans  are  still there.  Any member of the  public  can  get

access to these plans.  If you are not in Singapore, you  can

just  click on to www.ura.gov.sg and you can see these plans.

So  these are not secret plans, neither are they carried  out

surreptitiously or just on the spur of the moment.  As I said

earlier,  we  have looked at reclamation and we have  carried

out reclamation since the 1960s.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarise, we are a small country, we need land. We

have  been reclaiming land for a very, very long time.   Even

then,  after all the reclamations for the last 40  years  and

all  the  reclamations that we are going to carry out  within

our  territorial  waters, we will still be a  small  country,

still smaller than Malaysia.  So it is rather surprising that

these  allegations come out at this particular point in time,

that  we  are thwarting their port development, that  we  are

affecting their waters, or affecting them in many other ways.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stated earlier, our reclamation works are done

within our waters, in accordance with international law.   We

do  not  encroach on Malaysian territory.  They do not affect

navigation  in  the Johor Straits.  They do  not  narrow  the

channel.   They  do  not  affect  the  water  quality.    The

reclamation works that we do are a result of our own need for

land.  So I do not see why we have to consult Malaysia  on  a

matter of sovereign concern.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago, Malaysia was thinking about reclaiming

some  land off Johor, in the Straits.  This was not too  long

ago,  and  the planned reclamation was very extensive.   They

did  not see the need to consult us, neither did we make  any

noise about it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So given this, the fact that we need to reclaim, given

the  fact  that  we  have made studies  to  ensure  that  the

reclamation works do not have an impact, is it necessary  for

us  to consult?  Is it unreasonable for Singapore to want  to

continue  to  reclaim  land to the maximum  extent  possible,

within our territorial waters?

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, may I ask

the  Minister, besides the studies done, what other  measures

have  been  taken  by the Ministry to minimise  any  possible

environmental  impact  on both Malaysia  and  Singapore?   Is

there  any  pollution screen being erected,  or  whatever  is

being taken?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> When the reclamation works are being

done,  first  of  all,  the reclamation  barges  have  to  be

properly managed, properly steered, and so on.  As far as the

actual  works are concerned, there is a requirement  for  the

reclamation  works  to be carried out  in  such  a  way  that

pollution and siltation are kept to a minimum.  For  example,

the  contractors  are  required  to  make  use  of  siltation

screens.  These siltation screens are meant to block the silt

from actually moving out of the area of reclamation.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong):</b> I would like to ask the

Minister how binding is this 1995 agreement between  the  two

countries, and could any one party alter it unilaterally,  or

interpret it differently.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I think I should defer to my colleague,

the  Minister  for Foreign Affairs, to answer this  question.

But as far as I know,  it is an agreement that was signed  by

the  Minister  for  Foreign Affairs  for  Singapore  and  the

Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs  for  Malaysia.   It  is   an

agreement that was ratified by both countries.  It cannot  be

unilaterally altered by either party.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> I would like to ask

the Minister, therefore, is there a basis for the Malaysians'

expectations of us to stop work.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> We have carried out these works within

our  territorial  waters.  We have taken  all  the  necessary

steps to examine whether there would be any adverse impact on

the  surrounding  waters.  The reclamation profile  has  been

properly  calibrated  to make sure that  the  impact  on  the

environment is minimised, if not, completely eliminated.   So

as  far  as  we are concerned, we have carried out all  these

works  in  accordance with our international obligations  and

within international laws.  There is really no need for us to

stop work at this point in time.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Singapore's position

is  that it has no impact on shipping lanes, no effect on the

environmental situation in the Straits.  But given Malaysia's

position that it has an impact and that it has indicated that

it  will  send a note, looking forward, how do you  see  this

being  resolved,  or  would it be yet another  issue  in  our

tangle of problems?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, as DPM Lee has asked the

Malaysians to send us a note, I think it is important for  us

to  wait  until we receive such a note in order to understand

more  clearly what exactly are their concerns.  Because right

now,  from  what  we  read in the media, there  are  so  many

different   allegations  and  some   of   these   allegations

contradict one another.  So I think it is best for us to just

calmly wait for the note to come.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister  when we built the Second Link, although  it  was  a

joint project, we did quite substantial reclamation also  for

the  purposes  of the Second Link.  Did the Malaysians  raise

any objections then?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> No, they did not.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister  whether,  under the 1995 agreement,  or  under  any

international law, is Singapore obliged to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



notify Malaysia, or consult Malaysia, when we want to do  any

reclamation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, as I explained, the reclamation

works are within our territorial waters and we have satisfied

our international obligations.  I do not see that there is  a

need for us to consult.

<div align="center"><b>PATIENTS IN ACUTE HOSPITALS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Fees for overstaying)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Health how many

patients,  who have overstayed in acute hospitals, have  been

charged  with  higher fees since the policy  was  implemented

from March 2002.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan (Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Health (Dr Balaji Sadasivan) (for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon.

Member  for Jalan Besar GRC, Dr Lily Neo, has asked how  many

patients  who  have overstayed in acute hospitals  have  been

charged  with higher fees.  It is a policy that the  Ministry

of Health introduced in March 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to-date, only one patient has been

charged full cost for four days of overstay in Class B2  ward

of  Singapore  General  Hospital  (SGH).   Despite  financial

counselling  given  to  the patient,  she  chose  not  to  be

discharged home after she was certified medically  fit.   The

reason  she  gave  was that she did not want  the  hassle  of

returning  to  SGH  for  her  daily  outpatient  radiotherapy

treatment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take this opportunity to explain our policy on

overstayers   in   acute  hospitals.   Patients   should   be

discharged  from  the acute hospitals when  it  is  medically

assessed that they no longer require inpatient medical  care.

Patients who still insist on staying in the hospitals  should

pay  the  full cost of their extended stay.  In this way,  we

ensure  that  the  heavily subsidised beds are  taken  up  by

patients who require inpatient care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In implementing this policy, I would like to reassure

Singaporeans  that  we have put in place several  safeguards.

First,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>



our  hospitals  certify patients that they are medically  fit

for discharge based solely on medical grounds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, my Ministry is aware that some families may

face  difficulties  in looking after patients  at  home  upon

their  discharge for various social reasons.   Some  patients

may also require step-down care.  As such, the hospitals will

assist  the  patients  and  their  families  to  arrange  for

placements in step-down facilities, or home medical, or  home

nursing,  for  these patients.  Patients and  their  families

will  be given sufficient time to make the necessary domestic

adjustments.   Full  cost  would only  be  charged  from  the

seventh  working day after the patients have  been  certified

medically  fit  and  after the hospital has  placed  them  in

appropriate step-down care facility, if necessary.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> May I ask the Minister of

State  whether it is appropriate to implement the new subsidy

for  overstayers ruling as there is, at the moment,  still  a

shortage  of  nursing homes and community  hospital  beds  to

discharge  these patients?  Moreover, the home care  services

are not adequate presently to have them sent home.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, where step-down

facilities cannot be found for the patient, or where the home

nursing  arrangement has not been arranged, the patient  will

not  be  discharged  from  the hospital,  even  if  they  are

medically fit and even if the seven days have been exceeded.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister of State

what is the average occupancy rate of the acute hospitals?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the occupancy

rate depends on whether the patients are in the subsidised or

the  paying class wards.  Currently, in the subsidised wards,

particularly  in  the C class wards, the  occupancy  rate  is

close to 100%.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister of State who

certifies the discharge of overstaying patients?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the certification

that  the patient is medically fit will be done by a  doctor.

As  in the acute hospitals, these patients are in departments

that  are  under the care of consultants.  The consultant  in

charge  will  be responsible for the patient being  certified

fit for discharge.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister of State whether it

is  right  to  put  the  onus on the doctor  to  certify  the

discharge  of his patients?  Do the doctors have enough  time

to  investigate whether, socially, these patients  are  ready

for discharge?

Will  he  not  agree with me that a patient  cannot  just  be

assessed physically, but also in totality?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the doctors will

only  certify on the medical grounds whether the  patient  is

fit to be discharged.  There are social problems involved  in

many  of  these cases and the social problems will be handled

by  the  medical  social worker.  Where  the  medical  social

worker  cannot  solve  the problem,  meaning  that  the  home

nursing or home medical services cannot be arranged, then the

patient  will  not  be  discharged.   It  is  only  when  all

arrangements  can  be made, and there have  been  seven  days

since the time the doctor has certified that the patient  was

medically  fit  to leave, it is only at that point  will  the

patient be charged full rates.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to

discharging  of patients, is it because of the  present  case

mix policy, meaning there is a specific period of stay that a

patient  will  get subsidy from the Government,  after  which

there  will  be  no subsidy?  So I am wondering  whether  the

patients  are being discharged for this purpose to make  sure

that  the hospitals do not have to pay on their own to  treat

those overstayers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this policy has

nothing to do with case mix.  At this point in time, case mix

has  not been introduced for purposes of reimbursement of the

hospital.   So  they  have no reason to take  case  mix  into

consideration when discharging patients.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



And  should  case mix be introduced at some  point,  we  will

ensure  and  insist  that decisions on whether  patients  are

discharged   home or whether they are medically fit  must  be

decided  purely on medical criteria, and not on financial  or

case mix criteria.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, regarding the

allocation of the medical social worker to a case where step-down care is needed, when does the medical social worker come

into the picture?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Currently, it is the policy in

many hospitals that looking at discharge of the patients  and

placement  of  the patient starts very early, sometimes  even

soon after admission, particularly with stroke patients.   So

the  medical social workers may be involved very early in the

management of the patients.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister of State whether it

is  correct to say that many overstayers are old people  with

no  income or from families with low income and many of  them

with  no family members who can look after them.  May  I  ask

whether this new ruling will jeopardise this group of  people

further financially and socially.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the policy has

been implemented for only a month and only one patient so far

has  been charged.  In her case she had financial counselling

and,  for  convenience, she wanted to stay in  hospital.   We

will  monitor  the effects of this policy over the  next  few

months.  If there are any cases that have been discharged and

it  has  caused  undue  suffering to the  family  or  to  the

patient,  they can bring it up with my Ministry or  they  can

bring it up with me and we will look at it.  But as this is a

new  policy that has been implemented for only one  month,  I

cannot at this time tell the Member whether or not there will

be  anybody  affected in such a manner.  But we will  monitor

this.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister

of State, since the average occupancy rate for the subsidised

wards is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



100%,  is  there any plan to increase the number of beds  for

the subsidised wards?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, currently there

is  a  great  demand for C class beds.  We are reviewing  the

matter  and, at this point, we have not made any decision  on

that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, may I ask the Minister if there are plans  for

more step-down care services to be provided.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, there are

plans for more step-down facilities, there are plans for  new

nursing homes and new step-down facilities to be built.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister of State

whether it is correct to say that Medifund cannot be used for

nursing  homes and step-down care.  Therefore, may I ask  him

whether  his  Ministry  has created a group  of  people  with

special  needs that cannot be met by our present schemes,  in

other  words, have we created a group with no safety net  for

them?   How  would the Minister of State assure  Singaporeans

that nobody would be deprived of medical care as a result  of

lack of financial means?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the first premise

that  we  have when a patient is discharged from the hospital

is  that  the patient is medically fit to leave the hospital.

So  the  question of the patient not receiving  medical  care

does  not  come  in.  As long as a patient is  in  the  acute

hospital  requiring medical care, Medifund will be  available

for the patient.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Would the Minister not agree with me that

many  patients with disabilities are as a result of diseases?

A  good  example he mentioned earlier was stroke.  Therefore,

how  can  he  then refer to such cases as not medical-related

cases and not needing Medifund?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we need

to make a distinction between medical problems and social



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



problems  caused  as  a result of medical  illness.   When  a

patient  comes  to the hospital, the patient is  ill,  he  is

treated and medical care will be provided for him.  But as  a

result of the medical illness, there are real social problems

that  may  occur  in  that the person may be  left  disabled,

without  work  and  may  have to make  alternative  financial

arrangements to look after themselves.  These are the  social

problems as a result of a medical illness.  Where the  social

problems  arise,  they  are referred to  the  medical  social

worker,  who  will  then  liaise  with  the  various   bodies

responsible for taking care of providing support  for  people

with financial problems, to help these people.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding

the  100%  occupancy  rate of the  C  class  wards,  can  the

Minister of State assure us that those who are on the waiting

list  would be given the relevant medical attention and  also

at the C ward charges?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I said close to

100%  because the occupancy rate fluctuates from day to  day.

Any  patient who requires treatment will not be delayed.  The

patient  will  be admitted, put into a bed in another  class,

but  the  charges would remain, depending on what  class  the

patient   is   admitted.   So  the  various  hospitals   have

contingency  plans  to deal with the situation  when  at  one

point  in  time there are not enough beds in that  particular

class.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, will the Minister of

State tell whether a comatose patient is ever fit enough  for

discharge from the hospital?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> The decision on when a comatose

patient  is fit to leave an acute hospital will be a decision

to  be  made by the doctor in charge.  But there are comatose

patients who leave the acute hospital to be transferred to  a

nursing  home where they may remain for several months  until

they recover.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> If the family of a comatose patient

insists that the patient



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



be  kept in the hospital, will this patient then be subjected

to the policy of full charge?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> If an appropriate step-down

facility  is  available for the patient and the  arrangements

have  been  made  and there is a step-down facility  that  is

available  for the patient, it would make sense to  move  the

patient  to  the  step-down facility,  because  the  cost  of

looking after the patient in an acute hospital is much higher

than  in  a step-down facility.  And that is the purpose  why

step-down  facilities are built.  So where a patient  has  an

appropriate  facility available for him and the  family  does

not  want the patient to move to that facility or the patient

does  not want that to happen, then the full charge will come

in.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may ask

the  Minister  of State, when will plans for  the  additional

step-down  facilities be implemented?  When can  we  see  the

step-down  facilities be done and in what percentage  are  we

talking about?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not have the

figures with me at this point in time on the details  of  the

step-down facilities and when they will be available.  But  I

will make this information available to Mr Steve Chia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</b> Will the Minister of State

not  agree  with me that the difference between the step-down

facility  and an acute hospital is one of subsidy,  and  will

the  patient not be put in a position where he is  forced  to

take  up  an alternative provider of care where he  does  not

enjoy any subsidy from the state in a situation like this?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not agree.

There  is a difference between a step-down unit and an  acute

hospital.  In an acute hospital, the level of medical care is

more  intensive  and the patient is more  acutely  ill.   The

patient goes to a step-down unit when his condition is stable

and  needs medical care or nursing care of a lower intensity,

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



that is why the cost of providing care in a step-down unit is

much  lower  than in an acute hospital.  And, in a  step-down

unit, they are subsidised too.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I practise in a hospital, so I understand  the

system  very well.  The problem of overstaying, if I may  ask

the  Minister  of State, if I am correct, is very  subjective

because,  really, medicine is as much a science as it  is  an

art.   So,  are there going to be very clear fixed parameters

in  which you can determine that a person has already reached

a stage where he should be home and therefore if he stays any

further he should be considered an overstayer?  I think  this

is  going to be very, very difficult to determine.  So  I  am

not  sure  on  what  sort of criteria or  whether  there  are

certain  international  guidelines he  is  going  to  use  to

determine  that a patient has overstayed his  due  period  of

stay in the hospital.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> We have left the decision to the

doctor  in  charge  because it is  not  possible  to  draw  a

guideline  that you can apply across every case.  Every  sick

patient is unique.  So we will leave it to the doctor who  is

looking  after the patient to make the decision.  As a  rule,

and in fact all the doctors are very compassionate people,  I

cannot  imagine that they would want to discharge  a  patient

who  is not fit to be discharged.  What we will make sure  is

that there is no financial, social or administrative pressure

on the doctors to make a decision that is not in the interest

of the patient.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to ask the Minister of State, in that case, if the Ministry's

thinking is that everything should be left to the doctors  to

decide  when a patient is fit for home, then why is  there  a

move  over  the  last one or two years for  the  Ministry  of

Health  to  ask  professional  bodies  to  draw  up  clinical

practice guidelines.  I happen to chair one of these as well.

Obviously, the Ministry's purpose is to ensure that there are

perhaps  clear  guidelines  for  the  management  of  certain

diseases.   So I would like to ask the Minister of State,  if

that is the thinking of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



the  Ministry, then why are they asking doctors  to  draw  up

practice  guidelines?  Obviously, the reason is that medicine

is  very  subjective  and  it  is  very,  very  difficult  to

determine when a patient is well enough to go home or how  he

should be treated.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are fully

aware that, in medicine, there are subjective decisions to be

made  and  the  guidelines are drawn up by  the  doctors  for

themselves.  So when the guidelines are drawn up, it  is  the

specialists  within a certain area who draw up guidelines  to

help  them  make  the correct decisions.   And  most  of  the

guidelines  are clauses to ensure that it is not rigid,  such

that the doctor involved can still use his own discretion  to

make the final decision.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has

stated  that a decision on such overstayer cases is  left  to

the hospital doctors.  But who reviews the doctors?  Is there

an  avenue  for  a second opinion?  As he said,  doctors  may

differ  in  opinion.   Will he care to put  a  mechanism  for

appeal or review of any cases?  Where families are not happy,

could they bring it up through some channel, rather than come

to  our MPS, then we appeal to the Minister?  It will be  too

late, it will take too much time.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Currently, the consultants in

charge  of  the  patient  are responsible.   But  this  is  a

suggestion  that  we can take up, ie, as to whether  or  not,

when  an  appeal is made, another doctor within the  hospital

can  review the case.  This is a suggestion that we will take

up in the Ministry.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  ask  the Minister of State, in the acute hospitals  where

there  is great pressure on the beds, doctors are often asked

to  do  what  we  call "discharge rounds",  in  other  words,

doctors  will  go  and  do a round in  a  ward  to  discharge

patients  primarily to have new beds to admit acute  patients

and  some  of  these  patients are not again  what  we  would

determine  as  optimally cured or treated at  that  point  in

time.  In the light of this,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



how  is  the  Ministry going to prevent  this  practice  from

happening where you discharge patients primarily because  you

want to free beds to take in acute patients?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not want

our  doctors  to  discharge any patients  who  are  medically

unfit.   This is not acceptable.  If there is any  case  that

anybody knows, please let me know.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, the medical condition on whether a patient is fit to  be

discharged  is decided by a doctor but could the Minister  of

State  consider whether the decision to charge  him  fee  for

overstaying  can  be  determined  in  consultation  with  the

medical  social  workers  to  take  into  consideration   the

financial  and  social  aspects?  The  medical  condition  is

decided by a medical doctor but the decision to charge a  fee

should be decided including other elements as well.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Gan, I think the question has been

asked.  Dr Khor.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my

supplementary  question  is actually  similar  to  Mr  Gan's.

Following  the question from the Member for Jalan Besar,  the

decision  to  discharge  should be based  on  totality,  that

means,  he  may  be  medically fit but there  may  be  social

problems, so we should involve the medical social worker.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That question too has been answered.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to ask the Minister of State that since there is such a great

pressure on subsidised beds and since lately, the Ministry of

Health has also openly announced that they will go all out to

court  private  patients as well, there  seems  to  be  mixed

signals.  On one hand, are we trying to say that there are  a

lot  of  extra paying beds and therefore we should go out  to

court  paying patients but the subsidised beds are very  full

and   we   should  try  to  discharge  so-called   "perceived

overstayers"?    Should  the  Ministry  then   not   consider

converting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



more paying beds to subsidised beds and ease the pressure  on

subsidised beds?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> I think the Ministry will

periodically  review  the  demand  for  subsidised  beds  and

looking at the trend, if there is a necessity in future where

beds  have  to be converted, that is something that  we  will

have to consider.

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Bus lane restrictions on Saturday mornings)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Transport

whether, in view of the much lower traffic volume on Saturday

mornings, his Ministry will lift restriction on or review the

bus lane operating hours in the Central Business District  on

those mornings.

<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan (Senior Minister of State for Transport) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Transport (Mr Khaw Boon Wan) (for the Minister for Transport):</b> Sir, unlike the new

Ministry of Health's discharge policy which is only one month

old,  bus lanes have been around for nearly 30 years.   I  do

not  know  whether  new policies attract  more  supplementary

questions or old policies.  I shall know shortly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, bus lanes are needed to facilitate the smooth flow

of  public buses.  It gives priority to buses, enabling  them

to  better adhere to their schedules.  In this way,  we  have

brought benefits to millions of bus commuters every day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bus lanes are implemented only along roads where the bus

volume  is very high.  On Saturdays, we operate from 7.30  am

to 9.30 am, and from 11.30 am to 2.00 pm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although overall traffic in certain parts of the Central

Business District (CBD) may be lower on Saturday mornings  as

compared  to weekdays, the frequency and volume of  buses  in

the  CBD  area  do not change very much.  In fact,  in  other

parts  of  the  CBD, like Orchard Road and Bras  Basah  Road,

overall   traffic   remains  heavy  on   Saturday   mornings.

Therefore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



the  Ministry  of Transport does not intend to lift  the  bus

lane restrictions on Saturday mornings.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Since the policy is to

ensure  a smooth traffic flow and on Saturday mornings,  most

of  the  areas  in  the  CBD are already experiencing  smooth

traffic,  should the Ministry not have a periodic  review  on

this?  In fact, the ERP in the CBD area on Saturdays has been

lifted which suggests that the flow of traffic is very smooth

and there is no need for another policy to restrict it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> I think it depends on the volume of

buses.  We  have checked. For example, on Saturday  mornings,

bus  schedules remain quite heavy, as compared  to  weekdays.

Yes, on Sundays, the schedules come down significantly.   But

as  far  as bus companies are concerned, they treat Saturdays

as  similar to weekdays.  If I may give you some examples  of

the  streets around this area.  Hill Street, for example,  on

weekdays,  in the morning, bus volume is about 164 per  hour,

ie, about two or three buses every minute.  On Saturdays,  it

is  149 or 150, so there is not much difference.  On Sundays,

it  comes down very drastically, about 130.  Bras Basah Road,

on weekdays, it is 180; Saturday mornings, 165. So it remains

quite heavy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the concern. We have built roads and roads are

expensive.  We  do not want to under-utilise  the  resources.

Therefore, we are extremely selective when we decide on which

roads to impose bus lanes.  Although the working criterion is

about  50  buses per hour, which is one bus per  every  60-70

seconds,  in  practice, where we impose bus  lanes,  the  bus

volumes triple those rates.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> I would like to ask

the   Senior  Minister  of  State  about  the  cameras  being

installed in buses.  Are they still being installed  and  are

they effective?

<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</b> Sir, they are being installed. Those

are   called  bus-cams  and  they  have  been  effective   in

discouraging violators.  We still receive cases every

<br>1.25 pm



<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker Sir, I join

my colleagues in support of the motion thanking the President

for his Address.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am reminded by what you said about being the last

few  to  speak.  Indeed, in the last few days,  Members  have

dealt with daunting issues that Singapore faces.  I have also

been advised by well-meaning MPs and Ministers included.  But

as  the  debate  goes on, I should strike off  issues  raised

accordingly.   I  realise that as at end  of  yesterday  that

indeed,  I  am left with very little to say.  In fact,  every

evening for the last four evenings, I have been revising  and

updating my script.  Yet, I still come to the same thing.   I

have decided that there is nothing wrong to have more of  the

same, so long as the more reflects diversity of perspectives.

Therefore,  Sir,  I will be coming from the  perspectives  of

challenges and opportunities in these trying times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a time of great change and challenge for

Singapore.  Singapore today is faced with the greatest threat

to  its competitiveness than any other time in its history as

an independent nation.  After September 11th, we must be more

security conscious.  The threads of our multi-racial  society

must  be strengthened.  As we strive to remake Singapore,  we

must embrace dramatic transformations that will ripple across

many sectors of our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A seemingly endless wind of change ahead, but behind it

all,  lie  abundant opportunities.  So how can the  workforce

stay relevant?  And how can Singapore remain competitive?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To combat the challenges and build on the opportunities,

I  would  like to propose four key points.  The  first  deals

with   stakeholders,  namely,  the  workforce,  the  business

community  and the Government.  The second looks at  boosting

entrepreneurial  culture and spirit.   The  third  calls  for

building  a  tradition  of charity.   The  fourth  hails  for

solidarity in change efforts.

<br><br><i>Economic gypsies</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, workers have to be prepared to embrace the role of

economic  gypsies.   I  term  it  that  way  because   market

volatility  and shortened business cycles will  mean  workers

have to change their jobs and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



work environments ever so often, to stay employed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore now faces increased international competition

for  foreign capital, investments, and export markets.   This

is  a  result  of the liberalisation of the former  communist

bloc  countries such as China, Russia and Eastern  Europe   - who also have a lower cost base.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also beginning to lose our traditional

competitive  advantage. Knowledge and technology have  become

cheaply available and portable in the KBE.   Our growth  rate

can  be  expected to be halved from the heady  days  of  near

double-digit  growth. Workers' earnings will consequently  be

affected.



<br><br><i>Frog in heating water</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merely adapting to change is dangerous and misleading.

It  is  like a frog in water that is slowly heating  up.  The

frog  will  keep changing its body temperature  to  suit  its

surrounding.  Contented, the frog goes  off  to  sleep.   But

bliss turns to disaster, eventually it gets boiled alive.  So

people  must  do more than just adapt to change.   They  must

jump  out  of their changing world, take charge and  dare  to

venture into new territories.



<br><br><i>Ensuring viability of our businesses in the new economy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the workforce, let us now turn our attention to

businesses.   To  survive and remain competitive,  businesses

cannot afford to carry surplus capacity on a long-term basis,

without  matching growth periods.  They must  be  allowed  to

shed  excess  capacity, be it manpower  or  otherwise,  in  a

timely   manner.    Businesses  today   face   pressures   of

competition  to  reduce costs and will invest  only  in  cost

effective locations.  Singapore is severely lacking  in  land

and other natural resources which tend to push up our costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our workforce, traditionally hardworking and

disciplined, must be flexible and realistic to retain what is

left of our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>

competitive edge.  Workers must realize that unemployment  is

here to stay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore transits into a KBE, we face the challenge

of  structural unemployment.  I understand that for a country

to  achieve KBE status, at least 65% of its workforce has  to

be  in  the  skilled  category.  In  Singapore,  our  skilled

workforce only constitutes 59%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our race to reach full KBE status, we may have to

fill this gap with foreign talent.  This will only worsen the

problem  of  the structurally unemployed issue, as  it  takes

time  to retrain people for new jobs that require new skills.

Those  affected must therefore be prepared to  turn  to  less

pleasant  or  lower  skill  jobs,  traditionally  shunned  by

Singaporeans.  Others, including professionals, may  have  to

learn  to  be innovative and become self-employed, and  offer

competitively priced services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing the full brunt of this vicious cycle are the

executives.   In  1997, I was approached by several,  whom  I

call  the  PEMs  -  they are, basically,  the  professionals,

executives  and managers  -  who had lost their  jobs  during

the  financial crisis.   Many of them are casualties  of  the

dotcom  bust and ongoing restructuring of our finance sector,

highly skilled and trained.  But they are a vulnerable group,

with no avenue to seek redress.  PEMs comprise a sizable  40%

of the total retrenched workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided to put my support behind this group and

initiated   SPEC,  a  co-operative  of  PEMs.    My   friends

questioned  my  move  to champion the  cause  of  executives,

reminding  me  that  my father, a retired  Labour  MP  and  a

founding  member  of  the NTUC, had  battled  the  plight  of

workers.   But,  Sir, this cohort of our  workforce  is  fast

increasing,  and  they  do not enjoy the  slew  of  financial

assistance  and rebates handed out by the Government  to  the

workers, which I fully support.  Sir, I shall be calling upon

the  Government  to appropriately do more in some  areas  and

less  in others, as befitting the role of Government in  both

good and bad times.  The Government has allocated a $178,000-grant to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



SPEC to conduct job placement and other training schemes  for

this  group  of  people, but I think more  can  be  done  for

retrenched executives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest another way to help this

group of people, especially those who are above 40 years old.

It  is  difficult for them to find re-employment, because  of

employers'  preference for younger workers.  One  alternative

to  re-employment would be for the Government  to  help  them

become  self-employed.  PEMs have a wealth of  knowledge  and

expertise,  and many years of valuable working experience  to

offer.  The Government can facilitate the PEMs to offer their

services  to  SMEs  or other businesses that  the  Government

would   like  to  support.   The  Government  can   encourage

companies  to  employ  the services of  PEMs  by  granting  a

subsidy, but  for only a limited period of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM Lee had given his view on subsidies yesterday. My

take on his comment is that giving subsidies is tantamount to

robbing  Peter to give Paul.  In this instance, I would  like

to  persuade  DPM  Lee  that  in certain  situations,  it  is

necessary  to  jia-you, to get the car going.  For  my  Malay

colleagues,  it  means tambah minyak kereta.   Otherwise,  we

will  keep  running  on the same spot and  we  will  be  non-starters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way is to organise these PEMs to take up

overseas postings under a subsidised funding scheme.  We  can

prepare and encourage this group of PEMs to venture overseas.

From  my  understanding,  many  companies  in  China  require

expertise  and experienced operations managers to  help  them

run  their  businesses.   In these companies,  they  actually

employ  a  lot of young MBAs, but these companies still  feel

that they lack experienced operations managers.  So, this  is

one area where we can actually help our PEMs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of PEMs can actually become the nucleus for

the  eventual  emergence of portfolio managers.   They  could

form an "outsource industry" to meet the needs of businesses.

Such an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



industry  could thrive and flourish in the New  Economy,  and

help to make Singapore more cost competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to propose that some form of

minimum  legislation be put in place to protect  PEMs.   They

are  not  covered  by the Employment Act.  So  they  have  no

recourse  to  the  Ministry of Manpower if they  are  treated

unfairly by their employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conciliation Service Unit, set up by MOM after the

1997 downturn, offers some consolation, but is not sufficient

to   help  settle  a  retrenchment  or  termination  dispute.

Perhaps  it  is timely to consider a review of the Industrial

Relations  Act, to make provision for the aggrieved executive

to  be  represented in an Arbitration Court, for  termination

and dismissal issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be sure, Sir, I am not seeking redress for executive

union  representation.   To do that will  be  to  hamper  the

flexibility  of  doing  business in Singapore.   Our  desired

outcome is to have minimum legislation to protect the  rights

of every stakeholder in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President, in his Address to this House,

emphasised  the  need  for  us to strengthen  the  spirit  of

entrepreneurship  and  risk  taking,  as   a   platform   for

Singapore's future competitiveness.  May I also add  that  we

will  require as many of our best and brightest  to  take  up

this  challenge,  if  we  are to  succeed  in  building  this

platform.   And to this end, our Government must  once  again

take the lead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must correct the current imbalance in the

distribution of local talent between the public  and  private

sectors,  to  boost the spirit of entrepreneurship  and  risk

taking  in  Singapore.  Ironically, it has not been  seen  to

take  the risk of doing this, while exhorting the virtues  of

risk  taking.   The best and brightest among  our  young  are

still  being educated and nurtured, at great public  expense,

for  safe jobs in the comfort zones of Government service and

GLCs.  Worse still, many of able body and mind,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



who eventually retire from  service on mandatory grounds, are

re-absorbed into the service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must practise more of what it is

preaching  on this issue.  Notwithstanding the problem  of  a

limited local talent pool, the Government must be bold enough

to allow the private sector a larger share of this pool.  For

example,  retiring  officers,  who  are  still  fit  for  re-employment,  can be encouraged and facilitated to  start  new

businesses  or become active equity investors in  businesses.

A  good many of these talents can be drawn from the top brass

of our Armed Forces. Instead of giving them the security of a

second  career in the cocoon of the Government and GLCs,  why

not encourage them to become risk takers and wealth creators,

in  line  with our objective of strengthening the  spirit  of

entrepreneurship?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further enlarge the entrepreneurial talent pool, the

Government can also award scholarships for higher studies  to

top   students,   based  on  their  aspirations   to   become

entrepreneurs.  Returned scholars could be asked to  work  in

Government  or  GLCs for up to five years, after  which  they

could  be  released  to the private sector  to  pursue  their

dreams, perhaps with some help from industry and Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, in our midst in this Chamber, we have a reverse

trend  in  Minister  of  State Ng  Eng  Hen,  who  started  a

successful medical practice in the private sector and is  now

drawn into the Government to contribute.  But this is a  good

thing  to happen for Singapore, because it demonstrates  that

if  we can nurture the private sector, with the creame de  la

creame, we will always be assured of a minefield to roost our

golden  goose.   MOS  Ng,  please do  not  think  that  I  am

showering  you with flattery, but I only wish to emphasise  a

point to all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may argue that good entrepreneurs need not be from

the  brightest and the best.  I would argue that if Singapore

wants to produce a few winners and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



another  Sim  Wong Hoo, then it must cultivate the  brightest

and   the   best.   By  and  large,  the  majority   of   our

entrepreneurs   can  be  the  mums  and  the   pas   of   our

heartlanders,  but  in uplifting the entrepreneurial  culture

and quality, there is no denying that we also need the best.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We tend to have a pre-qualified definition for success

-   all  the  5  Cs.   But  let  me  relate  an  incident  my

entrepreneur  friend told me about.  One morning,  she  drove

her  daughter to school, something she had not been doing for

a  while.   The  principal, who knows  her  as  a  successful

entrepreneur, was surprised to see her and asked her why  she

was  not  at  work.  Amused by the query, my  friend  replied

"Well  I have made enough money for the year and have decided

to  quit  my  job."  In fact, she had just  quit  her  dotcom

company that went bust.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pre-conceived notion here is that she had time to

ferry  her daughter because she may have lost her  job.   But

the  principal may or may not be having this notion  that  my

friend  thinks the principal has.  The point really  is  that

the  meaning of success is relative and a matter  of  choice.

Singaporeans  must look at the entrepreneurial world  through

experimental  eyes.   Give  room  for  trials  and   courage.

Courage  does  not  mean having no fear.  Courage  is  taking

action despite fear, and this, to me, is success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President has also spoken of the need to

maintain  and strengthen our social cohesion, as  we  upgrade

our  economy, and the income divide widens between  those  at

the  top  end  and  the  lower end.  The  world's  wealthiest

country, the United States, is also a country of great income

divide.   But  the  social cohesion of  American  society  is

strong, partly because of their great charitable institutions

and the generosity of America's rich, in reaching out to help

their less fortunate compatriots.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of the American charity is best illustrated

by  Bill Gates, the world's wealthiest person with a reported

net worth of US$56 billion, but who has also given away US$20

billion to charity.  I am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



no fan of Bill Gates, but here is an example of a businessman

supporting the community in which his business thrives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Asian values of philanthropy are not lacking in the

least.  The first generation of Overseas Chinese in Singapore

like  Lee Kong Chian, Tan Kah Kee, Tan Tock Seng and Run  Run

Shaw  were all charitable towkays who had given back much  to

society,  especially  to  help the  less  privileged.   These

philanthropists   have   set   up   foundations   and   built

institutions that have benefited many Singaporeans.   Witness

the former Nanyang University and The Chinese High.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we should celebrate Singaporeans who do well,

let  us also urge those who are well-off, to take a leaf from

the  great  American tradition of charity and generosity  and

from  our Asian philanthropy values, in reaching out  to  the

less  fortunate in our society.  In so doing, social cohesion

will be strengthened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, Sir, we are all aware that Singapore is at

the  crossroads. The challenges we are facing  are  daunting,

but by no means insurmountable.  As a nation and a people, we

have been at the crossroads and turning points many times  in

our  history.  Yet, each time we have overcome the  odds  and

emerged  stronger.  I am confident that we will rise  to  the

occasion  and  emerge victorious again.   Strong  leadership,

transparency,  meritocracy, hard work  and  flexibility  will

continue  to give us the extra edge, not only to survive  but

will keep us ahead of many of our competitors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a nation, we must soldier on with a positive mindset.

As the Government, we must provide bold initiatives that will

facilitate the PEMs and budding entrepreneurs.  And  as  good

corporate citizens, we must always remember to give back what

we  have reaped.  In a nutshell, the President's vision  must

become a shared dream of all Singaporeans.  I urge that there

will be fuller discussions and public debates on this vision,

so  that  all  of us will own this vision and be inspired  to

always be hopeful.  For in hope, we find the way



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>



to  remake Singapore into a fine nation, not just in form but

in spirit and soul as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I support the motion moved

by  Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, Member for Marine Parade GRC, to  thank

the President for his Speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the view of the President and some other

Members  of  the  House that Singapore is now  at  a  crucial

crossroad.  I also agree with the President's view  that  the

choices  we will make will determine our future, our  success

or failure, our progress or decline, in fact Singapore's very

survival as a nation in a turbulent world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have our meeting here as the world is still trapped

in  economic  slowdown.   This is exacerbated  by  the  black

September 11 incident.  The contemptible terrorist attacks on

the  New York Twin Towers, the United States' reaction on the

Al  Qaeda terrorist group in Afghanistan, the unending bloody

conflict  between Israel and the Palestinians in  the  Middle

East,  the  threats from the Kashmiri dispute, all  create  a

really horrifying global political climate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this region, the political atmosphere is no less

worrying.   Threats from the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group  have

not  abated  in  the  Philippines.  In  Indonesia,  political

developments  have  yet to move towards  improved  prospects.

Malaysia  is  facing  challenges  from  the  Umno-PAS   power

struggle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a global city state which is open and exposed, we are

not  spared  the  sparks of the conflicts and  the  winds  of

uncertainty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Singapore able to overcome the difficulties? This is

the question playing in the minds of every one of us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can feel confident because we have the capacity. We

have the people rallying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



firmly behind the Government.  We have among the world's best

infrastructure for which we spent decades to build.  We  have

an   educated  and  capable  population.   We  have  national

reserves  which  can  be used in difficult  times.   We  have

leaders  of  calibre.   We have an excellent  defence.   What

matters is that we have a brand name.  The Singapore brand is

a very valuable capital.  All these are the capital we have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are still handicapped by several factors.

We  are small.  We have only 682.3 square kilometres of  land

bereft  of natural resources, and a tiny population  of  3.26

million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I do not in the least doubt that we can and

certainly will overcome the difficulties facing us now.  When

Singapore   was  born  as  a  nation  36  years  ago,   these

limitations were already there.  In fact, a large part of the

capital  that I mentioned earlier were absent then.  We  have

succeeded in creating the Singapore that it is today  despite

some  quarters predicting that we would fail.  In fact,  some

even hoped that we would collapse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a historical abnormality happened. We have

survived.   And what is more, we have prospered.  We  can  be

thankful  and  proud  because Singapore  is  an  oasis  in  a

troubled region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why and how did this happen? Singapore's survival

depends  on two factors - external and internal factors.   As

is  the  case with other small nations, Singapore's  rise  or

fall  is determined to a large extent, about 60%, by external

factors and 40% by factors within the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not the United States of America, or China which

are  sufficiently large to depend on the people's sources  of

wealth and dynamism of efforts.  America's economy forms  27%

of  the  world's  GNP.  China, with its  population  of  1.29

billion and vast land rich with natural resources, can depend

on  the  efforts  and  wealth within the country  to  support

itself in hard times.  Singapore cannot.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation three decades ago is different from the

present.   The  bipolar world and the Cold War of  the  1960s

were  to  our advantage when we were viewed as supporters  in

the  Western powers' struggle against communism.   Hence,  we

enjoyed the inflow of capital which developed our industries,

and this region saw support for anti-communist governments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such strategic considerations have helped the economies

of  Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Brunei

to  grow.   ASEAN has been hailed as the unmatched shield  of

stability  in  the  region.  The basis of  development  which

began  from  these strategic considerations  has  produced  a

circle  of  dynamism which benefited the region.   Singapore,

which has more obvious internal advantages and adopts correct

policies and approach, has been able to move far ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is now a unipolar one. The struggle against

communism has ended.  The concern of the West has shifted  to

tackling their biggest political and economic rivals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is considered as a side which is able to pierce the

unipolar  comfort of the United States?  Although  Europe  is

seen  as  an  economic  rival, it is  still  counted  as  its

political  ally.  So is Japan.  This puts China and  militant

Islam as the biggest challenge to US world supremacy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the way the US conducts its international

relations, many are of the view that the challenge from China

is  a long-term concern while the challenge by militant Islam

is more pressing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me explain. In its effort to counter

the  threat  of the Soviet Union, the US rallied  its  allies

among Muslim nations.  It helped Iran under Shah Phalavi  and

strengthened   groups  opposed  to  the   Soviet   Union   in

Afghanistan   apart  from  cooperating  with   several   Arab

countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political challenge of militant Islam to the US

began  when  Iran  fell into the hands of the  mullahs.   Its

attempt to make Iraq a buffer against Iranian influence



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



ended  with  the emergence of Iraq under expansionist  Saddam

Hussein.   Now  Iraq  has still not been completely  crippled

after Operation Desert Storm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Afghanistan, the government power fell into the hands

of the Talibans who opposed Soviet occupation of the country.

The  new  Afghan leadership later provided safe haven  to  Al

Qaeda  and  Osama Bin Laden, the person responsible  for  the

attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Palestinian-Israeli conflict is actually political

in nature.  George Habash of the People's Liberation Front of

Palestine  is a Christian.  So are several other  Palestinian

senior  leaders.  However, the existence and violent  profile

of  Hamas, Hizbollah and Al-Aqsa groups have placed  militant

Islam  as a challenge to the US.  The western media  is  also

responsible for such portrayal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow of migrants from Muslim countries in North

Africa, Middle East and Pakistan to France, Britain, Germany,

Denmark, and the social conflicts which have arisen  from  it

have also increased the concern of European countries on  the

phenomenon  called Islam. These countries, though  well-known

as  protectors  and  advocates of human  rights,  have  taken

measures  to  protect  their respective  interests.   Turkey,

since  Mustapha  Kamal Attaturk's era,  has  been  practising

secular  policy  and  identifies itself as  part  of  Europe.

Until  now,  its attempt to become a member of  the  European

Union has still not become a reality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A line seems to have been drawn by the western world

against Islam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our country, the events sparked by the Jemaah

Islamiyah  incident,  the emergence of KMM  in  Malaysia  and

Laskar  Jihad  in  Indonesia as well as  Abu  Sayyaf  in  the

Philippines show that the threat of global terrorism  affects

us and our neighbours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, what is the link between the geopolitical

development in the world and Singapore?  If a major  part  of

Singapore's future is determined by external factors,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



it  means  that  we  have  to think about  it  seriously  and

rationally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a secular country. Muslims form 15% of its

population.  It is surrounded by Indonesia where Muslims form

88%  of its 228 million population and Malaysia where Muslims

form  53%  of  its 22 million population.  Events  that  take

place  in the world and our neighbouring countries will  have

effects  on Singapore.  Does this mean that Singapore  should

be  suspicious of Islam?  Statements made by our leaders  are

clear.   Singapore  is not suspicious of Islam.   But  it  is

worried about militant Islam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this is not only the concern of Singapore,

but  also  other  countries such as Malaysia  and  Indonesia.

Likewise  with  Muslim  majority  countries  such  as  Egypt,

Jordan,  Pakistan  and Algeria.  They are  also  fighting  to

contain the influence of militant Islam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should expand our network and cooperation with

mainstream  and moderate Muslim countries.  They  can  become

our  friends.  At the same time, we must stop the  inflow  of

militant  Islam and prevent elements of militant  Islam  from

spreading  in our country.  It is the seed of division  which

can threaten our racial harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economically, we are facing China with its formidable

economic  challenge.  Many Members of the House have  touched

on  this  matter.   In  this region, Malaysia,  Thailand  and

Indonesia  can  offer an alternative with much  lower  costs.

All  these and many more that I am unable to mention form 60%

of the factors that contribute to Singapore's survival.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we may not be able to change the external

factor.   It is beyond our control.  But this does  not  mean

that we should not do anything and let it grip us.  We should

make efforts to make them work in our favour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I studied geography. Those who are familiar with the

topography of a desert know that an oasis does not  exist  on

its   own.   Its  existence  and  greenery  are  due  to  the

underground water that flows



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>



hundreds  of  kilometres to it.  The water flows  slowly  and

though we cannot see it, the water flows non-stop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is like an oasis. To remain as an oasis, it

needs   to  create  a  network  which  channels  sources   of

production and expertise from all over the world. Through the

external  wing,  regionalisation, the carving  of  niches  in

external markets, the setting up of strategic branch  offices

overseas,  the entry of talent and our networking with  post-industrial  countries, we create a network which becomes  the

lifeline of our country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to concentrate on the other 40% - the

internal factor.  We need to rediscover our strength, explore

new areas, change our way of analysing and solving problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to strengthen our unity, increase our sense of

belonging  and  stakes  of  our  people.   We  need  to  have

confidence in ourselves and our capability.  It is  a  factor

that can prompt us towards progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore brand enjoys an international standard.

We  should  fully  use it.  The success of  SIA  and  PSA  in

airline  and port industries can serve as a model  for  other

industries.  We should have more models of this kind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, two years ago I was in Belgium, a European

country which has a high cost of living.  It has been able to

maintain  its economic development by carving certain  niches

in  the  European and world economies.  Its small and  medium

sized  enterprises  (SMEs) produce  special  and  world-class

goods.  You may have heard the term 'boutique chocolate'.  It

is  a  special chocolate, delicious, unique but the price  is

ten times that of ordinary chocolate.  Many people love it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is the case with its restaurants. It has one-star to

three-star restaurants.  The three-star restaurants  are  not

big  restaurants.  Some are run by couples with an assistant.

But I have been told that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



cooking  is delicious and the ambience is fantastic.   Diners

pay premium amount to enjoy the service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Sydney, there are also similar restaurants which are

extraordinary.  Those who want to go to the restaurants  have

to  book three months in advance.  There is only one menu and

it  does  not  change but the restaurants  are  crowded  with

customers every night.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to stress here is that we should not blame

costs  only.  Generally, to compete with our rivals, we  need

to lower our costs.  But for special high-cost industries, we

can still increase demand by being creative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the oasis which is called Singapore has to

get  a  formula and model from the experience overseas.   The

formula and model are like underground water that gives  life

to  the oasis.  If this can be done, I am confident that  the

ship  which is called Singapore will continue to sail in  the

sea of success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

speak in support of the motion to thank the President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My being here is about maintaining hope in our younger

generation.   Three  other Members of  this  House  who  were

naturalised Singaporeans have spoken of how they  cast  their

lot  with  Singapore.  I, on the other hand, am a Singaporean

born  overseas to expatriate Singaporean parents in  Sarawak.

I  spent  my  early years in Kuching and Kota  Kinabalu,  and

later  in  KL.   In  the political aftermath  of  Singapore's

independence, circumstances forced my parents to move us from

Sabah  to KL, while the racial riots there in 1969 sent  them

back to Singapore.  Despite having to take a paycut each time

and  to  start all over again in their career each and  every

time,  Singapore was still home and that is where they  went,

because they knew that here, in Singapore, success would  not

depend on one's race and religion, but on hard work and equal

opportunities for all.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember how funny it felt having to renounce my

rights  to  a  foreign  passport and  to  take  the  oath  of

citizenship  again  despite  having  being  registered  as  a

citizen  since  birth.  After nine years in  our  schools,  I

gladly served NS, not only because I now possess the pink IC,

but  because  I felt that this was a place I was prepared  to

defend  because  it  had  given me the  opportunity  to  make

something of my life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After BMT, I was assigned to do social work among

soldiers  convicted of consuming controlled drugs.   Many  of

these so-called Hokkien ping were basically what I felt  were

very  good people, who had just strayed onto the wrong  path.

They taught me to appreciate all my blessings, and made me to

reflect  on the need for opportunities to get it right  first

time, and also how difficult it was to come back on course if

you did not get it right first time.  For these soldiers,  NS

was not about learning to defend Singapore, but a struggle to

get  back  on  track  in their lives and  a  struggle  to  be

accepted  back into a society which had already branded  them

as failures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, while studying to be a paediatrician, I suffered

many   reverses  in  specialist  examinations.   But  I  have

colleagues who believed that I deserved a second chance,  and

who  believed and supported me, and eventually,  I  became  a

paediatrician.  These experiences taught me valuable lessons:

Firstly, you must believe in yourself and you must believe in

your dreams to succeed.  The second was that, to succeed, you

needed  people  who believed in you and who are  prepared  to

give  you a second chance.  The third was that when you fail,

you  must  be prepared to be disappointed, but you  have  the

resilience  to  fight on, and perhaps be  laughed  at  for  a

while.   The fourth was that when you fail, you must confront

your  faults and weaknesses, and be prepared to try something

new or to risk repeating your mistakes again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, as a doctor treating chronic illnesses, such as

diabetes  in  children, I come to know that my patients  will

only get serious about looking after themselves



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



when  they  have  accepted the diagnosis and understand  that

they  have  a lifelong condition that will not go  away,  but

which they can battle and overcome.  Such patients respond to

treatment  better  and  faster once they  have  embraced  the

challenge  of  tackling the disease for  themselves  and  get

serious about taking control of their own lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this situation is analogous to the process

of  reinventing  Singapore, in that  we  need  to  undergo  a

painful  restructuring of our economy and reinvent  ourselves

as  a global city.  Our young people must buy into their  own

version  of  the  Singapore dream.  They will  need  to  help

remake  Singapore many times within their own  lifetime.   We

need  to support them in their efforts, even if they  do  not

get  it right first time round.  We need to imbue in them the

optimism  born not of cocky arrogance in their own abilities,

but  in  a  deep  and binding belief that they  will  triumph

whatever  the odds because their forebears did so.   We  must

teach them not to underestimate the competition, but also not

to give up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that, in remaking Singapore, we need to create

a  national psyche that emphasises three aspects:  Firstly, a

spirit of optimism and inquiry that seeks new challenges  and

new   opportunities  and  a  culture  that  recognises   that

sometimes  failure is a necessary stopover  on  the  road  to

success.  Perhaps, in Singapore, we are too hard on those who

fail the first time round.  Secondly, we need to have a sense

of  humility about our present successes, one that recognises

the  need  to  continually  improve  and  commit  oneself  to

excellence.   And, thirdly, in echoing many of my  colleagues

in this House, I believe that we must create a national ethos

that  emphasises the individual's obligation to active  civic

mindedness and civic service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To instill this spirit of inquiry and a thirst for

challenges, we need to imbue in younger Singaporeans the idea

that  they  too  can  be  the authors of  their  own  success

stories.  They do not need to follow the generally recognised

Government model.  We need to communicate the stories of role

models for economic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



success  that  will resonate with our young.  Some  of  these

models may not be the ones that we would recognise.  We  need

to train our young to think business right from the start, to

think leadership, to think a "can do" spirit, right from  the

schooldays.    I  know  many  of  our  budding  entrepreneurs

actually  started doing business even in the  NS  days  using

handphones and pagers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can encourage this simply by allowing our young

people  to plan and run their own fun fairs and magazines  in

schools,  sell  souvenir  T-shirts in  college,  run  service

projects   and  incubate  businesses  even  while  they   are

schooling.   I know there are one or two of my CDC colleagues

who  actually have already done so.  At the tender age of 21,

they  have  already become CDC counsellors because they  were

prepared  to throw in their two cents worth.  We  should  get

them to develop gadgets as part of their school projects, and

help  them patent inventions and bring them to market.  Never

mind  it  is not a commercial success.  I too have a  patent.

It  is  not  a  commercial success but it saves  my  hospital

money.   There is a thrill in learning the skills  needed  to

get  a group of people to work together to raise money or  to

complete  a project for the good of society.  This  sense  of

achievement and confidence gained will spur our young  people

on  as  social and commercial entrepreneurs later.   Learning

how  to  run  service projects, whether locally  or  overseas

volunteers,  will  also ignite a spark of  social  conscience

that  will  often  blossom into a lifetime  of  volunteerism.

Learning how to run these things, inter-school, inter-college

or  inter-community also teaches our young people skills  and

promotes   social  cohesion,  attributes  sorely  needed   in

Singapore's future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who have left school prematurely, schemes to

bring  them  back  to school, or at least to  bring  them  to

formal  learning,  such  as YMCA Project  Bridge,  should  be

encouraged.    Perhaps,  we  also  need  to   consider   more

educational support for those who would succeed if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>



they only have a little bit more help in our school system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to inspire our youths by showing them heroes

they  can understand and identify with, heroes not only  from

Singapore, but from this globalised world that they can apply

to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History buffs may know the lessons of Venice and Hong

Kong  vis-a-vis  Shanghai, and they  may  also  realise  that

London is still a financial centre despite the decline of the

British   Empire.   But  when  it   comes  to   our   younger

generation,  they may be more inspired by the men  and  ideas

behind household names, such as Nokia, McDonald's, IBM,  Sony

and Samsung.  They need to hear how Steve Jobs and Bill Gates

made their way, and their fortunes, and how the inventors  of

velcro, post it pads and the humble zipper seem to have  come

upon  the  great discoveries they made their fortunes.   They

also  need  to know the nature of the competition,  and  that

China  now  produces modern washing machines  that  can  also

churn butter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to hear also about our own Singapore role

models.  Not only do they need to know the stories of  Senior

Minister, CK Tang and Lee Kong Chian, but also about Creative

Technologies, our own poets and painters, our own  innovative

mushroom  growers, internationalised prata  and  popiah  skin

makers,   orchid  exporters,  aeroponic  vegetable   growers,

fishball makers and, yes, even our entertainers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all the possible role models for our young people

are  well  known  to  the media.  One of  my  own  grassroots

leaders, a Mr Tay, started out as an apprentice in one of our

local  shipyards,  then struck out on his  own  to  become  a

successful subcontractor to shipyards.  Although he is mainly

conversant only in Mandarin, he now has business interests in

Myanmar, Batam, and even in Australia.  His is an example  of

a  local  SME  made  good,  despite his  own  limited  formal

education.  I believe many can learn much from his example.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these examples to be effective, they need to be

widely  known.   They  need to become part  of  the  myth  of

Singapore.  Our young people need to hear the stories of  our

local  role  models, not just to be aired on occasional  news

specials,  but to be propagated in our magazines,  serialised

into  TV dramas, made into comics and perhaps even made  into

computer games, and made into part of our local folklore.  We

would also do well to have a young businessman's council,  or

a young inventor's chat show.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should consider the road less travelled to be no less

valid,  especially  when they lead  to  success.   We  should

celebrate those who clawed their way back to success from the

ranks   of   the   scholastically  challenged,   either   via

entrepreneurial  ladder  or  via  an  alternative  scholastic

ladder.   The knowledge that your own countrymen  have  tried

and  made it, even though they may have tasted failure  along

the  way,  this  is  powerful stuff.  This is  about  winning

hearts  right  from  an early age.  We must  tell  our  young

people that they should not be like the proverbial frog in  a

well thinking themselves superior to others around them.   25

years  ago,  my  mother,  then a teacher,  told  me  she  had

students who had never been to Orchard Road.  Just before she

retired, she told me of how her current students in the  very

same  school  were  now comparing travel notes  about  China,

Australia and the USA.  However, we should make sure that our

children  do  not  just become ugly Singaporeans,  known  for

passing  loud  comments  about the relative  backwardness  of

places that we visit, because pride comes before fall.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my travels as an advocate for diabetes knowledge, I

have  realised  that whatever lead we Singaporeans  think  we

have  in technology or language or ability to understand  the

local  culture obviously is fast disappearing.   Our  biggest

stumbling block may well be a misplaced confidence in our own

advantages.  Our regional neighbours are at varying stages of

economic  development.  Some may seem backward, but some  are

already better than us in certain areas.  We need



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



to  teach  our  children to be humble  when  we  visit  these

countries and to learn from them, to appreciate the  cultural

diversity,  and to be inspired to see these as new  lands  of

opportunity, new lands where they might want to do business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should continue to send our young people abroad for

school trips, even in these troubled times because we need to

open  their  eyes to poverty, to opportunities  for  service,

opportunities  for commerce and to understand the  people  of

the  region  better.  We should encourage  the  work  of  the

Singapore  International Foundation to send  more  people  as

volunteers representing Singapore.  Surveys by the SIF showed

that young people who had done overseas volunteer stints were

more  likely to be volunteers in Singapore upon their return.

These   people   will  not  only  develop  a  greater   civil

consciousness towards our own citizens, but they will also be

better  able  to function as global Singaporeans,  rooted  to

Singapore  and  yet  able to take on  jobs  and  do  business

globally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how about ourselves, this current generation, as

change  agents  for  a  better  Singapore?   As  the  current

generation  of adult Singaporeans, we can do a  lot  more  to

show  our  young  that  they  can  have  confidence  in   our

generation yet.  Let me just offer three suggestions before I

close:  Firstly, if you are a boss, consider hiring an  older

worker.   He or she may have been retrenched, but  may  still

have  an  agile mind and an able body.  Sure,  you  could  be

wrong.   You may have to sack him soon.  But if you take  the

trouble to consider the individual and not just the age,  and

put  yourself in his shoes, you may realise that one day, you

too  might  want someone else to give you a chance  to  prove

yourself.  Young or old, degree or no degree, I find that  it

is actually the job attitude that makes the difference.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, let us not price ourselves out of the market

whatever our field is.  We must consider that we cost more to

hire than most other people in the region, so whatever we are

doing, let us aim for excellence, let us aim to deliver value



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>



for  money.   Quality always commands a premium, but  working

smart enables you to charge less and yet earn more.  Once you

have  tried a new chicken rice stall that is as good  as  the

old  one but gives you more chicken for the same dollar,  you

may  not  want to eat at the old store anymore.   In  Europe,

Easyjet is flying rings round established airlines because it

offers  good  value at low cost.  SIA and PSA  are  companies

which,  to  my  simple doctor's mind, need to  consider  what

their consumers are saying about their perceived value,  even

though they may currently be at the top of the pile.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, when in a position to decide or administer a

policy,  consider if there is something you could do to  make

another  Singaporean's life easier, his business  less  of  a

struggle.   The  provision  of more temporary  heavy  vehicle

parks  in  the  light  of  our  slowdown  in  public  housing

development comes to mind.  Our civil servants and  statutory

boards  do  need to consider that together with our  business

community, we, together, represent Singapore Inc, and our aim

is  to  make it happen, not tell each other why it cannot  be

done.   I  am  sure  that preservation  of  policy  aims  and

transparency can co-exist with compassion and flexibility  in

application of policy.  It may take a little effort, but that

can and should be the Singapore cachet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans love food, so permit me to use one last

analogy.    Singapore   is  like  an  established   up-market

restaurant  in a neighbourhood that is seeing a  lot  of  new

eateries  spring up.  Our items on the menu are good,  but  a

little  bit pricey.  We need to ask ourselves whether we  can

really  keep  attracting the business  by  just  giving  good

value,  or  whether we will need to lower prices to  survive,

and  whether we need to put completely new items on the menu.

I  think  we need all three, and fast.  Maersk and  Evergreen

evidently  feel that good price outweighs good service.   How

many more out there feel the same?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion of Thanks to the

President.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>



<br>2.18 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry and</b>

<b>Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support the Motion of Thanks to the President.

<br><br><i>We will prevail and emerge flying</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming in at the tail end of the debate, I have had

the  privilege of listening to my colleagues' thoughtful  and

impassioned views on what Singapore needs to do to go forward

and  thrive  in  a  very different world.  I  would  like  to

comment on two priorities which stand out in the debate.  The

first,  on  what we need as individuals and, the  second,  on

what we need as a society.

<br><br><i>Twin priorities</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Singaporeans have to be more self-reliant, more

robust  as  individuals, less dependent on Government.   Many

Members have expressed this need for greater resilience.   Mr

Seng  Han  Thong  called for a camel spirit, not  an  ostrich

spirit,  among third-generation Singaporeans, and Dr Ong  Seh

Hong  called for flying dragons, not earthworms - all  these,

no  doubt, adding to the diversity of the new Singapore  eco-system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we have to redouble our efforts to stay together

as  a  people.   Government has to engage  Singaporeans  and,

particularly,   young   Singaporeans,   more   actively   and

demonstrate that it is sincere in doing so.  But Singaporeans

have  to  themselves  take ownership of efforts  to  build  a

strong  Singapore society to enhance our multi-racial compact

and  carry forward the Singapore Cause that Mr Khaw Boon  Wan

spoke about.

<br><br><i>A new culture</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with the views expressed by many of my

colleagues on these two priorities.  At the core, we  need  a

new culture, a new spirit, to take Singapore and Singaporeans

forward in a new and very different world.  We need a culture

of rugged economic individualism.  But it has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>



to  be a culture that sees value in every citizen, celebrates

alternative  paths  to  success, and  preserves  a  deep  and

abiding  sense among all Singaporeans that we share a  future

together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no choice but to go the way of economic

individualism.  We have to encourage individuals to  do  well

in the marketplace and earn great rewards.  We need many more

Singaporeans  willing  to stand out, do  things  differently,

take a risk and occasionally go against the tide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need this new culture not only to succeed in

throwing up a stronger core of entrepreneurs, but to  develop

a more innovative people.  It will be what gives us advantage

against  the  competition  and enables  us  to  achieve  good

growth.   This  new culture will take time to evolve  and  it

will have many implications for Singapore society.  How do we

ensure  that those who do well in the market and earn  higher

incomes  will  not feel they stand apart from and  above  the

rest?   How far should we intervene in the market or seek  to

moderate the consequences of the market, whether through  our

fiscal policies, HDB subsidies or a social safety net?  These

are not trivial questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not many societies have succeeded in preserving a true

spirit of togetherness and cohesion while holding to a spirit

of enterprise and economic individualism.  In most societies,

economic  individualism has worked against  social  cohesion.

And   policies  and  attitudes  aimed  at  preserving  social

cohesion  have  often worked against a culture of  enterprise

and economic individualism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Americans have the most enterprising culture among

the  advanced  countries.  In strictly economic  terms,  they

have  outperformed the rest.  They have been able  to  do  so

because, more than other societies, Americans accept the free

play of market forces.  Individuals are more willing to adapt

to  changes, develop the next product, find the next  market,

look for the next opportunity.  Americans accept as fair that

individuals be rewarded in the market for their energies  and

their enterprise.  They also welcome the best



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



and  brightest  foreigners into their society,  give  them  a

place and make them feel at home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US has a wider inequality of incomes and wealth than

most  societies. But Americans tolerate inequality  and  even

regard  much  of  it  as  fair because  of  the  reality  and

perception  of social mobility in the US.  It is  a  powerful

and  popular ethos - that anyone can get ahead if he puts  in

the  effort.   Contrast with Europe.  Because there  is  less

social  mobility  in  European societies,  there  is  greater

popular  demand in Europe for government to fight  inequality

than there is in the States.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Americans' non-egalitarian attitude to capitalism,

and  their greater acceptance of creative destruction in  the

corporate  world,  has produced superior  economic  outcomes.

For  every NTT  DoCoMo or Vivendi,  there are many more  Wal-Marts, Intels and Microsofts.  More important, jobs in the US

have  grown  more rapidly than in any other advanced  society

over  the  last  two decades.   And they have  had  a  faster

increase in average productivity and standards of living.  It

has  produced better results for the majority, not  just  the

wealthy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But American society is not cohesive. They rally

around magnificently in crisis, as September 11th showed, and

have  a fervent  belief in certain American ideals - but  the

US  is  otherwise  not  a  tightly  bound  society.   Wealthy

Americans  make large contributions to charity, as  Madam  Ho

Geok  Choo  has mentioned, but it does not change  the  basic

reality  of  a somewhat disparate society.  The affluent  and

the  upwardly-mobile live their lives quite separate from the

less-skilled if they wish, moving out to the suburbs and even

out of the cities altogether.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Japanese are most unlike the US in social culture.

They shun individualism and place a premium on modesty, group

decision-making, and on sharing the credit.   They  succeeded

as   a   people  for  40  years,  caught  up  with  the  West

economically  and  surpassed the West  in  some  areas.   But

Japan's system of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



consensual decision-making and its highly egalitarian culture

are  now  holding it back.  The system is geared to  avoiding

pain,  which  means  avoiding reform.  Farmers,  construction

companies  and corporate dinosaurs have greater influence  on

government  policies than the needs of the  overall  economy.

There is a profound loss of confidence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Europeans have a more congenial and cohesive culture

than the US.  They are also  absorbing lessons from the US on

how  to  create an environment for growth, although of course

the  Europeans would not say they are learning from  the  US.

They are cutting taxes, trying to roll back the welfare state

and putting in place US-style capital market discipline.  But

the  differences between  Europe and the US  lie  deeper,  in

the  culture and outlook of individuals on either side of the

Atlantic.  Unlike the US, the Europeans view the world  as  a

zero-sum game - one person's gain is another's loss.  And  so

they  seek to preserve the status quo.  It is a culture  that

blocks  out  newcomers, start-ups and up-starts,  those  with

ideas  and innovations that can unseat the incumbent  players

and generate growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So although there is great egalitarianism in European

culture,  and a genuine concern on the part of the successful

for those lower down the economic ladder, the system produces

less  growth, fewer jobs and higher unemployment.  It  is  an

egalitarian   culture  that  does  not  produce   egalitarian

outcomes, especially for those without jobs.

<br><br><i>Embracing the Market</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have to embrace the market and

accept  the inequalities thrown up by the marketplace  if  we

are  to succeed in generating growth and creating jobs in our

next  phase  of  development.  We  cannot  shrink  from  this

challenge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a city-state, competing with cities within

countries.   They are not just cities, but cities  that  draw

the best talent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



and the most energetic people from across their countries and

regions.   Cities  like  London  and  Zurich  within  Europe,

Shanghai and Guangzhou  drawing from China, New York and  San

Francisco  drawing from the world.  Over half of  New  York's

residents are either foreign-born or children of parents  who

are  both  foreign-born.  Native New Yorkers do not  begrudge

the  presence  of foreigners who have settled  in  the  city.

They  know  that  New York throbs because it attracts  talent

from  around the world in business, the professions  and  the

creative arts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to be the hub in Asia for business, small and

large,   and  a  Mecca  for   talent.   We  have  to  develop

Singaporeans  of  all  talents and spur  on  Singaporeans  to

succeed.   But  we  also  have  to   move  further  ahead  in

attracting  foreigners with the ideas, skills and connections

that  can contribute to Singapore's growth and vibrance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should continue to shift the emphasis of our tax

policies from redistribution to growth.  We have to move away

from  the  egalitarian  approach.   We  should  give  greater

incentive  for  anyone with the ability, guts and  energy  to

succeed to go as far as he can.  That way, we can succeed  as

a  country, generate more growth and more jobs.  It is not  a

zero-sum game.  It is not a matter of favouring the  rich  or

the  clever,  but  of favouring a future of better  jobs  and

better  incomes  for  all.   If  a  Singaporean  entrepreneur

becomes  a  billionaire,  our  "Gini  coefficient",  as   the

economists  put  it,  will "worsen" - we  will  have  greater

inequality  -  but  we should be happy as  his  success  will

create more jobs and better incomes for  others.

<br><br><i>Strengthening Our Social Compact</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the market philosophy that we need for future growth

will not be viable in Singapore if we do not work hard on our

social  compact.  We have to overcome the problem  that  many

other  societies have faced, where economic freedom  has  not

coexisted  well  with social cohesion.   We  can  do  so,  by

building on our past strengths, preserving the trust  between

people and Government, and exercising



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



strong leadership wisely.  For the market-based philosophy to

work  and  be  accepted, Singaporeans who do very  well  must

engage with and show concern for the rest of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot recreate the environment that threw up the

sense of commitment to community that our early pioneers had,

or   the   extraordinary  spirit  that  Singapore's  founding

generation  had in building a new nation.  But we  will  find

ways  to  strengthen civic attachments and a sense of  shared

purpose among all our citizens.  We have to do so through our

educational institutions, our community organisations and, as

Raymond Lim emphasised, through a more vibrant civil society.

And  we  have  to  strengthen the  heartware  of  multiracial

relations,  as  Mr  Iswaran  and Mr  Ahmad  Khalis  spoke  on

yesterday.



<br><br><i>Social Mobility</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to work hard to preserve a sense of

mobility  in Singapore society, especially through education.

Every  citizen  must know he is getting an  equal  chance  to

improve  himself  and  develop  his  talents.   We  have   to

intervene earlier to help children from lower-income  groups.

We  have to raise standards of pre-school education so as  to

narrow  the gaps, as best we can, at the starting line  where

children  begin their school education.  My colleagues,  Sir,

have  spoken  also of the importance of providing  a  "second

chance"  to those who do not do well in school.  We  have  to

expand the paths to tertiary education, and provide the  full

menu  of  opportunities for life-long learning.  We may  even

have to provide classes for Members of Parliament seeking  an

upgrade  in Cantonese karaoke.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need more varied heroes in education, who make good

regardless  of how they started.  Like the ITE graduates  who

make  it  through polytechnic, some even through  university.

Or  people like Mohamad Saberi Bakar who, not daunted by  his

indifferent 'O' level grades, decided to catch up in his mid-20s by working hard for a diploma, then an advanced diploma



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



in  IT - his study room was the Changi Airport waving gallery

-  and eventually went on to get his computer science degree.

He  now  works as an engineer.  Mr Saberi told The New  Paper

that  he  was  tired  of  the  "underclass"  tag  and  people

suggesting  that, as a Malay, he would have no opportunities.

In  his own words, "Everyone has a chance  in Singapore.   No

matter  who you are  or what your background or race is.   It

is just a matter of grabbing that chance."



<br><br><i>Redefining success</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, ultimately, Sir, we have to measure success not by

whether you get a university degree.  Everyone who puts  full

effort into going as far as he can, and developing the talent

he  has, is a success.  Every ITE graduate who holds  down  a

job  and  looks  for ways of upgrading his skills  every  few

years is an unqualified success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We inherit an East Asian tradition that reveres

scholastic  success.  We also inherited an  education  system

that  was  geared  to  producing the  intellectual  elite  in

Britain.   The  combination  of East  Asian  values  and  the

academic bias of the British system was a potent combination,

and  has shaped attitudes among generations of parents.   All

that  mattered  to the British were your "O"s  and  "A"s  and

which university you went to.  It is very different from  the

tradition  in several European countries, where students  who

go  through  the technical route suffer no stigma.   We  have

changed   our   system  over  the  years,  built  world-class

institutions in our polytechnics and ITE.  ITE graduates  got

jobs  faster  than university and polytechnic graduates  last

year,  and with good starting  salaries.  But some old social

attitudes remain and we have to change them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to remove the sense of failure among those who

do  not  make it all the way up the academic ladder.  But  we

have  to avoid going the way the British have since done,  of

converting  polytechnics into universities and  creating  new

degrees  -  in sports, tourism studies and so on  -  so  that

more  people  can make it through university.  We  should  be

honest and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



pragmatic  in  our  education agenda.   We  should  recognise

different  abilities  and give them each the best  chance  of

flowering.   We  should avoid lowering standards  and  giving

students a false sense of academic achievement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must continue to show compassion to families and

individuals who end up in distress through no fault of  their

own  or  no lack of effort.  But we should continue to  focus

this  effort at the local level, through the CDCs  and   CCCs

and  through  voluntary actions by private organisations  and

citizens.  That way, we develop strong local community  bonds

and  ensure that assistance goes to those who are willing  to

put  in  the  effort to help themselves.  That way  we  guard

against a culture of dependence on the state.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young must have opportunity to contribute to the

community.   They have to develop the instinct of wanting  to

contribute  something  much  larger  than  themselves.    Our

schools  are  providing a range of activities  to  make  this

possible, whether through local projects or regional ventures

that  bring students face-to-face with the realities of  life

outside Singapore's prosperous, comfortable conditions.   The

enthusiasm of many of the students is remarkable.  One school

girl, Liu Xiaojun, 17, borrowed from friends to fund her trip

to  East  Timor  recently  on  a humanitarian  mission.   Her

father,  a  technician, had been retrenched before her  trip.

Xiaojun  has now found a part-time job as a piano teacher  to

repay her loan.



<br><br><i>Taking the Road Less Travelled</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need a breed of young Singaporeans with a spirit

of  inventiveness and an ability to take failure  in  stride.

More  of  our  young have to be willing to be unorthodox  and

take  the  road  less  travelled.  They must  learn  to  take

knocks, be prepared to run into a rut from time to time, know

how to get out of it and look for another way to get ahead in

life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will take time to develop a more enterprising spirit

in Singapore, a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



willingness to be different, and think differently.   But  it

is  not  totally absent among our young.  The eight  national

sailors  in  junior  college, university or  early  in  their

careers,  who  recently  put a hold  on  their  education  or

careers  in order to train full-time for the Asian games  are

an  example of this new spirit.  One of them, Stanley Tan,  a

27  year-old   who   had completed his Bar examinations   has

decided  to postpone his legal career until after the  Athens

Olympics.   As he put it, "I want to see how far  I  can  go.

Frankly,  I  am looking at 30 or 40 years of a legal  career.

Taking  some  time  off is a drop in the  ocean."   They  are

taking  time-off to do something they can do well in, and  do

something which they take passion in doing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we should not try too hard to develop

entrepreneurs,  or  to  build  an  entrepreneurial   culture.

Entrepreneurs  are self-made.  But we have  to  provide  more

space  for our young to develop a free-spiritedness  that  is

lacking  in  Singapore  today,  and  that  is  essential  for

entrepreneurial society.  We should avoid being,  as  Mr  Gan

Kim  Yong says, a perfectionist society.  The Chinese have  a

saying, clear water has no fish (qing shui wu yu).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree in spirit with Dr Wang Kai Yuen, Assoc. Prof.

Low Seow Chay, Mr Chew Heng Ching and other MPs who felt that

the excessive amount of time that our students spend in

examination preparation is not ideal.  It is especially not

ideal for our more academically able, to prepare for both

their "O" and "A" levels in a space of three years before

proceeding to university.  It will not prepare them well for

the future.  It is one of the reasons why the Ministry of

Education has embarked on a review of the structure and

curriculum for the upper secondary and junior college levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are no easy solutions to the problem of

examination  pressures in a society whose very strength  lies

in  being meritocratic and achievement-oriented.  We  do  not

want to water down our standards, or lose the transparency of

the assessment system which allows all students to compete on

a fair basis for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>



entry  into schools or the tertiary institutions.  I am  sure

many of my colleagues in Parliament would join us in thinking

through the changes which can be realistically achieved,  and

which represent real improvement  over our current system.

<br><br><i>Building on Strong Foundations</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have come this far over 40 years

because of extraordinary feats of leadership. We are building

a  new Singapore on a strong foundation - an aspiring people,

a  system of multiracialism and meritocracy that still  makes

us  special, a labour movement that favours growth  and  good

governance,  fair and transparent.  It has given Singapore  a

strong brand name in every capital  across the world.  No one

seriously thinks of us as a little red dot.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot erode these assets, the core of our social

capital.  But we need new capabilities to succeed against the

competition, and to keep our sense of well-being as a people.

These  new  capabilities will require us  to  evolve  a  new,

tougher  social  culture.  We can do  so.   We  are  a  young

society,  still mobile, without encrusted values and  habits,

still engaging our future with vigour.  We will prevail,  and

emerge flying dragons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving

me  the  opportunity to speak on the motion which I  rise  in

support of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President's Address is a timely and sobering

reminder   of  the  most  serious  challenge  that  confronts

Singapore since independence.  Rarely have we been faced with

an  uncertain future that requires the complete  resolve  and

single-minded  determination of the nation to overcome.   Why

are we so despondent about the future?  It does not take much

to see why.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, unemployment is hovering around 5% and

rising.  Many of those who are unemployed are the middle aged

and not very highly educated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



Neither  are  they in tune with the demands of the  knowledge

economy.   Even as I am speaking now, I know for a fact  that

there  are  many, including those in the GLCs,  who  are  now

being  retrenched or about to be retrenched  because  of  the

present  state  of  the  economy.  We are  speaking  here  of

workers who are robbed of their dignity and pride to  earn  a

decent  living, not by circumstances of their  own  choosing,

but  by  forces beyond their control.  Sir, we  are  speaking

here  of the ineluctable sweep of the forces of globalisation

that  have taken many countries by storm.  The breaking  down

of  trade  barriers would mean that for many, the  goods  and

services that are now being produced, can be produced cheaper

elsewhere.   For  many of the emerging economies  with  their

teeming  masses to feed, this would be a welcome  opportunity

indeed  to  provide  cheap labour and  to  offer  lower  cost

centres of production.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, for others, the availability of

alternative  venues  of operation would  mean  that  they  no

longer  appear  as  attractive to  foreign  investors  or  as

competitive as the foreign rivals.  What results  then  is  a

steady  flight  of  capital  or a  continuing  relocation  of

operations  to  other  venues which are cheaper  to  operate.

When  this  happens, it is often the workers of  closed  down

offices or factories who suffer.  We see this when the labour-intensive  industries  here started to  relocate  to  cheaper

production  centres  in Indonesia, Malaysia  and,  in  recent

years, in China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of us who have had the good fortune of visiting

China  recently will attest to the rising and growing Chinese

industrial might.  This newfound confidence among the Chinese

that comes with the rising level of wealth and the opening of

the  country is something which is self-evident.  And greater

still  will  be  the  confidence  of  the  Chinese  as  China

integrates  itself  further  into  the  international   trade

through  the  WTO  in  the  hope of  becoming  a  first-world

economy.  The China that we know of today is a very different

China  that  we knew of when our pioneers first stepped  foot

into that country 20 years ago or perhaps earlier.  Then they

were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



eager  to  learn from us and looked upon us for guidance  and

investment capital.  We know that they have since moved on to

become  like  a  giant vacuum that sucks  up  new  investment

capital  in  Asia.   With a critical mass of  more  than  one

billion people and offering cheap labour in a huge market, it

becomes  increasingly  difficult  to  justify  why  investors

should  choose Singapore as a preferred choice of investment.

China  has  now  become our most awesome  competitor  in  the

marketplace for investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how should we deal with global competition and its

effects?   For many, the natural instinct is to fight  it  by

shutting  out foreign import.  We have, in Singapore,  chosen

the path of riding the wave of globalisation.  Rather than to

resist  it,  we  open  up our market to outside  competition.

From  finance to manufacturing and services, there is nothing

here that is protected from competition.  Foreign parties who

feel  that  they can produce cheaper and perform  better  can

expect  to do business here.  For many, the process has  been

painful.    The consolidation of financial services to  brace

itself for competition from foreign banks will see more  than

2,000  jobs  being  lost in the process.   Sir,  we  are  not

talking  of  some  statistics here.  We are talking  here  of

fathers and mothers without a job and an income to bring home

so that there will be food on the table and the bills will be

paid.   Not  only  that,  with  the  hollowing  out  of   our

industries, more jobs will be lost.  Indeed, even if  we  are

able  to  hunker down and wait through the present  storm  of

economic  recession, there is no assurance that life,  as  we

know it, will be the same again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in his Address, the President did reiterate that in

order  for  us to stay competitive, our business  environment

must be highly conducive.  In keeping with this objective, we

have stated that our infrastructure must continue to be world-class  at competitive cost and our spirit of enterprise  must

be  strong.   I  have  no problems with  the  broadly  stated

intention of our Government.  However, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



do have some reservations about how far a focus on continuing

to  improve our business environment is going to take us.  In

the  present  climate,  I  see that  there  are  three  major

considerations in this approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I believe we are at the present level of

development   of   our  infrastructure  where   any   further

improvements would only bring about a diminishing  return  on

our  investments.  The fact remains that economic outlook for

the  region  will  continue to remain weak in  the  next  few

years.   We  are,  as  they  say,  a  good  house  in  a  bad

neighbourhood.  As long as there is no obvious upside in  the

outlook  for  the  region,  any further  improvement  to  the

infrastructure  is  going  to only provide  us  with  limited

gains.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to foster a strong spirit of enterprise

amongst Singaporeans requires a milieu that supports  it.   I

am not that optimistic, Sir, in this regard.  Over the years,

we  have not actively nurtured the growth of a strong body of

small  and  medium enterprises.  Instead, we have  chosen  to

focus  strongly on the GLCs as providing the engine of growth

of  our  industry.  For many of these GLCs, it is  said  that

they have an unfair advantage on our local turf.  It was  not

too  long  ago only that we learn of a GLC going  into  roast

meat  business  here as well.  It is arguable  that  for  the

GLCs,  the yearning for contracts and business to stay  alive

is   not   of  the  same  extent  as  the  small  and  medium

enterprises.   The relative weakness of these desires  should

also  arguably mean that our instinct, at least for the GLCs,

for  enterprise and business will not be as well-honed as  it

should have been.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, when you have the best of brightest

brought  up  in an environment that looks down  at  failures,

whose primary pursuit of university education is to get well-paying secure jobs, and to avoid taking risk, one is not  too

hopeful  that  you can raise from this rank  of  Singaporeans

many more successful entrepreneurs.  Besides, even if we  try

to nurture in our young the spirit of enterprise, our ability

to raise them in sufficient numbers is largely constrained by

our lack of critical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



mass.  Both China and India have population sizes that exceed

a  billion  each.   We have four million.  Sir,  how  can  we

effectively compete in number with human talent?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, looking primarily internally, as our

Government's  approach seems to suggest, for new  initiatives

to  re-orientate our economy may inadvertently  cause  us  to

lose our broad focus.  Let me illustrate.  We have identified

the  life sciences as the next wave for our economy.  In this

regard,  we  are  committing much of  our  resources  towards

preparing  our  people  for this undertaking.   We  are  also

spending much time and effort building up infrastructure  for

research and development in life sciences in Singapore.  Yet,

we  know  that the centres for cutting edge research in  life

sciences  are to be found in the west.  Brave as our attempts

may  be,  it will be many more years, Sir, before Singapore's

research  and  development centres in the life  sciences  can

come up to the standards of the west, if at all we get there.

Sir, there are many who have asked the question of whether or

not,  we are better off if we had just leveraged on the  more

developed  science  industry of  the  west,  either  by  more

intensive  collaboration or direct investment overseas,  than

try  to establish a separate physical base in Singapore.   My

fear is identifying new growth areas for our country may well

embark us on a physical expansion of resources that will give

us a very limited outcome, when we may be better off building

up our R&D industries overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some years ago in this Chamber, I had suggested

that  for  us  to  survive  in this  country  into  the  next

millennium,   we   must  increasingly   look   overseas   for

opportunities.  Here, I am not just referring  to  industrial

park  developments  or  investment into  areas  that  we  are

comfortable  with.  I am referring to, as I have  alluded  to

earlier,  investments into the new areas  such  as  the  life

sciences and info-communications technologies.  We have, over

the  years,  built up a substantial amount of reserves.   Our

budget  surplus between FY96 and FY2000 was in the region  of

$17.535 billion.  Like a prudent farmer, we intend that these

reserves be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



stored for use in difficult times when the harvest is not  so

plentiful.  Again, like the prudent farmer,  we  should  also

consider using these reserves and husbanding our resources to

look  to new sources of revenue if what we bring in from  the

field  is  not  enough to provide for the  family.   With  an

accumulated  surplus of approximately $17.535  billion,  that

is, in the last term of Parliament, we could use some of that

money to buy a substantial stake, if not, a controlling stake

in  some  of these carefully chosen world-class companies  or

companies with world-class potential.  We could then leverage

on  our  ownership  of these companies by  tapping  on  their

management  and technology know-how and in particular,  their

ability  in  brand  management and promotion  to  give  us  a

headstart  in  the new growth areas that we have  identified.

In  other  words,  Sir,  besides developing  our  bio-medical

expertise,  we  should  perhaps acquire  leading  bio-medical

companies  and be plugged in immediately into the world  bio-medical grid.  We could use this opportunity to send our best

and  brightest to learn from them, and hopefully,  from  this

experience,  we  could  build on a new  generation  of  young

Singaporeans  who  are savvy about the ways of  international

marketing and investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the present time, where the flow of information

and  mode  of doing business is substantially different  from

the  pre-Internet era, we must learn to think out of the box.

Increasingly,  we have to ask ourselves whether  there  is  a

continuing  need to ensure that companies be rooted  here  to

serve the economic interests of Singapore.  In looking at the

model  that I have proposed earlier, we could perhaps own  or

control  a  Fortune 500 company, headquartered in the  US  or

Europe,  but  allow it to be an outpost for  Singaporeans  to

gain the relevant experience needed to keep Singapore in tune

with  the demands of the international market place.  In this

regard, we should perhaps take a leaf from the NUS, where  we

learned recently that they have, presumably to stay relevant,

taken to setting up outposts outside of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we are able to externalise our economy

substantially  and  draw our revenue from this  second  wing,

there will be less pressure on us if the Singapore economy is

not  doing as well.  In fact, a thriving second wing  derived

through prudent investments and acquisitions could well allow

us  to have some inefficiency within our own economic sector.

We  do  not, for instance, have to be so ruthless  in  making

that segment of our workforce, the uneducated and middle-aged

workers, redundant because they are not able to compete  with

their  counterparts in India, China or Indochina.  That  way,

we  can  keep  a  healthy balance between the  need  to  stay

competitive to make a living, which our investments  and  our

stakeholdings outside of Singapore can provide, and the  need

to provide employment and to carry those Singaporeans who may

not be able to look after themselves, without having to worry

about cost efficiency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we are serious about pushing our people to

consider the world as our workplace, wherein to live  and  to

work,  I  think we must be prepared to make some adjustments.

I shall dwell on one, ie, education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is widely known that amongst companies and

businesses,  there is one stumbling block  in  sending  staff

members  overseas, and that has to be with the  education  of

their   children.   Every  parent  in  Singapore  knows   how

important  the  second language is, and how important  it  is

that they must do well in the second language if they are  to

do  well  overall in school.  No serious parent will disagree

that  taking a child out of Singapore and placing him  in  an

environment  where the second language is  hardly  spoken  or

written,  will  have  a major impact on his  second  language

ability.   Hence, for parents with school going children,  it

would almost be impossible to send them overseas, unless  the

centres  of posting have Singapore style schools,  or  unless

they  can be assured that their children will not be severely

disavantaged when they return.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that the Ministry of Education has a policy

of  providing dispensation with the second language  for  the

child  for  a  year, if he went overseas and  did  some  time

there.   However, for many parents, that may not  be  enough.

The time has now come when the Ministry should perhaps review

to see if they should be more flexible on the second language

in  order to ease at least one worry amongst Singaporeans who

may  choose  to  answer the call of the  Government  to  work

overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in overcoming the challenges ahead, we will have to

rely  on the larger home grown corporations since it is these

corporations  that  will  have the wherewithal  to  meet  the

demands  that these challenges bring.  Here, the  GLCs,  with

their  resources and close proximity to the Government, could

well  be  suited for the work.  Much has been  said  in  this

House about the role and performance of the GLCs.  Long after

the rumblings and grumblings in Parliament are over, there is

still this rather common perception that GLCs could have been

better  run  and should preferably not be staffed  by  senior

managers  who  had spent the better of their careers  in  the

public  service.  There is a common perception that  part  of

our  problem has to do with the policy of keeping  our  civil

service  young.  What do we do with bright young senior  army

officers  who  we  retire at 45 or,  for that  matter,  young

Permanent Secretaries who have served their time in  service?

It  has  been  said  that for many, they  find  their  second

careers in the GLCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no doubt as to the mental ability and the

integrity  of  civil servants who are seconded or  chosen  to

spend  their second career, or some say retirement years,  in

the  GLCs.   However,  one  wonders whether  the  skill  sets

involved  in  running a public organisation are the  same  as

that  of  running  an organisation that is  oriented  towards

making  money.    Can we effectively move from  the  role  of

being  a   guardian  to  being  an  entrepreneur  whose  sole

objective  is to go out and earn more money for the  company?

It  would be to our good fortune if they are able to make the

mental switch.  But then again,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>



what  if  they are not able to and are just content to  coast

along?   Typically,  in the West, if a  large  public  listed

company  goes  through a bad patch, the CEO  and  the  senior

management  run  the  risk of losing their  jobs.   They  are

assessed  by their current performance.  It does  not  matter

whether  they had been good in the past.  What should  matter

is  how they are currently fairing compared to CEOs elsewhere

of  similar companies.  Our difficulty here is the assumption

that  the talent pool is limited in Singapore and, therefore,

if the civil servant has proven himself to be good at running

a   Ministry, he should, at the same time, be good at running

a  large  corporation.  There is a common perception that  in

Singapore,  it  is the same group of men circulating  amongst

the various corporations.  And unlike the civil service, they

could  well be there for the long haul.  Many have  commented

to  me  that  the GLCs may turn in bad results, but  for  the

senior management, life goes on.  If the perception is  true,

is this how we want to run these corporations and expect them

to be world-class companies?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if part of the problem lies in our policy of

keeping the civil service young and, of course, the uniformed

services  young, we should perhaps now begin to  review  this

problem  to  see  if we should extend the retirement  age  of

senior officers, whether they be in the uniformed services or

the  civil  service.   Not  all of  the  developed  countries

subscribe   to  this  policy.   Embarrassingly   enough,   at

international  conferences, we often find our civil  servants

amongst the youngest in the crowd, and sometimes by a  margin

of  more than 10 years.  Something must be said of experience

and  age.   No  amount  of  brilliance  can  be  an  adequate

substitute  for  experience.  By pushing back the  retirement

age  for  these very capable officers, I think we would  have

taken  away  the pressure to provide for their retirement  in

the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no denying that we are at the most

important crossroads of our nation's history.  It is  not  an

exaggeration to say that our future destiny will depend  very

much  on how we are able to resolve the present crisis.  Over

the past few days



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



of  debate  in this Chamber, I have heard remarks  and  pleas

that our Government and indeed our civil servants listen  and

not  just  hear the comments and suggestions on  how  we  can

better  position Singapore for a better future.  I  sincerely

hope  that  this time round, we will come out of this  crisis

stronger  and better, with our bearings and policies enjoying

the full confidence of the people, because our Government has

taken serious account of the concerns of the silent majority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office and Ministry of Community Development and Sports (Mr Chan Soo Sen) (In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion of

Thanks to the President moved by Mrs Lim Hwee Hua.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days ago, I discussed with my grassroots leaders the

President's Address and the debates in Parliament so  far  on

the  motion  of  thanks to the President.   These  grassroots

leaders  told  me  that having heard the President's  Speech,

they  were  a  bit  worried.   And  having  heard  the  views

expressed   by   the   various  MPs,   they   felt   somewhat

disappointed.   Because  the President's  Speech  sketched  a

scenario  of  a  sea  of  roaring waves  beset  with  crises.

Subsequently,  when they read the reports in  the  press,  it

appeared  as though all the MPs were suggesting that everyone

should be self-reliant.  They felt that the Government seemed

to  have  flinched. They asked me whether the Government  had

forgotten the strong mandate given to them by the voters some

five  months ago, with the understanding that the  Government

would bring them through the crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These grassroots leaders were very close to me, and that

was  why  they  were  so  candid in  telling  me  their  real

feelings.   This might well be the voice from  the  heart  of

many  fellow Singaporeans.  Of course, we must reassure  them

that the Government has been thinking of ways and means,  all

the  time, to solve the problems of its people.  If  they  do

not  believe,  then they should listen to what  Deputy  Prime

Minister Lee Hsien Loong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



had  said  yesterday  about  the  measures  to  be  taken  to

restructure  and reform.  They would know that the Government

had put in a lot of thought.  The Government has also set  up

a  few  high-level  committees to  look  for  solutions,   in

consultation  with private and people sectors.  However,  the

challenges  we are facing are really very tough  ones.  These

are  very  arduous and formidable challenges that  cannot  be

solved  by the Government alone.  Therefore, my parliamentary

colleagues here have suggested that all of us, from  the  top

to  the  bottom, must be united and strive for self reliance,

so  that we will be able to cross this sea of roaring  waves.

If  we are not willing to help ourselves, then no matter what

the Government provides, in the end it will be of no avail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember a story about a man who was so lazy that the

only thing he was willing to do was to open his  mouth to  be

fed  and  to hold out his hands to be dressed.  One day,  his

wife  had to go back to her own village to visit her parents.

Before she left home, she made a big biscuit and tied it with

a  string around the neck of her husband.  She told the  lazy

man,  "If you are hungry, just open your mouth and   bite  on

the  biscuit."  A week later, she returned home to  find  her

husband  dead.  He had only managed to eat the  part  of  the

biscuit nearer to his mouth. He was too lazy even to use  his

hands to reach for the part of the biscuit farther away  from

his  mouth. As a result, he died of starvation. So, if we  do

not help ourselves, whatever the Government does, it will  be

quite useless in the end.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to continue with our success, we must change

this mentality of relying and depending on the Government  to

solve  all problems. The President's address devoted much  of

its volume on the people factor.  We are reminded that if  we

want  to  succeed, we must struggle and fight.  In Singapore,

opportunities are still abundant and everywhere.  So long  as

we are prepared to work hard, there will be achievements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that, in order to tackle these new challenges in

a new economic and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



political situation, all of us in Singapore, from the top  to

the  bottom, should  make some adjustments to our mindset and

mentality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues here have already made some suggestions.

Allow me to  summarise these adjustments as three kinds of "a

bit   more",  namely,  a  bit  more   courage,  a  bit   more

magnanimity and a bit more care and concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start with `a bit more courage'. This means that

we  must  dare to innovate, dare to lead.  We must decisively

seize  opportunities that come along, and be  courageous  and

resolute  in  whatever we do. Otherwise, you will  lose  your

opportunity.  This is a big problem for Singapore, because we

are blessed with a good natural environment. For example, our

temperature here is quite constant. The weather will  be  the

same  as  today,  and so will the day after.   There  are  no

natural disasters to worry about.  As a result, there may  be

a  sense  that  if we do not work today, we can  always  work

tomorrow, and if not, we can always wait until the day  after

tomorrow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not so elsewhere. In China, if you go to Huang

Shan  (the Yellow Mountain), today, you see the peak and  you

might  see  sunrise. But just a while later you may  not  see

them because they are covered by the fog and clouds.  So, the

moment  the fog is dispersed, you must immediately seize  the

opportunity  to take in the magnificent view,  otherwise  you

may  just  miss the most fantastic scenery you could  see  in

your life.  But, in Singapore, there is no thick fog. We  see

the  same  scenery day in and day out. Seizing an opportunity

to  view  certain  scenic  spot does  not  seem  to  be  that

important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also dare to venture, dare to adjust, dare to

advance  and dare to retreat. We must never be too swayed  by

considerations of minor gain and loss, and hesitate over what

move  to make or shilly-shally.  We must remember that  paths

are  made  by  men  walking over them.   If  we  want  to  go

somewhere and there is no access road, create your  own  way.

So, if we want to start a business, use the road



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



that we have created for it. There is of course a cost to it,

but then this is what entrepreneurship  is all about. You can

recover  the cost by charging others who use the road started

by you.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we must dare to express ourselves. We must also

dare  to  take responsibility for what we say.   Whenever  we

tell  our young professionals that  the Government is  asking

people to make suggestions and contribute ideas, their  first

response  is  inevitably, "Where are the  OB  markers?"   Are

there  any  out-of-bound areas?  When we keep thinking  about

the  out-of-bound areas, then we might just as well  shut  up

and do not talk. So in that way, we would not be able to have

a good exchange of ideas.  In my view and experience, so long

as  we speak according to our conscience, in the interest  of

the  nation and our fellow citizens, it should not be  deemed

to  be out-of-bound even if we hold views different from  the

government.   That  is my experience as a civil  servant  for

more than 20 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we must dare to face failure. We must remember

that  failure is the mother of success.  So when we  start  a

business,  we may make some mistakes and lose some money.  So

long as we learn from these we can treat the losses as though

you  are paying the tuition fees to learn.  So, when we  fall

down,  pick  yourself up, lift up your head  and  try  again.

Hongkongers are full of such adventurous spirit. So they have

a  proverb: `A great gentleman can bend and can be straight'.

To  them, there are only temporary set-backs but no permanent

failures.  Take one step backwards, and you get more space in

front  of you. So, taking a step backward today may mean  few

steps  forward  in the days to come. You can start  all  over

again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also dare to learn new skills, to go into new

industries,  new ventures.  We must be able to turn  quickly.

You  must remember that heaven never seals off all the exits.

Every cloud has a silver lining.  There is always a way  out.

Opportunities and success are out there waiting for you. .

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is not to be too agitated by noises or the comments

from our neighbours.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>



We must not be unduly troubled by what they say.  We must put

the  truth  in perspective.  We must remember that  important

issues must be solved with reason and enlightenment.   So  if

we all have a little more courage and can do all these things

that  I  have  suggested,  then I think  we  will  have  more

confidence in ourselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we must have `a little bit more magnanimity'.

With a little bit more magnanimity, we shall be able to

accept divergent views from other people.  This may be

difficult.  As it is often said that too many people generate

too much noise, it becomes chaotic. But, remember, there is

also this saying that "among three people walking together,

there will be one who is good enough to be my teacher". In

other words, there is always someone from whom we can learn

something.  So we can talk, we can debate, we can discuss,

and from all these we will all learn something from one

another. So long as we  are magnanimous, listen to and

willing to accept the views of others, then we will be able

to find order in chaos.  Even in a chaotic state, we can

learn a lot of things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not judge a person by his success or failure

alone.   We  should not reckon the person by the  clothes  he

puts  on.  Today, we are successful, we wear branded  clothes

and drive a luxury car. But, you cannot guarantee to have all

these luxuries forever.  Many of our fellow citizens argue in

forum  page  that we must have broader yardsticks to  measure

success  or failure, and not by money alone.  And success  or

failure  is  not permanent.  Many of us like to sing.   There

are  two  lines in a very popular song by the name  of  Gujue

zhao  Jin  Chen (Ancient Moon Shining on Today's Dust)  which

says, "Victory and defeat cannot last very long; rise or fall

happens  in  a  flash."   So  we are  successful  today,  but

tomorrow we may fail.  So this is the turn of tide.  When you

see  somebody fails, do not say that he is finished,  because

tomorrow  he  may  rise  up  again.   So  we  must  be   more

magnanimous in this sense.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we must dare to accept talents from

other places who can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



contribute different styles and ideas, and who can supplement

our shortcomings with their strong points. We must be able to

leverage on their greater abilities to our benefit.   But  we

normally look only for their shortcomings, and say, "Look, we

are  better than they are."  But, few would recognise others'

strength  and  learn from them. If we can  learn  from  other

people's good points to strengthen ourselves so that we  will

have  a  good team and a strong community.  If there  are  10

people with the same ability, their combined strength is  one

multiplied  by 10.  But, if they have different capabilities,

then their combined strength is 10 multiplied by 10, and  you

have 100 - this is what we call "synergy".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are magnanimous, we will be able to understand

and  hence  tolerate  the  different cultures  and  different

religions.  We must realise that "all roads lead to Rome", we

could  reach  the  same  goal by different  means.   We  must

mutually respect one another.  We must strengthen our  mutual

trust,  and  fortify the foundation of racial  and  religious

harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also esteem the wisdom and strength of the

masses  and  the  community.   Although  not  everyone  in  a

community  has high education, he or she knows the  needs  of

his  or  her  own  community better.  We must encourage  each

community to resolve its own problems using its own ways  and

means. We must not crave for a new Government ministry to  be

set  up  just  whenever we are faced with a new problem,  and

then  complain that there is too much bureaucracy.   Once  we

have  a  new ministry, we must have new procedures.  Once  we

have procedures, we cannot escape having bureaucracy.  So  if

we  have  too  many Government ministries, we are encouraging

more  bureaucracy. Since we all dislike bureaucracy, we might

as  well  go  and  solve our problems ourselves  rather  than

asking  the  Government to set up more  ministries  and  then

complain: "Why is there so much bureaucracy?".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, is to have `a little more care and concern'. We

must remember that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



new  economy is full of roaring waves, and people,  including

ourselves,  will  get tired or injured.  When  this  happens,

where  do  we  go back to?  We should go back to our  family.

But  many  of  us  feel that our family  structure  has  been

weakened.    When the young people are urged to set up  their

families,  they  say,  "Where do we have  time?"   These  are

matters  that we must consider seriously.  We must strengthen

the family fabric.  We must not forget that the family is the

basic building block of the society's foundation.  It is  our

emotional  support and our focus of care.  The  family  is  a

haven  for  us  in  the towering waves of  the  oceans.   So,

however  strong the ship may be, in the face of the  towering

waves in a storm, we must find a haven.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, more care means we must take care of the man-in-the-street, our little men, the ordinary citizens. The

inspiration from our popular local song Xiao Ren  Wu  De  Xin

Sheng  (Voices from the Hearts of the Little People) and  the

hot-selling local films,  Money No Enough and I Not Stupid is

that  we  should not forget the ordinary and less  successful

compatriots among us. We must remember that the prosperity of

our nation and the opportunities that bring up the successful

ones  among us are actually created through the joint efforts

of everyone, including the not so successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our society, about 90% of our people are ordinary men-in-the-street, and they contribute very greatly to our

society.   We must not forget them.  We must not  forget  our

roots.   We must also propound the fine traditions  of  self-help - that is, the more successful ones should help the less

successful  ones to catch up, and cope with   the development

of the society and the nation.  In the traditional societies,

this  is very important.  The places that our ancestors  came

from,  like  Indonesia,  China,  India,  have  this  kind  of

tradition.   During the colonial days, the  colonial  masters

did not care much about the life or death of the people under

their  rule. Yet, this spirit of self-help and self-reliance,

enabled our society and the various communities to carry  on,

to  survive and prosper. However, when the Government becomes

too successful and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



too efficient, the people begin to look to the Government for

help, and then this spirit of self-help and self-reliance  in

the  community  becomes weakened.  So I  feel  that  we  must

rediscover  the communal self-help spirit and  tradition,  so

that  we  could have more care and concern among our  people.

What  we want to see more is problems solved through the care

and concern coming from within the community, and not some ad

hoc  measures  dished out by the Government through the civil

servants.   We  must  also  care  for  the  retrenched,   the

unemployed  and the less fortunate people among  us,  because

they are also part of our community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when I was in Shanghai two weeks ago, I

exchanged  views  with  a  Chinese unionist  on  helping  the

unemployed and retrenched. He told me, "In China, we  try  to

educate  the community that a worker has been retrenched  not

because  he  is not good enough, but because changes  in  the

labour  market  has caused his job to be lost.  So  this  can

happen  to  anyone, including you and I. Hence we should  not

look down on the retrenched and the unemployed. Tomorrow,  it

may  well  be  us.  So, we should help each other. Show  some

care  and concern for them, they will feel they have not been

forgotten by society, and they will have the courage to start

all over again."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we can learn from this attitude, and show a

little  more care and concern for others.  We must  also  not

forget our elders. As it is said in Chinese, "Honour your own

elders  and  extend it to other people's elders.   Love  your

young  and extend the love to other people's young as  well."

While it is good to look after my own family,  we should look

beyond that. We should transcend our family to look after and

care for other people, beyond our family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to promote volunteerism in our society. We must

encourage more people to volunteer in social works.  We  must

strengthen  our  social heartware. A little more  courage,  a

little more magnanimity and a little more care and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>



concern can go a long way in strengthening our social fabric.

Start  from  a little here, a little there and build  up  our

social  cohesion.  Then,  we will  be  moving  in  the  right

direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can find inspiration in the Presidential Address.

Move  forward courageously, and get rid of our kiasu  (afraid

to  lose)  and kiasi (afraid to die) mentality.  We  will  be

able  to  be  bold  and  courageous,  but  with  caution  and

prudence.   Then  we can reach the state of baijia  zhengming

(letting a hundred schools of thought contend).  We can  then

lay  the strong foundation for our future development in  the

new  century.  Some 100 years ago, the founders of  Singapore

came  from  various  parts of Asia. On  the  basis  of  three

"little  bit more": more courage, more magnanimity  and  more

care  and  concern for the people, they have  built  up  this

miracle  in the form of a prosperous Singapore. Let us  adopt

the  same kind of spirit to develop a better Singapore in the

new century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion of Thanks to the

President.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I propose to take the break now. I

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, as a labour MP, I thought I would just touch on

issues  that  are  close to the hearts  of  our  workers  and

heartlanders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our workers at the shop floor know very well that more

retrenchment  will  be  coming  despite  signs  of   economic

recovery.   They also understand the reasons, such as  merger

and  acquisition,  company relocation or restructuring,  cost

cuttings  or  poor business.  There are many  reasons  why  a

person can or cannot get a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



job  in the market.  Obviously there is no one solution  that

will  solve  all the problems through getting  jobs  for  the

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is encouraging to note that we have tried to help to

alleviate the unemployment problem by setting up a  Job  Task

Force  and  a Career Centre providing job placement  and  job

counselling  service  under MOM.  NTUC also  spearheaded  the

Skills Redevelopment Programme and set up a JobLink centre to

help  fellow workers to find jobs and to provide the relevant

training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must encourage our workers to continue to learn and

upgrade  their  skills.  However, we must also realise  that,

besides  skills, there are other factors that  determine  the

employability of our workers.  We may not be able to  find  a

job  even though you are highly skilled during the recession.

It  is true that there are workers who have managed to get  a

job  after they have gone through some skills training.  But,

Mr Speaker, Sir, there are also many of them who still cannot

find  jobs  even though they have obtained their  new  skills

certificate.  We need to find a better and more efficient way

to match skills training that would bring more workers to the

new  jobs.  The most common question that the workers ask  is

"What  are the skills training courses that will most  likely

land me with a job?"  That is not an easy question to answer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many people have said that there are

500,000 to 600,000 foreign workers in Singapore and there are

about  100,000 workers who are unemployed because our workers

are  choosy  about their jobs and are unwilling  to  take  up

those  jobs  done  by the foreign workers.   Therefore,  many

workers  have  urged our workers to lower their expectations.

Theoretically, this may be correct and there is some truth in

this  observation.  But according to what I know,  a  typical

foreign worker from Thailand, India or China earns about $600

to  $800 a month.  If the worker is from China and he  remits

$500 back to his hometown, this would convert

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>

to  about  RMB2,500.  In many parts of China, such a  sum  of

money can really make a difference to the living standards of

its  people.   This  is the same for workers  from  India  or

Thailand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But such a salary, Mr Speaker, Sir, is far from enough

for  a  Singapore family who lives in a 3-room HDB flat  with

two  children.   Some people have said that  the  minimum  is

$1,200  to cover the HDB loans, conservancy charges,  utility

bills, school fees and food.  How low can the expectations of

our  workers  go?  It is easier said than done  when  we  ask

other people to lower their expectations.  If you were in the

shoes  of  these workers, can you maintain your  family  with

$600?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the crux of the issue is that our workers need

to  get a job that will pay them reasonably to support  their

family.   There is an urgent need for MOM, NTUC and employers

to  work  closely  to redesign certain low-end  jobs  through

automation and skills training.  This in turn will  help  the

less educated workers to increase their productivity.  A good

example  would be the use of high-tech cleaning  machine  and

the   relevant  skills  training  provided  in  the  cleaning

industry.  These are the real help that many of our Singapore

workers need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to remake Singapore, I think we must

also  focus  on how we can develop new industries and  create

jobs for all levels of the workforce.  It is not practical to

expect  to  uplift  our  whole  workforce  to  become  highly

skilled.   This is crucial to the heartlanders  because  they

need to make a living in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Dream cannot be a global dream where the

talented citizens seek their fortune in other countries.   We

will  pay  a heavy social, economic and political  price  for

that.   In fact, we need as many talented people as possible,

be  it  foreign  or local, to seek their Singapore  Dream  in

Singapore and to compete in Singapore against the best in the

world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many people have expressed their

concern   over  the  well-being  of  the  small  and   medium

enterprise, especially those in the retail sector.  Many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



have also requested the Government to further reduce rentals,

taxes  and levies to alleviate their situation.  On the other

hand,  we  notice  that  many  Singaporeans  still  do  their

shopping  at  the mega shopping malls and petrol stations  in

Johor  Baru.   This is fine during good times.   Besides  the

fact  that goods in JB appear to be cheaper due to the  lower

exchange  rate  for the Malaysian ringgit, it also  helps  to

strengthen close bilateral ties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Malaysia has intensified its effort to compete

in  all  ways and means commercially with Singapore recently.

We have also noticed the media and the politicians there have

threatened  our water supply.  I feel that, as  Singaporeans,

it  is time that we should ask ourselves, if they continue to

criticise us unreasonably and threaten us, is it time that we

should  refrain from shopping in Johor Baru.  Why do we  have

to  contribute to the well-being of the Johor Baru economy as

Malaysia continues with its Singapore bashing?  I, therefore,

urge Singaporeans to shop in Singapore with immediate effect.

If  we  do not support our own neighbourhood shops, it  would

not  help them much even if HDB provides free rental to these

shops.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time for Singaporeans to make a stand to support

Singapore.  It is our nation we are talking about and  if  we

are not vigilant, we may not be able to afford to shop in  JB

anymore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first-generation leaders have fulfilled the dream of

our  forefathers.   They have built a stable  and  prosperous

environment  with  a proper shelter over the  head,  abundant

food and good education for the children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1990, when Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong took over the

torch  from the first-generation leaders, he said, "Singapore

can  only do well if her good sons and daughters are prepared

to dedicate themselves to help others.  I shall rally them to

serve  the  country.  For if they do not come  forward,  what

future  will we have?  I therefore call on my fellow citizens

to join me to run the next lap together."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to say that Prime Minister Goh has not

disappointed  Singaporeans and neither  have  the  people  of

Singapore  disappointed him.  The result of the last  general

election  is a show of recognition and trust that our  people

have given to our Prime Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President, in his Address to Parliament, has said,

"During  the  term  of this Parliament,  we  expect  to  make

another  political  transition.   The  nucleus  of  the  next

generation of political leadership is already in place."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to sail in the open sea depends very

much  on  the  steersman.  Our new steersman has demonstrated

his  astute  political  judgement and foresight  with  tested

capabilities.  His leadership charisma lies in his commitment

to  Singapore  and  his resoluteness to  overcome  challenges

ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is changing fast but the basics stay the same.

We must have the confidence in the new steersman and his many

young  and  capable  sailors to bring  Singapore  to  greater

heights.  Mr Speaker, Sir, no matter how rough the sea is  or

how  strong the undercurrents, even if we have to sail in the

dark, we will see the dawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you  for  this opportunity to join in the debate.  I  support

this motion to thank the President for his Speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to speak after more than 60 of my fellow

hon.  Members of the House, including some Members  from  the

Frontbench,  have  had their say.  You had  yours.   So  many

issues,  ideas  and suggestions were covered that  one  could

literally  say  that  no  stone was left  unturned.   Let  me

quickly  add that I agree with and support most of what  were

said.   Hence, whatever I now say will evoke a sense of  deja

vu.   I  receive  friendly  hints that  my  chance  of  being

appreciated  increases  the less  I  speak.   With  Professor

Chin's words "somnolent" and "soporific" ringing loudly in my

ears, I reckon that I would be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



tempting  fate  to perform a rendition of issues,  ideas  and

suggestions  already repeated many times over to an  audience

who  had  sat stoically here listening to them for  the  last

five  days.   I intend to heed their advice but will  stretch

the edges.  Let me therefore reduce the odds by confining  my

remarks to just one topic: quality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me quickly add a few words on our civil

service.    Although  DPM  Lee  had  spoken  on  the   matter

yesterday,  I decided earlier to say this.  I would  like  to

add my support to the call to our civil servants to implement

policies humanely, giving sympathetic consideration to  those

who  deserve  them.  However, I must add that in my  dealings

with the civil servants the last few years, I have found them

to  be  humane and caring, but also cautious.  They  must  be

careful.  We expect them to be so.  But this should not  stop

them  from  being humane and caring.  I know they  can,  they

have, and should be more so in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I return now to the topic of quality. Here, I wish to

declare  my interest in the topic.  I am the current Chairman

of  the  Singapore Quality Institute, which is an association

for quality professionals and promotes the quality discipline

in Singapore.  Notwithstanding this responsibility, I want to

state  that I am plumbing for quality as I personally believe

in its importance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practically everyone has touched on the topic of

competition  in  the last few days.  Two  men,  chased  by  a

hungry tiger on an open plain, quickly understand the meaning

of  competitive  edge.   Just  outrun  the  other  chap.    A

competitive edge is, thus, simply being able to do  something

better  than  your  competitors.   And  the  longer  you  can

maintain this, the better the competitive edge.  Quality  can

be the basis of a competitive edge for Singapore.  Why does a

person  pay so much for a Mercedes Benz when he can  buy  the

same  capacity car of another make for much less?  The answer

is  quality,  perceived or otherwise.  Dr  Ng  Eng  Hen  also

referred  to Starbucks' order-to-froth-time quality target  a

few days ago.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quality is even more critical when it comes to service

and,  in our economy of the future, the service component  is

slated  to  become  even more important.   Mr  Ong  Kian  Min

eloquently elaborated on the service component yesterday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years ago, Hong Kong had a very poor reputation for

service.    Today,  this  image  has  changed.   What   about

Singapore?   We  have a good reputation for product  quality.

Singapore-made products are respected around the  world.   We

must thank SISIR, then PSB and now known as SPRING Singapore,

for  this happy state of affairs.  On the other hand, I think

we have room, lots of room, for improvement in quality in our

services sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me share with you an example. I think Singaporeans

deserve  better  taxi  services.   While  many  taxi  drivers

provide  good service, many do not.  Sometime ago, travellers

arriving  at Changi Airport had wished that our taxi  drivers

could  be more helpful, such as helping them with their  bags

and  luggage.   I  do  not know if the  situation  there  has

improved,  but I recently saw a lady stopping  a  taxi  along

Holland  Road.  She was struggling to load her  luggage  bags

into the boot of the taxi.  Meanwhile, the taxi driver merely

sat in his taxi, waiting for the work to be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example. A few days ago, I observed a passenger

paying  the taxi driver for the journey.  The driver received

the  payment  and returned the change, all the while  with  a

sullen expression tainted with annoyance and anger.  I  asked

myself, "Why so?  Why was he not happy?  Did he not just  get

paid?   Should he not show some degree of happiness,  if  not

gratitude for the customer, then for himself, especially when

we  are  trying  to  survive the current  difficult  economic

times."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about the taxi driver who drove away with the

belongings of his passengers?  The misdeeds of this one black

sheep brought Singapore world-wide infamy.  In one stroke, as

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a result of his greed and misdeed, he tainted the good name

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Singapore, Singaporeans and his fellow taxi drivers. And

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if we remember that for many tourists and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>



overseas visitors, the taxi drivers are some of the first and

last Singaporeans that they meet, their attitude and services

provided  by  our taxi drivers are, thus, not unimportant  to

the  image  of  Singapore around the world  and  our  tourist

income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another experience of poor quality service that we can

share  is  the  treatment  that we receive  in  some  of  the

restaurants,  shops and stores.  I am sure  each  of  us  has

encountered  instances when there were  many  attendants  and

serving  personnel but could not get one to  help  us.   They

might be looking in our direction but, miraculously, they did

not  see us, even when we stuck up our hands and waved.  When

this happened, we often swore to ourselves that we would  not

go  back to the shop again, ever.  And many customers do just

that.   You  can  put up lots of money into  advertising,  to

decorate up the place and to spruce up the ambience, but  the

poor quality of service provided by the workers will kill the

business, sooner or later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have merely used the above examples to highlight the

need  for  Singaporeans  to adopt a  more  positive  attitude

towards  their work.  The taxi drivers and service  personnel

in  restaurants and shops are not the only people who need to

spruce their services, as each of us has encountered or heard

of  experiences of poor quality service in many other  places

and  trades.   Yesterday, Mr Ong Kian Min also described  his

experiences with some electrical contractors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If every worker in Singapore, citizens or otherwise,

takes pride in his or her work to produce the highest quality

product or service, to perform his or her work with care  and

attention to the best of his or her ability, this will result

in  happy, appreciative and satisfied customers who will  buy

the  product and service, even if the prices may be a  little

higher, return for more and will probably sing praises of the

establishment to others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By now I do not blame you if you were beginning to ask

why  is  it  that  if quality is that great, that  not  every

country is pursuing it.  The truth is that though the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



idea  is  simple,  it is very hard to do.   Quality  concerns

mindset  and  attitude.  A quality nation  is  one  in  which

quality   is   endemic,  systemic  and  permeates  completely

throughout  the  country.  Converting  a  person  is  already

difficult, what more a nation?  But precisely because quality

is  difficult to achieve, it also means that, once  you  have

got it, you get to keep it for a longer time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But does this mean that we have the luxury of time to

develop a quality culture among Singaporeans?  Let me  answer

this  question  by  describing for you a  recent  experience.

Last  month, a friend bought me a gift from a trip to  China.

It was a nice box of biscuits.  The box was fairly large, but

there were only 12 biscuits in it.  Each of the biscuits  was

separately packed with a small packet of drying agent to keep

the  biscuits crisp.  It was a quality product.  I  asked  my

friend  about  the biscuits.  The answers both impressed  and

perturbed   me.    It  was  made  in  China.    So,   Chinese

manufacturers have obviously climbed the quality ladder in  a

few  short years.  What was even more disturbing was the fact

that  the  biscuits were not produced for export but consumed

by  the  local  population.  This suggests that  the  Chinese

people have also changed and acquired a quality attitude.  My

perception fits in with the Chinese experiences of  Mr  Ahmad

Mohd Magad, Mr Matthias Yao, Mr Inderjit Singh and others, as

they  had  described in their speeches during  the  last  few

days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in such a short timeframe the Chinese are able not

only  to  acquire the capital, talent and technology but  are

also  able  to get their people to change their  mindset  and

attitude   to  compete  effectively,  China  is  really   the

formidable and fearsome competitor that it is made out to be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a nation, we started out with the emphasis on

quality in the earlier years.  During the 1980s, we refocused

on productivity.  But in the last few years, we refocused yet

again and, this time, on innovation and creativity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to borrow Assoc. Prof. Chin's advocacy

of  the  importance  of culture and arts itself  to  quality.

Quality,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



productivity,  creativity and innovation are  all  important,

but  each  is  important  in its own  right.   We  have  been

exploring the issue of cost-cutting.  Quality cuts cost in so

many  ways.  Workers, doing the right things and doing things

right,  reduce  repairs  and  reworks.   Reliability  of  the

products and services passes the savings to the parties  down

the  line  as  their  repairs and reworks are  also  reduced.

Satisfied customers return and are retained, reducing further

promotion costs, adding certainty to operation.  We can go on

enumerating its virtues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should, thus, not take quality for granted. We

should  not  merely  subsume quality  under  productivity  or

creativity and innovation.  Not everyone can or needs  to  be

innovative  or creative all the time.  But everyone  can  and

should  deliver quality all the time.  We should see  quality

as  important, to be developed and promoted in its own right.

By  developing a quality culture among Singaporeans, we  will

add  to  the  competitiveness of Singapore to whatever  other

competitive edges that we may develop.



<br>4.02 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  welcome the new MPs to this House.  I feel a deep sense of

responsibility towards them, because I had a hand in  getting

them here.  Some, like Khaw Boon Wan and Vivian Balakrishnan,

I  had personally persuaded to leave the security and comfort

of  their  job  to  take on this onerous  task  of  governing

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new MPs have crossed a major milestone in their

lives.  An 'MPship' is not a career move or a feather in  the

cap.  It is a commitment to serve the people and the country.

This you can do well, only if you feel for the people and the

country,  and  are  prepared to think beyond  yourself,  your

family and your friends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demands on your time and energy will be great, and

the expectations of your performance high, both in Parliament

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>



in  the  constituency.   And you will probably  receive  more

criticisms than bouquets.  It is therefore not a job for  the

thin-skinned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should seek to make a difference to Singapore. You

can  do this by looking after your constituents, helping them

when  they  need  help,  and  forging  social  cohesion.   In

Parliament, speak thoughtfully and honestly, after  you  have

reflected  on the issues and done some research and analysis.

Do  not  just  offer feedback, useful though it is,  or  echo

criticisms  without  thought.   Offer  also  suggestions  for

improving  the lives of Singaporeans, and help to solve  both

big and small problems.



<br><br><i>Expression of views by Party MPs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tan Soo Khoon argued for the Whip to be lifted for all

backbenchers,  and for the Ministers to be allowed  to  speak

freely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not really need to explain the meaning of the Whip

and the Cabinet system of collective leadership to the former

Speaker.   But as there are many new MPs here,  let  me  take

some time to explain.

<br><br><i>Lifting of Whip</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The party Whip is an appointment that can be found in

many  political  parties represented in all legislatures  all

over  the  world,  particularly in countries  that  follow  a

Westminster or British style of Parliamentary democracy, like

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duties of the party Whip vary from party to party,

but  primarily  they involve maintaining the  party's  voting

strength,   by   ensuring  that  members   attend   important

Parliamentary debates and support their party when a division

is  called.  Simply put, the party Whip builds and  maintains

party discipline.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in the interest of the people for political

parties  to be disciplined.  In Parliamentary elections,  the

parties  come first.  Candidates stand for election  under  a

party  logo,  unless  they are independent  candidates.   The

people want to be assured that the MPs they have voted for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>



remain  faithful to the party platform they were elected  on.

A  party  whose  members  are unable to  maintain  reasonable

consensus  on its policy positions will find it difficult  to

instill confidence in it, and get the support of, the voters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, lifting the Whip for most motions, as Tan

Soo Khoon suggests, implies that we should completely let  go

of  party discipline.  This goes against the grain of  party-based  Parliamentary democracy.  We will be lifting the  Whip

on  the  motion on Nominated Members of Parliament.  Already,

we  can see some MPs marshalling others for their cause.   Do

we want to see this for every issue?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how much leeway is given to MPs, and how to do it,

are  the  prerogatives  of  the individual  political  party.

Different  political  parties have different  comfort  levels

when it comes to party discipline.  Some are less tolerant of

public  dissent amongst their members, others more  so.   But

none  will  agree that they can do away with party discipline

completely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, in the spirit of experimentation, we are

willing  to  provide more opportunities for the  Whip  to  be

lifted.    Apart  from  lifting  the  Whip  for  matters   of

conscience  and selected issues, PAP MPs may  request,  on  a

case-by-case basis, for the Whip to be lifted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we are introducing other measures to

enhance  Parliamentary debates.  For example, a more flexible

timeframe will be adopted to allow sufficient time  for  MPs'

views  and inputs to be debated in Parliament, considered  by

the  relevant  Ministries, and incorporated  into  the  draft

legislation.    Also,   to  help  MPs  prepare   better   for

Parliamentary  debates,  we  will  give  them  more  research

resources and staff support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our MPs today assume that the unity and cohesion of the

PAP  will  stay  forever, when they ask for the  Whip  to  be

lifted.  They are too sanguine about the future.  No one  can

tell  what the state of the Party will be like in the future,

or how some MPs will behave once they think that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>



Ministers are beholden to them because they can vote  against

the Ministers freely.



<br><br><i>Collective ministerial responsibility</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soo Khoon also suggested that we should let Ministers

state their individual views freely before the final decision

is taken on a subject.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is being done. Ministers are expected to

contribute  to the debate on a subject before a  decision  is

taken  on  the  matter.  Their inputs are given  in  Cabinet,

before the matter comes to Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not let Ministers speak discordantly outside

Cabinet  because  of the principle of collective  ministerial

responsibility.   This  principle is another  cornerstone  of

Westminster-style Parliamentary democracy.  It is,  in  fact,

enshrined  in Article 24(2) of our Constitution.   There  are

two reasons for this principle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, collective ministerial responsibility enhances

the accountability of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our Parliamentary democracy, whichever party has a

majority  in  Parliament will form the Government.   But  the

Government,  led  by  the  Prime  Minister  and  his  Cabinet

Ministers, is not at liberty to do whatever it wishes.  It is

accountable to Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of collective responsibility means that

there  is  an  agreement between the Prime Minister  and  his

Cabinet  colleagues that they will stand together as  a  team

when accounting for their actions before Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussions within Cabinet are therefore secret. Once a

decision  on  an issue or a policy has been reached,  Cabinet

Ministers  will take the same public position.  It cannot  be

otherwise.   Imagine  for  a moment  that  the  principle  of

collective  responsibility  did  not  exist.   If  a  problem

occurs,  it  is only too tempting for a Cabinet  Minister  to

claim,  "I did not really agree with this policy, so I cannot

be   held   responsible."   This  principle   of   collective

responsibility is therefore to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>



ensure  that  all Cabinet Ministers are held  accountable  to

Parliament for the actions of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, collective ministerial responsibility enhances

inter-ministry co-ordination.  Most of the important problems

we face as a nation are complex and cut across the portfolios

of  individual  Ministers and Ministries.   The  Government's

policies  and initiatives must be evaluated in the  light  of

their effects upon various aspects of our society.  They must

be carefully coordinated to avoid unnecessary duplication or,

worse,  mutual contradiction.  It therefore makes good  sense

for Cabinet Ministers, and indeed, the entire Government,  to

share the same broad policy positions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if the views of Cabinet Ministers sound alike at

times,  we  should  be comforted that they  are  united.   We

should,  in fact, worry if they begin to sound very different

from each other on the same subject, for this would suggest a

divided Cabinet.



<br><br><i>Severe challenges ahead</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the last few days, MPs and the new

MOSs  have  dwelt on many serious challenges  that  Singapore

would  have  to confront in the coming years.   Listening  to

them,  I  am not sure that they realise the full gravity  and

enormity of these challenges.  The challenges they face  will

certainly  be  much tougher than those I faced when  I  first

became  an  MP  in  1976.  The issues  today  are  much  more

complex, and also more threatening.  They will put our  young

MPs and Ministers severely to the test.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eighties through the early nineties, we had the

benefit   of  a  benign  regional  environment.   ASEAN   was

cohesive.   Its economies were booming.  There was  political

and  social stability in our region.  Indonesia was  growing,

and  under  Suharto, well-disposed towards  us.   The  global

economy also expanded rapidly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there were several crises - Vietnam's invasion of

Cambodia in 1979, and the downturn in the global economy that

contributed  to  our 1985 recession.  But on the  whole,  the

external  environment was favourable.   This  allowed  us  to

concentrate  on economic development.  We attracted  MNCs  to

invest  here.   We upgraded the economy from labour-intensive

industries to higher value-added activities.  Later, we built

an  external  wing to our economy.  We rode on  the  region's

rapid growth.  We went to China, India and many other places.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1997 Asian financial crisis brought that happy state

of  affairs to an end.  The crisis did not pull down only the

economy  of  the  regional countries.  It  also  changed  the

political  environment of some countries.  Even  today,  four

years   later,  the  political  situation  in   our   largest

neighbour, Indonesia, has not fully settled into a new  state

of equilibrium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in addition to having to restructure our economy, we

now  have to deal with a more volatile and less accommodating

political environment in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more serious is the security problem we now face - the threat from terrorism and Islamic militancy in the

region.   September  11  and  the  Jemaah  Islamiyah  arrests

exposed   this  grave  and  immediate  threat  to  Singapore.

Singapore was very nearly blown up.  Four tonnes of  ammonium

nitrate, 1.2 tonnes of TNT, and fuses for the explosives, had

already  been  acquired.   The terrorists  were  looking  for

another  17 more tonnes of ammonium nitrate and seven  trucks

and  they are going to pack the 21 tonnes of ammonium nitrate

into  the  seven  trucks and about the same time,  drive  all

these  seven trucks at seven different targets to  blow  them

up.  Can you imagine the devastation this would have cost  to

Singapore and the aftermath?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPs, understandably, concentrated on bread-and-butter

issues,   because  these  are  what  your  constituents   are

concerned with.  But you will also have to inform them of the

larger picture against which the bread-and butter issues will

have to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



solved.   So  let  me  now elaborate  on  some  of  the  more

intractable  larger-picture problems which we will  be  faced

with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang Kai Yuen commented that the Government tended to

understate good news and overstate bleak scenarios.  It is in

the  nature  of  this Government to plan  on  the  worst-case

scenario.  Then, if things do not turn out as bad as  we  had

provided  for, we can all sigh with relief.  But if  they  do

turn real bad, then we would have been prepared with possible

responses.  This characteristic of the Government has enabled

Singapore to survive many crises.

<br><br><i>Islamic militancy</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Halimah Yacob said that Malay-Muslims in Singapore had

turned  to religion to counter the threat that their  culture

and values might be eroded in the face of the global cultural

onslaught.   She added that becoming more religious  did  not

mean  that  Malay  Singaporeans were  choosing  to  disengage

themselves from society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand her position. But if this was the only

reason  for  Malay-Muslims in Singapore to turn to  religion,

and  Halimah is right about Muslims not disengaging from  the

other  communities, then I would not worry about  the  trend.

There is really nothing wrong with Singaporeans wanting to be

more  religious,  so long as they regard  their  religion  as

something personal between themselves and their God, and they

interact freely with people of other races and religions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increased religiosity of our Muslims is part of the

global Islamic wave that emanated from the Middle East  after

the  1973  oil crisis, when the countries there were  flushed

with cash,  and the 1979 Iranian Revolution.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met the Prime Minister of Mauritius last month when he

stopped  over  in Singapore on his way to Australia  for  the

Commonwealth  Heads of Government Meeting.  He told  me  that

the  Muslims in his country had become more conservative, and

that  many  Muslim  women had taken to  wearing  headscarves.

Mauritius is far away from the Middle East and some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



distance  from  Africa, and yet in that island country,  they

too  have  been affected by this wave of Islamic  resurgence.

He lamented that their Muslims were not mixing as freely with

the  non-Muslims as they did in the seventies.  In Mauritius,

52% of the population are Hindus, and 17% Muslims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same Commonwealth meeting, the Foreign Minister

of  Sierra Leone told me that the same thing was happening to

his   country's   Muslims.   They  have  also   become   more

conservative.  60% of Sierra Leone's population are Muslims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, other Muslim societies which have

not  gone  down the path of conservatism.  I met  a  Moroccan

Minister on Wednesday.  He was surprised that so many  Muslim

women in Malaysia and Singapore wear the tudung.  He told  me

that  the  women  in his country did not wear  the  religious

headscarf.   He invited me to visit his country  to  see  how

Moroccan  Muslims  practise  their  faith.   He  added   that

Tunisia,  another Muslim country, is even more liberal,  but,

no, not Algeria.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Singaporeans who are more religious remain engaged

with mainstream secular society, there is no problem.  But if

they opt out, this could fracture our social cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am even more concerned about, however, is

religious activism and extremism, or people using religion to

advance  their  own agenda.  Take Ibrahim Maidin,  the  local

Jemaah  Islamiyah leader, as an example.  He taught Halimah's

children  religious  studies.  He wrote to  Halimah  when  he

heard that she was standing for election.  He urged her  that

as  a Muslim, she should not do so.  He argued that as an  MP

in  a  secular political party, she might be associated  with

laws  and  policies  which were not in  accordance  with  the

Syariah.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It spoke well of Halimah that she did not listen to him.

Otherwise, she would not be here today, and would not be able

to contribute to her community as well as to Singapore.  This

would have been a loss



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



both to the Muslim and non-Muslim communities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Malay leader told me a similar story of

extremism.  A religious teacher had advised his students  not

to mix with non-Muslims as they were non-believers.  When one

of the students told her parents of this, they pulled her out

of  the class immediately.  But what about the other students

remaining  in  the  class?  Should it not  be  the  religious

teacher  who  should be pulled out of the class instead?   At

the  very  least, he should be advised to refrain  from  such

teachings.  Such extremism is a cause for concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extremism comes at the expense of inter-racial and inter-religious interaction. It excludes rather than includes. It

results  in the withdrawal of the practitioner into  his  own

communal  cocoon, and in the rejection of others who  do  not

share  his beliefs.  When that happens, the other communities

will  not  only keep their distance, but will also press  for

more  space  of  their  own.  This can break  up  our  social

structure and social cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extremism is even more dangerous when the extremists

campaign  and compel others to follow their view in the  name

of  religion.  Zainul Abidin Rasheed should be supported when

he  asked  moderate  Muslims to stand up against  extremists.

Moderate Muslims should not allow the extremists to  set  the

agenda for them.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not only us who are concerned about the rise of

Islamic  extremism.  Earlier this year, leaders  of  the  two

largest  Muslim organisations in Indonesia met in Jakarta  to

discuss  the problems facing the country.  After the meeting,

the  Nahdlatul Ulama chairman, Hasyim Muzadi,  told  a  press

conference  that the image of Islam had been  politicised  by

certain groups for their vested interests.  He stressed  that

such  radicalism  was not the Islamic way of  thinking.   His

counterpart in Muhammadiyah, Syafii Maarif, said that if  the

authorities  were afraid to take stern measures  against  the

radicals, that





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>





would pave the way for the birth of another Taliban nation.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Malaysia too, moderate Muslims - "the silent

majority" - are being urged to speak up, to balance extremist

views  on  Islam.  The Executive Director of Sisters-in-Islam

recently called on middle-class Malaysian Muslims, especially

those who had  been quiet so far, to voice out their moderate

views,  instead  of allowing the radicals and  extremists  to

dominate.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My worry is that some extremist groups will exploit the

growing Islamic consciousness in Singapore and in the region,

to  advance  their religious or political objectives  through

radical means, some of which can be violent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kumpulan Mujahideen Malaysia is a radical group. It

envisages the creation of a Daulah Islamiyah Nusantara, a pan-regional  Islamic state, comprising Malaysia,  Indonesia  and

southern Philippines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian-led Jemaah Islamiyah group has added

another   country  or  part  of  it,  Thailand,  to  Kumpulan

Mujahideen  Malaysia's pan-regional Islamic  state.   It  has

talked  about  forming an Islamic state  comprising  southern

Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and southern Philippines.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ibrahim Maidin, the Singapore leader of Jemaah

Islamiyah,  went one step further.  He told  an  ISD  officer

that  he  was  convinced  that  sooner  or  later,  Malaysia,

Indonesia, and Mindanao in the Philippines, would come  under

Syariah law and become a Daulah Islamiyah, or Islamic  state.

He   continued  that  when  that  happened,  Singapore  would

inevitably also become Islamic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other militant groups in the region have objectives

which  are  more  national in nature, but they  are  no  less

worrisome.  Malaysia's Al-Ma'unah wants to set up an  Islamic

state  in  Malaysia.  Laskar Jihad and the Islamic  Defenders

Front want an Islamic state in Indonesia.  Abu Sayyaf and the

Moro  Islamic  Liberation Front want to form  an  independent

Muslim state in the Muslim enclave of Mindanao in southern



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



Philippines,  while  Barisan Revolusi  Nasional  and  Gerakan

Mujahiddin Islam Pattani want to do so in southern Thailand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these militant groups have objectives that are

domestically  driven, some of them already  have  operational

links  with  one  another  as well  as  with  Al-Qaeda.   For

example, both Kumpulan Mujahideen Malaysia and the Indonesian

Mujahidin Council subscribe to the goal of uniting the global

Islamic community, which is what Al-Qaeda advocates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not bogeyman tales to frighten children. Nor

have  we  exaggerated the extent of the  problem.   There  is

overwhelming evidence to suggest that the militant groups  in

our region have extensive and well-developed networks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Jemaah Islamiyah is part of a much larger

regional terrorist network spanning Indonesia, Malaysia,  and

the  Philippines.   Singapore Jemaah Islamiyah  members  have

identified  Abu Bakar Baasyir and Abu Jibril as  among  those

responsible  for  the  establishment  and  operation  of  the

Singapore  Jemaah Islamiyah.  Abu Jibril has been  implicated

in  crimes  committed  by the Kumpulan  Mujahideen  Malaysia,

while  Abu  Bakar  Baasyir and another  Indonesian  Mujahidin

Council  leader, Hambali, are said to be behind the  movement

to  establish an Islamic state comprising Indonesia, Malaysia

and southern Philippines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six of the 13 Jemaah Islamiyah members being held in

Singapore  had links with the Moro Islamic Liberation  Front,

while the two who were arrested and then released had visited

Moro Islamic Liberation Front camps in the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jemaah Islamiyah may also have Thai connections. In

January  this year, a Singaporean Jemaah Islamiyah  fugitive,

who is still on the run, Mas Selamat Kastari, and four others

were  believed  to  have  fled  to  Thailand.   Kastari   was

suspected   to  be  planning  to  hijack  an  aircraft   from

Indonesia,  Malaysia or Thailand, and crash  it  into  Changi

Airport.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see, it is not just Al-Qaeda we are concerned

with.   It is Islamic radicalism and militancy in our region.

The  Al-Qaeda terrorists are primarily against the Americans.

Their  targets  are  Americans.  The radical  groups  in  our

region  have  a  different regional  agenda.   The  two  have

combined forces.



<br><br><i>Relations with Malaysia</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several MPs have spoken on our relations with Malaysia.

Yeo   Guat  Kwang  said  that  one  union  leader  could  not

understand why the Malaysians were so angry with Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent months, hardly a week went by without the

Malaysian  media playing up one bilateral issue  or  another:

water,  `tudung', land reclamation, and even Vivian's playful

remark  about "wild animals".  Now it is Ravindran's turn  to

fall victim.  Tomorrow will be Ong Ah Heng's.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked some young Singaporeans what they thought of all

these  attacks on Singapore.  They said that they were immune

to  them.   In  other  words, there  is  no  effect  on  them

whatsoever.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unfortunately, when the Malaysian media carries

factually  incorrect  or one-sided reports,  or  inflammatory

comments, they also stoke the flames of the Malaysian people.

They  sour  relations at the people level.  Guat  Kwang  said

that his union leader friend was worried about travelling  to

Malaysia.  I know of others who had cancelled their plans  to

spend the recent school holidays in Malaysia.



<br><br><i>Land Reclamation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take land reclamation as an example of flame-stoking.

There  have  been so many allegations on so many fronts,  and

also  many  inconsistencies and inaccuracies in  their  media

reports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to delve into detail on this issue, as Mah

Bow Tan has already done so.  But I do wish to point out that

our  land reclamation policy is not new or secret.  Singapore

is a small country.  We reclaim land because we need land and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



for  no other reason.  We have been doing so since the 1960s.

In  1991,  a  set of comprehensive land-use plans,  including

those  pertaining to long-term reclamation, was  approved  by

the  Government  and  put on public  record.   This  was  the

Concept  Plan  of 1991, which was recently reviewed,  updated

and  re-issued  as  Concept Plan 2001.  This  is  a  publicly

available document.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do take Malaysia's concerns seriously. This is why

DPM  Lee  Hsien Loong told the Malaysian leaders  during  his

visit  to  KL,  that  if  Malaysia  had  concerns  about  our

reclamation  works,  it could put them down  in  a  note  and

Singapore would study them.

<br><br><i>Water</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water is another complicated issue between our two

countries.  In fact, it has been a constant source of tension

since our independence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture that has been recently painted in the

Malaysian  media  is  one of an arrogant,  selfish  Singapore

profiteering from our purchase of raw water from  Johor.   As

in  the  land  reclamation issue, this picture is  skewed  to

arouse feelings and resentment against Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example. We have been accused by a

Malaysian  newspaper  of  raking in  huge  profits  of  RM600

million annually, by selling the water we get from Johor at 3

sen per thousand gallons, to ships which call at Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water sold to ships calling at our ports does attract

high  tariffs,  but this is only because we do  not  want  to

encourage this kind of demand.  We sell only a small quantity

of  water to ships, about 1 million gallons per day, which is

less  than 1% of Singapore's total water demand.  The revenue

Singapore  gets  from this sale, I wish, was near  the  RM600

million figure, but it is not.  Last year, Singapore's  gross

revenue  from our sale of water to ships totalled about  RM40

million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key unhappiness, however, is in the current price of

3 sen that we are paying for raw water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the deal on the bilateral package, which we

are  still negotiating, we had offered to increase this 3 sen

for  raw water that was agreed between Singapore and Malaysia

in  the 1961 and 1962 Water Agreements.  In addition, we  had

been  prepared  to  vary  the Points of  Agreement  (POA)  on

Malayan Railway Land, and offer Malaysia additional plots  of

land for joint development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these concessions that Singapore had offered under

the  bilateral  package  must  be  taken  into  account  when

considering the price Singapore is willing to pay  for  water

under a new agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for Singapore, this issue goes beyond money. The

1961  and  1962 Water Agreements are international  treaties,

legally   binding  on  Singapore  and  Malaysia.   They   are

guaranteed   by  both  governments  in  the  1965  Separation

Agreement and cannot be varied except as provided for  within

the  Agreements, or by mutual consent.  But we were  prepared

to consider an increase in the price of existing water within

the  bilateral package and as a gesture of goodwill  to  help

conclude a deal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bring up this point because at the height of the

furore  over  water, certain comments by the Malaysian  media

troubled  us.   They seemed to suggest that  Malaysia  should

unilaterally   amend   the  terms  of  the   existing   Water

Agreements, if resolution could not be reached on a new price

for  existing  water.   For  example,  a  New  Straits  Times

editorial of 30th January commented:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By (Singapore) suggesting that these (water) agreements

continue  to  apply  by  default  because  the  Johor   state

government  failed to re-negotiate the price structure  after

25 years in 1986 and 1987, it is simply playing hard to get."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same editorial suggested that the issue of water be

viewed as a business transaction - agree to a price, seal the

deal,  or  part with no hard feelings and look elsewhere  for

water.  In other words, if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  does not agree to Malaysia's price for  water,  we

would have to look elsewhere for water because Malaysia would

stop its supply to us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not so simple. Both sides can walk away from

the  negotiations on a new water agreement if we cannot reach

an  agreement.   However,  both  sides  have  to  honour  the

existing  1961  and 1962 Water Agreements.   As  I  mentioned

earlier,  these two agreements were confirmed and  guaranteed

by  both  governments in the 1965 Separation Agreement,  also

known as the Independence of Singapore Agreement.  Any breach

of  the  Water  Agreements would also call into question  the

Separation Agreement, and undermine our very existence.  This

is totally unacceptable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is high time we explored a different approach

to  water  supply from Malaysia.  I do not want our relations

with Malaysia to be always strained by this issue.  It is not

healthy for our two countries to be always locked in dispute.

It  is  unwise  to  allow this one issue  to  sour  bilateral

relations  at all levels and on all fronts.  It  prevents  us

from co-operating in strategic areas of mutual benefit.   The

long-term  interests  of our two countries  might  be  better

served  if we can remove this constant thorn in our bilateral

relations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sensitivity of this water issue goes back to the

Separation.   On  9th  August  1965,  the  very  day  of  our

independence,  Tunku  Abdul  Rahman  told  the  British  High

Commissioner in Malaya:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If Singapore's foreign policy is prejudicial to

Malaysia's interests, we could always bring pressure to  bear

on them by threatening to turn off the water in Johor."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time has not changed this perception that water is to be

used as a leverage against Singapore.  In an article entitled

"Water  as a Factor in International Relations" published  in

the  November  2000  issue  of Strategi,  a  journal  of  the

Malaysia Armed Forces College, a Lt-Col Azmy Yahya wrote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Malaysia should take full advantage of water as a

strategic  weapon  to counter Singapore's military  advantage

over Malaysia."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noting that "without water, Singapore may not survive",

Azmy  said  that apart from the ability to disrupt the  water

supply  to  Singapore, Malaysia also had  the  capability  to

pollute   the  supply  with  either  chemical  or  biological

weapons.   He  argued that Malaysia had the right  to  defend

itself through all means.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, though, there are others with a more

realistic  sense of the situation.  Lt-Gen Zaini  Mohd  Said,

the former Malaysian Army Field Commander, wrote a commentary

in   Mingguan  Malaysia  just  two  months  ago  when   media

criticisms  against  us on water were at  their  zenith.   He

pointed  out that water was a security issue that could  lead

to armed conflict.  He reminded Malaysians that the Singapore

military  was stronger and more sophisticated.  And  although

Malaysia  had  its own means of responding,  Zaini  concluded

that both sides would be losers if it came to armed conflict.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not healthy to always have a Damocles' sword

hanging  over  our heads.  It breeds mistrust and  suspicion,

and  does not make for a productive relationship.  It may  be

better  for bilateral relations if we start to move a  little

away from our reliance on Malaysia for water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is doable if we have to do it. We have already

called a tender for a 30mgd desalination plant.  We have been

operating a plant to produce NEWater (reclaimed water)  using

membrane  technology for two years now.   And  we  intend  to

build   more  such  NEWater  plants.   The  cost   of   these

alternative  sources  of water is not  all  that  prohibitive

either.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to have good, stable relations with Malaysia for

the long term and for mutual benefit.  We shall play our part

to achieve this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia has written to us with their latest proposal on

the bilateral package.  We shall send them our reply, stating

our position, some time next week.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do not want to leave Singaporeans with the

impression  that  if  we  remove this  issue  of  water  from

bilateral relations, or if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



we  manage to wrap up the bilateral package, then there  will

be  no  more disputes between Singapore and Malaysia forever.

There will always be the occasional squabble, because we  are

geographically  close.  Even more so, given  our  shared  and

broken history together,

and the different ways in which our societies are organised.



<br><br><i>Co-operation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must therefore view the inevitable ups and

downs  in our relationship with Malaysia with a certain  calm

and  balance.   We should not be complacent  when  things  go

well.   Neither should we get excited when things turn  sour.

We  need  patience, stamina and a long-term  view.   We  will

stand  firm on fundamentals, but must be broad-minded  enough

to  accommodate Malaysia's interests where our  own  national

interests are not diminished.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not give up the prospect of achieving a win-win

relationship  with Malaysia.  We can and we  must  co-operate

with each other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our two economies are strongly inter-dependent.

Malaysia  was Singapore's top trading partner last year.   We

were  Malaysia's second largest export destination and  third

largest import source.  Singapore was also Malaysia's  fourth

largest  foreign investor in terms of total value of approved

projects.   So, co-operation would bring us greater  benefit,

certainly more than being at each other's throat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that there would be no competition

between us.  Rivalry between our two countries will always be

strong.  In some instances, we will be fighting for the  same

piece of cake.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But generally, I believe that the economic pie is

growing and is big enough for the two of us.  Neither country

would   do  well  without  the  other.   It  is  a  symbiotic

relationship which we have not fully exploited.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The late President Yusof Ishak told the inaugural

session of our Parliament on 8th December 1965:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our survival as a people, distinct and separate from

our  neighbours in Southeast Asia, depends upon our  patience

and  resolution in dealing with physically bigger  and  hence

difficult  neighbours, and upon our perseverance  in  seeking

long-term  solutions of finding a new balance  of  forces  in

this part of the world."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is still good advice.



<br><br><i>Declining Fertility</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indranee Rajah said that the Government needed to look

into  the  problem of housing for singles.  I would say  that

the  more pressing challenge that we have to look into is the

rising  number  of singles.  Since we first  highlighted  the

problem some years back, it has become more acute.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singlehood rate for resident males aged 40-44 rose

from  11.6 per hundred in 1995, to 15.0 per hundred in  2001.

That  is for males.  The singlehood rate for resident females

in  the  same  age group increased from 12.5 per hundred,  to

14.0  per hundred.  For males, most of the singles were those

with  secondary and below education, whereas graduate females

continued to be the biggest "single" group across all ages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This inability or unwillingness on the part of

Singaporeans to get hitched, is seriously contributing to our

falling  fertility problem.  So two years ago, the Government

put  in place a package of marriage and procreation measures.

We  introduced  the Baby Bonus, Third Child Maternity  Leave,

more  and  better  childcare  centres,  family-friendly  work

practices, easier home ownership, public education  and  more

opportunities for singles to socialise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But more than nine months after we started giving out

the  Baby  Bonus in April last year, I have not received  any

bonus myself!  I do not mean the Baby Bonus.  I mean that the

response to the package of measures has not been encouraging,

and  the fertility rates have continued to fall.  I hope that

this was because the economy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



took  a  downturn just as the measures were being introduced.

I  am  told that couples are likely to delay or even  abandon

plans for children in times of economic uncertainty.  We  saw

that  phenomenon in the previous two recessions in  1986  and

1998.   So, maybe, the response will be better as the economy

improves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am not too hopeful. It will pick up somewhat, but

the  reason  for  declining  marriages  and  births  is  more

fundamental.   We  are  experiencing  a  change  in  attitude

towards   marriage  and  family  among  the  young.   Surveys

continue  to show that our young place financial  and  career

goals ahead of family formation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) for 2001 hit a historic

low,  the  lowest on record, of 1.42 children per woman,  way

below  the  replacement rate of 2.1.  The number of  resident

births  in  2001 was about 40,000, a decline  of  12.5%  over

2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This decline in our marriage and procreation rates is

clearly a national problem.  The implications are grave.   We

cannot  let nature take its course, even though low fertility

is  common among developed countries.  We need to act, as the

implications  of a continued sub-replacement TFR  are  severe

for  a  small country like ours.  We might not survive  as  a

nation because of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is committed to creating a total social

environment conducive to marriage and family formation.   The

Working  Committee  on  Marriage  and  Procreation  will   be

considering  new measures.  However, there is  only  so  much

that  the Government can do.  Ultimately, marrying and having

children are personal decisions.  It is up to Singaporeans to

take advantage of the support provided by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am heartened by the fact that numerous studies over

the  years  show  that  most among our young  desire  to  get

married  and have children.  The majority say that the  ideal

number of children is three.  But the figures show that  many

are only having two or less.  Our focus



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



should,  therefore,  be  on them.   Besides  the  Government,

parents,  friends,  relatives,  colleagues,  employers,   and

community and religious organisations can and must do more to

bring  about  the  total  social  environment  conducive   to

marriage and having children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going back to Indranee's request to look into the

housing  needs of singles, yes, singles are an integral  part

of  a  family.   The  needs of young  couples,  however,  are

comparatively more immediate and necessary as they  need  new

flats to start their family.  Singles will be helped in their

housing,  but  the priority will be for couples  and  family.

And  to  the pragmatic Singaporeans who have postponed  their

marriage  plans, I advise them to act fast.   The  timing  is

good now to get a choice flat to start a family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has tried many ways and means to make it

easier  for  couples to have a family.  Any MP who  comes  up

with  an  ingenious and a better solution to help our singles

get  married and our TFR increased, will get a bonus from me.

Not the Baby Bonus, but a real bonus.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have listened to and read carefully

the speeches of the MPs.  I have instructed the Ministers  to

follow  up  on  their  concerns and  ideas.   I  myself  have

addressed  this  House  on  three  critical  challenges   for

Singapore.   These  are  challenges for  which  there  is  no

obvious solution.  I wanted to inject a sense of reality into

this week's debate.  The world is a complex place, and often,

there  are  no black or white answers.  This then requires  a

hard  choice to be made among a range of solutions,  most  of

which  are  neither painless nor cost-free.   This  is  where

leadership comes in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang Kai Yuen is right. The people want the Government

to  lead.  They want the Government to listen to feedback and

to consult them too.  But at the end of the day, they want  a

strong  Government that will find solutions to their problems

and give them hope for the future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, several other MPs, including Tan Soo Khoon,

feel  that  Singaporeans are cynical and sceptical about  the

Government.   I do not agree.  Cynicism and scepticism  arise

when the Government does not do what it says.  But this is  a

Government  that  does  exactly what  it  says.   We  have  a

reputation  for  being  legalistic,  clinical  and   precise,

meaning  also that we take very seriously our every word  and

commitment.   We  invest a great deal of effort  into  policy

announcements, to make sure that they are correct, because we

will  abide by our every undertaking.  Singaporeans know that

when  we  state a policy, we will carry it through.  When  we

consult  the  people for their feedback, we take their  views

seriously.   It  is practically not possible, of  course,  to

acknowledge  individually  every  contribution.   Nor  is  it

possible to accept every suggestion.  But that does not  mean

that we are merely going through the motions.  The views that

are  expressed influence our thinking and attitude,  even  if

some do not get translated into specific actions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politicians in Singapore have high standing with the

people,  unlike politicians in many other countries.   We  do

not  shoot off our mouths, making wild promises and  baseless

accusations.   Every  line we take is a carefully  considered

and  deliberated policy.  For this reason, we do not like  to

be  referred to ourselves as "politicians" because this  word

"politicians"  has  acquired a negative connotation  in  many

countries.  We prefer the term "political leaders".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, a handful of Singaporeans are cynical and

sceptical.   But  we should not generalise the  attitudes  of

these   few  Singaporeans  to  the  rest  of  the  3  million

Singaporeans!  Indeed, if the large majority of  Singaporeans

were cynical and sceptical of the Government, they would  not

have  returned the PAP to power again and again in 10 General

Elections after 1959.

<div align="center"><h4>PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Debate on the Address)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. As I

said,  we  had won elections again and again.  Also,  in  the

last  General  Election, in the contested seats,  the  voters

gave  us  75 per cent of the vote.  Why?  Because  they  knew

that Singapore faced several severe challenges - the economic

recession,  the  terrorist threat  and  a  less  than  benign

regional  environment.   And  the  voters  believed  in   our

leadership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we must not disappoint them. We must lead. Look for

new  solutions  to old problems.  Anticipate future  problems

and head them off.  Explain issues in simple, clear terms  to

the people and mobilise them behind the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running a Government is like conducting an orchestra.

Every PAP MP is a member of this orchestra.  Each MP has  his

own musical instrument.  And there are many different musical

instruments, eg, the piano, violin, cello, oboe, bass,  drum,

flute and so on, each providing a different sound.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they must produce beautiful music together. If we

perform well, at the end of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>



each  electoral term, the voters will ask for an encore.   If

not, the orchestra will not be invited back to perform.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this mean that the MPs must make similar speeches

since we are members of the same Party?  No.  Each speech  is

like  a  different instrument, with its different  sound  and

effect.  But, taken together, all the speeches you have  made

and  you  will  make,  must  sound like  a  grand  orchestral

performance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do not understand this, and you sing Jail House

Rock  with  your  electric  guitar when  others  are  playing

Beethoven,  you are out of order.  The Whip must be  used  on

you.   This does not mean that you cannot gyrate to the music

of  Elvis Presley, but do it at an appropriate occasion, like

at the end of Budget Debate party.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This orchestra analogy has relevance also to Singapore

Inc,  or to the whole of Singapore.  In this case, the entire

nation  is  the orchestra.  The Government is the  conductor,

and the people are the musicians.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As musicians, Singaporeans can play any instrument they

like, which means they should feel free to speak up and offer

their  views  and suggestions, even if they are  contrary  to

Government policy.  But do remember, whatever you do or  say,

at  the end of the day, we must perform well enough as a team

to  deliver economic growth, social harmony, quality of life,

and security for ourselves and our children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be many challenges for which there is no

final  solution  where we can declare, "case closed".   There

are many problems which will remain with us for many years to

come.   And new challenges and problems will arise.  We  will

simply  have  to persevere, constantly try creative  and  new

approaches, and manage problems to the best of our ability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that we can get on top of these difficult

challenges.    We  have  recruited  good  people   into   the

Government.  Ng Eng Hen, Khaw Boon Wan and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>



the  new  crop of MPs give me hope, that there are more  able

and committed Singaporeans out there who are willing to leave

the  comfort of the public gallery and the operating theatre,

to serve the nation.  We just have to find them and give them

the  reasons  to step forward, whether it is to  advance  the

Singapore Cause or to achieve their Singapore Dream.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This - persuading Singaporeans that they should step

forward  to  serve the nation - is itself a major  challenge.

As  Khaw  Boon  Wan put it, the dream of younger Singaporeans

nowadays is the Global Dream.  They are well-educated,  well-read  and well-travelled.  They are mobile.  They can fit  as

well  into New York, as they can in Singapore.  They will  be

pulled by where the opportunities beckon.  What can we do  to

keep  their hearts here so that, even if they leave to pursue

their Global Dream, they will return one day to Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can achieve these two goals - secure a constant

flow   of   good  people  into  the  Government  and   anchor

Singaporeans  firmly  to  Singapore -  then,  Singapore  will

endure and prosper.  [Applause.]

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, do you want to wrap up

the debate?



<br>5.05 pm



<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

wrapping  up  after  the  Prime  Minister  has  spoken  is  a

challenging  task  but one which I will endeavour  to  do  my

best.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to begin by thanking all 61 hon.

Members who have risen in support of the Motion of Thanks  to

the  President.   Over  the past five  days,  we  have  heard

statements of harsh realities, treated to excellent  displays

of  wit  and  humour, and even a little  poetry.   There  is,

however, strong evidence of a common will and spirit  in  all

that Members have said.  I am also happy to note that all new

Members have participated and clearly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>



demonstrated their ability to add significantly to the  depth

and breadth of parliamentary debate.  The House can therefore

be  expected to witness similarly lively debates  for  future

sittings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this whole debate has to do with change in response

to  all  the challenges: what has brought about the  numerous

changes  to our economic conditions, our social ties,  values

and  the  political landscape, how do we cope with change  at

the  country and individual level, how we can exploit  change

using our strengths, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now my humble duty to highlight the common threads

that run through this debate, in the context of change, along

the following themes: competition, human capital, adaptation,

narrower divides, globalisation of terrorism, and engagement.

<br><br><i>Competition</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Members have eloquently dwelt on the onslaught

of  competition.   Increasing  competition,  especially  from

technological  advances, will lead to shorter  product  life-cycles  and,  therefore, innovation and creativity  are  all-important.    Competition   is   ruthless   and   does    not

discriminate.   Therefore, survival means  that  we  need  to

constantly offer a point of differentiation.  It is no longer

enough to be simply more effective and efficient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also an acute awareness of the need and a

sense  of urgency for Singapore to remain competitive.   Many

Members have urged the Government to review the cost of doing

business  in  Singapore.   Competition  also  comes  in   the

juggernaut of China, how with its ample resources and massive

domestic   market,   it  is  already   competing   for   FDIs

aggressively.

<br><br><i>Human Capital</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nothing strikes a more common chord than the

recognition that people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



are  our most precious resource.  And many Members have  made

calls  to  the  Government to do all it can to  maximise  the

potential   of   all,  including  women,  by  ensuring   that

opportunities  for education and multiple  role  playing  are

available.  Sustaining a competitive edge is all about having

a  relevant and nimble workforce, one that can bounce back in

adversity.   There  is  no doubt that the  current  spate  of

retrenchments will come increasingly from restructuring  than

a pure downturn in demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we recognise that retrenchment can occasionally be

opportunistic,  in  the name of creating  shareholder  value,

that  it afflicts all across-the-board and is not limited  to

lower-skilled  workers.  There is, therefore, also  no  doubt

that  some jobs will never return, and Singaporeans who  used

to hold these jobs will simply have to be reskilled for other

employment.   Otherwise, structural unemployment,  especially

of  the  older workers, will be hard at the personal,  family

and community levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can build on our strengths. We have a highly

skilled   workforce,  well-regarded  for  quality  work   and

diligence, and a very strong Singapore brand.  We  also  have

solid  tripartite relations which we should leverage  on,  to

help   ease   transition  in  career   switches   and,   more

importantly, to continue to present a difference  to  foreign

investors.



<br><br><i>Adaptation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change is also all about adaptation, in a pro-active and

not  reactive manner.  Many Members have called for a mindset

change  in  the  way we maintain our relevance  as  employees

whilst recognising that insecurity will be hard to shake  off - in  the  way we view success and failure in society, even  in

schools;  in  the way the civil service can be  flexible  and

effectively  facilitate  growth in the  private  sector.   As

employees, we now have to accept that contract work could  be

a  dominant feature, and the norm will be that we go  through

several jobs in our lifetime or be economic gypsies,  as  one

Member has put it.  Loyalties and predictable wage

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>

growth  would be replaced by rewards according to the  degree

of innovation, creativity and risk-assumption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a people, we have to be psychologically prepared

for strategic changes that we would have to make: changes  in

the  tax structure, the composition of wages, as well as  the

CPF scheme.  We would also have to rethink and review how  we

use  our  CPF as we address the aging population  and  rising

singlehood trends.



<br><br><i>Narrower Divides</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, on narrower divides. As a people, we should

strive  towards narrower divides, ie, help bridge the  wealth

and  digital  divides that would otherwise  characterise  our

modern  world.   And this, we should achieve  through  closer

community  bonding and mutual responsibility.  We would  have

to  be  watchful  of  external stresses  on  our  racial  and

religious  harmony and move towards greater  integration  and

understanding.  We would also have to continue  to  build  on

the  principle  of meritocracy and equality of treatment  and

opportunity.



<br><br><i>Globalisation of Terrorism</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the globalisation of

terrorism, which the Prime Minister has already dwelt  on  at

length.   Globalisation  has made  the  world  seem  smaller.

Technology  transfer can be had in the twinkling of  an  eye.

But  terrorism has also globalised along the way.  The  "911"

attacks  and  similar events in the region have  demonstrated

how   the   economic  consequences  can  be  so   widespread.

Experiencing  terrorism right at our  doorsteps  and  in  the

region underscores the importance of national defence  and  a

need  for  vigilance.   We must guard  against  the  negative

effects of extremist tendencies.



<br><br><i>Engagement</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last but not least, change is all about engagement.

Many   Members  have  implored  the  Government   to   engage

Singaporeans with greater intensity at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



all  levels and regardless of gender, race, age, religion  or

physical  ability.    No single group of Singaporeans  should

feel alienated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe it is worth belabouring the need to

engage  especially  the  young, to increase  their  sense  of

belonging  to  Singapore, to enable them to contribute  their

all   to  the  future  of  Singapore,  including,  hopefully,

procreating   enough.   This  should   rank   high   on   the

Government's  agenda.  Engagement must be  genuine;  feedback

and participation must be seen to play a constructive role so

as  to  address  any  lingering scepticism.   Engagement  is,

therefore, vital to strengthening the sense of ownership  of,

and belonging to, Singapore.  In turn, it will strengthen our

sense of ownership and belonging to one another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a nation, our sovereignty is absolute, and one shared

by all Singaporeans.  It shall also be the basis for which we

relate to our neighbours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now just make some concluding remarks. We have

the  certainty of change and uncertainty from change.  Change

will  not wait to happen.  If unexpected, change will be very

uncomfortable.  But change can be anticipated  to  a  certain

extent.  And we have just heard from the Government,  by  the

Prime  Minister  himself,  that the Government  will  provide

strong  leadership and assurance that it will do  just  that:

anticipate   change,  do  long-term  strategic  planning   to

anticipate the shifts and leverage on our strengths, see  how

we can prepare our people to meet the new challenges, explain

the need for change, and invest in the necessary physical and

social  infrastructure, so as to enable every Singaporean  to

contribute  in  his  own  way.  Our individual  response  is,

therefore, critical as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, the ultimate challenge will be the uniting of

both  the Government and people in purpose and in undertaking

the necessary changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It leaves me now to thank all Members once again for

their support, and I would like to invite all Members to join

me in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the following Address in reply to the Speech of the

President be agreed to:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1989, the Singapore Constitution has provided for

the  appointment  of Nominated Members of Parliament  (NMPs).

However,  before  they can be appointed, Parliament  must  so

resolve  to have them at the beginning of each session  of  a

new Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why I am back here the third time moving this

motion  at the beginning of the Tenth Parliament.   The  last

two  occasions when I moved a similar motion were on 29th May

1992 and 5th June 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since the implementation of the NMP

scheme  in  1990,  Parliament has granted 26 individuals  the

privilege  to  take part in the proceedings  in  this  House.

While not all of them made the same level of contribution  to

the  debates in this Chamber, they have, generally, acquitted

themselves well, with some serving two terms of four years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, we have also increased the number of

NMPs  from  two  to six, and then to nine, and  improved  the

selection  process  by  having proposal  panels  to  nominate

representatives of functional groups as NMPs.  So,  in  1997,

apart from inviting the general public to submit the names of

suitable persons, the Special Select Committee on NMPs  wrote

to  organisations representing three major functional groups:

(a)   business  and  industry;  (b)   labour;  and  (c)   the

professions  - to propose candidates for this Special  Select

Committee's consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a sitting on 5th June 1997, when we debated the

motion on having NMPs at the start of the Ninth Parliament, I

also said that the Government would con-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



sider  further  improving  the  NMP  selection  process,   by

expanding  the number of functional groups invited to  submit

nominations.  Thus, for this Tenth Parliament, the Government

would  like  the Special Select Committee to also  invite  an

additional three functional groups: (a) social and  community

service     organisations;    (b)     tertiary    educational

institutions;  and  (c)  media,  the  arts  and  the   sports

organisations  - to submit nominations.  The  Special  Select

Committee  will nominate a coordinator among the  constituent

organisations  of  each functional group.  Each  coordinating

organisation  will  then consult its constituent/constituents

and  eventually submit up to two names of two individuals  to

the Special Select Committee for consideration and interview.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government hopes that the outcome of doubling

to  six  the  number  of functional groups  involved  in  the

selection process will be an even wider cross section of NMPs

entering   Parliament,   whose   diverse   but   non-partisan

viewpoints  ought to make a contribution to our Parliamentary

debates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the merits and usefulness of having the

NMP   scheme   have   been  thoroughly  debated   since   the

Constitution  was first amended to provide for  it.   At  our

subsequent sittings of Parliament to resolve to have NMPs, we

also  exhaustively argued over the need to continue with  the

scheme  and  we  voted  for it.  So I would  not  repeat  the

reasons  why  we  should  have  the  NMPs  in  this  term  of

Parliament.  For those who are interested, I would  recommend

that they run through the Hansard on all the debates that  we

have had in the last three times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It suffices me to sum up by saying that NMPs have been a

plus for our Parliament.  Many have distinguished themselves.

Their objective, non-partisan views on a wide range of issues

brought before this House have added value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I moved a similar motion in 1992 and 1997, the

Party  Whip was lifted.  Now, for this motion, the Whip  will

also be lifted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to urge

Members of this House not to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



support the motion moved by the Leader of the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Parliament is an elected institution

and  we  must  keep it that way. Each Member  in  this  House

fought their way through an electoral process involving  nine

hard  days  of  campaigning  and  countering  many  traumatic

moments of electioneering.  Some who fought lost and are left

out of this Chamber.  There were risks taken, like giving  up

comfortable jobs to venture into this political arena.  If we

had  lost  in  Jurong, our hon. Member, Mr Tharman  would  be

jobless  because he left MAS.  I am sure that  he  must  have

some  moments when he asked himself why he got into this when

matters  got  very  hot in Jurong.  But he went  through  the

hustings and I am sure he felt a sense of pride and joy  when

he won.  He told me that he felt very humbled, just like what

I felt when I won my first election in 1980.  Assoc. Prof. Ho

Peng Kee, my good friend, fought very hard and he lost a  lot

of  weight, but he won.  So also my good friend, Assoc. Prof.

Low  Seow  Chay.  Steve, you gave him a hard fight,  but  you

lost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At every election, we go round to campaign for votes in

trucks,  lorries,  we  walk, we  run.   Every  time  we  meet

somebody, we ask them, "please vote me".  It takes a  lot  of

courage  to  ask somebody, "please vote for me".   Those  who

have not gone through an election do not understand, but most

of  us, who have gone through would realise how difficult  it

is  for us to ask somebody to vote for you.  And when they go

knocking at the doors, sometimes when people open the door to

you, they do not offer you pleasantries.  They call you  -  I

do  not  know  whether  it  is unparliamentary  language,  Mr

Speaker  - "PAP bastards, you get out!"  But this is part  of

the hustings and we have to go through it.  At the end of the

day,  we  develop a certain inner strength in us. We  develop

thick  skin, as the Prime Minister said. We learn  to  handle

abuses but we gain the respect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These experiences will mould and change us, but also

help us to tackle



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



issues  and  to manage crisis.  So we Members in  this  House

deserve to come into this place because we made it, we earned

it, we have the mandate.  Do we want people nominated to come

into  this  House and enjoy what you have fought so  hard  to

earn a place here?  You better think twice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have once asked a Nominated Member of

Parliament  why  he  wanted to come to this  House.   He  was

silent.   He  said he was not interested in politics.   So  I

asked  him,  "Do  you know what this Chamber  is?"   In  this

Chamber, every discussion is political in nature.   So  I  do

not  understand  why  a  person, who  is  not  interested  in

politics  is prepared to come into this Chamber, which  is  a

political Chamber, as I have said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we want men of substance, not men of

words  in  this House.  In the last four days, we have  heard

numerous  speakers  in the House giving their  views  on  the

remaking  of  Singapore and they addressed a  wide  range  of

issues,  from high-tech to the bread and butter  issues,  and

even  to what is happening in the region, terrorists,  tudung

and  so  on.  And there were no NMPs in this House.  I wonder

whether anyone of you felt you missed their presence.  I  did

not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideas and issues raised by all of you in this House

would give the Ministries a lot of work to do, and they  will

be kept busy for a long, long time.  Yet, we were told by the

Leader of the House, in the last debate, that they needed non-elected Members to give us alternative views.  I have watched

NMPs  perform in this House.  Yes, some of them were good  at

articulating  issues,  but  no  better  than  our  Dr  Vivian

Balakrishnan,  Mr Tharman Shamugaratnam, Dr  Wang  Kai  Yuen,

Assoc.  Prof.  Chin,  so many of you  here.   So  if  we  ask

ourselves,  are they better than all of us, and if  they  are

better than any one of us here, you let them in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because some of you are new here, let me bring up some

of the things I said in this House 10 years ago.  It is still

relevant.  We had Nominated MPs in Parliament.  It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>



was  not  called  Parliament.  It was  called  the  Singapore

Legislative  Assembly and there was a recommendation  by  the

Rendel  Commission.  The Rendel Commission recommended  four,

two  to make sure that the minority interests are taken  care

of,  and two to make sure that trade and business matters are

taken care of.  I am sure you can quite understand.  In 1954-1955, what was Singapore?  We were a third-world country.  We

did   not  have  so  many  PhDs.   Education  was  very  low.

Therefore,  we  can expect that these people  were  there  to

oversee their interests.  We can understand that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there was an overriding clause that that feature was

to  be  a  transient  feature,  and  that  it  would  not  be

permanent.  And this non-permanent feature was later examined

by  another Commission.  This Commission was chaired  by  the

former  Chief  Justice  Wee Chong Jin in  early  1966,  which

examined  whether  a council of nominated people  called  the

Council  of State should be a part of Parliament.  They  were

non-elected  people, and their primary function was  to  make

sure,  again,  to  check on minority  rights.   And  for  the

benefit of the new MPs, I quote paragraph 54, page 15, of the

Report of the Constitutional Commission 1966:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It will be a body separate from Parliament, but to

which Parliament can look for serious and weighty advice  and

while  having  no control over legislation, it will,  to  the

extent of having given its advice, share with Parliament  the

responsibility  for any legislation passed pursuant  to  such

advice.    We  think  the  continued  practice  of  a   sound

democratic  system of government in Singapore  will  best  be

achieved  if our recommendations leave untouched a unicameral

legislature  which we have at present, where all  Members  of

Parliament  are  elected  by the people  by  secret  vote  at

elections  held at regular intervals of years.  In  this  way

the   many  and  grave  responsibilities  which  Members   of

Parliament taken upon as the elected representatives  of  the

people will rest solely on them.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even our Senior Minister - I would not quote him - said that no nominated people can give him advice. So, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, we have seen these two reports and  they  were

crafted by non-parliamentarians and yet, today, we are asking

parliamentarians, all of you here, to endorse this  Nominated

Members scheme.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 30 years have passed since those reports. This

Parliament  is  very different.  Members  of  the  House  are

experts in their own field.  Like I said, we have experts  in

finance, health, law, business and even unions.  The fear  of

no  minority representation has been taken care of.  We  have

the Presidential Council on Minority Rights to make sure that

all  legislation in this House must pass through their  hands

to make sure that there is no discrimination against minority

interests.   Then  we  have the GRC  system  to  ensure  that

minority representation is guaranteed in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lack of women was one of the reasons our Prime Minister

gave for wanting Nominated Members of Parliament.  Now I  see

10 women in this House, and Members  have all listened to how

our  10  women have performed in this House.  They  are  more

than adequate.  They are women of substance, and we have even

included  single  women.  So, I think, we  have  covered  the

whole range of women's interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask this House, what more do they want? Alternative

voices?   We have the Opposition parties here.  We  have  the

NCMP.   If we expect Nominated MPs to give opposition  views,

our  past experience shows that some of the Nominated MPs are

more PAP than the PAP!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we cannot artificially create another

voice  in  this  House to represent sectoral  and  functional

interests.  We are pandering.  The moment we start to  pander

to functional and sectoral groups, we are in trouble, because

there  is no end to it.  Everyone will come knocking  at  the

door every two years asking why he is not represented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who do we select? They have a whole list of

functional groups that are coming in.  But I said that if  we

look  at  some  of the women representatives of the  previous

nominations, invariably, one must come from AWARE.  To me, it

is  proxy representation for AWARE.  Why should this House be

used as a platform for them to air their grievances and their

views?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We select lawyers. I wonder why. We have Davinder

Singh   -   he  is  great.  We have Shanmugam, another  great

senior lawyer. We have Ravindran, Indranee, Sin Boon Ann.  We

have so many and yet we want more.  I think it is crazy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the worst - I cannot understand - is that we want unionists to enter this House. If I were an

elected  unionist MP, I will be thoroughly embarrassed.   How

can  the  elected unionists have a nominated unionist sitting

side  by side, listening to him, cautioning and advising  our

Minister  for Manpower?  Surely there must be something  that

is  not correct.  I am sure that our unionists here,  Yeo and

others,  will all agree with me that they all can do  a  very

good job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet the very people that cannot get representation

-   the hawkers, the shopkeepers, the taxi drivers and so  on

-  either they do not know the system or because they are not

familiar  with the procedure.  I wanted to know  why.   So  I

spoke  to  a  former Nominated MP, Gerard Ee.  He  said  that

there  is  some eliteness in our selection process, which  is

quite  true, because we are biased towards the professionals.

So, who are they representing?  We are missing a big group of

people  outside clamouring to come in, and we are not  giving

them representation.  It is not fair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While listening to the Prime Minister, it suddenly

dawned  on me that this system could be a backdoor entry  for

religious and racial politics.  The Prime Minister said  that

we  are  in charge.  Yes, we are in charge.  Let me tell  you

that  some enlightened ones will study our selection process.

They  will  be  wise to how we select, and  they  will  train

themselves  to  present in a very acceptable  form  for  this

selection  committee.  And before long, we will  get  someone

very well educated, but he is a proxy representation of maybe

one  of  the  terrorist groups.  [Laughter]  This  is  not  a

laughing matter.  It is a remote possibility.  But if  things

can  happen  now, it can happen later.  Why do we  take  this

chance?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, this House, being the highest

legislative body in the land, must send the right signals  to

Singaporeans.   We must remember that in this House,  we  set

policies, we set rules, we make laws.  Singaporeans read  and

watch  us on television.  So, everything that we say  and  do

here  is examined in the living room,  and they take the  cue

from us.  So they listen to all of us.  Many Members call for

Singaporeans  to  be prepared for a change in  lifestyle,  to

take  risks, to go into business areas where nobody dares  to

go.   And  we always tell them, "Don't worry.  If  you  fail,

jump up, start again."  So we are risk advocators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to ask ourselves how Singaporeans are going to

react  on  the way we vote on this scheme.  We are asking  to

approve  a  scheme to accept non-risk-takers  as  Members  of

Parliament.  So it contradicts what many Members  are  saying

in  this House.  We must think very carefully whether we want

non-risk-takers to come into this House.  Non-risk-takers are

afraid of elections.  They are afraid of being challenged  by

the  electorate.  They are afraid of abuses.  But you all are

prepared to go through.  You went through and you came out of

it strong, and you are all here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must send a correct message to the ground. And if

the ground thinks that we have a double standard, then we are

all  hypocrites.   We  cannot have a  double  standard.   You

cannot  say that you can take risk, I cannot take risk.   Why

can  I not take risk?  Because I am a professional, I am well

heeled,   but  I  am afraid you can take risk.   You  do  not

belong to that category.  To me, it is a double standard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, this time round, the Whip is lifted. I know

Prime  Minister has spoken about the Whip.  And  PAP  Members

here are not stupid as to bring down the Government, but this

issue  is not a life-and-death issue.  This issue is to bring

in  non-risk-takers into this House.  So, if Members want  to

agree to have non-risk-takers, then vote for it.  But I  will

vote against it.  [Applause.]



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support this motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read the NMP debate on Hansard since 1989. I have

read  many  of  the  arguments of Dr Tan Cheng  Bock  in  the

Hansard.  I think what sticks in his throat when it comes  to

NMPs  is  that they enjoy the ride but they do  not  pay  the

price.    And  I  understand  this  sentiment.   No  one   is

suggesting that the men and women here are not excellent.   I

think they are absolutely excellent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the key question that we must ask ourselves on this

motion  is whether having Nominated Members of Parliament  in

this House will serve the national interest.  Do NMPs add  to

the public welfare that we, as elected representatives of the

people,  have been entrusted with?  My view is that it  does.

If  we  take the position, which I believe is shared by  many

Members in this House, that a vital role of Parliament is  as

a  debating Chamber on issues that affect the public welfare,

then  the addition of Nominated Members can only further this

cause.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To arrogate this right to debate, to review and question

the  Government to only elected representatives is not to add

but  to  take away from the public interest.  It is precisely

because  we  believe the discussion on public affairs  should

not  be  the exclusive preserve of political leaders,  but  a

right  as  well  as  an obligation of citizens  that  various

initiatives  have  been  launched to  engage  the  public  in

matters  that  affect  their  lives  and  future.   Feedback,

dialogue sessions, the Remaking Singapore Committee  and  the

Economic  Review  Committee are but  manifestations  of  this

belief.  The Nominated Members of Parliament provision  gives

institutional recognition to this in the highest deliberative

assembly in the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Democracy", as Clement Atlee said, "means government by

discussion.".   Lord Lindsay, in his classic work,  Democracy

and  Discussion, argued that ". anyone with experience of the

effectiveness of discussion in a small democratic society



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



must recognise how valuable is the contribution of those  who

are  not  easily  convinced but can stand up  resolutely  for

their own point of view."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of NMPs into this House, many

resolute  men  and women had, together with elected  Members,

committed their intelligence, expertise and experience in the

service  of  this nation by discussion and debate  on  issues

that affect Singapore's future.  In doing so, they helped  to

fulfil one of the most important aims of Parliament, which is

to  ensure that the Government acts in the national interest,

free of partisan inclinations and local prejudices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to me,

Dr  Tan is a man of principles.  I have known him as a fellow

MP  for  the past 17 years.  He is a righteous man.  To  him,

the  world  is  black  and white, and  very  little  grey  in

between.   He also tends to be obstinate, which is  a  virtue

under  certain circumstances.  Sir, if I were to choose  just

one  man to go into battle of life and death, I would  choose

Dr  Tan.   I knew, with him at my side, I would not  have  to

cover my back, as he is absolutely dependable as a friend and

as  a comrade.  He also knows his politics very well.  He  is

now  in  Parliament for the sixth term.  His PAP  Ayer  Rajah

Branch  is indeed a very small branch, compared to the  other

branches  of PAP.  In fact, we have been urging him to  build

up  his  branch.  And, yet, in the last General  Election  he

polled  88% of the popular votes.  How he managed to do  that

is  something  that we all should learn from.   I  think  the

speech  he  just gave showed us some of the things he  really

learned  how to do it.  And he had named all of us who  would

speak  against  him,  making it difficult  for  us  to  speak

against him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when Dr Tan spoke about the right of

representation  in  Parliament  and  spoke  against  the  NMP

concept,  I  believe all of us take his views very seriously.

However,  despite  my respect for him,  I  think  he  is  too

obstinate in his view in this area.  I believe he missed  two

major points



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



in  his  speech.   Firstly, the right  of  representation  by

ballot box - he insisted that to be in this House, one has to

be tested by the ballot box.  Secondly, I think he completely

ignored  the contributions of the NMPs in Parliament to-date,

those who had served us in the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, around the world today, there are variants of

democracy and democratic representation, each evolved to suit

the  situation of the respective countries.  Enough had  been

said about this in the previous debates on this very topic in

November 1989 and March 1990 when the Bill was tabled for the

Second and Third readings.  The subject was again extensively

elaborated in March 1992 and June 1997 when a motion to admit

NMPs  in the respective term of Parliament was debated again.

Basically Dr Tan argued for what I would classify as a static

vision  of Parliament.  He would like to see that as long  as

possible - the concept that he had learned as a young man  be

perpetuated unchanged in this Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say, Sir, representation in Parliament should not be

that  static and should not be locked into time.   Parliament

is  a living thing and it should evolve with the needs of the

time.   Just like the concept of marriage, husband and  wife,

that evolves through human history.  Today, one man, one wife

is  the  accepted  norm  in Singapore.   However,  under  the

Women's Charter, bigamy is illegal in Singapore, but  it  was

not  that way that long ago.  Just about 50 years ago, it was

quite acceptable in Singapore for a man to have more than one

wife.   Now  if  you really go back in time,  anthropologists

would  tell  us  that most human societies  were  a  maternal

society,  remnants  of which could still be  found  scattered

here  and there around the world.  In some of these, a  woman

could  have  many spouses.  Today, in some western societies,

same  sex partner families are recognised by law as  a  basic

family unit similar to the traditional family unit.  So  even

with a concept as fundamental as the concept of family, there

is  no absolute.  It is but a value system acceptable to  all

members of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



community appropriate to the demands of the time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will present to Dr Tan that this is

the  case with Parliament.  We should be an institution  that

should be enhanced to meet the needs of the time.  NMP to  me

is   an   innovation  in  the  Singapore  Parliament.     The

constitutionality  of  the  NMP  concept  has  already   been

settled.  Theory aside, the question we should ask ourselves,

as  Mr Raymond Lim has pointed out, in this motion is whether

NMPs  inducted into Parliament have been positive or negative

to  Parliament.  Have they added to the depth and the breadth

of debate in Parliament?  Sir, I think everyone, including Dr

Tan,  must  agree that many of them did contribute to  better

debate  in  Parliament.  Names that readily crop  up  include

Prof. Walter Woon, Claire Chiang - I think we all missed  her

very  much  -  Jennifer Lee, Shriniwas  Rai,  Thomas  Thomas,

Zulkifli Baharudin, Tay Beng Chuan, among others.  I  do  not

think these are non-risk takers.  Many of them are successful

businessmen  in  their  own right.  Surely,  they  are  risk-takers.   Yes,  while some NMPs could have  contributed  more

but,  overall,  I  think  we are  better  off  with  NMPs  in

Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the arguments Dr Tan has as regards NMP

representation  is whether they represent  anyone  when  they

come  into Parliament.  I think, Sir, we should ask  instead,

whether  NMPs are Members of Parliament.  The answer actually

lies  with  Singaporeans.   Do Singaporeans  accept  them  as

Members  of Parliament?  And whether NMPs have been  accepted

by the international community of parliamentarians is another

question we should ask.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have the privilege of attending several

international conferences of parliamentarians  with  some  of

our  NMPs  in the past, and these NMPs had done us  proud  in

these  international forums.  They were accepted  by  all  as

equal.  So if a flower looks like a rose, feels like a  rose,

smells like a rose, it is a rose.  The other argument Dr  Tan

has  against the NMP concept is that we should not provide  a

backdoor  for people who are non-risk takers into Parliament.

And I believe he said that this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



is  not just a debating shop; it is a political chamber where

we make decisions.  Surely, Sir, Dr Tan knows from the bottom

of  his  heart  that  there is actually  a  major  difference

between  an  elected  Member of Parliament  and  a  Nominated

Member  of  Parliament.  This difference is obvious  even  to

those  who volunteered and were selected to be NMPs.   In  my

view,  an  elected Member of Parliament is more than  just  a

representative of the people in his constituency because  we,

the  elected  MPs, do not carry out an opinion  poll  of  our

constituents every time we speak.  An elected MP, everyone of

us  - Backbenchers, Opposition Members included - is a leader

in  our  own right.  So, in a crunch, I think we are expected

to step forward and to lead.  Having NMPs in the Chamber does

not  dilute or blur this distinction.  Thus, in my mind, Sir,

having NMPs in the House does not provide a backdoor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nominated Members are just a different category of

Members  in this House and should be recognised and  accepted

as  such.   Sir,  being an NMP is already  difficult  enough.

They  have to make a mark within a very short period of time.

I  am already a fifth term MP and I still have a lot to learn

to improve my performance in Parliament.  For NMPs to leave a

mark  within their first two-year term, they are indeed  rare

individuals with outstanding abilities.  Talents are hard  to

come  by  and  we  should  not make it  harder  for  talented

individuals to step forward to serve in this capacity as NMPs

in  this  House.  We should not denigrate the office  of  the

NMP,  thereby  discouraging more outstanding  individuals  to

step  forward.   With all due respect to my good  friend,  Dr

Tan,  I  do not think he is doing a service to this House  by

opposing this motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this motion and urge all my colleagues to

vote in favour of it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

first,  I would like to thank you for allowing me to join  in

this debate on Nominated MPs (NMPs).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of the NMP scheme is, of course, laudable.

As explained by the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>

Leader of the House, Mr Wong, the addition of up to nine NMPs

will  add  to  the quality of the debate in  this  House.   I

surmise  therefore that the NMP scheme is introduced  not  so

much due to the lack of PAP MPs, but to overcome the lack  of

opposing and discerning views in Parliament, arising from the

lack of Opposition MPs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to state my case on why I feel that for

this  new Parliament, there is no need for an NMP scheme,  in

spite  of  the fact that there continues to be a  paucity  of

Opposition Members in this House.  I would like to  bring  up

some new angles, instead of what some Members have claimed to

be  old  angles, as raised by Dr Tan Cheng Bock.   There  are

many  reasons why this new term of Parliament could  do  away

with  NMPs.   I think the NMP scheme has been useful  in  the

past, but I think it will serve limited use in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first point is that for this new session of

Parliament,  the PAP Whip will be lifted.  That makes  a  big

difference.  The Leader of the House has said that  in  cases

of  certain Bills that are not critical - even the PM himself

has  said so - he will allow PAP MPs to speak up, which means

that  now, except for some critical Bills, we have a new body

of  MPs  to  take  on issues - the PAP MPs.   With  this  new

Parliament, the new PAP MPs, as well as the old PAP MPs,  can

therefore  speak  with more conviction  and  freedom.   Their

views  on  Government policy can be more  engaging.   In  the

past,  we all know that the PAP MPs' mouths had been  gagged.

We could not speak up, because there was a Whip behind us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> No.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> You can speak against it, but you

have to vote for it.  It sounds very illogical.  Anyway,  now

that the Whip has been lifted for those who want to speak,  I

think they can speak more readily and more heartily.  But, of

course,  they have to be responsible for whatever  they  say.

Therefore,  I  think  we do not need more  NMPs,  because  we

already have such a large body of PAP MPs.  This is one major

difference.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second difference I would like to say is that

we  now have a large quantity and quality of MPs, and new PAP

MPs,  in  this Parliament.  There are 24 new PAP MPs and  one

new  NCMP.   Certainly, with these 25 new faces put together,

and with the old existing veteran MPs, what more views can be

offered  in  this House and not more effective  that  can  be

covered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard how well most of the MPs who have spoken - all the 50-over of them - how well they have covered their

points,  and how eloquent they are.  As you have  seen,  even

including  a  poem by my GRC colleague, Dr Ng Eng  Hen.   And

also  we  just  saw this morning how well a new  Minister  of

State,  Dr Balaji, had fielded the barrage of questions  from

the  other MPs.  Many of these questions are from the new MPs

themselves.  So these are examples that we are going to  have

good debate in this House with this new crop of good MPs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even the hon. Member, Mr Chiam - I remember he told

me  just  two days ago - that it was most refreshing to  hear

our new PAP MPs speak.  Is that not right?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, the other argument about having

NMPs  is  that  they  represent a wider  spectrum  of  public

opinion.  Once again, I wish to contend that we already  have

a  wide and adequate representation in this House.  As Dr Tan

Cheng Bock has said, we have businessmen, we have Ph.Ds.,  we

have entrepreneurs, we have unionists, we have professionals,

doctors,  lawyers - what else do we want?  Everything  is  in

this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in terms of elected female MPs, again like Dr Tan

Cheng  Bock has said, now we have increased from four to  10,

and  we see more colours of dresses now.  So do you want more

colours  from  the  NMPs?  I think not.   Dr  Wang  had  also

mentioned  that in the past, there were some very good  NMPs.

I must say I agree with him.  I can single out some very good



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>



ones  myself.  But my contention is that for every good  NMP,

we  have at least one good PAP MP to cover or be equal to the

person.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite you examples. I recall Assoc. Prof. Walter

Woon - he was eloquent, penetrating in his remarks.  In fact,

he  came out with the Maintenance of Parents Bill, which  was

very  remarkable.  We had Dr Augustine Tan, equally eloquent,

equally deep and penetrating in his debates.  Then we had  Dr

Lee Tsao Yuan, from the NMP side; on our side we had Dr Aline

Wong,  equally eloquent and adequate in covering  points.   I

think  in  the last Parliament, we had Mr Tay Beng  Chuan,  a

good businessman who brought up several business issues,  but

we  have  Inderjit Singh.  And then we had,  of  course,  Mdm

Claire  Chiang, who is a very good speaker as well.  We  have

Dr  Lily Neo who can match Mdm Claire Chiang, word for  word,

speech  for speech, maybe dress for dress.  I think she  also

has  one up on Mdm Claire Chiang.  She has her famous "Hairdo

Debate".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, all the other past NMPs that we have in this House

can be equally matched by our PAP MPs.  So what can they add?

I  would like to argue against Mr Raymond Lim that, at  best,

the  contributions  the  NMPs  can  give  are  marginal,  not

substantial.  Of course, we also have the other NMP  who  was

quite  notable, Mr Simon Tay.  I remember him very well.   He

made  very good remarks, very articulate.  Of course, we have

on  our  side Dr Tan Cheng Bock himself, well matched  to  Mr

Simon Tay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to belittle the contributions of the

past  26 NMPs, or imply that they did not contribute  to  the

debates,  or the cut and thrust of this House.  I  said  they

are  honourable people and I have very high regard for  them.

I  respect  them.   All  I  am saying  is  that  we  do  have

sufficient numbers of elected MPs in this House to cover  all

the bases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there are three strong lines of attacks we

have from the backbench to take on the frontbench.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the speeches of the MPs in the last

few  days, I am even more convinced than ever that we do  not

need  NMPs.   The backbenchers are particularly pleased  with

the  return of Mr Tan Soo Khoon, the former Speaker.  He  has

demonstrated  just by two speeches that he is  a  speechmaker

par excellence, as Dr Wang Kai Yuen has said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in this new House, we have three strong lines

of  formation of attack to take on the frontbench.  The first

line  are  the  25  new MPs which includes  the  "Magnificent

Seven",  ie,  the  seven new Ministers of  State  and  Senior

Ministers  of State.  The next line we have are  the  second,

third  and slightly older MPs, which include people  like  Mr

Inderjit Singh, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, Dr Lily Neo and Prof.  Chin

Tet Yung.  Then we have the final line, the strongest line we

call it, there we have the double Tans: Dr Tan Cheng Bock and

Mr  Tan  Soo  Khoon.  And backed by them are  also  good  and

capable  MPs,  Dr Wang Kai Yuen and, again,  Prof.  Chin  Tet

Yung,  and  of  course next to him, Dr  Ong  Chit  Chung  and

others.   These are all very good back-up forces  to  support

the  two Tans.  With all this firepower, why do we need NMPs?

I do not understand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the final analysis on whether or not we

should have NMPs does not depend on how well they speak,  but

what value they bring to the House and what contrasting views

they  can  bring.  Sir, I must say that they  do  bring  some

views.  But I must contend against Mr Raymond Lim that maybe,

at best, marginal.  Sir, my GRC colleague, Dr Ng Eng Hen, has

called  this Chamber a "theatre".  I am sure he did not  mean

that  this  House is a theatre for shows.  Not  a  place  for

wayang wayang, or play-play.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House debates on serious matters. We all agree on

that.   Therefore,  it is not the quantity,  that  means  the

additional number of NMPs, that counts, but it is the quality

and  substance that count.  Added to that, we need to add  in

"conviction".    Elected  MPs need to  have  the  conviction.

They  speak  from their hearts for the people.  NMPs  do  not

have to do that.  They



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



have no constituents.  NMPs can come and go.  But elected MPs

cannot.  Elected MPs have obligations to the people who  vote

for them.  Elected MPs must be responsible, speak up and make

their voice heard in this House.  Sir, Dr Wang Kai Yuen  said

that  roses that smell like roses must be roses.   I  do  not

agree.   NMPs  and elected MPs are different,  and  they  are

different.  They come from a different breeding process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when this NMP Bill was first introduced in 1989, I

was  ambivalent  and  unsure of whether  to  support  it.   I

checked  the  Hansard and noted that I did say that  I  could

support  this  Bill  subject to certain qualifications.   But

over   the  years  and  after  observing  my  fellow  elected

backbenchers perform in the last few days, I would  say  that

now I do not feel the need for the NMPs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Bill was first introduced by the Prime

Minister,  Mr  Goh Chok Tong who was the first  Deputy  Prime

Minister  then,  he summed up the debate by  saying  that  he

surmised  that the uneasiness was not so much about the  Bill

itself,   but   with  the  uneasiness  of  the  elected   MPs

themselves.  I think this uneasiness was true, and  is  still

true.  Let me explain why.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me use the concept of "shelf space". Parliament is

an  august House, not a theatre, where all the elected MPs do

their  serious  work.  This is where MPs do  their  work,  by

making laws and debating on Government policies, as the Prime

Minister has just made a very important and inspiring  speech

for  us  to  hear.   Parliament is also a  major  avenue  for

elected  MPs to reach out to the constituents they represent.

Their  constituents want to hear their MPs speaking  out  for

them.   They  want to see their MPs at work.   Now,  the  NMP

interrupts this process of the elected MPs at work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, let me explain the "shelf space" concept. NMPs

occupy  shelf  space.   In a supermarket,  every  product  is

fighting  for  shelf space to gain consumer  attention.   One

extra  product,  one extra can of sardine by  another  brand,

takes up the shelf space.  So PAP is the premium No. 1



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>



product.   The consumers decided that this is so.  They  also

decided that Opposition MPs can only have two out of  the  84

shelf space. So be it.  But why do we need more?  There is no

reason for us to introduce a third brand called NMP.  NMP is,

what  I call, a "generic" brand, a no-name brand, a "me  too"

product.  No self-respecting premium brand producer wants  to

introduce  a generic brand to the consumers just because  the

competitor  No.  2  is very weak.  I do not  understand  this

marketing strategy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to reiterate that we are not against

competition as such in this House.  It is good to  have  more

debates  and  more competition.  And I have  nothing  against

NMPs  themselves.   I also do not want to debase  their  past

contribution,  but I am only against the NMP  scheme.   Those

who   have  accepted to be NMPs in the past have contributed,

but  there are other avenues for them to be heard,  to  voice

their   opinions.   Of  course,  they  can  first  join   the

elections,  no  matter whether they are on a PAP  ticket,  or

opposition   ticket.   Or  they  can  become  an  independent

candidate, if they want to.  If not, they can join the  other

processes  where they can also have their views heard.   They

can be invited to the Economic Review Committee, the Remaking

of Singapore Committee, Feedback Committee, public forums and

dialogues where their views can be heard.  So I contend  that

there  is  no need for them to enter Parliament.  As  Dr  Tan

Cheng Bock has said, it is a political process, not a talking

process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elected MPs have work to do here. Sometimes, I am

very  saddened to hear an MP, especially a newer  MP,  making

very  good  points in Parliament, but because of the  limited

media  space, as I said earlier, shelf space, they  are  shut

out.   They did not get the media coverage they deserve, such

that their constituents cannot know what he or she has to say

on their behalf.  Elected MPs have constituents to answer to.

NMPs  do  not.  The debate on the Presidential Address  is  a

prime  example.   Over  50 MPs spoke  up,  not  counting  the

Ministers, DPM and PM himself.  But many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



MPs'  speeches were not covered at all by the media.  So,  if

we  have  more  NMPs,  it means even less  coverage  for  the

elected MPs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to make a final point as to why I feel

that  things  are a bit different now.  Debate is  a  two-way

process.   NMPs may add to the debate, yes, I can agree  with

that.  But we can have all debates we want in this House.  It

is  no  use if the Ministers are not listening.  We now  know

that  the  Ministers  are  listening.   Yesterday,  DPM   Lee

actually assured the House that he would listen, and he would

not  bristle.  When the Ministers are listening, at least the

speeches  they make are making an impact.  So it is  not  the

quantity  or  the  numbers that count.   It  is  whether  the

recipient side also makes an effort to hear and to take  into

account the views.  With more receptive Ministers, of  course

capable  and  good Ministers, and more eloquent  and  elected

MPs, do we need more NMPs?  Surely not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me end by saying that since the PAP Whip is

lifted, I urge my fellow PAP MPs to search deeply into  their

hearts.    Ask yourself:  is there a need for NMPs?  What  is

it  that they can do that we elected MPs cannot do?  With the

Whip off my back, Sir, I intend to vote against this motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like me, those MPs who have spoken in support of

the  Bill in the past, which I did, could change their  minds

given  the new circumstances.  That is precisely the  purpose

of  the  motion  being tabled and put  to  the  new  term  of

Parliament,   so  that  each  new  term  of  Parliament   can

reconsider whether there is a need for NMPs.  Sir,  there  is

no  longer a need.  I contend the time has now come  for  us,

the elected MPs, to speak up, speak from our hearts.  We, the

backbenchers, have asked the Minister and civil servants  for

a  mindset change.  How about our own mindset?  We also  must

change.  Be prepared to say, no, if you are persuaded that  a

"no" is right.  Say "no" to the NMP motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Davinder Singh (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the speakers before me have been addressing the question as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



though the issue before Parliament is whether there is  merit

in the NMP scheme.  But we have passed that, have we not?   I

thought  the  question now is whether, having regard  to  the

experience we have had of the NMP scheme for more than  10-12

years,  there is a reason to get rid of it.  We have  already

decided, many of us still in this House, that there is  merit

in the scheme, that it serves the purpose and it improves the

process.  If this House is being asked to look at it  afresh,

it  must be with a view to asking ourselves whether something

has  gone  wrong  with the NMP scheme  for  us  to  say  that

throwing it out is justified.  Let us look at the record.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has happened to the NMP scheme which has degraded

the parliamentary process?  What have the NMPs, who have come

to  this  House, session after session, done to diminish  the

standing  of this House?  Have they done anything  which  has

adversely  affected the interests of the people?   Have  they

done  anything  which  has made it more  difficult  for  this

Government  to govern?  Have they done anything  to  make  it

more difficult for the elected MPs to put their views across?

If  I  hear  an argument which suggests that, yes, they  have

done  something contrary to our interests which,  ultimately,

affects  the  man-in-the-street, then we can begin  a  debate

about casting away this scheme.  But what we have is a rehash

of the arguments that we went through in 1989.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at the Hansard and Dr Tan Cheng Bock had done a

service  to us by reminding us of his arguments that he  made

in 1989 and, to a large extent, so too has Mr Leong, although

then I think he took a different position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us go through the arguments one by one. The NMP

scheme resulted, apart from anything else, in the passage  of

the  Maintenance of Parents Act.  How many people  have  been

hurt  by that and how many people have benefited?  Would that

Act  have come through this House and ended up as legislation

on  our  own  steam?  Could it?  I have difficulty  believing

that  because  I remember, when Prof. Walter Woon  stood  up,

many people in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



this  House  spoke  up  against it.   Let  us  ask  ourselves

honestly:  would  that  Act  have  been  passed  on  our  own

initiative?  And has that Act operated to benefit  people  in

Singapore,  people  who do not have the resources  to  go  to

court,  and  people  who need the help of the  Government  to

recover  from  recalcitrant children?  Do we  throw  the  NMP

scheme out because people have benefited?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask Members another question. One of the

concerns  highlighted by Dr Tan in 1989 was that this  scheme

was going to open the door for racial and religious groups to

be  represented in this House and, therefore, we were  asking

for  trouble.  Has that happened?  In 1992, I think, Mr  Tang

Liang  Hong  tried to make a move to come in  under  the  NMP

scheme,  and the people who stood up, who wrote in to  oppose

it, were the elected MPs.  As a result of that opposition, he

failed  to get into this House.  Since then, no other  person

has tried, no matter how cleverly, to get into this House  so

that  he  can advance a sectarian cause.  It is one thing  to

say  that  there is a "remote possibility" - I think  Dr  Tan

used  those words - of that happening;  it is another to  ask

ourselves:  has  it  happened?  And,  really,  is  there  any

chance, given the fact that we are now talking about it, that

we will let that happen?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us go to the next argument that is made, ie, that

Parliament  is  an elected Chamber and, so,  as  purists,  we

should  retain this form.  And that is the operative  word  - form.   Having heard the arguments that Dr Tan and  Mr  Leong

have  very  eloquently put across, it seems to me  that  they

would  have  no  quarrel with this notion.  We  will  have  a

separate body, we would not call it Parliament.  The  NMPs  - we  can  call them something else - will sit there  with  our

Ministers  in  the  Frontbench,  make  their  speeches,   get

responses and have the media cover them.  But so long as they

are  not  in  this  House, so long as they are  not  in  this

elected  Chamber,  that  is fine.  But  because  this  is  an

elected  Chamber, they should not be sitting in  these  seats

and  they  should  not be joining us in  this  House  in  the

debate.  But they can do it in another forum.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are past form. We were past form a long time ago,

when  we  brought  in  the NCMP.  He is not  elected  by  any

stretch of the imagination.  So we can either go for form  or

we  can go for substance.  And, at the end of the day, has it

been  substance the last 12 to 13 years, or has it been form?

Mr  Leong  himself  says  that  there  have  been  very  good

performances from Prof. Woon, Ms Claire Chiang and the others

whom  he has named, and that is credit given where it is due.

It  has  not been pure eloquence; it has been substance.   It

has  forced the rest of us to sit up to do a bit better.   It

has  added  a dimension to this House which none of  us  were

able to give and had the time to give.  How have we lost  out

by  that  process?  I have difficulty understanding  how  all

these  points aggregate to create an argument to throw out  a

scheme that has done well for us and for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the argument is made that these NMPs do not speak

for  their  electorate,  in  other  words,  I  assume,  their

constituents.   None of us speak for our constituents.   None

of  us  do.   We are brought into this House by the electoral

process, many of us unopposed.  My experience, four times.  I

do  not  speak for my residents in Toa Payoh.  When I make  a

speech,  I  make  a  speech  which I  consider  will  benefit

Singaporeans at large.  So this argument that we are speaking

on  behalf of our own constituents is a fiction, and must  be

recognised as a fiction.  And the moment we recognise it,  we

move  away from the fallacious argument that we are only here

for  our  constituents.  We stand here, after thinking  about

our  speech, because we know that at the end of the day there

is  a  chance that the speech will be reproduced in the media

and   that  every  Singaporean,  whether  he  lives  in  your

constituency or not, is going to read you and assess you, and

that  he  is  going to take a view about your arguments.   So

this  is  not  a forum for espousing views peculiar  to  your

constituents; it is about Singapore.  And if a few additional

brains can come into this House to add breadth to the debate,

why not?

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me end by turning to a point which I think Mr Leong

and  Dr Tan made.  The strongest argument they have for doing

away  with  the NMP scheme is the quality of the new  MPs  in

this  House.   I  accept that.  Their quality is  impeccable.

Why  do  we need NMPs when we have what Mr Leong has  called,

"the  magnificent 7"?  Let me ask Members this.  Assume  that

despite the best efforts of the political leadership, none of

the seven agrees to join politics and come to this House.  We

have  seen  the quality of what they can say.  We  have  seen

them  speak, we have heard them speak, we know their quality.

Assume that they refused to enter the political game and  did

not stand for elections.  Would we be better off if they came

in  as  NMPs, or would we be better off without them in  this

House?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir,

for allowing me to join in this debate.  I am speaking not in

favour of the motion to have Nominated MPs in this session of

Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PM had earlier in the debate lifted the PAP's Whip

and  allowed its Party Members to vote freely on this motion.

This  is  excellent.  Otherwise it is pointless  for  us  t/o

continue  in the discussion.  If the Whip is not lifted,  the

<br><br>82&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members would have only the "Yes" button to press when it

comes  to voting.  This lifting of the Government Whip  gives

Members  of  the  House  a  free  choice  to  exercise  their

individual beliefs and philosophy.  While I disagree with the

PM on the Whip, I shall not debate it here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that is put before us now is whether there

is  a  need  for  NMPs  in this First Session  of  the  Tenth

Parliament.  It is no longer a debate about the merits of the

NMP  scheme anymore.  That has already been very well covered

in  the last two Parliament sessions, and by Dr Tan, Dr Wang,

Mr Leong and Mr Davinder Singh earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of past NMPs has also shown that the

scheme  works.  Times have changed, however.  What had worked

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>



the  past does not mean that it will continue to work in  the

future.   The NMP scheme had worked in the past for two  main

reasons.  First, the Special Select Committee did a good  job

in  selecting  outspoken  but sensible  critics.   But,  more

importantly,  there was, in my opinion, a gap, a  niche  that

past  NMPs  had fulfilled.  That niche is to generate  debate

and critical evaluation of the Bills that were presented.  At

most,  MPs, again in my humble opinion, might have failed  to

perform  effectively.  It could be due to  the  Whip  or  the

presence  of  the  Whip, and the lack of consistency  between

speaking up against a policy and, yet, voting for it  at  the

end   of  the  day.   There  are  probably  constraints   and

restraints  by the Party's internal rules that do  not  allow

them to vote against their Party leaders.  This was confirmed

again  by the Prime Minister earlier.  However, we have  also

heard from the PM that the Government is prepared to lift its

Whip  more  often.   This  will free the  current  batch,  as

discussed, "the magnificent 7" and all the other 25  new  MPs

to  be vigorous, to be more vigilant, in asking questions and

debating the important policies, as what we have seen in  the

last  five days.  And I believe the new and old MPs  will  be

able  to  do a good job, speaking what concerns their  heart.

Given  more  opportunities, there will  be  more  alternative

views to be presented in the months to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last four days, we have also heard many Members

talk about the scepticism and cynicism of youths towards  the

Government.   Sir,  it  is the youths who  are  sceptics  and

cynics,  and they cannot vote.  So it does not mean that  the

75%  of  the population who voted for the Government are  not

sceptics.  Some of these youths have remarked to me that  the

Government introduced the NMP scheme to drown out  the  voice

of the Opposition MPs.  I do not see how that can be the case

when  we are so out-numbered.  If there is a reason to  drown

out, it will be the presence of the PAP MPs who speak against

us that will drown us out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of the NMP scheme shows the failure of the

governing Party MPs in speaking up and being critical.  To  a

certain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>



extent,  the impression of the public is that they  need  the

NMPs  to  do the job for them because they cannot  do  it  as

Party   members.   The  question  on  the   minds   of   many

Singaporeans,  including myself, is whether  the  Government,

when  it  talks  about opening up society  and  engaging  the

young, is for real.  The question asked is, if the Government

is not prepared to open up its Party and allow its Members to

speak up and vote freely, how can it be genuine in wanting to

open  up  society?  Many Singaporeans are watching,  silently

waiting  and hoping that the Government's action  will  match

its words.  Like a resident in Choa Chu Kang once remarked to

me  in  Hokkien,  "mai gong ka jue, zuo lai kua  sheng".   He

said, "Do not talk so much.  Do and show me first."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best action for the Government to convince its

critics  and the many young cynics out there is to  free  its

Party  Members completely from the constraints of  the  Whip.

The PM had said no to this permanent lifting of the Whip.   I

disagree, but that is a decision of the governing Party and I

have  no  say in it.  However, I hope that it can  be  proven

that  there is no need for more NMPs to come in to help  this

fine team of MPs in the debates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already had NMPs for 10 to 12 years. Let us try

for  two years, for this Session of Parliament, without NMPs.

If,  at  the end of two years, the Government MPs,  ourselves

included,  fail to do a good job in airing alternative  views

or  constructive dissent, then let me be the one to move  the

motion to have NMPs at the Second Session of this Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I strongly believe that

we  must  seize  this opportunity to get rid of  the  growing

cynicism in young Singaporeans.  We can do it by allowing the

MPs  in  this  House  to  be  genuinely  critical.   This  is

leadership  by example.  It will be the best way to  convince

Singaporeans  that  the  Government  is  willing   to   stand

corrected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that we do without NMPs, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, as I sat there listening to the

speech of the NCMP, I take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>



it  that he supports, in principle, the idea of the NMP, save

that  we  should  give  it some time  before  we  propose  to

introduce them into this House.  That is precisely the nature

of  this debate now and I rise in support of the motion  that

we have NMPs in this present term of Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, five years ago, during my first term in Parliament,

I  have  spoken  in support of the motion to bring  Nominated

Members into this House.  I am now into my second term of the

office  and  having  had the experience and  the  benefit  of

engaging the Nominated Members in debates, I can say  that  I

stand by my conviction that I believe that at the end of  the

day,  NMPs do make a positive contribution to this House.   I

remember  then when we debated on this issue,  Dr  Tan  Cheng

Bock  had  then said that I was still fresh, wet  behind  the

ears, still green and, that we would come back to look at the

issue five years later and see whether I am still of the same

view.  I hate to disappoint Dr Tan that unfortunately, I have

come  back  to say that, yes, we were right when we supported

the initial motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the underlying arguments against the introduction

of the Nominated Members essentially run along three grounds.

First,  they  lack  moral  standing  because  they  were  not

elected.   They  did  not contest in an election,  therefore,

because of the absence of a contest in an election, they have

no  right  to  represent  the people  of  Singapore  in  this

Chamber.   Secondly,  the argument was made  that  there  are

enough  avenues  existing in this country  to  allow  for  an

expression  of  dissenting opinions and  with  these  avenues

available,  there is really no need for Nominated Members  to

then come to this august Chamber to debate and participate in

policy  deliberation.  Of course, the final argument that  is

made  that  I see coming across is that in this new  climate,

with  the  partial lifting of the Whip, and the new batch  of

Members of Parliament with sterling qualities in engaging the

rest  of  the  House in eloquent debates, there is  really  a

question  as to whether or not you need any more  Members  to

come in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



to  contribute  to the cacophony of sounds or  as  the  Prime

Minister puts it, the symphony of music that we now  seek  to

generate in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with my colleague, Mr Davinder Singh, that

the  issue  of  whether or not we want to bring in  Nominated

Members of Parliament is not a live issue.  We have gone past

that.   The question that we have to ask ourselves is:  going

forward,  how do you want to see the model of democracy,  and

in  particular,  the nature of this House  evolving  in  this

country?  I do not believe, Sir, that there is a single model

of  democracy and as such, we should not be so restricted  by

forms  and  our  fixed views as to what constitutes  it,  who

should have the legitimate right to sit in this House and  to

participate  in the deliberations.  We have to ask  ourselves

this  basic question:  what exactly is it we want that is  in

the interest of Singapore?  I agree with my colleague earlier

that  in  looking at this question, we have to ask ourselves,

looking  at  the participation of the Nominated  Members,  is

Parliament  richer for it with the Nominated Members  present

or  are  we poorer?  Is Singapore better off with or  without

the  presence of these Members?  My colleague has articulated

these views rather eloquently when he said that if we look at

the  past  instances of their contributions to  the  debates,

without the presence of these Members, we would not have  had

such  lively  debates,  we would not have  had  such  a  rich

diversity of views coming into this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may, Sir, I think we can look at this analogy. An

argument that was made earlier is that we have had people  of

various expertise and therefore, do we need any more of  such

people?  I think essentially, if an analogy can be made here,

the  question  is, you have a 2.1 mega pixel camera,  do  you

therefore  need a 3.1 mega pixel camera?  In  the  nature  of

things  and in the nature of human beings, if you can  settle

for  a 3.1 mega pixel camera, why settle for a 2.1 mega pixel

camera?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also the argument that they are not

elected, and therefore, they have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



no  right  to  speak for Singaporeans.  The argument  suffers

from the flaw that only elected Members have the monopoly  to

speak  for  Singaporeans.  Let us not forget  that  Nominated

Members are also Singaporeans. We have to move away from  the

rigid  mindset  that the elected forum should  only  comprise

elected   Members   whose  sole  right  is   to   speak   for

Singaporeans.  Nominated Members, being Singaporeans, also do

enjoy  the legitimate right to speak for Singapore  and  they

represent  the  interest  of  all  Singaporeans,   not   just

constituent  Singaporeans,  but  also  functional  groupings.

Therefore,  if you look at the Nominated Members,  they  come

across  as being non-politically party partisan and  I  think

they perform a useful role here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said before, Sir, a Government for all the

people,  by  the people, is not premised on the functions  of

the  elected representative people alone.  The Government  of

the  people must be founded on a cornerstone on what is  best

for the people, and this must surely include listening to the

voice of the people in this land, including the voice of whom

the NMPs seek to represent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support of the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support it for three reasons. First, since the NMP

scheme  was  introduced in 1989, the NMPs in each cohort  had

justified the usefulness of this scheme.  By and large,  they

had  contributed  to  a lively debate and,  as  the  previous

Members  have  said,  to  our  constant  search  for   better

solutions to the many complex problems facing this country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a confession: when I was a political

correspondent sitting up there in the Press Gallery, I  would

often look forward to hearing some NMPs speak.  They included

Prof. Walter Woon and Dr Kanwaljit Soin and we know the  work

they  have  done  here.  Their views were  often  refreshing.

They added different dimensions to the issue being discussed.

I think Parliament debates would have been the poorer if they

had not been present.  They



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



easily outshone the Opposition.  This is not to say that  the

PAP MPs did not make refreshing speeches.  Many did.  But  as

we  have said so often, nobody enjoys a monopoly over wisdom.

And the fact remains that some NMPs did add to the debate  in

constructive and meaningful ways.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That conclusion, which I made when I was a journalist,

does  not  change just because I have migrated  down  to  the

Chamber.  On the contrary, because I am a PAP MP, I  feel  it

is  incumbent on me to support this scheme.  The PAP  is  the

dominant  party in the House.  One reason it is  dominant  is

because it is a party that is constantly evolving to stay  in

tune with the times and that is always searching for ways  to

secure a better future for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep NMPs out, just because we, the elected MPs, came

in  the  hard way, is to lose sight of the greater good.   We

must take the moral high ground that what is good for society

must   be  the  foremost  concern.   Nearly  every  political

philosopher,  from  Aristotle, Confucius to  Max  Weber,  has

agreed  that the provision of a good or just society  is  the

end  purpose of government.  We cannot always agree  on  what

defines a good society, but at the minimum, the people from a

very  wide spectrum society can all feel that they all get  a

fair  hearing  here.  This gives a sense of legitimacy  to  a

dynamic  and complex society.  This will also increase  their

sense of belonging to the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I stood for elections last November, I said that

the younger generation wanted a greater say in policy-making,

and  that  they  wanted  a more transparent  and  accountable

system.   I  saw one of my roles as an MP as furthering  this

cause.   This  brings me to the second reason for  supporting

this scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It opens the door for more Singaporeans, who are

credible,  to  have  a  greater say in policy-making  in  all

areas,  and at the highest levels.  To that extent,  it  does

make for a more accountable and transparent system.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, it was announced that the door will be opened

wider to usher in a greater variety of groups.  The number of

functional  groups  will be doubled  from  three  to  six  to

reflect  a  wider  spectrum  of society.   Besides  business,

unions    and   professional   groups,   they   now   include

representatives    from   social   and   community    service

organisations,  as  well as the media, the  arts  and  sports

organisations.  This is to be welcomed.  It encourages active

citizenship, which is one of our mantras in Singapore 21.  It

also  reflects our seriousness in remaking Singapore,  to  go

beyond  the 5Cs and to nurture our budding civil society,  as

well as the arts and the sports.  It would also send a signal

that this PAP-dominant Parliament is a dynamic and bold one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I was involved in two dialogues with two

separate  groups  of  young  Singaporeans.   One  group   was

undergraduates, the other group was Secondary 3 and Secondary

4   students  from  the  Gifted  Education  Programme.   Some

students in both groups expressed scepticism about how  ready

the  PAP was to accommodate alternative views.  I pointed  to

the diverse slate of the PAP MPs, especially the new ones, as

a sign of PAP Government's openness to different views and to

the  easing  of the Party Whip.  I also pointed  to  the  NMP

scheme  as another example.  This is not just a case  of  the

Government being open to alternative views.  This is  a  case

of a Government going out of its way to consciously make room

for alternative views.  How many governments would initiate a

scheme that allows non-elected MPs to speak up in Parliament,

and even a non-elected Opposition Member to be here with us?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be a strong Government, confident of the ability

of  its MPs to hold their own in the House as well as on  the

ground.  Therefore, the NMP scheme should not be seen  as  an

indictment  on the quality of PAP MPs in the House.   On  the

contrary,  the  NMP  scheme is the by-product  of  the  PAP's

success.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason I support the NMP scheme is because it

could  help  to  increase  the  number  of  MPs  from  under-represented  groups,  such as women.  It  is  true  that  the

number has increased in this latest batch to 10 - but we  are

still  under-represented.  It is a fact that we have  a  hard

time  finding good women to stand for elections.   It  exacts

considerable  sacrifice in both their  personal,  family  and

professional lives, as many of us have found out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my women colleagues here have expressed their

worry  to  me  that this NMP scheme would only make  it  more

difficult  for  us to persuade women to stand for  elections.

This  scheme provides an easy alternative to be  here.   They

just  pop up in Parliament, all nice and neat, make a  speech

and  the  next day, they appear in the newspapers.   Whereas,

the  rest  of  us  have to slog it out on  the  ground,  hair

dishevelled,  pumping hands, staying at MPS late  at  nights,

attending countless grassroots meetings.  And for my  married

women colleagues, they go home and they have also to meet the

needs  of their families.  Often, we do our best work as  MPs

out of the limelight, championing the causes of our residents

conscientiously.  Hence, the concern that, if given a  choice

to  women, they would probably go for the NMP scheme than  to

join politics full-time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share this reservation. But I am also pragmatic.

Politics,  the  election  kind, is  still  seen  as  a  male-dominated  field in Singapore today.  Indeed,  I  have  heard

reservations expressed that if a strong woman candidate  were

to contest in a single seat against a weak male candidate, it

is  very hard to say whether the female would win even though

the  merit  is  with  her,  even though  she  is  a  superior

candidate in all aspects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our society is still a patriarchal one, I am often

reminded.   So,  given this patriarchal system  that  we  are

operating  under today, I would say that if  the  NMP  scheme

will  help  bring in more women and for them to  share  their

valuable  perspectives with us, then let them in.  With  more

female voices in Parliament, we can work better towards



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>



our  vision of a society where all citizens, including women,

live their lives experiencing justice and equality as a right

and not by grace or favour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started my speech by saying that I supported the

scheme because previous batches had proven its usefulness.  I

would  urge  the  Government to ensure that  the  quality  of

future  NMPs is not compromised even as it widens the  groups

to  be represented here.  Presently, the selection process is

not  transparent.   Can  the  Minister  assure  us  that  the

selection process is rigorous enough?  We must keep high  the

entry bar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, the usefulness of the scheme

depends   on  the  quality  of  the  NMPs.   They   must   be

intellectually honest, pro-Singapore and offer  useful  views

that will make for a better Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that we have this debate, if only to remind

the  NMPs that if and when they sit among us, it is  only  at

the  pleasure  of  a  strong Government  and  the  individual

elected MPs in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I urge my fellow MPs to vote for the

motion alongside with me.

<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, thank

you  for  allowing me the opportunity to participate in  this

debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was listening to Dr Tan Cheng Bock, I was very

disturbed  to realise that I am actually a major obstacle  to

the  NMP  scheme  because he said we  should  not  have  them

because  we have lawyers - I am a lawyer. We should not  have

them  because now we have more women - I am a woman.  And  we

should  not have them because we have more singles  -  guilty

also.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very disturbed, particularly, Mr Speaker, because

I  am going to support the motion.  Also because when Dr  Tan

described  the degree of hassle and the heat of  battle  that

one has to go through in elections, I was actually privileged

to  see  him  in action, because I was assigned to understudy

him during the elections at Ayer Rajah.   I must say that  is

why it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



gives me a certain degree of grief to be disagreeing with  Dr

Tan, because, in many respects, I regard him as my si fu.  Si

fu,  te  pui  chi,  but  this unworthy student  is  about  to

disagree with you.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that we do need to have NMPs in order to have

alternative   views   in  Parliament.    And   when   I   say

"alternative", I mean alternative here to the PAP.   We  have

<br><br>85&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of Parliament, out of which 82 are PAP and only  3

are  Opposition  MPs.   If  we had  more  Opposition  MPs  in

Parliament, my view might well be different.  But because  we

are such an overwhelming majority, I do think it is necessary

for us to have alternative views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three arguments have been made as to why we should not

have  NMPs.  The first is because, or as the allegation goes,

the Whip will be lifted, which will encourage more debate and

therefore  we  do  not  need NMPs.  It  is  true  that  every

Backbencher who sits here understands the need to speak up in

accordance  with our conscience.  But there is  a  difference

between  speaking up and voting, and in some cases  the  Whip

will  not be lifted.  So there is some value still in  having

NMPs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, no matter what we say, in the eyes of the

public,  we  are  still  such  an  overwhelming  majority  in

Parliament  that  we have 82 Members of  the  same  party,  I

think,  for the public, it is important for them to know  and

understand  that there are alternative views, and that  these

alternative  views  can  be aired  in  Parliament.   Make  no

mistake, I do not make any apology whatsoever for being  part

of  the  majority in Parliament.  I think it is in the nature

of  parliamentary democracy, especially party-based politics,

that every party tries its best to get as many of its members

as  possible into Parliament.  So I make no apology for being

part  of  the  majority.  But if you are a  majority,  it  is

necessary to hear from others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the NMPs agree with Government policies, so much the

better,  because it means that there are people,  other  than

party affiliated MPs, who agree with Government policies.  If

the NMPs do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>



agree with Government policies, so be it.  At least, we  have

heard from another voice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second argument is that we do not need NMPs because

we  have such good quality Backbenchers, especially this  new

batch.  Thank you, on behalf of all the new MPs who have come

in.  We may be good but I do not think we are that good, that

we  are able to cover the entire spectrum of views.  I  think

there  is  always room for alternative views  from  different

groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third argument is that NMPs are not elected and they

therefore do not have the mandate of the electorate.  That is

true,  but  they will not be here as representatives  of  the

electorate.   They will be here, if they are invited  in,  as

people  who  provide alternative views.  And as  long  as  we

understand  that, I think it does not matter that  they  have

not been elected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia said that the success of the NMP scheme

shows  the failure of the PAP MPs.  I do not agree with that.

I do not think there is any other government in the world who

actually  takes steps to invite people that are not of  their

party to come into Parliament and give alternative views.  So

I think the success of the NMP scheme is an indication of the

willingness  of  this  Government  and  this  party  to  hear

alternative views and to try its best to solicit from as many

areas as possible ideas that are good for Singapore.  So, the

crux  of  the matter really, as I see it, is that we  are  an

overwhelming majority.  We do need to hear alternative  views

and I therefore support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

initially,  I  did not intend to speak on the issue,  because

the  stand  of  the Workers' Party is clear.  We  oppose  the

introduction of NMPs in Parliament.  It is not  my  habit  to

repeat  what  I  have  said and argued,  as  they  have  been

recorded in the Hansard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, when I revisited the speech made by the

then First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>



Mr Goh Chok Tong, on the rationale of the introduction of the

NMP  scheme,  I  find that there are some interesting  points

worth  for the House to recall and consider before the  House

decides  whether  there  should  be  NMPs  in  this  term  of

Parliament.  The MP for Bishan-Toa Payoh, Mr Davinder  Singh,

just now said that perhaps we should look at whether there is

anything wrong with the NMP scheme in the past 10 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we should look at another perspective, ie,

whether  the NMP scheme has achieved its original objectives.

First  of all, let me quote Mr Goh, Prime Minister,  in  1989

[Hansard, 29th November 1989, Vol. 54, col. 695], he said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The aim of this Bill is to further strengthen our

political  system by offering Singaporeans more opportunities

for political participation  .'



Sir,  has our political system been strengthened in the  past

10  years  with  NMPs  in  this  House?   Has  the  political

participation of Singaporeans increased?  Strangely, Sir,  10

years  after  the  introduction  of  NMPs  to  generate  more

political participation, we are still hearing in the last few

days   about   how   the  Government  should   involve   more

Singaporeans in the remaking of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, according to Mr Goh, Prime Minister, the need

to  introduce  NMPs is because the Opposition is  inadequate.

He said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'After nearly one year's experience, the feedback is

that  the  two of them, ie, the two Opposition  MPs,  do  not

adequately express significant alternative views held outside

this Chamber.'  [Vol. 54, col. 698].

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He further added:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In 1984, despite a sharp drop in national support for

the  PAP,  a  drop of 13%, the PAP lost only two  seats.   In

1988, though the support level went down by 1% from 1984, the

PAP  lost only one seat.  In fact, it recovered one from  the

two  opposition seats which it lost in 1984.'  [Vol. 54, col.

704].

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Prime Minister conveniently forgot that the

primary  reason why the PAP was able to win back the seat  it

lost  in  1984  was  because Anson Constituency  held  by  my

party's former Secretary-General was redrawn into Tiong Bahru

GRC.  As a result, when I stood for my first



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>



election  there,  my  team, all new faces,  had  to  face  an

incumbent veteran MP, Mr Chng Jit Koon, who had been  the  MP

for  Tiong  Bahru  for  20 years.  I  believe  if  Anson  had

remained as a single seat constituency, the result could have

been  different.  Sir, for your information, Anson  today  is

part of Tanjong Pagar GRC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the PAP has found that the political system is not

ideal  and  that there is a need to strengthen the  political

system,  I  wonder  why  the PAP did not  face  this  problem

squarely,  as  it did with most problems, instead  of  having

NMPs.  Is it because the PAP does not consider the Opposition

as  part of the political system?  I also wonder why the  PAP

did  not  find  problems with the political system  and  take

issue  with  the lack of participation prior  to  1984,  when

there  was no Opposition in this House at all?  Why was there

this  sudden  wake-up call in wanting participation  and  the

introduction of the NMP scheme after 1988 when  there  was  a

substantial vote swing against the PAP?  Sir, I do  not  have

answers  to  these questions.  I leave it to Singaporeans  to

answer and to judge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason for introducing the NMP scheme is that

the NMP is politically non-partisan.  Mr Goh said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Nominated MPs are not Government MPs either. They

should and will be people who will vote as they think right.'

[Vol. 54, col. 700].

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I find that most of the NMPs voted with the PAP all

these  years.   Of  course, we have heard that  it  does  not

matter if they vote for the PAP.  But what was the purpose of

introducing  NMPs?  Yes, they have their views and  they  can

express their views eloquently, but I find that most  of  the

views  they  expressed were similar to the PAP's  views,  but

expressed  in  different style.  So I doubt whether  the  NMP

scheme has achieved its non-partisan objective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I do find that the NMPs have one useful

role  to  play, ie, because they are not PAP MPs,  when  they

criticise  or  attack the Opposition, they would  sound  more

convincing and would be more receptive to the public.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh, the then First Deputy Prime Minister, also

revealed interesting workings of the PAP.  He said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'PAP MPs often vote on issues, but this is done in

closed-door  party meetings.  Once a vote is  taken  and  the

decision  made,  they are expected to abide by  the  majority

decision.'  [Vol. 54, cols. 698-99].

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems to me that the real Parliament is actually

behind  the  PAP's closed-door meetings.  And the problem  is

that  they  are  not allowed to vote against  the  Government

unless the Whip is lifted, and this is one of the reasons for

bringing in NMPs who could vote freely to show dissent.  Sir,

now  that the Prime Minister has decided to lift the Whip   - I do not know  - but just now he said maybe not.  So I do not

know  whether the Whip is lifted or not lifted, not  only  on

this  NMP issue but for other issues for enlightened  debate.

If  that  is the case, is there a need for NMPs to  show  the

public that there is indeed sufficient dissent in Parliament?

Sir, the essence of parliamentary democracy, I understand, is

representation  of the people in the decision making  process

and  accountability.  I am quite surprised to hear  Mr  Singh

say  that he does not represent a constituency.  Perhaps  the

PAP  wants to explain to us their thinking and how they  feel

about  the  political system such that  they  can  walk  into

Parliament  without  being elected.   Anyway,  I  think  they

should go through the political system.  My understanding  is

that  Parliament is the highest decision making body  of  the

country.   So it is essential that those who are  present  in

Parliament  participate  in the decision  making  process  on

behalf of the people and be accountable to them.  I think  it

is  not simply a question of having their views, as what some

Members have said.  We can have their views, yes, but I think

we  are  here  not only to express our views.   We  are  here

representing the people and making decisions on their behalf.

We  must have some basis for representing the people and,  to

me,   "representing  the  people"  means  going  through  the

election  process.  If  not,  how  do  you  claim   you   are

representing  someone?   It  has got  to  be  some  electoral

process that you have gone through.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Government is sincere in wanting

participation  from  the people, wanting Singaporeans  to  be

concerned about the country and wanting Singaporeans to  take

ownership, and thereby feel that they are rooted here, and it

is  our  home,  I  think it is time that it  should  consider

seriously  either a proportional representation system  or  a

hybrid   system   of  first-past-the-post  and   proportional

representation system.  Is the PAP open enough for the  idea?

Or  we just shut the door immediately and say that the change

is  too  radical  and will weaken the Government  and  social

structure, etc, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us wait and see.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, imagine the nine Nominated MPs

are  now in Parliament, and we have heard our debates for the

last  five days, and 61 speakers have spoken, do our  Members

here want to hear another nine Nominated MPs speak up?  I  do

not think so.  They cannot contribute anything else.  Most of

the  points  would  have been already covered,  and  I  would

imagine  more eloquently than if the nine Nominated MPs  were

present.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally think that circumstances have changed. I

have been here 18 years and I can see this particular session

that  we  have just had is completely different from  what  I

have  seen  before in this Parliament.  The debates  are  not

only lively but of very high quality.  In fact, today we have

seen  PAP  MPs  debating vigorously against another  PAP  MP,

which  is  a very, very rare thing to see in this House.   So

things  will change with this Tenth Parliament, and  I  think

for this particular Tenth Parliament we certainly do not need

nine  more  Nominated  MPs.  I do not think  they  will  make

Parliament debates richer or of higher quality, which I think

we already have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike Dr Tan, who feels very strongly against NMPs

because  he  says that he has to fight through  the  election

hustings  to get into Parliament, whereas NMPs just  walk  in

through the backdoor without



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>



paying  the  price, well, I do not feel as  strongly  as  him

although  I fought a hard, vigorous election.  But my  reason

for  objecting  to having NMPs in this House is  not  because

they do not pay a price for it but because it undermines  the

very  system  that we believe in, and that  is  a  democratic

system.    In   some  countries,  they  do  not  call   their

legislatures   "Parliament";  they  call   them   "House   of

Representatives"  -  that is what made our  legislature  here

democratic.    Because   we   are  representatives   of   our

constituents, we are elected by them.  As for NMPs, they  are

not representatives.  They represent only themselves or, more

likely, represent the ruling party that selected them and put

them in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever Mr Davinder says, I still believe that we

represent  our  constituents,  and  the  people  want   their

representatives  in Parliament.  That was clearly  proven  by

one  NMP  who was highlighted in the papers.  He had  a  high

profile,  and he thought he could win easily at an  election.

He went to have a try - I think it was at Chua Chu Kang - and

he  just  got off by the skin of his teeth in not having  his

deposit  forfeited.  I think he obtained only 14%.   So  what

does that tell us?  That tells us that the voters do not want

an  NMP, although he had performed so well in Parliament.  He

was  rejected outright.  Singaporeans do not want Members  of

Parliament who are not voted by the constituents.  That was a

very,  very clear signal that the people do not want MPs  who

are not elected by them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right from the start, from 1989, I disagreed with this

scheme  because  I  think that the real reason  for  the  PAP

wanting NMPs is part of its election strategy.  They want the

NMPs to dilute the Opposition in Parliament, and I think they

also  read the ground rightly that people do want the PAP  to

rule  them  but, at the same time, they still want Opposition

voices  in  Parliament.  So they say,  "All  right.   PAP  is

ruling,  and at the same time we provide you with  Opposition

voices in the form of NMPs.".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the NMP scheme was announced, the NMPs were

supposed not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>



to   take  sides,  either  with  the  ruling  party  or   the

Opposition.  They were supposed to be the third voice, to  be

on  neutral ground.  But I have said before, there is no such

thing  as a third voice, or neutral.  Either you are  for  or

against an issue.  The other day we heard that the person who

stands in the middle of the road gets run down by a motorcar.

And  during the time of the cold war, some nations sided  the

Soviet  Union and others sided the US and the west, but  some

Asian  countries  conveniently said that they  were  neutral.

And the one time Secretary of State of the United States,  Mr

Dulles,  said,  "neutrality is immoral".   If  neutrality  is

really immoral, then there is no place for NMPs in Parliament

because  they cannot take the neutral ground or be the  third

voice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have debated for five days on the remaking of

Singapore.   It would appear that the Government  hopes  that

things  will  change, Singapore would open up a  bit,  people

will  speak up, entrepreneurs will be bred and help Singapore

out.   But  this  NMP scheme is not in sync with  this  whole

concept of the new Singapore.  NMPs are, firstly, not elected

MPs;  they  do not have to win the battles to have their  own

right to be in Parliament; they are appointed.  We are  in  a

way  going  back  to the authoritarian style  -  appointments

rather  than  open up and be democratic.   I  think  the  NMP

scheme  does not fit in with the times.  Times have  changed.

We  are going to see a new Parliament and it is going  to  be

changed.  As the Government has said, they are going to  lift

the  Whip more often and, I think, circumstances have changed

and therefore it will be for the greater good of Singapore if

there were no NMPs in Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Raymond Lim also argued that today NMPs are here for

the  national interest.  I can say that they are not for  the

national interest for the simple reason that they will  erode

our  belief in democracy, in representation, because they  do

not  represent anyone.  And if you erode democracy  and  make

people think that you do not need to elect your MPs, let  the

Government appoint them, it is going to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



a  wrong signal sent to the people of Singapore, and I do not

think that it is good for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the contributions of Prof. Walter Woon in

initiating the Maintenance of Parents Act, actually,  to  me,

as  a nation, I think we should not have this Act at all.  He

thinks  it  is  good; but I think it is bad.   What  sort  of

society  will  we become when the parents have to  sue  their

children  to get maintenance?  I think in Israel and England,

they  have  this  Act,  but after a while  people  became  so

shameful  about  the whole thing that that Act  just  died  a

natural  death.  I hope the Maintenance of Parents  Act  will

also  die  a natural death.  [Interruptions].  I suppose  you

are  waiting for the next NMP to do it.  [Interruptions].   I

said "you", not me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Davinder Singh has said that the quality of new MPs

is impeccable, and I entirely agree with him.  In fact, these

few  days, I look forward to hearing many of them speak.   So

if  we  have such good quality elected MPs, I certainly think

we  can leave NMPs out this round.  I think they will just be

redundant, occupying unnecessary spaces here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I end, I call for a division on this motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Davinder Singh:</b> Mr Speaker, may I have your

permission to raise a point by way of clarification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang and Mr Chiam See Tong have both

misunderstood  the point I made.  I did not say,  as  Mr  Low

claims, that I do not want to represent the residents of  Toa

Payoh and I did not say, as Mr Chiam claims, that we are  not

here  because  we  were not elected by the residents  of  our

constituencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is a different one. My point is that when you

stand up and make a speech in this House, you are accountable

not  only  to  your constituents, but you are accountable  to

every  single Singaporean.  You are accountable to  yourself,

to  your  family  and  to every single Singaporean.   So  the

proposition   that   you  are  only   accountable   to   your

constituents and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>



therefore only elected Members should sit in this House is  a

fiction.   Accountability is to everybody.  And  in  the  way

that  Mr  Low and Mr Chiam spoke about this motion, Mr  Chiam

and  Mr  Low  did  not speak on behalf of  the  residents  of

Hougang  and  Potong Pasir in rejecting  this  motion.   They

spoke,  I believe, in what they considered to be in the  best

interest  of  all Singaporeans when they speak  against  that

motion, not your residents only.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I cannot resist taking up a point by Mr Chiam just  now

when  he said he was going to wait for the next NMP  -  if  I

heard  him telling correctly - to introduce a Bill to  repeal

the Maintenance of Parents Act.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I say probably the next MP will

repeal it.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> You said "next NMP".

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> They asked me.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Yes, but you did say the

"next  NMP"  which  suggests that you are in  favour  of  the

scheme.   And I have to say that I have to address Mr Chiam's

very  serious  point  about Nominated Members  of  Parliament

undermining the system of democracy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think anyone with even a casual

knowledge of democracy and models of democracy would  realise

that  in Westminster, for example, we have the House of Lords

which  comprises non-elected Members and, in  fact,  they  do

have even non-partisan members sitting in which they call the

cross-benchers.  So the notion of Nominated MPs, as it  were,

is not unknown to the world of democratic governments.  So we

have  to  say  that  these two arguments would  not  wash  in

relation to whether we should have NMPs or not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may address the motion. I have to say that

when  I  first came to Parliament in 1997, I recall listening

to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>



eloquent speech of the hon. Member for Ayer Rajah against the

NMP scheme.  And I remember, with some trepidation, how I  am

going  to be able to match such eloquence, or even come close

to  such eloquence.  I remember, in particular, the array  of

reasons  he gave as to why we should not have such a  scheme.

And  I  took  the  liberty to list them  out  and,  strangely

enough, they also comprise the "magnificent seven" reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may digress a bit, Mr Speaker, when some Members of

this  House referred to our new MPs, the "magnificent seven",

I  have  to say that, if I remember the movie The Magnificent

Seven correctly and the Japanese version of Seven Samurai,  I

think  at the end of the film, only two survived.  So  may  I

wish  the  magnificent seven good luck and may the  best  man

win.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us turn to Dr Tan's seven magnificent reasons. May

I  be  so  bold as to take out the rhetoric and the eloquence

and  just  take them for what they are.  First, he said  that

the  NMPs  are  not risk-takers.  Second, that they  come  in

through  the  back  door  without having  to  go  through  an

election.  Third, they seldom, if ever, raise issues that are

not  already  raised by the elected MPs.  Fourth,  that  they

represent  no constituency and know very little, if anything,

about the feelings and views of the people.  Fifth, there  is

ample  supply of lawyers, accountants, doctors and we do  not

need more of them in this House.  And, sixth, that the couple

who did well, Prof. Walter Woon and Dr Kanwaljit Soin, cannot

be  taken  as  evidence of the success of the scheme,  and  I

remember the hon. Member saying that two swallows do not make

a  summer.  Finally, the seventh argument is that,  which  he

mentioned again just now, there may be difficulty in choosing

the  right  NMPs,  or,  for that matter,  ensuring  that  the

various interest groups are represented, or vice versa,  that

extremists may find their way in through such a scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these magnificent seven reasons which I think

we  must  try  to rebut if we want to support the  scheme,  I

think Mr Leong referred to the idea of shelf



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>



space and that as NMPs are not bound by the Party Whip,  they

are   often  given  much  better  coverage,  make  a   better

impression  on  the media, than the elected  MPs;   in  other

words, they make the elected MPs look dull, ordinary and even

boring.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are very powerful arguments indeed and they

have to be taken into account.  However, I have to say that I

have great personal discomfort in having to disagree with the

hon.  Member  for  Ayer Rajah and state  why  I  support  the

scheme.  First of all, we must be clear why the NMP scheme is

of  such value to the House.  To be clear about that, let  us

first  look  at what the elected Members are here  for.   The

elected  Members  represent their party in  the  House,  both

Opposition as well as the PAP.  We are elected on the party's

manifesto,  with promises made to the party as  to  what  the

voters can expect if they voted for us, the candidates of the

party.   That is also the reason why we have the  Party  Whip

because it is necessary to keep party discipline in the House

so as to make good on election promises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are elected on this basis, we must in

general   believe   in  supporting  the  party's   programme.

Otherwise, we might as well run as independents or  apply  to

be  NMPs.  Given that this is the case, I think it will be on

very  rare  occasions when the Whip is lifted,  or  on  where

personal  conscience dictates, that we, PAP  MPs,  would  not

support   a  piece  of  legislation  proposed  by   the   PAP

Government, especially when it is attempting to carry out the

programme  promised  to the people.   And  if  PAP  MPs  make

speeches  in  support  which  are  then  not  given  as  much

prominence as the NMPs who project a different point of view,

I do not think we need to feel apologetic.  That is something

which  we should expect the media to do, even though  we  may

not  agree  with  it.  The Minister's speech supporting  such

legislation is usually taken to state the policies  for  such

legislation and the MPs' speeches in support are just seen as

excess  baggage, no matter how interesting the  speech  might

otherwise have been.  We can only hope to persuade the  media

to  give us more attention, or as much attention as they give

to the NMPs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the NMPs, the NMP scheme is intended to

add  value  to  the debate precisely because they  offer  the

opportunity for non-partisan voices to be heard.   In  answer

to  Mr  Chiam, it is not really wrong for NMPs to agree  with

the  Government if they have good reasons for doing so.   The

point is that they are not bound by Party Whip, that they can

express their personal opinions as to what they think is  the

value  of  such  legislation.  So it is  not  that  they  are

sitting  on the fence if they agree or disagree.   They  will

take a position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I do think that NMPs take risks when they decide to

put  themselves up for Parliament.  I remember saying  so  to

Prof. Walter Woon, who was a colleague of mine at the Faculty

of  Law, when he came to talk to me about his intention to be

put  up  as  an NMP.  I remember telling him that the  public

would  scrutinise  him  and  that he  would  definitely  lose

privacy and that, as an NMP, as any MP, he would run the risk

of  looking ridiculous in public if he were to come  up  with

quirky  ideas.   He had not.  But we have on  occasions  seen

NMPs  coming  up with strange ideas.  But the point  is  that

they  take  individual responsibility  for  their  views  and

indeed  can be said to be at more risks because they  do  not

have  party  support.  And as for not having a  feel  of  the

ground,  sometimes, not always, I think that is  a  strength.

NMPs can concentrate on the merits of legislation instead  of

being  preoccupied with the political consequences which  may

impact adversely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said of the Maintenance of Parents Bill,

which  Prof.  Walter Woon introduced, and  Mr  Chiam  himself

pointed out that there were some fierce adverse comments from

Members of this House as well as from certain sectors of  the

public.  But, as an NMP, he can afford to do so because he is

responsible  only  for his views, he is himself,  but  he  is

acting in the interest of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NMPs also take an Oath of Allegiance to the Constitution

and  to  the people of Singapore to serve Singapore.  We  can

expect them to give off their best and, if they do not,  then

it is quite obvious what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>



consequences will occur.  But the success or failure  of  the

scheme  depends  very much on the quality of  the  candidates

willing to put themselves up for this.  Here, I would put  it

this  way.   For example, it is a common perception  of  many

that those who entered the Miss Singapore competition may not

be   the  most  beautiful,  charming  or  eloquent  women  in

Singapore.  There are many we know who prefer not to  display

their beauty and brains in competition.  In the same way,  if

our  most  intelligent, independent and  non-political  minds

were not persuaded to come forward to participate in the  NMP

scheme, then it would be time to re-examine the scheme.  But,

as  of  now,  I  would agree entirely with  my  Parliamentary

colleague,  Mr Davinder Singh, that the time has  passed  for

questioning whether on principle such a scheme is correct.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme has produced excellent MPs who have added

much  value  to the debates in this House and we  should,  in

this  Parliament, continue to support the scheme so  long  as

there  are  good people who can contribute their non-partisan

views  publicly.  Their non-partisan support  for  Government

policies  and legislation will be reassuring to Singaporeans.

And  if  they do object to legislation, then Ministers  would

have  to take that into account.  All in all, I believe  very

strongly  that  it  can only improve the general  quality  of

Parliament  and Government in Singapore.  And  to  borrow  an

analogy  from Dr Wang Kai Yuen, if we can have a rose garden,

why  not have different types of roses, rather than just  red

roses  or  white roses.  Why not have yellow roses also?   It

makes for a nicer garden.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): To put it frankly,

just as Dr Tan Cheng Bock has said, we, the elected MPs, have

come  in  from  the  main door.  We have  gone  through  very

vigorous   battles  and  had  to  fight  off  the  Opposition

candidates  to  win our rights to represent our  constituents

here.  Put it in a more dramatic way, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>



were  like what the Chinese classics would describe,  guo  wu

guan,  zhan  liu jiang - crossing five strategic  passes  and

slaughtering  six generals. On the other hand, our  Nominated

MPs  were  carried  in on sedan chairs.   They  need  not  go

through the battles.  Honestly, seeing them coming in in such

a  glamourous and easy manner, if you say you are not envious

and  feel  like banging your chest, I think you are  probably

not telling the truth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have to think very seriously about it. What

contributions  have  Nominated MPs made to  Parliament?   Are

they hua she tian zu (draw a snake and add feet to it) or jin

shang tian hua (add flowers to the brocade)?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is to add something to the existing system like

adding  feet  to the snake, it is like what the Hokkien  will

say:  "kay kiang" - pretending to be smart.  Having  drawn  a

snake,  why would you want to add some legs to it?   You  are

doing  something superfluous. But, if it is  jin  shang  tian

hua,  that  you  are adding flowers to a beautiful  piece  of

brocade,  we  are  making  it even more  beautiful  with  3-D

effect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nominated MPs and the elected MP have raised

different voices, coming from different backgrounds.   To me,

elected  MPs  and Nominated MPs are like people holding  pink

ICs   and  blue  ICs  respectively,  that  is,  citizens  and

permanent  residents.   The  NMPs  are  contributing  to  our

parliamentary system like the permanent residents contributed

to our nation building and both are adding value to us.  I do

not  agree  with Dr Tan Cheng Bock that, as a  labour  MP  or

union  leader,  I  had  to feel bad when  Nominated  MPs  are

invited  to  come into this House as representatives  of  the

labour movement.  Does it mean that I am not doing my job?  I

do  not  think  so.   Having  other  union  leaders  here  as

Nominated MPs, will only make our good work here even better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Tan Cheng Bock has said, we need to have people

from  different  educational and  family  backgrounds  coming

here.   All these union grassroots leaders who were  promoted

from  the  rank and file are in a better position to  reflect

the opinions of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>



the  workers.   If you look at the previous batches  of  NMPs

from  the labour movement, we can see very clearly that  they

have   brought   in   alternative  views   and   constructive

suggestions from the workers.  I think it is value  added  to

our  whole  parliamentary  system.   Their  contribution   is

definitely not like adding legs to the snake.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since the Nominated MPs come in by a sedan

chair, we have to be very careful when we are carrying  them.

They  are  different from us because they do not have  to  go

through  the  General Elections and win the  mandate  of  the

voters to come in.  So, I agree with Dr Tan Cheng Bock   that

we  have  to  be more stringent  in our selection system,  so

that there will not be any black sheep slipping  in from  the

crevices.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I have your permission to

seek a point of clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Yeo has said that

the   Nominated  MPs  are  adding  value  and  they  are  not

redundant.   If  you  look at these two  idioms  he  uses  to

illustrate his points:  jing shang tian hua and hua she  tian

zu, can he tell us what is the difference between them?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If you draw a snake

and put legs on it, then it is no longer a snake.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I have just got

one  small  point  to make.  I support the motion.   We  have

heard  that there are NMPs who have made useful contributions

and many did not too and they just occupied the seats in this

House.  So I would urge the Special Select Committee and  the

Leader of the House that when we implement the NMP system  in

this  round, let us not just fill up all the nine seats  that

we  have.  If it means it is two, it means two.  If there are

four  who qualify out of five, then let it be that,  and  not

just  stretch to nine to make up the number.  Because in  the

last round, I think we have seen the quality dropping.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can we have one last speaker, please?

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, I know it is

getting late, so I will keep it very short.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I hear the arguments and the debate itself, it

appears to me that the issue of the NMP scheme sounds  a  bit

like the issue of foreign talent.  I think Mr Chiam said that

NMPs  drown the voice of the elected Members.  So it  is  the

same  argument,  that foreign talents dilute  local  talents.

Some  said that the NMPs have no constituency and, therefore,

they  cannot  speak for the people.  It is the same  argument

that   the  foreign  talents  do  not  know  Singapore   and,

therefore, cannot work for Singapore.  There is also  someone

who  said  that  NMPs have never fought the  GE  itself  and,

therefore,  they do not have the emotional rootedness,  which

is  the same argument that foreign talents would just pack up

and go.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I disagree with these arguments because I support

the  foreign  talent issue itself.  The NMPs, by adding  them

on,  will  not  drown  out the voice of the  elected  Members

unless, of course, the elected Members themselves choose  not

to  speak.   In terms of media space and so on, if  they  can

stir  up  a  very good argument that promotes debate  itself,

then  perhaps  the media can consider giving us  more  space,

rather than limited to that number of pages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of constituency, I would say that although they

do  not  represent a constituency, they do come from  certain

associations or representations.  In that sense, they can  be

contributing to the debate itself with perhaps a  little  bit

more  depth  on specific issues.  As for the fact  that  they

never  fought  GE  and,  therefore,  they  do  not  have  the

emotional rootedness, we also know of the same NMP  who  then

went  to  fight the elections and garnered only 14 votes.   I

think he must have gone through -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> 14%.

<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low:</b> 14%, yes, I am sorry. I did not mean

to insult him.  14% of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



votes.   He  must have thought that, after going through  the

parliamentary  process and so on, he has more to  contribute.

I do agree, however, that the process of selection itself has

to  be  more diligent.  We have to be careful about  whom  we

want  to  speak for and which constituent is not represented.

I  think Mr Steve Chia actually mentioned that the youths and

so  on are not represented in the voting process because they

are under 21 and perhaps they are the group of people whom we

want to represent.  Then, of course, there are other minority

voices that we need to hear.  So I would think that, yes,  if

we  can  broaden some of these selection criteria on the  one

hand  and make sure that it is not just based on some  people

who  have academic excellence but that they have really  done

something in some associations, even if they do not have that

kind  of  academic excellence, we can bring  them  into  this

House, so that the various groups have a voice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, I would like to remind this House

that,  earlier on, Mr Chan Soo Sen spoke about "lu san dian",

ie, the three points that he talked about, that we have to be

"xin  xiong kwang yi dian", "guang huai duo yi dian" and "dan

zi da yi dian", which relate to taking risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that light, I would say that, yes, one, let us be

"dan zi da yi dian", ie, take some risks.  In retrospect, the

NMPs  have  indeed contributed to the debates in this  House.

Will they do more harm?  I think we have to be "dan zi da  yi

dian" and take a little bit of risk there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, "xin xiong kwang yi dian". I think if we do not

view  it  as a zero-sum game but that the net result of  this

debate itself can add on to the validity of some of the Bills

that  are  passed  or even the debates in  this  House,  then

Parliament and Singaporeans at large will actually benefit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, "guang huai duo yi dian". If in a

spirit  of  wanting  to involve more people  in  the  process

itself  we involve more people in the form of NMPs  who  will

also be getting the voice from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



their own represented groups of people, then I think we  will

all  strive  towards a much better society and a much  better

Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, can I make three

clarifications?  Two are in regard to the last speaker,  Miss

Penny  Low.   What  I  said  was that  the  NMPs  dilute  the

Opposition in Parliament, and not dilute the elected Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of my bringing up the instance of an NMP

standing for election where he obtained only 14% of the votes

and  of  course  lost  the  election  was  not  to  show  his

contribution,  but  the  fact that he  was  rejected  by  the

electorate.   In  other  words, my point  is  that  NMPs  are

rejected by the voters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clarification is with regard to Assoc. Prof.

Chin.   I  do not support the NMP scheme.  I brought  up  the

point  that  the next NMP, if he comes along,  could  move  a

motion  to  repeal the Maintenance of Parents Act  because  I

think  the Leader of the House asked me to repeal  it  and  I

said no.  I said the next one who comes along.  I assume that

this motion will probably be passed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, can I have a clarification on

Mr  Chiam's  point?  Sir, Mr Chiam said that NMPs dilute  the

Opposition.   I am from the Opposition.  I do not  feel  that

way.   Sir, I am prepared to face whatever challenge, whether

NMP or whatever.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I did say that Parliament will

be different from now on.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, that is one. Secondly, he

mentioned  about the NMP who participated in the election  in

Chua  Chu  Kang  and was rejected.  Sir, I have  a  different

point  of view.  For the MPs who have been here for 10 years,

we  have  seen many NMPs.  At least there is one NMP who  was

prepared  to  say, "OK, I am prepared to stand  for  election

since  I am somehow interested in politics."  Sir, the  point

is - I was in the Special Select



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



Committee  for  NMPs  - sometimes, when  we  go  through  the

interviews,  what  crosses my mind is: why are  these  people

prepared  to  be NMPs but are not prepared to participate  in

the political process?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low, do you know that you are making

another speech?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> No, Sir, I have a clarification on

the  points made.  What I am saying is that perhaps we should

not  look  at the NMP who only had 14% of the votes as  being

rejected.   The last thing we want is for the NMP  scheme  to

become  something that encourages NATO, ie, no  action,  talk

only.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my name keeps

cropping up every time when -

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Tan, are you making another speech or

are you asking for a clarification?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think there are

certain  points  that  have been  raised,  at  least  I  must

respond.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No, you cannot. Either you ask for a

clarification or you do not.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Can I seek clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If you seek clarification, yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Thank you. I do not know who spoke.

There  were  so many.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I think  there  is  a

difference between personality and policy.  Some Members  who

addressed this issue to me, did mention some of the good -

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Tan, I am still waiting for your

clarification.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, my clarification is that these

people must make a clear distinction between personality  and

policy   when   they  bring  this  matter  up.    The   other

clarification is that I am not so obstinate as Kai Yuen said.

I  support  the NCMP, so I am not so stubborn as  the  Member

thinks I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>



am.  The other point is that there are many avenues -

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Tan, I must insist that you clarify or I

will rule you out of order.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> I do not know who spoke -

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Point of order, Sir. I do not think

Dr  Tan is quite clear about what he wants to ask.  Maybe  he

should go back and think about the kinds of clarification  he

wants  to seek, whom he wants to seek from and then ask  that

person.  Otherwise, we can be here befuddled about what he is

thinking about.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes. Mr Wong, do you want to wrap up?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I am quite clear, Sir. This is the

third  time  I am doing this, and I have heard  many  of  the

arguments  before.   I spent the whole of  last  night  going

through this fairly thick file which the Parliament Librarian

was  very  kind  to photocopy for me, and I am very  familiar

with  the arguments.  In fact, if Members were to go  through

the  same  Hansard, they would have noted that  Dr  Tan  made

these same arguments in the Hansard reports in 1989, 1992 and

1997.   So  I  will  not go through all  these  points  again

because Members can find my answers there too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one point which is not quite clear to many

Members  and that the Prime Minister himself has answered  it

quite eloquently way back in 1989 when he was explaining  the

meaning  of Parliament and parliamentary democracy.  And  the

Prime Minister took some time to research into the meaning of

these  terms and quoted one paragraph from this  book  by  Mr

Stanley  de  Smith  on the Constitutional and  Administrative

Law,   which  said:  "At  common  law,  Parliament,  as   the

legislative body, consists of the House of Commons, the House

of Lords and the Queen", and that, of course, is in reference

to the British Parliament, the mother of all parliaments.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other parliaments, eg, in Malaysia, they too have a

similar provision in Article 44 of the Constitution, where it

says:  "The legislative authority of the Federation shall  be

vested  in  Parliament, which shall consist of the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Agong  and two Majlis (Houses of Parliament)  to  be

known  as  the  Dewan Negara (Senate) and  the  Dewan  Rakyat

(House of Representatives)."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in our case, we have the Constitution that

provides  for the legislature that consists of the  President

and  Parliament, and we have a unicameral Parliament.  We  do

not have a two-tiered Chamber.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the other parliaments, eg, the British Parliament,

Malaysian  Parliament  or even, if I may  call  the  Canadian

Parliament  the  daughter of the mother of  all  parliaments,

they too have an unelected Chamber called the Senate.  105 of

the  Senators are totally unelected.  In fact, in the British

House  of Lords, 713 of the Lords were totally unelected  and

yet  they  have  as  much or, if not,  a  lot  of  authority,

including coming up with new Bills and passing Bills  in  the

House of Lords.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will not belabour this point. I just clarify

that,  indeed, there are different ways that we can structure

a  parliament  and,  in  our case, it is  just  a  unicameral

Parliament  and  we have devised a scheme to allow  unelected

Members  to  be  brought  into  this  Chamber.   That  is  an

interesting device because we have allowed others to come  in

and  take part in our debate, which otherwise they would  not

have been because we do not have a second Chamber.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because of the way that we have been evolving our

parliamentary system that we have NCMPs too.  So I  am  quite

puzzled  as  to  why  Mr  Steve Chia would  want  to  object,

because,  following the same purist principle,  which  he  so

strongly  supported Dr Tan for, then he should not  be  here,

because he is also unelected.  He came in by the grace of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



PAP  Government that changed the Constitution  that  provided

for the NCMP system that allowed him to be here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I also hope that Mr Steve Chia would not begin to

speak  like  a PAP MP because, if he does, then  people  will

really be confused.  The Whip is not applied to him.  He does

not need to talk about the Whip at all.  So whether we have a

Whip  or not is our internal Party business.  So he does  not

need  to  remind our MPs that they are not subjected  to  the

Whip.  He himself is not subjected to any Whip at all at  any

time, unless Mr Chiam wants to impose it on him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam's argument, about people rejecting the NMP, is

really a great leap of imagination.  I do not understand  how

an  individual,  having been here as an NMP, eventually  went

out  and  contested in an election and got  rejected  by  the

people,  rejected him because they do not want him to  be  an

elected MP, means that they do not like the NMP system,  that

is beyond me.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I clarify?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sure.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I would like to make two

clarifications with the Leader of the House.   The  first  is

regarding  the  NCMP.  The Leader says that an  NCMP  is  not

elected  but the issue is not whether he is elected  or  not.

The   issue   that  I  brought  up  is  that   democracy   is

representation.   But, in his case, to some  extent,  he  has

representation, about 35% of the votes.  Even the first NCMP,

Mr  J  B Jeyaretnam, I think, had 44% of the votes in a  GRC.

The  issue is representation, and not whether he is the first

to pass the post and he has obtained 50%.  That is my point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is regarding Chia Shi Teck. He lost

when be obtained only 14% of the votes.  My point is not that

he  dares  or  he wants to present himself in  the  electoral

process.  My point is that he was a high profile NMP, and the

newspapers gave him a lot of coverage.  So he went  to  stand

for  elections on the strength of his reputation as  an  NMP,

and on that score,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



he  lost.  So my conclusion is that the people do not want an

NMP.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I

clarify?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Wong, are you giving way?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, the Leader of the House

said I am a purist.  I am not a purist.  I did not object  to

the  scheme of NCMP but my argument is that:  do we  need  to

have  NMPs  in the House in this first session of Parliament?

My argument is that we do not need to, because the Government

could  show their sincerity in their action by allowing their

people to speak up even more.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> If I remember Mr Steve Chia

correctly, when he was talking about this point, he said that

we do not need the NMP scheme at this time and that after two

years,  if  it  shows  that the elected  MPs  did  not  prove

themselves, then let us bring back the NMPs.  Maybe he should

read  the  Constitution.   The Constitution,  in  the  Fourth

Schedule, says that at the beginning of every term and within

six  months,  which is now, Parliament must resolve  to  have

NMPs.   Once  we  go  beyond six months, and  we  do  not  so

resolve,  we  cannot  have any more NMPs  during  this  Tenth

Parliament.   He would have no chance to come back  here  and

introduce a motion to get back NMPs unless he gets elected in

the Eleventh Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on the issue of representation. In our system,

representation means "first-past-the-post".  It means that  a

candidate  must  get 50% plus one vote,  then  he  gets  into

Parliament.   He may get 49.99%, but he is still  voted  out.

So  he has no representation at all.  Mr Steve Chia does  not

represent  34%  of  the people who voted for  him.   He  just

received 34% of the votes and, therefore, he has not the same

right  as  Mr  Chiam has to be here.  And  he  came  in  here

because we have a system to allow NCMPs to come in here.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang raised a more serious point. Apart

from  the  reasons  he  cited,  he  said  that  the  original

objectives why we should have NMPs were not really fulfilled.

I do not think that is the case because, if that is the case,

we would not be talking about NMPs here.  If NMPs show up the

inadequacy of the Opposition, then that has got nothing to do

with  us.   It just means that the Opposition just  does  not

have   enough   numbers.   And  if  the  NMPs  outshine   the

Opposition, then the Opposition has got to work very hard the

next  time.   They have got to find other ways of  convincing

people.  Following the same argument that Mr Chiam is worried

that  NMPs  dilute the Opposition, I think  that  is  a  real

reason  for  him to fear why we should not have  NMPs,  which

also  means that he has got to work very hard the  next  time

round  to  find people to join him and be convinced to  their

cause.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mr Low's serious point is that if we want to talk

about  getting  more representation and more views,  why  not

change our political system to proportional representation or

have a mixed system.  Do not forget that Singapore is a small

country,  a  multi-racial and multi-religious  country.   The

moment  we have a proportional representation system, we  are

going   to  have  different  sectional,  communal,  religious

interests represented in this system.  Then we are  going  to

have a very unstable system.  In Western Europe, many of  the

Parliaments  there  do  have  a  proportional  representation

system.   As  a result, you can see that, as far  as  policy-making  is  concerned,  and  as  far  as  the  government  is

concerned,  it has not progressed that far.  It becomes  very

difficult for decisions to be made, for laws to be passed and

a lot of trade-offs and compromises would have to be made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one country that attempted a mixed system,

which is proportional representation plus the first-past-the-post  system, and that is New Zealand.  In the same way, they

have  almost  ground  to  the ground  -  very  difficult  for

policies  to  be  passed and laws to be  made.   In  a  small

Singapore, where we have so many constraints, we have so  few

alternatives



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



and choices and only one or two ways of deciding on a policy,

we  do not have that luxury of choice.  We should think  very

seriously  before we change the system.  But  that  does  not

mean  to  say that political systems should not  change.   We

have.   We  have evolved over the years to allow  for  NCMPs,

NMPs  and  GRCs  where all races can be represented  in  this

Parliament.   Were  there  further changes?   Of  course,  we

changed   the  Presidential  system.   We  have  an   Elected

President to ensure that certain safeguards are in  place  to

protect  our reserves, veto key appointments and certain  key

decisions of the Executive, like the ISA detention.  We would

change,  but  we  should not rush into just  overhauling  and

changing  the system completely that we become unbalanced  to

the detriment of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just covered very briefly the few points made by

Members.  I have to come back here every term to ask for this

motion to be passed and even then, in the Fourth Schedule, it

says that NMPs can be appointed for two years, which means if

Parliament lasts the full five years, then we have  to  start

the  process  of selecting NMPs three times during  the  full

five-year  term.   I am going to propose, at  an  appropriate

time, a change to this 2-year term, to stretch it out to 21/2

years or 3 years so that, within one Parliamentary term of  5

years,  we  only  need  to do it twice.   Otherwise,  if  you

remember,  like  the last term, we had NMPs who  only  served

about  one  month or so, yet we have to go through the  whole

process  of  public advertisement, inviting  members  of  the

public  to send in nominations and interviewing them, and  so

on.   This is an administrative change which I will  have  to

put  forward  to Parliament at an appropriate  time  when  we

amend the Constitution.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> May I make a point of

clarification, Mr Speaker?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Make it short.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I expected the answer from the

Minister on proportional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



representation.  But I would like to ask him:  do we not have

confidence  in  the people because you are worried  that  the

system  will  generate issues such as race  and  instability?

Eventually, does the Minister agree that it is a process  and

it is a question of whether Singaporeans are mature enough?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, he talks about other countries having the

system.   I  thought  the PAP always says we  are  different.

When  are  we different and when are we the same  with  other

countries?  Is it at your convenience, you cite examples  and

you decide?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, it is not a question of whether

we  have  confidence  in our people or not.   I  believe  our

people are sophisticated enough.  But in every society, there

will  be  extremist elements who will try and there  will  be

groups of people who will believe in them and, therefore,  we

must not provide such opportunities for groups and for people

like  that to gather together and find a seat in this  place.

That  is precisely the worry that Dr Tan Cheng Bock has, that

when  we select NMPs, we may invariably or unwittingly  bring

in  an extremist.  We hope that will not happen because every

time  we have a list of NMP candidates, we circulate the list

to  all  MPs for their comments and views.  If by any chance,

Members  know  any of them who holds certain  views  that  we

should  not entertain in this House, then they must  register

their  points  strongly  with the Special  Select  Committee.

That vote, in a sense, is with Members to tell us who the NMP

candidates are and why they should not be here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as standards are concerned, we will maintain the

standards.   We have to maintain standards.  Of course,  much

depends on the kind of people we have coming forward.  If  we

cannot  find nine good men or women, then we shall  not  have

nine  of  them.  We shall have a fewer number, so be assured.

Last  time round, we only have eight.  We will make sure that

our standards are maintained.  If, unfortunately, one of them

did  slip  in,  because either we do not  know  the  person's

background or he did not show it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>



earlier, then in one term, we will find that out and he  will

not be around the next.  That is very simple.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When do we learn from other people and when do we not

learn  from other people?  We cannot have hard and fast rules

about what to take and what not to take.  We have got to  see

whether  it is useful for us.  If it suits our circumstances,

our social context, then we should take these ideas.  If they

do  not,  then  we  should not graft them  into  our  system.

Otherwise, we will be the worse in for it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is, "That this Parliament, in

accordance  with  section (1) of the Fourth Schedule  to  the

Constitution  of  the  Republic of Singapore,  resolves  that

there  shall  be nominated Members during the  term  of  this

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those who are of the opinion say "Aye".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Aye.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> To the contrary say "No."

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will hon. Members who support a division

please rise in their places?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong, Mr Chiam See Tong, Mr Leong

Horn  Kee, Mr Low Thia Khiang, Dr Tan Cheng Bock and Dr  Lily

Neo rose.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, we will take a Division. Before I

proceed  to start the electronic voting, Members are reminded

that  they  are  to press "Present" on their electronic  unit

located  at  the left armrest before indicating  their  vote.

Those  who fail to press "Present" will not have their  votes

recorded.  Voting will be open for 45 seconds from  the  time

"Voting  in  Progress"  is  flashed  on  the  display  board.

Members   are  reminded  to  check  their  names   and   vote

indications  posted on the display board after the  close  of

the  voting.  If a Member is of the opinion that his vote has

been taken in error or has been recorded wrongly, he may rise

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



request  the Chair to have his vote taken correctly, provided

that  such  request  is made before the  Chair  declares  the

result of the Division.  You may now proceed to vote.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Division taken: Ayes, 58; Noes, 5; Abstention, Nil.
