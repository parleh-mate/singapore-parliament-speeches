<div align="center"><b>EMISSIONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE PER CAPITA</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Singapore's ranking)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for the Environment

how  Singapore  ranks  in the emissions of  carbon  dioxide  per

capita,  in  comparison to other countries and what efforts  are

being made to reduce the emissions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for the Environment (Encik

Sidek  bin  Saniff) (for the Minister for the Environment):   Mr

Speaker, Sir, Singapore ranked 24th in the world in terms of per

capita  carbon dioxide emission in 1995, based on  a  comparison

between our carbon dioxide emission figures and data compiled by

a  US-based  agency.   Our  per capita emission  is  lower  than

countries such as the USA, Canada, Japan, Germany, Denmark,  the

UK as well as Australia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, power generation accounts for half of the

carbon  dioxide emission, and industries and road transportation

account for much of the remaining 50%.  A wide range of measures

taken  over  the  years has helped to keep down  carbon  dioxide

emissions from these sources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In power generation, new technology and greater efficiency

in  generation  have meant more electricity being produced  from

the  same  unit  of fossil fuel.  As the use of natural  gas  in

place  of fuel oil can reduce carbon dioxide emission by  up  to

25%,  we  are  planning  to  use  more  natural  gas  for  power

generation in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much effort has also gone into improving energy use

efficiency.   The Public Works Department has laid  down  energy

conservation standards aimed at promoting energy-saving building

designs.    The   Public   Utilities  Board   conducts   regular

educational   programmes   and  training   courses   on   energy

conservation.   It  also  conducts energy  audits  to  help  the

industrial and commercial sectors identify oppor-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>



tunities for energy efficiency improvements.  My

Ministry, together with the Ministry of Finance, has introduced

a tax incentive scheme to encourage the corporate sector to

replace energy-inefficient equipment and to invest in energy-efficient technologies.  Thus far, nine companies have benefited

from this scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land transport sector, our vehicle ownership policy,

in  combination with our very energy-efficient public  transport

system, has moderated fuel consumption by motor vehicles.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, given that our

Government's figures show a relatively lower emission per capita

for  Singapore, will our Government take steps to release  these

figures  widely  and  the efforts we are making,  especially  to

rebut those who believe Singapore emits a much higher figure?

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Sir, the Ministry has been

liaising  with  the  national  agency,  which  publishes  carbon

dioxide emission figures, to point out the inaccuracies  in  the

figures for Singapore.  We have likewise given the facts to  our

local  media.  I am quite sure the Member was referring to World

Wide Fund (WWF) for Nature where they put down ours as about  35

tonnes  per capita, whereas ours is only 8.2, almost as good  as

New  Zealand.   So  we have corrected that  part  by  using  the

standard  accepted, ie, IPCC measurement.  And IPCC  measurement

is a measurement recognised and accepted by all.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> May I ask the Senior Minister of State, if

Singapore  is supportive of the Climate Change Convention,  what

is  our position as regards adopting voluntary limits as a  more

advanced developed country?

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Sir, Singapore supports the UN

Framework  Convention on Climate Change.   The  Kyoto  Protocol,

under the Convention, called for the industrialised countries to

limit their emission.  This does not include the industrialising

country.  Singapore, being a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>



developing country, will see its emission grow as

it develops and industrialises further.  So my Ministry is of

the opinion that it is not appropriate for Singapore to address

the issue on voluntary limits when we have not arrived.

<div align="center"><b>MEDICAL REGISTRATION ACT</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Compulsory voting of election of Singapore Medical Council</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>members)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Health if he will

consider   introducing   legislation  to   amend   the   Medical

Registration Act where the issue of a practising certificate and

the  compulsory voting at election of Singapore Medical  Council

members are coupled.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Aline K. Wong)</b>

<b>(for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, voting has been

made  compulsory  at  the  elections of  the  Singapore  Medical

Council  members under the Medical Registration Act 1997.   This

is  because the Council, being the governing body of the medical

practitioners,   must  represent  the  medical   profession   in

Singapore.  In the past, when voting was voluntary,  only  about

10%  to 15% of the eligible doctors voted.  Such a small turnout

cannot   represent  the  entire  electorate  among  the  medical

profession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been made clear to all the doctors that those who

are  not able to vote with a valid reason need only to write  in

and  inform the Council.  The penalty for those who do not  vote

and  who are unable to provide a valid reason is a fine of $500.

I  believe doctors are responsible professionals and we  do  not

have  to  resort to imposing the penalty.  In fact,  during  the

recent  election  conducted from 28th October  to  1st  November

1998, more than 90% of the doctors voted.  For those who did not

vote,  the main reason was that they were overseas.  This  is  a

valid reason and no further action will be taken against them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council will hold back the renewal of a doctor's

practising  certificate only when he does  not  vote  without  a

valid  reason and when he also fails to pay the penalty.   There

is no need to amend the Medical Registration Act on this matter.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> May I ask the Senior

Minister of State if it is not too severe to cut off the

livelihood of doctors just because they do not participate in

the voting for the few representatives to the Medical Council?

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> As I have explained to the Member, if a doctor

did not vote, but he had a valid reason for not voting, he would

not be subject to a penalty.  If he did not have a valid reason,

but  he  paid the fine of $500, then no further action would  be

taken against him.  In my view, I think this is very reasonable.

As  I  said, the doctors are responsible professionals.  I think

most of them would want to exercise the right to vote.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Senior Minister of State if she

would  consider just meting out the monetary penalty alone being

sufficient to compel all doctors to vote for the representatives

to the Medical Council?

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> I think the monetary penalty is not the point.

The  point  is  that  doctors should take the responsibility  to

vote.   If you say the $500 is too severe or too heavy,  then  I

would have to ask you: what would be a sufficient amount of fine

in order to ensure doctors would vote?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, does the Senior Minister of

State  think  that  it  is  equitable to  deregister  a  medical

practitioner if he does not vote and refuse to pay up the  fine?

Is  our professional practice based on whether or not the doctor

is  committed to vote in the future?  And is this tantamount  to

saying  that if a citizen refuses to vote or has no valid reason

not  to participate in the voting, he might lose his citizenship

as well?  It looks as if it is going to be the same case.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Is it equitable? As I said, doctors in the past

had  felt that they needed to be represented adequately  on  the

Medical  Council and therefore they valued the  vote.   But  the

trouble  is,  in the past, when voting was not made  compulsory,

only  10%  to 15% of them ever turned up to vote.  In  the  end,

they felt that the number of members elected did



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>



not represent them.  So it is a chicken and egg

question.  So, we say, if you value the vote, you should all

turn up to vote.  And the way to make you come to vote is to tie

that up with some penalty which is heavy enough that you feel

there is a pinch.  But the money is not the question.  I must

clarify that when a doctor fails to vote, his practising right

is not revoked there and then.  It is only when he renews his

practising certificate, he may not be given the permission.  So

he can pay up the penalty.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I have no quarrel with compulsory

voting.   My question is whether or not it is fair to  link  the

voting  to  the  renewal of certificate.  Can a doctor  practise

without renewing his practising certificate?

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> The linking of compulsory voting with the

practising  certificate is not limited to the medical profession

alone.   Even in health matters, for self-employed people,  they

are  required to pay Medisave.  If they do not pay up, then  the

renewal  of their business licences could also be held  up.   So

this rule is not peculiar to the medical profession.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is exactly what I am

objecting.   Why should we be linking everything  to  a  penalty

which  would  affect  a  person's  livelihood  and  professional

practice?  Is it equitable in the first place?

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> As I said, this is really an incentive for

people  to  come and vote.  So if the livelihood is so important

to them, by all means pay the penalty if you cannot vote.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid this is only

an  administrative  expediency.  But the principle  involved  is

whether it is equitable.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may  I ask the Senior Minister of State whether any attempt  has

been  made  to find out why doctors have failed to vote  in  the

past?  Has any study or census been taken?  They



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>



may have very good reasons.  Maybe they think that

the Medical Council is not effective enough for them.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Many of the doctors who failed to vote, when

voting  was not compulsory in the past, did so because they  did

not bother to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Have you made any attempt to find out why they

have  not bothered?  That is my question.  Could you please  try

and answer the question?

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> My answer is yes, of course, we have attempted

to find out.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> This is becoming a fact of life in Singapore

which is what we are against, and I support everything that  has

been said by my Party Member for Hougang.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your question, Mr Jeyaretnam?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The question is this: Singapore citizens seem to

be living under one compulsion or another all their lives.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is the question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is that desirable in a society where people

should decide for themselves?

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not see the relevance

of this to the question asked by Dr Lily Neo.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> The Senior Minister of State has my

sympathies.   I  think  the  Medical  Council  has  powers   and

therefore needs good officers and therefore responsible  voting.

May  I  ask the Senior Minister of State how many practitioners,

in  fact,  have been knocked off and what serious obstacles,  if

any, are there to voting?

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> This is the first time that we are

exercising  this Act which requires compulsory  voting.   During

the  exercise  in  October,  out of a  total  of  4,866  doctors

eligible to vote, 90.2% turned up to vote.  The majority of  the

477 doctors who did not turn up to vote were overseas.  There



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>



were also some doctors on medical leave.

Therefore, so far, nobody has been struck off the register.

<div align="center"><b>TEST RUN OF ELECTRONIC ROAD PRICING SYSTEM</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Compensation to motorists charged accidentally)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Communications

whether the Government has compensated those motorists who  were

charged  accidentally  in the test run of  the  Electronic  Road

Pricing System on 28th August 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Communications  (Dr  Yaacob  Ibrahim)  (for  the  Minister   for

Communications):   Sir,  all of the 1,562  motorists,  who  were

accidentally charged during the test run of the Electronic  Road

Pricing (ERP) gantries on 28th August 1998 have been sent a  $10

CashCard.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, what is the rationale for refunding

the  affected  motorists a flat rate of $10 CashCard  which  has

incurred  a Government expenditure of $15,620 rather  than  just

paying them back the collected amount of $1,659?

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, on the morning of that particular

day, we deducted between 50 cents and $3 accidentally from 1,562

motorists.   We  could have chosen to refund the  exact  amount.

However,  as  a  gesture of goodwill and to compensate  for  the

inconvenience and the confusion caused, we have decided to  give

each of them a $10 CashCard.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, why did the Government give out

goodwill?  I would like to know who made the mistake and whether

or  not  the taxpayers should bear the mistake of this goodwill,

which was a mistake made by a civil servant.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, we have conducted an internal

inquiry  into  this incident and we have found  that  the  party

responsible  is  the ERP contractor and, as such,  we  would  be

claiming  all costs incurred due to the incident from  this  ERP

contractor.  This would include the cost of the CashCard that we

have sent out.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, how did the LTA know

who are the motorists who are overcharged and how were the

CashCards sent to them?  Were they sent to them or they came to

collect them?

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, every in-vehicle unit (IU) has its

own  unit  identity  code which is indexed to  the  registration

number  of  the vehicle.  So when a vehicle with  an  IU  passes

under the ERP gantry, this unit identity code will form part  of

the normal ERP transaction.  Usually, we will keep this ERP data

for  only  24 hours in order to allow LTA to settle  with  NETS.

For  that  particular instance, we downloaded and  retained  the

data  for  the  express  purpose  of  identifying  the  affected

motorists so that the $10 CashCards could be sent to them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, since the system is capable of

capturing  the  identity  of the car through  the  gantries,  my

question is whether or not this system itself is also capable of

monitoring  the  movement of motorists  and  thus  infringe  the

privacy of motorists?

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, as I have said earlier, we only

retain  the data for a maximum of 24 hours to allow us to settle

the transaction with NETS.  After that the data is deleted.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, is it possible to download the

data and store it somewhere?  Could you do that?

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> It is possible, but we do not do that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Can the data not be downloaded and

stored separately for future reference at all?

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> As I have said earlier, Sir, it is

possible to download, but we do not do that except for those who

have violated the ERP.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the question is whether you do

that or you do not do that.  The system is capable of doing that

if  you  want  to.  In other words, if the Government  wants  to

monitor the movement of motorists, they could have done that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, we do not do that, and

the question is irrelevant.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, this is relevant. I believe the

LTA  has completed its investigation. Is the LTA confident  that

such  errors will not occur again in the future?  And what other

systems are in place to make sure that the same mistake will not

occur again?

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, the system that we have in place

is extremely reliable.  Any errors that have occurred during the

test  run have already been rectified.  Nonetheless, we will  be

very  vigilant  to prevent any mishap that could happen,  be  it

human or otherwise, and we will continue with our vigilance,  as

we do daily in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, is the system capable of self-checking any errors that occur?

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I do not have the exact answer.

If the Member is interested, he could file a Question and I will

answer at the next sitting.

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT AND</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ELECTRONIC ROAD PRICING CHARGES</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Payment by taxis)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Communications

whether  the  policy of requiring taxis to pay Central  Business

District  and  Electronic  Road  Pricing  charges  defeats   the

Government's purpose for introducing such charges.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr John Chen Seow</b>

<b>Phun) (for the Minister for Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  primary  objective  of the Electronic  Road  Pricing  (ERP)

system  is  to  bring  about smooth  traffic  flow.   With  ERP,

motorists  are charged for their use of congested  roads.   This

will  make  the  cost of travelling more evident  and  encourage

drivers to consciously plan their trips and consider alternative

modes  and  times of travel. This is the rationale for  the  ERP

system.  This  way, we can keep the crucial arterial  roads  and

expressways relatively smooth flowing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For road pricing to work, it must apply to all

vehicles in order to be fair and effective and to keep road

pricing charges to the minimum.  Taxi drivers and commuters

would then decide on the best route to take, as well as the

basis of cost-sharing for road pricing, in order to enjoy the

benefit of faster travel on the roads. To help taxis and

commercial vehicles, I would like to inform the Member that the

ERP charges are phased over three to four years.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am indebted to the Minister for his

explanation.   But the question still remains.  As I  understand

the  Minister, the purpose was to try and keep mainly  users  of

private cars from roads which get congested in the mornings  and

evenings.   But is it not the intention that they should  switch

to  public service vehicles rather than use their cars, and  are

taxis not public service vehicles, no less than buses?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, it is true that we want to

encourage commuters to take public transport and we have spent a

lot of resources and efforts in promoting public transport.  But

we must also recognise that public transport vehicles do compete

for road space and contribute to traffic congestion.  As ERP  is

a  traffic management tool, it is not appropriate to exempt them

or  reduce  the ERP rates for taxis relative to other  vehicles.

In  fact, the buses are also paying the ERP charges depending on

the  size of the bus.  It has a pcu (passenger car unit) of two,

so  the bus is actually paying two times the charges compared to

private cars.  But of course, we are phasing in over four years.

And  bus is a more efficient transport.  Therefore, the cost per

commuter will actually be very, very small.

For  taxis,  it  is  different.  Taxis provide a  point-to-point

personalised  form  of  transport service  with  comfort  levels

comparable  to  that of cars and occupy the same road  space  as

cars.   So taxi commuters would therefore pay the same ERP rates

as  if  they were using their cars.  Nonetheless, in recognition

of the role of taxis as a form of public transport, albeit a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>



personalised one, the full ERP charges for taxis

will be phased in over three years to help taxi drivers and

commuters to adjust.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is it not the Ministry's intention then to

force  people  who  can afford to pay taxi fares  to  travel  on

buses?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> We will let the commuters decide

what kind of service they want, what price they want to pay, and

if  you  look at our public transport fares, whether it is  MRT,

bus  or even taxis, and compare them to other countries, I think

Singapore's public transport fares are very, very affordable.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> We get this answer every time, Mr Speaker,

Sir.   The  prices in Singapore are very, very affordable.   But

does  the  Ministry realise that even a small payment can  be  a

burden on families which cannot even find enough to live on?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> That is why we have a choice of a

wide  range  of services and after all, Sir, I do  not  see  the

relevance  of  this question to the Question that he  is  asking

about taxis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

the Singapore Cable Vision (SCV) has cabled up 90% of HDB flats,

57%  of  private  high-rise  and 33%  of  landed  households  in

Singapore.  This means that 82% of all households  in  Singapore

have now been cabled up.

<div align="center"><b>GRANTING OF LICENCES TO INDIVIDUALS TO OPERATE TAXIS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Government's policy)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Communications if he

will  outline the rationale for the Government's policy  of  not

granting licences to individuals to operate taxis.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (for the Minister for</b>

<b>Communications):</b> Sir, prior to 1975, taxi licences were issued

to  individuals to operate taxis.  However, this arrangement was

unsatisfactory.  Taxis  were  poorly  maintained.   There   were

malpractices  and abuses. And some owners of taxi licences  were

not  driving  but  hiring out their taxis to others  and  simply

collecting  rental.  Worse, syndicates emerged  to  control  and

exploit taxi drivers.  The result was unreliable and unsafe taxi

services.  Commuters suffered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To upgrade taxi services, we have since 1975 issued new

taxi  licences only to bona fide taxi companies or organisations

which  have  the resources and expertise to manage the  pool  of

drivers  and  fleet of taxis. As a result of this policy,  today

the  three  taxi companies, namely, Comfort, CityCab  and  TIBS,

operate  a  combined fleet of 15,900 taxis.  Commuters  enjoy  a

wide   range  of  services,  including  Premiere  Taxi  Service,

Mercedes  Cabs, London Cabs, Airport Direct and even Cab-Pooling

services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new policy, anyone can obtain a taxi driver

vocational licence from LTA and rent a taxi from one of the taxi



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>



companies.  Nobody, I repeat, nobody has been

stopped from earning a living as a taxi driver.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> As I understand the Minister, there are two

reasons  underlying the Ministry's decision.  One is that  those

to whom licences were issued, individuals, ie, to operate taxis,

hire them out.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, can you proceed with your

question?  It is not necessary to repeat the answer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is that not what the companies are doing?

They are hiring the taxis to the drivers.  Yes.  Are the drivers

not  paying  a hiring charge to the companies?  So what  is  the

difference?  The second is, the Minister says the Ministry found

out  a  syndicate  was controlling and exploiting  the  drivers.

Would you rather have the companies exploit the drivers?  May  I

ask:  is  one  of  the  reasons for  not  granting  licences  to

individuals to try and  stop taxi drivers from expressing  their

opinion about the Government because I have been told more  than

once  that  one  of  the  NTUC rules is that  they  should  stop

criticising the Government?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the first

question  is  about  comparison between the syndicates  and  the

public  listed companies.  There is no comparison.  How can  you

compare them?  The syndicates were out there to make profit  and

they  did  not  care about the welfare of the  drivers  and  the

services that the commuters would get.  It is precisely  because

of  the  experience that we have seen in the past that  we  have

done  away  with  individual  licence  as  it  will  result   in

malpractices.   But the companies are different.  The  companies

today provide investments.  For instance, they have spent a  lot

of money on the satellite system to enable radio booking and the

taxi drivers actually receive the booking fee.

Let  me just give the Member an illustration of how taxi-drivers

are  being looked after by the companies.  I take Comfort as  an

example.   Today,  Comfort has about 18,000  drivers,  including

relief



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>



drivers, and the average income of these drivers is

about $1,800 per month.  That means $32 million per month, and

over a year it is $380 million.  Do you know how much the

company earns for its shareholders?  $20 million over a year.

That is about 7% of what the taxi-drivers are getting, not to

mention all the services that they put in place to benefit the

commuters and also the drivers, so that they can earn an easier

living.  Can a syndicate do such things?  Obviously, it is out

of the question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his second question about taxi-drivers, they are responsible

citizens.  Of course, we have heard some of them, from  personal

experience, commenting on Government policies, but this is  part

and parcel of their right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio GRC):</b> Sir, is there any plan

by the Ministry to have more frequent dialogue sessions with the

taxi-drivers  so that they could air their views  and  criticise

the policies of LTA?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Indeed, Sir. The Ministry

supports  the  formation of the Taxi Operators  Association  and

after  its formation, we have had a number of dialogue  sessions

with them.  We listen to their views and we continuously do  our

utmost  to improve their working conditions and the services  to

commuters.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Was there any dialogue session between

the Ministry and the taxi-drivers association on the ERP?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Yes. In fact, not just on ERP but

on  many issues that are of interest and relevance to the  taxi-drivers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I just heard that the taxi-drivers'

average  income  is  $1,800.  I do not know whether  the  figure

quoted  is correct because I remember, some years ago, when  the

taxi   diesel   tax   was   raised,  the   then   Minister   for

Communications, Dr Yeo Ning Hong, said that taxi-drivers  earned

as much as $3,000.  Would the Minister of State like to clarify?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> If you take the main hirer, the income

is higher.  But if you take the relief driver, the income is

lower.  But the average is about $1,800.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Since the Minister of State says that

LTA  now issues licence to bona fide taxi operators and the main

complaint was that taxi-drivers did not take their licence  very

seriously,  would the Ministry consider issuing taxi licence  to

bona fide taxi-drivers?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> When I say "bona fide

organisations and companies", it means that we assess the  level

of  their quality of service and their ability to provide  these

services  before we issue a licence to these companies.   If  we

issue  licences to individuals, as I mentioned, you open up  all

these possible abuses.  We have done that in the past and  I  am

telling  the  Member that if we do that, we are  going  back  to

those old days, and that is not acceptable.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Does the Ministry accept that a taxi-driver who is allowed to own his own taxi and to use it as he

likes  is running a road business of his own?  He owns the  taxi

at  the end.  So what is wrong with that?  Why is the Government

so  keen to kill all individual businesses that everyone  should

go  into a company?  Secondly, about these sessions that I  have

heard,  are  taxi-drivers allowed to attend public meetings  and

voice their grievances not only about their conditions but about

the conditions that exist in Singapore for everyone?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think Mr

Jeyaretnam  is  repeating the question about why  we  would  not

allow  individual taxi-drivers to own their licence and  operate

their  business.  As I said, if you were to compare the scenario

that  he  proposed  with  what is present  today,  there  is  no

comparison  because we have seen that once you allow individuals

to  do  that, there would be people who say, "You cannot  afford

the taxi, right?  Because you need to pay upfront all the costs,

I  will finance you".  Or, in fact, anybody could say, "Look,  I

will  become the boss and take the taxi licence, and I will rent

it to the taxi-drivers."  The whole problem will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>



re-emerge.  Now, it is different, as we make sure

that only the bona fide companies with a track record or with

ability to run a good taxi service will be given the taxi

licence.  That is the difference.

On  his  second question, the taxi company would have to  manage

its  pool of taxi-drivers according to the company's policy.   I

cannot comment on that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, what sort of

welfare does the taxi companies provide for their drivers?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> I believe they provide training,

recreational  facilities  and opportunities  to  earn  a  better

living.   For example, Comfort spent $30 million for a satellite

system  to enable phone booking.  They actually give the booking

fee  to the taxi-drivers.  In other words, if you call a Comfort

taxi-driver, and you have to pay a booking fee, Comfort lets the

taxi-driver  keep a large part of  the booking fee to  encourage

him  to  take phone booking.  Companies can give these  benefits

but syndicates cannot .

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Tong:</b> In what way has the Ministry helped the

taxi-drivers in topping up their Medisave account?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think we are straying away from the

main question.  Mr Chiam, do you have any relevant supplementary

questions?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The Minister of State has said that the

average earning of taxi-drivers is $1,800.  How many hours  does

a taxi-driver need to work to earn this amount?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> During good times, they work less

hours and may even be able to earn more.  But during an economic

downturn,  we  hear  that taxi-drivers are  now  driving  longer

hours.   From  the  latest information,  the  earning  is  about

$1,800.  For a single shift, they can work 8-10 hours.  It is up

to  them.  They are either hirers or owner operators and if they

decide to work longer hours, they will earn more money.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. I think we are straying away

further and further from the question.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I have one last question, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right. I will listen to your question

first.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> What evidence did the Ministry have about

syndicates  exploiting taxi-drivers, and if they do  have  that,

would they make it public so that we can see it?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said, this

happened in the 1960s and early 1970s.  I do not know whether Mr

Jeyaretnam  remembers that in 1982 he asked the  same  question,

and  he  is repeating the same question today.  At that time  we

have  already told him.  At that time, probably his  memory  was

better  and  he  could  remember  there  was  this  problem   of

syndicates exploiting taxi-drivers.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee)</b>

<b>(for the Minister for Law):</b> Sir, this matter was indeed being

considered  in consultation with the Judiciary.  For some  time,

we  had  weighed the relative merits of the single  site  option

where  both Subordinate Courts and the Supreme Court are  housed

in one location.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that there would be insufficient space at the

Supreme   Court/Colombo  Court  site  or  in  the  vicinity   to

accommodate  the existing courtrooms of the Subordinate  Courts.

We  also have to bear in mind projected future caseloads of  the

Subordinate  Courts.  The Subordinate Courts presently  have  56

courtrooms and operate from two separate locations, namely,  the

Havelock  Square  campus  and the  Paterson  Road  campus.   The

Subordinate  Courts' venue at Havelock Road  will  therefore  be

expanded to accommodate the increased caseload.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> May I ask

the Minister whether the needs for the next 10 years will be met

if we transfer from Paterson Road to Havelock Road?  Would it be

sufficient to meet the Subordinate Courts' needs?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> The Havelock Road campus is in

fact ideal.  It will be expanded so that all the venues would be

housed on one campus and the needs of the courts for the next 10

years, at least, will be served.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister of State whether the

Ministry considers that rather than concentrating the courts  in

one area, it will serve the public if the Magistrates Courts are

taken  out to the various districts?  Is he aware that way  back

in  1963 - and I know this personally as I was the Registrar  of

the  Supreme Court then - there was this plan proposed  that  we

should  set  up Magistrates Courts in the various  districts  so

that  the  public  are saved the trouble of having  to  come  to

Havelock  Road  or anywhere else to pay their  fines  or  answer

their charges?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> We have the best of both worlds.

Because  in terms of the necessity for the courts to be  on  one

site,  I  think  the  site must be central and  dignified.   The

Havelock  Road campus will have that.  In terms of reaching  out

to  the community, we have got various other outreaches like the

Small Claims Tribunals and Community Mediation Centres which are

being built.  Indeed, even in terms of making it convenient  for

Singaporeans  to pay fines, the ATOM system was  introduced  two

years ago where you can now pay fines through a machine.

policy has been to give notice of an acquisition to everyone at

the same time through a public notification in the Government

Gazette.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not be proper to notify any person or group of

persons  of proposed acquisition before such Gazette.   This  is

because  prior  knowledge of acquisitions of land  required  for

public  projects can affect the prices of the properties  to  be

acquired  as well as adjoining ones depending on the  nature  of

the public project.  In a property transaction, it would not  be

equitable  if  one  party  has  privileged  information  of  the

property's  imminent  acquisition which  he  could  use  to  his

advantage in the transaction.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, many tenants of Colombo Court have

requested that they be given some time.  May I ask the  Minister

whether some time could be given to them, because 31st March  is

actually too short a period for them?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I believe the Member knows that in

acquisition  cases, the authority deals with the  owner  of  the

property  acquired.  On his specific question about the deadline

of  31st March, my understanding is that this is contingent  and

dependent  on the Supreme Court's own schedule for redevelopment

of  Colombo Court.  So I cannot commit myself now as to  whether

there  is flexibility to extend the 31st March deadline, but  it

is  certainly a point that I will ask my officials  to  take  up

with the Supreme Court.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam Seng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam Seng Tong:</b> Sir, my question is on compensation.

Many  of  the tenants there were not given ample notice  of  the

acquisition.   They  went ahead and spent  a  lot  of  money  on

renovation  of their premises.  I have heard that  tenants  have

spent  up  to $100,000.  Will the Ministry consider giving  them

some kind of compensation?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Here again, I think the Member will

appreciate  that  I  cannot go into details  or  commit  myself,

because  I understand that the Collector's inquiry has commenced

but has not been concluded.  I understand that the Collector has

received



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>



the various claims but the proceedings have not

been concluded and he has yet to determine the final award.

Consistent with past practice, the Collector will take into

account the various factors and considerations including claims

from the individual tenants when making the final award.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I believe that a precedent has been

set  at  Potong Pasir.  One resident there did not know  of  the

acquisition  of  his  land  and  he  went  ahead  to  apply  for

renovation.  And not long after, an acquisition was announced on

his property.  I believe the Ministry is willing to pay back the

renovation cost in that case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This case is quite similar. No notice was given to the

tenants  that  the building was going to be acquired.   So  they

went   ahead  and  spent  money  to  renovate  their  shops   in

preparation   for   business.   Will   the   Ministry   consider

compensating them with some money?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I am not sure whether the Member, when he

cites a precedent, is talking of the acquisition in Potong Pasir

with respect to an owner of the premises, whereas here I take it

that  the  reference he and Mr Shriniwas Rai  have  made  is  to

individual  tenants  who have leases in the building  where  the

owner  is  the  person who has been served with  an  acquisition

notice.  So it may not be exactly the same precedent but, in any

case, I will ask my officials to look into it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

whether  he  will  step  up enforcement action  against  illegal

parking along Mulberry Avenue, Jalan Wangi and Angsana Avenue in

Sennett Estate.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng</b>

<b>Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, there has been

occasional  illegal  parking along these  roads.   Many  of  the

offenders live or patronise the shops and eating places  in  the

vicinity.  Police has stepped up enforcement action against  the

offenders.  From  January to September 1998,  Police  issued  34

summons, as compared to 27 for the whole of last year.   In  the

meantime,  Police  has  been working  with  the  Land  Transport

Authority to improve the situation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, does the Police realise that the cause

of  this illegal parking is due to the many eating shops  there?

Does  the  Police  want  to  liaise with  the  Ministry  of  the

Environment to try to limit the number of shops?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> The shops are there and they are

privately  owned.  So they cannot be relocated.  But  certainly,

we  will work with, for example, the grassroots leaders and  LTA

to  ensure  that  the cars there are properly parked.   I  think

these measures are being looked into.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Is his Ministry willing to open up more car

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Yes, this is one of the proposals

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> As I said, the

locating some car park lots along the service road off

MacPherson Road.  It is quite nearby, so that the patrons who

want to use the shops there will not clog up Jalan Wangi,

Mulberry Avenue and Angsana Avenue area.  It is a bit further

away but it is still within walking distance to the shops.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Is the Minister aware that there is a disused

building, which is the former Sennett Community Centre,  and  is

he opening up that area for a car park?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> This is the former grassroots' club

which  will  be  used,  I  believe,  by  the  Potong  Pasir   CC

<div align="center"><b>SEWERAGE SYSTEM ALONG MULBERRY AVENUE</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Improvement)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for the Environment

whether  his  Ministry  will improve the sewerage  system  along

Mulberry  Avenue in Sennett Estate which frequently gets  choked

and causes toilet bowls in private houses to overflow.

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff (for the Minister for the Environment):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, the sewer along Mulberry Avenue does not  need

to  be improved.  The sewer chokes are caused by the oily/greasy

waste  discharged  from the food shops.  ENV will  require  food

shops without grease traps to install them and those with grease

traps to maintain them more frequently.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Does the Minister agree with me that this

regular overflow from the sewer in that area is due to the  fact

that the sewer system is insufficient for the load in that area?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Sir, the answer is no. As Mr Chiam

should know, there are residential premises and shophouses along

MacPherson Road parallel to Mulberry Avenue.  The shophouses

include three eating establishments.  Two of them already have

these grease traps.  Only one does not have.  So we are asking

this shop to install a grease trap and the other two shops to

make sure that they clean the place.  As far as the ENV is

concerned, we will step up our efforts to make sure that the

place is clean.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Does the Minister know that this problem has

been  going on for the last 10 years or even more?   This  is  a

regular  complaint.   Every month there is flooding  of  private

residences'  toilet facilities and they have  to  telephone  the

Ministry  of  the Environment.  They are like the Fire  Brigade.

They  come and try to solve the problem.  Unless something  more

concrete is done, this problem will continue.

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Our considered opinion is that it would

not.  Because these two food shops can maintain the cleanliness.

The  other food shop will install a grease trap.  The  ENV  will

step  up  its efforts to keep the place clean and that is  that.

If  this shopowner does not follow our regulations, we will warn

him.   At the end of the day, we have to apply section 51(1)  of

the  Water Pollution Control and Drainage Act to fine them.  But

I  think my Ministry officers are very kindhearted.  They try to

explain and advise the shopowners.  But, ultimately, if they  do

not follow the regulations, we have to fine them.  But we always

believe that at the end of the day, when we promulgate laws,  it

must  be  self organisation and self regulation.  The individual

must  organise himself.  Companies must organise themselves  and

regulate  themselves.  And that is the crux of all the  measures

taken by the Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Does the Ministry intend to solve this

problem  by  either enlarging the sewer pipes there or  reducing

the  load?   And  it  is to close down these eating  houses.   I

understand that one of them is a 24-hour eating house.  I  think

the Ministry must take concrete steps



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>



either of enlarging the sewer pipes or you have to

reduce the supply of the waste matter by closing down these

eating houses, especially the 24-hour eating house.

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> I think Singapore has grown to a large

extent, not only 24-hour eating houses but working also  for  24

hours.   We  have to use computers, robots and  so  forth.   The

answer  to  this problem is for the two food shops to  clean  up

their places and the other shop to install a grease trap.  I can

assure  the Member that we will advise this particular shopowner

to install the trap as soon as possible, and this will solve the

problem.   If  it does not, I will ask the Member to  put  in  a

question again.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I am not happy with the Minister's

answer.  The problem is that the sewer system is insufficient.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, could you ask your question? You are

repeating yourself.  Do you have any more questions?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Is his Ministry going to solve this problem?

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Sir, the answer must be obvious.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes or no.

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Obviously, yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, would you like to ask your next question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National

Development):  Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the  playground  at  Butterfly

Avenue which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>



is currently being managed and maintained by

National Parks, has the typical facilities of a playground of

its size.  The size is about 0.175 hectares.   National Parks

has, over the past three years, replaced damaged and worn out

facilities in the playground.  National Parks has also recently

worked with the Ministry of the Environment on the

reconstruction of the roadside drain adjacent to the playground

and covered it with a footpath.  This, I believe, has improved

access to the playground.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the regular maintenance of the facilities in the

playground,  there  are  currently  no  plans  to  upgrade   the

playground  further.  Most of the facilities are  in  relatively

good condition, and the provision of additional facilities will,

I think, clutter the playground.

Chempaka  Avenue.  Does his Ministry intend to  do  anything  to

improve this playground?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on Question [23rd

November, 1998],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House endorses the strategies and policies set

out   in   the   Report   of   the  Committee   on   Singapore's

Competitiveness,  contained in Paper Misc. 3  of  1998,  as  the

basis   for   strengthening  Singapore's  competitiveness.".   - [Minister for Trade and Industry].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br>1.30 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support  of  the  motion  moved by the Minister  for  Trade  and

Industry  to accept the recommendations contained in the  Report

of the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness (CSC).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is significant that the CSC has examined not just short

term concerns arising from the current regional economic crisis,

but  also long term issues to strengthen our ability to  compete

in  the  global  market of the future.   It  was  as  recent  as

May/June last year that we as a nation were collectively  seized

with  the competitive challenge posed by neighbouring and  other

economies.  Indeed, it was such considerations that led  to  the

formation of the CSC.  Today, those thoughts seem rather  remote

as  we  and  our neighbours grapple with the consequences  of  a

profound economic downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC report is a timely reminder that the fundamentals

have  not  changed.   As  the Minister has  mentioned,  regional

economies will emerge from the current economic crisis stronger,

leaner   and  more  cost-effective.   Their  labour,  land   and

currencies  will be cheaper.  As the Committee has observed,  it

is  not  just  cost, but also our capability that will  underpin

Singapore's   long   term   competitiveness   within   such   an

environment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key recommendation of the CSC is to reduce

total wages by 15%.  Although a painful recommendation, I fully

endorse this recommendation.  It is an essential step in

restoring Singapore's cost competitiveness.  This need is

evident especially when we realise that even after this across-the-board reduction of costs, we will not fully offset the

relative strengthening of the Singapore dollar against regional

currencies over the last 18 months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also a signal to the international business community

that  we  are  different.  It is a tribute to  the  strength  of

tripartism  and  labour-management relations in  Singapore  that

this issue has been discussed extensively in recent months in  a

systematic,  cool and rational manner.  The CSC's recommendation

and  the reasoned response of organised labour in Singapore must

surely  have distinguished and differentiated Singapore  in  the

eyes of global investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, Singaporeans accept the need for wage

reduction.  However, they feel that it should be done  equitably

and  in  tandem with the introduction of measures  to  ease  the

impact.    For  instance,  the  wage  reduction  will   have   a

significant impact on the ability of many to service their  home

mortgages.  More than 100,000 Singaporeans use their entire  CPF

for  this  purpose  and  many  others  use  most  of  their  CPF

similarly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeowners are hopeful that Government will institute

adequate measures to ease their burden.  One means would  be  to

allow  them  to use contributions to the Special Account  for  a

limited  period to service their housing loan.  Another  measure

could  be the establishment of a bridging loan facility to  help

Singaporeans,  in  both  public and  private  housing,  who  are

affected by the CPF cut to tide over this difficult period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also a view that the wage reduction should be

progressive.  The 15% figure should be taken as an average  with

high income earners taking a proportionately higher wage cut and

a lower burden imposed on the rank and file.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, many Singaporeans are looking to

our political leaders to set the tone by taking a deeper cut

than that recommended by the CSC.  They readily concede that it

is not necessarily an economically  rational response since the

resultant cost saving will be insignificant in the overall

scheme of things.  They also recognise that Ministers have

already forgone wage increases due to them this year.  However,

it is an important emotional issue.  Knowing that our leaders

are showing the way might make it a little easier to swallow the

bitter pill in these hard times.  I would, therefore, urge the

Government to consider a deeper cut in wages for the political

leadership (including MPs) and the higher echelons of the public

sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, Sir, I wish to stress that wages in

Singapore  should not only be flexible downwards but also,  when

the  time  is right, upwards.  This applies equally to  workers,

senior  civil  servants and Ministers.  When times  are  better,

employers  should  reinstate the wage cuts imposed  on  workers.

Similarly, when the economic condition improves, the  wage  cuts

taken  by  our  Ministers and senior civil  servants  should  be

readily  restored without question, both within this  House  and

without.  Just as we seek today a departure from the formula  to

determine  the  pay of Ministers and senior civil  servants,  we

should  be  equally  prepared to do so when the  time  comes  to

restore the cuts that they take voluntarily.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important recommendation of the CSC pertains to the need

to  review the tax treatment of ESOPs  - Employee Stock Options.

The  purpose of ESOPs is to align employee's interests with that

of  the  company.  As the company grows and its value increases,

so  too will the value of its shares and the stock options  held

by  its  employees.   Indeed, the longer  employees  hold  their

ESOPs,  or  their shares after the exercise of the options,  the

better   for  the  company.   It  also  has  the  advantage   of

diminishing the incentive to job hop.  Indeed, Sir, this is  not

an  uncommon  practice in places such as Silicon  Valley,  where

from the receptionist to the CEO hold stock options.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the current practice of taxing ESOPs at the

point of exercise as "earned income", rather than waiting for

the point at which the underlying shares are sold, creates a

perverse incentive - the employee will probably sell his shares

as soon as the option is exercised in order to realise his gains

and pay his tax liability.  As we move into a knowledge-based

economy, intellectual resources, ie, our people, will become an

even more important asset to companies.  In that context, ESOPs

will become an essential component of remuneration which today

comprises mainly the basic salary, flexible components and

bonuses.  I would urge the Government to review the tax

treatment of ESOPs to make it more compatible with the knowledge

economy envisioned by the CSC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, a point from a social perspective. The

recommendations of the CSC make compelling business and economic

sense.   Many  big  words like "competitiveness",  "talent"  and

"capability"  have  been used.  But these  recommendations  will

have a profound impact on the lives of average Singaporeans, and

also  on  the work of CDCs and VWOs that serve the disadvantaged

within our community.  We must address these social consequences

especially   because  social  cohesion  is  a  key   competitive

advantage for Singapore.  Families will find it difficult to pay

the bill for childcare, before-and-after-school-care, and maids.

Yet,  two  incomes have become an even more important  issue  in

this  economic climate.  I would urge the Government to consider

extending  further  assistance in this  regard  through  grants,

rebates  and extending the reduction of the foreign worker  levy

to  domestic maids, either as part of this exercise  or  in  the

forthcoming FY99/2000 Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CDCs and VWOs have also been hit by a double whammy. Their

sources  of  funds, corporate and individual, are slowly  drying

up.   Meanwhile, the demand for their services remains unchanged

or  even rising in some instances.  This is especially the  case

for  those serving the economically disadvantaged.  I would urge

the   Government  to  consider  extending  additional  financial

assistance to VWOs and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>



CDCs as a short term measure.  One formula could be

to increase the matching grant from Government, although this

may not go far enough where even the basic seed money is hard to

come by in the first instance.  An alternative could be for the

Government to set aside a fixed sum explicitly for this purpose.

VWOs can then apply for additional grants and these can be

assessed on the merits of each case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I conclude by thanking the Minister and his team for a

very comprehensive Report and I think this will now be tested in

the implementation and its speed of execution.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

when  the  Committee  on Singapore's Competitiveness  (CSC)  was

established in May 1997, its original terms of reference  was to

map  out  a plan to enhance the competitiveness of Singapore  in

the  face  of  intensifying competition  from  the  neighbouring

countries  as well as the developed countries over the  next  10

years.   However, in July 1997,  the regional economy  began  to

deteriorate.  Short-term measures to restore our competitiveness

became  most  urgently  required.  As a  result,  when  the  CSC

presented its  Report,  a major portion was devoted to solutions

to  resolve the imminent economic crisis, such as the  reduction

of  wage cost by 15%, reduction in foreign worker levy, lowering

of  JTC/HDB  rentals,  electricity  tariffs,  telecommunications

cost, port charges and vehicle taxes, etc.  Property tax rebates

and  stamp  duty  exemption  are to  be  continued.   All  these

measures  are  very timely and worthy of our support.   But  the

Report  seems  to  overlook  the two following  areas:  (1)  the

predicament  of shopowners and stallholders in the HDB  estates,

and (2) the competitiveness of our retail industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with the first issue. The Report recommends a

15%  reduction  in the total wage cost.  To big  companies  with

many employees, this is  an alleviation of their burden that may

help to  restore their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>



competitiveness.  But to the retail shops and small-time stallholders who employ just a very few employees, many of

whom are their own family members, these cuts in employers' CPF

contribution and bonuses will not significantly reduce their

operational cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business is bad for these shop-owners and stallholders

because  of  the  economic downturn, and they cannot  make  ends

meet.  Then, when these wage-cut measures are fully implemented,

the spending power of the general public will also shrink.  This

will  affect their business even more.  On the other hand,  they

have  to pay for their overheads and service their loans.   With

less  income, they will find it difficult even to survive.   Not

too  long ago, a stallholder who could not service his loan  was

slapped with hefty interests by the finance company, and he  was

even  taken  to  court.  This is a glaring example.   Therefore,

helping  these shop-owners and stall-holders by reviewing  their

cost  to  tide  over these difficult times at the moment  is  of

utmost  importance.  These small-time neighbourhood traders  are

mostly  operating  in  the  HDB  estates.   Many  of  them  were

encouraged  by  the Government's "Shop For Everyone"  scheme  to

purchase their existing shops and stalls.  The majority of  them

took   loans  from banks or finance companies to  finance  their

purchases  of  these  shops or stalls.   Now,  because  of  poor

business,  they are having problems with their cash-flows.  They

cannot  keep  up with the instalment payments or  service  their

loans.    As   an  adviser  to  the  Federation  of   Merchants'

Association,  I  would appeal to the Government  to  advise  the

banks  and finance companies to reschedule the instalment  plans

by  extending their repayment periods. This will help to lighten

the  burden of these people.  The Housing and Development  Board

should  also consider lowering the rentals so as to  help  these

people to tide over their difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is how to restore the competitiveness of

our  retail  industry.   The retail industry  has  been  in  the

doldrums  for  quite a long time. With further deterioration  of

the regional economy, the retail



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>



industry has a very grim future.  Thailand and

Malaysia have devalued their currencies by huge margins.  So to

the tourists, it is better and cheaper to shop there.  In

comparison, Singapore's retail industry is finding it more and

more difficult to attract tourists to come and shop here.  This

will affect our tourism industry directly.  Since tourism is one

of the main pillars of the service industry, which is one of the

main items of concern in the CSC Report, how to help our retail

industry and tourist industry reduce their business cost is

therefore another important issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To many departmental stores and supermarkets which employ large

numbers  of people, a cut of 15% of CPF and wage costs  together

will  effectively cut down their operational costs.  But to  the

small shopkeepers in the shopping complexes, the effect will not

be  very significant. Another recommendation of the CSC is  that

the  Government  should continue to grant the 55%  property  tax

rebates.  With  its  implementation,  only  owners  of  shopping

centres  and complexes will benefit.  Some of them may  pass  on

the  savings to their tenants by reducing the rentals.  But, the

vast  majority  of  property owners do not lower  their  rentals

because  they  themselves  are also facing  financial  problems.

Another  way to further help the owners of shopping centres   is

to  adjust  downwards  the net annual value  of  the  commercial

properties.   In  recent  years,  because  of   bad  times,  the

pressure to lower the shop rental is always there.  But  because

the net annual value has not been lowered,  they continue to pay

very  high  property tax.  So it is very difficult for  them  to

lower  their  rental.  I hope that the authority concerned  will

review the net annual value of all the commercial and industrial

properties  soon.  If the property owners can have their  burden

alleviated,  they will be in a position to lower  their  rental,

and  the  tenants  will  also enjoy the benefit  of  some  cost-cutting.   In this way, they will be able to sell their goods or

provide  their  services at cheaper prices,  and  hence  enhance

their competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion in the name of the Minister for

Trade and Industry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a great many of

those who have spoken, particularly coming from the Government

ranks, the PAP MPs, have all expressed immediately their support

and enthusiasm for the Report of the Committee.  The two

Opposition Members who spoke yesterday were less enthusiastic.

I must say that, speaking for myself and for the Party, we do

not share the enthusiasm that has been shown for the Report of

the Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find this Report disappointing and discriminatory. Why do we

say disappointing?  There are several factors which prompt us to

say  that the Report is totally disappointing. One is the timing

of  this  Report.   As the Report mentions, the  Prime  Minister

would  appear  to  have  announced his intention  to  appoint  a

committee way back in November 1996.  Then it took him about six

months  to  convene a Committee on Competitiveness in Singapore.

That  was in May 1997.  And we have a Report from this Committee

17 months later - I understand the Deputy Prime Minister will be

announcing the measures the Government will implement -  but  we

have  yet  to hear what measures the Government will accept  and

implement.   I should have thought, Mr Speaker, Sir, that  these

measures would have been announced before this debate,  so  that

the  Members in this House could then pronounce their  views  on

the  measures taken by the Government.  That is what  I  thought

was going to happen.  But clearly that was not the intention.

As  the Party's Member for Hougang said in his speech yesterday,

this  recession was foreseen.  I was talking to a bank  official

some days ago and he said  that the danger signals were seen  as

early  as  1996.   He  said it was quite evident  to  them  that

Singapore was going into a recession.  And yet no measures  were

taken then to avert the crisis.  The Government prides itself  - and we have heard this so many times - that it does not wait for

any crisis or problem to arise, it nips it in the bud.  But,  in

this  particular case, it does not appear to have shown the same

enthusiasm  as  it has - of course, when it comes  to  political

action.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lack of prompt action was mentioned by the Member for

Hougang, as I said, yesterday and we heard from a PAP Member - or was it a Nominated Member - who did not seem to answer our

point at all.  He talked about chickens and the eggs.  Again, as

the Member for Hougang pointed out, we had conflicting

statements from the Ministers about the crisis.  I remember,

when I was proposing a number of measures, as far back as

February or the beginning of this year, the Minister for Finance

and the others were saying that Singapore had not been badly

affected and we would take the necessary measures when the

crisis hit us.  That is unlike, as I said, what the Government

has done when it came to taking mainly political action.  And,

again, it was in February of this year on my motion for the

Ministers to give up 25% of their salaries to show their

identification with the people, when I said there were already

indications that pay cuts were taking place.  The Deputy Prime

Minister, in his reply, which was quoted by the Member for

Hougang, said that Singapore was still competitive.  There was

no problem about Singapore's competitiveness.  And yet eight

months later, we are told that Singapore is not competitive and

we have got to take the measures.  So were Ministers really not

aware of what was happening in Singapore?  Have they lost touch

with the conditions prevailing in Singapore?  Or were they just

beaming with their own over-confidence?  We heard the Deputy

Prime Minister say in that speech how wonderful the Ministers

had managed Singapore's economy and their efforts had been

lauded by people outside.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So our first point of dissatisfaction is the timing and the

delay that has occurred in announcing the measures that would be

taken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as has been mentioned outside this House, the measures

and  the  Report itself are not bold enough.  There  is  nothing

innovative.  There is nothing radical about any of the  measure.

And  may I say that it is more or less a repetition of what  the

Committee in 1985



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>



or 1986 submitted, perhaps dressed up a bit more to

meet the present situation.  I wonder why that is so.  One

senses, reading the Report, that there was a concern in the

Committee not to tread on government toes and try to be as

placatory as possible to the Government in making their

recommendations.  Is that because we had two Cabinet Ministers

sitting on top of the Members of the Committee listening to the

deliberations and commenting on anything they had to say?  Not

only did we have two Cabinet Ministers, we had another Minister.

Could the Committee not have been left entirely to the private

sector, people who we say are experts in the field, instead of

having a political control over it?  This, again, is one of the

facts of life in Singapore, as has been mentioned, that

everything in Singapore has to have a political master

overseeing whatever is being done, even when it comes to playing

football.  Is it not time that we trusted the private sector to

do its own work without overseeing how they do it and what

recommendations they will put up?  So that is another point of

our dissatisfaction - that it is not bold enough, nothing

innovative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an assumption that our fundamentals are strong. This,

of  course,  is  what  the  Ministers have  been  saying  -  our

fundamentals  are strong, so there is nothing for us  to  worry.

But are they?  Is there any attempt made to question whether  we

have  got the correct fundamentals for our economy?  The  Report

suggests that perhaps we do not have the fundamentals, but  they

do  not  go  far enough to point out what exactly is strong  and

what should be done about it.  Mr Chiam referred to paragraph 29

of  the  Report, the Executive Summary, and I do not propose  to

read  it.  But the Committee stresses the need for Singapore  to

be  an open cosmopolitan society and for the need for a critical

mass  of  Singaporeans who are risk-taking entrepreneurs.   They

say  about  the  need for Singapore to be an  open  cosmopolitan

society.  This is what we in the Workers' Party have been saying

for  many years that Singapore needs to be an open society.   It

is good for business.  It is good for the economy of the country

and it is good for our people.  But are we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>



an open society?  The Committee does not appear to

answer that question.  They should have, and they should have

suggested what was wrong with the society at the moment today.

Do we have a critical mass of Singaporeans who are risk-taking

entrepreneurs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you want Singaporeans to be critical,

it must follow quite clearly that you have got to encourage them

to  ask  questions.  They should be encouraged to  enquire  into

what  is  happening in Singapore and get the  answers  to  those

questions.  That is not happening in Singapore simply because we

are  not an open society.  We take the attitude that the affairs

of  the  country  do not concern the people.   It  is  only  the

concern of the Government and we should just trust them and they

would  deliver  the goods.  Some goods they have delivered.   So

clearly, we do not have an open society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, they talk about human intellectual capital being the

key  to  competitiveness.   It is in  page  81  of  the  Report,

paragraph   3.a.,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir.   They  say   that   human

intellectual  capital  is  the key  competitive  edge  and  they

propose reviewing the education curriculum, examination and  the

school  ranking systems to help foster creative thinking and  an

entrepreneurial spirit among the young.  They continue with this

question of the education in Singapore in page 86 of the Report,

paragraph  11,  where  they say "The content  of  the  education

curriculum should help to prepare the young for the workplace of

the 21st century."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, in the Workers' Party, - and I have to repeat this because I

would  suggest  to  the  Ministers that  they  should  read  the

Workers' Party's manifesto - have been urging a complete  review

of  the education system in Singapore today.  This was way  back

in  1988.  I am glad to see that the Committee thinks that there

should be a review.  And further on, they talk about the content

being  reviewed and not teaching our children to be  parrot-like

and regurgitate what they have been told.  We have to start,  if

you really mean to be economically progressive, with our young



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>



people who are going to take over and the spirit of

enquiry must be started there.  Do we have it?  The answer is

clearly no.  The Committee has admitted that it should not be

regurgitating what they have just been told.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to the university level, do we encourage and

actively urge an inquiring spirit among the university students?

Or  do  we  sit on them and confine their learning to  just  the

subjects  for  which they have come to university to  get  their

degree?   So we do not have those fundamentals.  There  is  also

the  cost of education.  I see that in page 91, paragraph 35.b.,

in  commenting  on  the need for foreign talent,  the  Committee

recommends  that  the Government reduce the cost  of  children's

education  in Singapore by ensuring an adequate supply  of  land

for  international schools.  Here, of course, they  are  talking

about the children of the foreigners working in Singapore.   But

what  about reducing the costs for our own children,   something

which  we,  in the Workers' Party, have been urging?   It  is  a

burden for families who are not earning enough to provide proper

education.   It  is  a  burden for  them  to  provide  a  proper

education  that their children need and the schools,  which  the

curriculum  and  the  content  are  not  doing.   So  would  the

Government consider this?  I will, at the end of my speech,  put

forward the Workers' Party's proposals and I will have something

to say then.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point of dissatisfaction is that there is really no

evaluation  of what went wrong in Singapore.  We of course  know

that  it was precipitated and perhaps aggravated by the regional

crisis.   But was there nothing wrong with the way that we  were

conducting  or  managing our economy?  There was no  attempt  to

examine  in  this Committee's Report the role of  the  GLCs  and

their  management.  We know that over the last  few  years,  the

GLCs have lost a lot of money that belongs to us, the taxpayers.

And,   yet,   there   has   been  no   proper   examination   on

accountability.  The GLCs have not been made accountable to this

House on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>



decisions that they have taken and why they have

lost monies.  And we are talking about public monies, not their

own monies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So should we not rethink about the role of GLCs? And I have

also  heard  that the GLCs, because of the fact  that  they  are

Government-linked,  enjoy  an  unfair  advantage.    Should   we

continue  with  that?  Are we providing an even  field  for  the

conduct of businesses in Singapore?  Or are we giving an  unfair

advantage  to  the Government companies?  But, more importantly,

what  is needed in Singapore more than anything else is openness

and  accountability and we are not getting that from  the  GLCs.

If  you go to the Registry of Companies to seek information, you

are told, "Well, this is not public.  You cannot look at it.  If

you  tell  us what good reasons you have we can perhaps consider

it."   The  activities of the GLCs in their  various  businesses

should be made public as much as possible and not kept a secret.

Again, there is nothing about the Government policies that might

have  contributed to the recession.  Why is no attempt  made  to

examine  whether the Government in its policies may have perhaps

contributed to the recession?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned, Mr Speaker, Sir, that this recession was foreseen

way back in 1996 by people outside.  The Government not only did

not take any attempt to correct anything that was wrong, but  it

would  appear  that  they were more interested  in  winning  the

elections that were going to come on over the next one  year  or

after  that.   So,  we heard a lot about the  asset  enhancement

programme  of  the Government.  That was their bonanza  for  the

voters  to vote in the PAP Members into Parliament so  that  the

PAP  would continue in power.  And along with that, as  part  of

the  programme,  there was the liberalisation for  purchases  of

properties, particularly, HDB.  What was the result of all that?

It  boosted  prices,  making land cost becoming  more  and  more

difficult  for the companies and those who are doing  businesses

in  Singapore.  It boosted the rentals.  Yet no attempt was made

in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>



Report to point to that and, as I said, is it

because we had Ministers sitting on the Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I was glad to see, Mr Speaker, Sir, that after the Report

was   released,  the  manufacturing  sub-committee  in  a  press

conference  was a little bolder.  This sub-committee  said  that

they  would like to see the Government contribute more than  30%

of  the package and they would like to see the Government use up

the  surpluses  from the statutory boards to help  overcome  the

recession.   Maybe without the Ministers sitting next  to  them,

they were bold enough to come up with those statements.

Finally,  another  disappointing aspect of the  Report  is  that

there  is not enough data, not enough information given in  this

Report  on  how  they  have  arrived at  their  conclusions  and

recommendations.   Mr Speaker, Sir, in an  attempt  to  try  and

understand  their  recommendations and to make some  suggestions

here,  I  wrote to the Ministry of Finance and the  Ministry  of

Manpower to ask for certain information.  Did I get it?   Not  a

word, I have not heard from them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this the open society that we are proclaiming ourselves to

be?   But  what I am saying is that this Report does not contain

the information and data on which they base their conclusions in

making   recommendations,  particularly  on   the   cost-cutting

measures.  There is the suggestion that there should be some cut

in  the  utilities  rates,  electricity and  telecommunications.

They  have not tried to answer the question or have they  sought

an  answer to the question why in spite of fuel prices  falling,

electricity tariffs have not gone down.  At one time, the reason

given was that the Singapore dollar was weak and that offset the

falling  prices.   But now, as I understand  it,  the  Singapore

dollar has strengthened against the US dollar.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you  for  this  opportunity to participate in  this  debate.   I

support  the  motion standing in the name of  the  Minister  for

Trade and Industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would like to touch on the point on what this

CSC Report is all about.  Put in a very simple language, imagine

two  persons walking in a jungle and all of a sudden, they heard

that  the tiger is coming up on them.  One of them bent down  to

tighten  his  shoelace.  The other person says,  "What  are  you

trying to do?"  He says, "Obvious.  I am getting ready to  run."

This  other person says, "You must be crazy.  You think you  can

outrun  the tiger?"  The guy says, "No, I do not think so.   But

all I need to do is to outrun you."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the point here is that we live in a world

of  jungle.  Competition is everywhere and in this jungle, there

are  many  tigers  -  the  tiger  of  recession,  the  tiger  of

unemployment,  and  the  tiger  of  retrenchment,  and  so   on.

Basically, what the CSC Report is all about is to get  Singapore

running faster than our competitors so that we do not have to be

beaten  up  by these tigers around us.  But it is  not  easy  to

start  running because it is painful and stressful.  Some  would

say,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>



"Why run?  I do not see any tiger, I do not see

unemployment in Singapore."  Then some will say, "Before we

start running, we need to start fighting among ourselves first.

Let us go for political reform so that we will all  loosen up

and could run even faster."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that all these suggestions are not

constructive.  Some would even ask, "Before we start running, we

should ask ourselves how come we end up in the jungle.  I  think

the Government is wrong because they should not have led us into

the  jungle."  Worse still, they say, "This Government, how come

they did not have the foresight to tell us in advance that there

are tigers in the jungle."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us put it this way. This is the worst crisis that this

world  has  seen  in  the  last 50 years.   The  world  economic

experts,  up  to  today, no one dares to  say  that  they  could

foresee  the arrival of this recession.  When the NCMP mentioned

that  a private banker told him in 1996 that he saw exactly what

was  coming, I was shocked.  Perhaps the banker should  come  to

the  open to explain to the world how did he in 1996 foresee the

regional  crisis was coming and that Singapore was  heading  for

recession  in  1998.  Because that could win him a Nobel  Prize.

Some  would say that, "If we have to run, why not you run  first

because  I am not convinced that we have to run."  For  example,

if the Ministers do not take a pay cut, how can you expect us to

take  a pay cut?  Again, we forget that the Ministers have  been

leading by example all these years.  We forget that in 1997 when

all  of us were enjoying pay increase, the Ministers took a  pay

cut of 2.5%.  We forget that in the first half of 1998, when the

situation  was still all right, when we were talking about  wage

restraint, when workers were getting 2% to 4% of wage  increase,

the Ministers took the lead for a wage freeze.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, none of us in the labour movement has stood up to urge the

political  leaders to take pay cut first because  we  have  full

faith  and trust in this Government.  We know that the Ministers

would take the lead in taking a bigger pay cut, not because  the

opposition MPs have asked for it nor the labour movement has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>



pressed for it but because our leaders know what to

do.  They always believe in doing the right things and we know

they will never disappoint us.  Therefore, there is no need for

anyone of us to come up to claim credit should the Ministers

decide to take a deeper pay cut because the recognition should

be given to the Ministers for their leadership by example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point that Ministers have not been doing their job

in looking ahead into the future, as a result, we have to take a

wage  cut today.  The message seems to imply that the Government

has  not been doing the job well.  Speaking as a member  of  the

labour  movement,  we  do not think so.  Just  think  about  it.

Singapore's economy is one of the most open in the world.  About

70%  of  our demand here is externally driven.  By right,  at  a

time  like this, the Singapore economy should be worst hit  than

many  other economies because we are so externally driven.   And

yet   look  at  what  has  happened   in  Hong  Kong   -5%   GDP

(contraction),  Malaysia, -5%; Korea, -6%;  Thailand,  -8%;  and

Indonesia, -13%.  What about Singapore?  This year, we are still

talking  about 0.5% to 1% growth.  The reason why  Singapore  is

able  to  be in such a good position today relative to  all  the

other economies is because our  Government has been able to look

ahead  and  make  sure good governance and public  policies  are

always in place.  As  a result, our workers today do not have to

suffer the kind of pain that many of our fellow workers in other

countries and economies are suffering today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, as far as the labour movement is concerned, we

believe  that there is nothing fundamentally wrong in Singapore.

There is nothing fundamentally wrong with our workers, companies

or the Government.  Let us accept that we want to run because we

want to run faster than all other competitors so that we will be

able to return to full employment in the nearest future and  all

our  workers  who are able and willing to work can  continue  to

enjoy good employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I want to emphasise the point that the

CSC Report is not just



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>



about cost-cutting.  In the last few weeks, if you

had listened to radio talkshows, it is not surprising that quite

a number of the callers who called up the radio talkshows

referred to the CSC as the "Cost Committee".  In fact, CSC is

being referred by many people as a "Cost Committee".  It is not.

The CSC is not a Cost Committee.  It is a Committee on

Competitiveness.  The key word is "competitiveness".  The CSC is

not about making Singapore cheaper all the time.  It is about

making Singapore better all the time.  Mr Jeyaretnam said that

this Report is not bold enough.  He says that we need to have

more social reforms.  Yesterday, Mr Chiam See Tong said that we

should have political reform.  The CSC is not about political or

social reform, but about economic reform.  Here we are talking

about moving towards a knowledge economy.  For anybody who knows

something about economic development, he will recognise the

boldness contained in this Report.  In fact, many countries are

amazed that Singapore is able to look 5 to 10 years ahead even

at a time of economic downturn and aim to come up stronger and

more competitive.  In that regard, as Singaporeans, we can all

be proud of this bold vision in the CSC report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that CSC is a bold report on economic reform, I

would  like to highlight that we must be aware that we must  not

pursue  economic  competitiveness as an end in  itself.   It  is

important that as we pursue economic competitiveness, we do  not

achieve  it at the expense of social cohesion.  If I may  relate

another  story.   A  group of people come together  to  build  a

housing  estate and the leader told them, "Let us make this  the

best  housing estate we have ever built.  Give it our very  best

and make it an estate we can all be proud of."  The workers were

excited  and everyone started to work.  But along  the  way,   a

small group of people in the team decided that things were going

too  nicely and they should have some excitement.  So they  went

around talking to the workers.  They asked, "Why do you work  so

hard?  We can build this to be the best housing estate.  At  the

end of the day, it will fetch higher prices and the people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>



who move in would enjoy a beautiful home.  But what

will happen to us?  We will just move on to build another

housing estate."  Over time, the workers lost heart.  The

carpenter started to take it easy on the carpentry work.  The

one who laid the tiles took it easy and as a result, workmanship

became very shoddy.  By the time the housing estate was

completed, the workers packed up and were ready to move on to

the next housing estate project.  The leader came with a bunch

of keys in  his hands.  He asked the workers to line up and he

gave each and everyone a key.  The workers asked, "Boss, what is

this all about?"  The leader said, "Remember, when we first

started this project, I urged you to give your very best to

build the best housing estate that we have ever built.  Why?

Because this is going to be our home and everyone of you would

be given a unit for free."  It came as a shock to the workers.

How they wished they had put in their very best in building this

housing estate.  Now, they have to live with whatever mistakes

or lousy workmanship that they have put in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly the point here. We are talking about

building  Singapore  as our home.  When we talk  about  economic

development and social cohesion, we must always remember that we

are  not  building this home for anybody else.  We are  building

this home for ourselves and our children.  Therefore, it is with

great disappointment, speaking as a Member of this House, to see

some  Members here adopting a partisan approach in debating this

motion.   This CSC Report is not a PAP report.  It is  a  report

formulated by Singaporeans and friends of  Singapore.  There are

many  foreigners  who are not Singaporeans but  they  share  the

commitment  and  contributed  their  ideas  and  efforts.   Why?

Because  as  friends of Singapore, they want  to  see  Singapore

well.  Many people work together very hard to come out with this

Report.  And to see a Member coming to this House to talk  about

PAP  Government versus Workers' Party and so on, I think  it  is

with great sadness that I have to hear what he has said.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Singaporeans, let us be aware that it is

important for us to work together to sustain our economic

competitiveness.  But equally, if not more important, is that as

we implement the recommendations of this Report, let us not

weaken social cohesion.  Therefore, as a Labour MP, I call on

the employers to stop calling for more cuts, because a 15% cut

in business costs is already a significant achievement that

Singapore can achieve.  Ask a businessman, in all the other

countries, are they able to secure the support of Government of

the labour movement to go for a 15% cut?  Are they able to

secure the to lower business costs by 15%?  So be thankful for

what we are able to achieve as a nation.  Let us move on.  As

employers, do not ask whether 15% cut is enough, but rather ask

yourself what more can we do so that we can be more productive,

we can be more competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is today, there is already some sign of social tension

between the local workers and the foreign workers, between young

Singaporeans  and older Singaporeans.  There is even  talk  that

maybe  we should defer the extension of retirement age, so  that

the  older Singaporeans can retire next year, instead of working

beyond 60 so that their jobs can be taken by young Singaporeans.

There is also talk about stopping foreign workers from coming so

that the retrenched Singaporean workers can fill these jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we allow these issues to be taken out of context, we are

going to end up worse off all round, because two years from now,

three  years  from now, yes, we may be able to regain  our  cost

competitiveness, but in terms of social cohesion,  we  may  have

created the social tension that will take a long time for us  to

mend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue now must be to recognise that we are in a much

better position than anybody else, but we do not wait for things

to   turn  worse  before  we  take  action.   There  are  enough

opportunities for everyone.  What is more important  at  a  time

like  this  is  for us to work together, be consistent,  send  a

clear  message  to all Singaporeans that there  is  no  painless

solution  today.  The severity of the crisis is that it  is  not

possible now to look for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>



painless solutions.  So employers, give up the idea

of a painless solution.  No way can we cut wages by 30%, CPF by

25%.  No way.   Just accept it and let us put our minds together

and move on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, our workers, do not pretend that life can go on as

usual.   As we move towards a knowledge economy, we must upgrade

our  skills.   Likewise from the angle of the national  economy,

all  Government  agencies  have to  speed  up  their  effort  to

reposition  the economy.  Basically, we are down to these  three

points:  skill  redevelopment  for  the  workers,  business  re-engineering  for the business enterprises and re-positioning  of

the  economy  towards a knowledge economy.  If we can  do  that,

then  I  think  all of us can work together to create  a  better

future,  one that all Singaporeans can be proud of in  the  21st

century.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support   the   Report   of   the   Committee   on   Singapore's

Competitiveness.   The  strategies  and  policies  proposed  are

timely  and  much  needed  as  we  can  now  capitalise  on  our

strengths, review our weaknesses so as to ride out the  economic

storm  and  emerge  leaner, stronger and  better  positioned  to

engage the global economy on a higher platform.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been argued that the proposed reductions in our

costs  may  not go far enough to offset the impact  of  currency

realignments  that  have  taken place since  the  onset  of  the

economic crisis.  Between June 1997 and November this year,  the

Singapore  Dollar has depreciated by about 15%.   This  compares

with  a devaluation of 72% of the Indonesian Rupiah, 36% of  the

Thai Baht and 35% of the Malaysian Ringgit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worthwhile to note that Singapore does not need to close

this  currency  gap completely to remain competitive.   We  have

superior  qualitative advantages and strengths that far outweigh

the absolute cost differences with our competitors.  Indeed,  we

have just been ranked No. 1



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>



Business City in Asia by Fortune magazine, above

Taiwan and Hong Kong and have received consistent top ranking by

PERC (Political Economic Risk Consultancy).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in this mammoth exercise to review our competitiveness,

we should not only focus on the quantitative aspects.  We should

also   take   steps  to  remind  ourselves  and  reinforce   the

qualitative    aspects    that   contribute    to    Singapore's

competitiveness.  These aspects include the benefits of a stable

political   environment,  non-corrupt  government,  a   positive

business climate, excellent infrastructure, highly educated  and

skilled  workforce, conducive industrial relations,  racial  and

religious harmony and social cohesion.   This year, we have been

confronted  with the images of rioting, mass rapes,  destruction

of  property,  with  a disturbing racially  motivated  slant  to

violence amongst our neighbours.  Sunday's religious clashes  in

Jakarta serve as a grim reminder.  These are some of the results

of  endemic  corruption  which have accentuated  inequality  and

poverty,  and precipitated the social and political  instability

that is plaguing many countries now.  The results are a loss  of

life and the destruction to property, elimination of decades  of

economic growth and wealth creation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see it therefore necessary that in this exercise, we should

remind  ourselves  of  the  need for political  stability,  non-corrupt  government,  racial and religious  harmony  and  social

cohesion.   We cannot afford to be complacent.  Indeed,  a  pre-requisite to our economic achievements in the future must be the

need  to  strengthen these institutions  institutions  that  are

fundamental to these intangible qualities in our effort to  make

Singapore  more competitive and attractive to investors.   These

include, amongst others, our transparent and efficient legal and

political  system, a pro-business environment led by  Government

agencies  like  the  EDB,  and  our meritocracy,  compared  with

corruption, cronyism and nepotism which characterise some of our

competitors.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development and evolution of intermediate civil

institutions like the Community Development Councils (CDCs) and

more public forum such as the Singapore 21 Committee and other

feedback mechanisms would also serve to forge unity, nationhood

and consensus.  This process of consensus and consultation must

continue to be a fundamental part of our strategy and policy for

the next millennium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unique to our success is the close cooperation between our

unions,  the employers and the Government which is a  remarkable

competitive strength and advantage.  In the next millennium,  we

must  strive  to further strengthen this tripartite relationship

which  has  presented Singapore as a stable,  pragmatic  country

with   an  efficient  workforce  to  attract  global  MNCs   and

investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to touch on some of the qualitative

competitive  aspects  of our workforce.   We  have  mainly  been

looking  at  costs and skills, which I consider to  be  hardware

items.    Critical to a competitive workforce are  the  software

items  as well.  We should take the opportunity in this downturn

to  address the work attitude of Singaporeans which is  critical

for us to succeed in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is high time that we considered reducing our dependence on

foreign labour, as in reality not all Singaporeans will be  able

to  climb  the skill ladder.  Some foreign workers, particularly

unskilled ones, contribute to numerous social problems.   It  is

therefore   in   our  interest  to  encourage  more   and   more

Singaporeans to undertake jobs that are shunned by the  majority

of  Singaporeans, as being "low-class" jobs.  Jobs  like  maids,

conservancy cleaners, construction workers, etc.  We must change

the  work attitude of Singaporeans to take on these jobs  as  we

have to cater to those workers in the 40-60 age group who simply

cannot be upgraded as they have less than basic education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other aspects in our workforce which can be improved.

Singaporeans have to be nurtured to be more tolerant of  failure

and be less risk averse.  The ability



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>



to accept failure and take risks is critical in

forming our attitudes in society towards the perception of jobs

and towards alternative careers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should shift from a more materialistic evaluation of

work  to a standard where the pursuit of unconventional careers,

new  business,  or  even what is perceived to  be  a  less  than

desirable job choice, becomes acceptable and even commendable in

our  society.  We should focus not just only on earning  a  good

income  but  on  the right job match and an improvement  in  the

overall  quality of life.  The Singaporean worker has to  change

his attitude from being a  functionary in the system for a fixed

salary, to one that genuinely takes an interest and pride in the

work he produces.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has an important bearing on labour productivity and will

enable  the  Singapore worker to gain a significant  competitive

edge,  which wage cuts and skills upgrading alone cannot address

completely.   We need to emphasise this qualitative aspect  that

is  fundamental to our competitiveness as well.  And it  is  for

this reason that I strongly support the call for employees to be

treated as stakeholders of companies and for the employee  share

option  scheme to be liberalised to encourage more  Singaporeans

to be shareholders of the companies in which they work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to caution that in our haste to cut costs, we

have  to  also consider adequate compensating factors to  offset

the  corresponding declines in disposable income.   This  is  to

avoid  a  self-fulfilling deepening of the economic downturn  as

consumption shrinks, affecting our domestic economic  activities

and asset values, as families adjust to wage cuts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perils of deflation are quite evident in the Japanese

economy, for instance, where the government has had to embark on

radical   steps  to  stimulate  consumption  after  a  prolonged

stagnation,  as  even  negative real interest  rates  failed  to

generate demand.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore urge the Government, as we implement the cost

cutting exercise, to consider and implement corresponding

measures that may prevent a severe recession that would result

if consumption falls.  We should have adequate additional,

either on-budget or off-budget, measures to boost confidence and

to avoid by default a deflationary spiral in asset values and

domestic business activities, as Singaporeans in the next few

months tighten their belts whether out of sheer need or

kiasuness.  The savings that the Government has from a reduction

in the wage bill for the public sector should be passed on to

generate economic activities and to boost domestic demand.  As

our workers accept the bold step of wage cuts, the Government

could equally be bold in cutting costs to the individuals as

well, such as lower transportation costs, lower petrol taxes,

higher income tax rebates, amongst others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in line with the call by the Feedback Unit, I would

like  to  urge  that private sector companies, corporations  and

employers pass whatever savings they have arising from wage cuts

to consumers by way of lower prices of their goods and services.

Here,   I   would  like  to  commend  the  big  local  financial

institutions  in taking the lead by rescheduling mortgage  loans

and  lowering interest costs and the NTUC Fairprice by  lowering

prices  of  essential food items.  More corporate bodies  should

follow  the example.  This is necessary so that the real  impact

of  wage cuts can be mitigated, and we can move down to  a  more

cost competitive economic structure without necessitating a real

decline  in  disposable  income and threatening  a  deflationary

spiral.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Report has given us directions to remain

competitive,  or to be more competitive in the next  millennium.

But  we  must not be complacent.  It does not mean that it  will

get  us  out  of the current recession immediately.   There  are

still  too  many variables outside our control.   Prospects  for

next year remain uncertain.  I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>



would like to paint an extremely gloomy but still

probable scenario, and that is the devaluation of the Chinese

renminbi coupled by failures to revive the Japanese economy and

a recession in Latin America and its consequential impact on

Europe and the United States.  The Chinese economy is undergoing

severe stresses since the onset of the economic crisis.  Indeed,

the Chinese have undershot their growth target of 8% for the

first nine months of this year, and even the 7.2% GDP growth

figure is estimated to be an overstatement of the real economy

which is plagued by weak financial institutions and huge excess

capacity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial crisis that is now destabilising Japan and

Latin  America may knock on the doors of Europe and  the  United

States,  plunge  the  world  economy into  a  severe  recession,

precipitated by a devaluation of the Chinese renminbi next year.

In this scenario, Sir, it would appear that the direct cost cuts

recommended  by the CSC may not be enough to offset the  adverse

effects  of  another  round  of  currency  devaluations  by  our

competitors.  Overnight, the proposed 15% cost cuts may be  lost

in  the  midst  of  such a scenario, further dragging  down  our

economy.   If  such a scenario occurs, we may  have  to  further

review and cut our costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not mean to be unduly pessimistic or gloomy. The

scenario I have just painted appears a likely one, as recent  as

two to three months ago.  But events that have occurred recently

have changed the scenario a bit and the outlook today looks less

pessimistic.  It is still not optimistic.  But we should not  be

complacent.   We should continue to prepare for  the  worst  and

hope for the best.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, not every country can have the foresight and

the  cohesiveness  to be able to implement a comprehensive  cost

cutting  programme  that  involves $10  billion  in  savings  to

businesses  with  the majority of 70% coming  from  wage-related

costs.   I  am  proud that we are going forward  in  biting  the

bullet   upfront,  so  as  to  secure  our  long  term  economic

interests.  Singaporeans have shown that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1401</b></font><br><br>



they have the unity and the pragmatism in banding

together in the past to ride out storms in the global economy.

I have confidence that Singaporeans will have this unity and the

pragmatism today to overcome this storm.  We have to continue to

reinforce our qualitative competitive strengths and distinguish

ourselves with our honesty, integrity, stability, unity and

resolve, whilst upgrading our efficiency and managing costs.  I

am confident that with this ambitious plan at hand, we can

emerge leaner, stronger and more cohesive as a workforce, as a

people and as a nation to face the challenges in the next

millennium.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at

first  glance,  the CSC Report in the form of  a  press  release

appears  to repeat what has been reported in the mass  media  in

the  past few months.  One tends to be disappointed and believes

that  nothing substantial was forthcoming to save a recessionary

economy  and  the  jobs.  However, I must confess,  after  going

through  186 pages of the Report, I was quite impressed  by  the

work  of the Committee.  The CSC Report is comprehensive,  bold,

in-depth and professionally written.  It has addressed  most  of

the  key  issues  concerning  our economy  at  present  and  how

competitiveness can be enhanced in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its completeness leaves me with only a few areas to

criticise, particularly many of the requests made by myself  and

numerous  Members  of this House have already appeared  in  this

Report.   To  name a few, many Members have asked  for  cuts  in

wages,   rents,  petrol  tax,  promotion  of  venture   capital,

investment in human capital, more training for workers, etc.  In

general,  I find it hard to fault the contents, except  for  the

following comments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the CSC Report should have been split into two

parts.   Part  I  on cost cutting could have been completed  and

announced earlier.  I concur with several hon. Members  of  this

House  that the cost cutting should have been part of  the  off-Budget measures implemented in June this year.   Like a morphine

jab for a patient in great pain, earlier cost cutting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1402</b></font><br><br>



would have helped the affected companies gain their

competitiveness earlier and confidence in our economy would have

been regained earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not here to cry over spilled

milk.  What is more important is for the employers, workers  and

investors  to  recognise that our Government has  the  political

will  to  exert its leadership and has once again performed  the

impossible  to rally its people around them to make the  economy

competitive  again.  In other countries, the 15%  CPF  wage  cut

would  have led to massive strikes and protests.  Our Government

has  put  forward a very convincing reason why cost  cutting  is

very  necessary for our economy to chug along, to save jobs  and

to  prosper  in the future.  However, what is not clear  in  the

Report  is, and I share the same sentiments with many who  spoke

before  me,  how  much  of  the $10  billion  is  borne  by  the

Government.  Mr Leong Horn Kee has mentioned earlier  that  with

the 10% cut in CPF and 5% cut in wages, that would amount to  $7

billion.   It  is expected that the money supply to the  economy

would  dwindle  substantially.  Though the  banks  may  help  in

increasing the money supply through extending more credit to the

home buyers, the net effect can still be contractionary.  Hence,

I  wonder  if  the Government's economists have worked  out  the

appropriate  amount  to  cut from the  non-wage  parts  such  as

utilities rate, JTC/HDB rentals, etc. to offset the reduction in

consumption power and avoid a further slump in domestic demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not sufficient, the Government should introduce

more  expansionary policies to avoid a deflation.  The September

figures   already  showed  large  drops  in  retail   and   food

consumption.   This shows that the consumers could have  started

slowing  down  their consumption before the wage  and  CPF  cut.

This must have contributed to part of our negative growth in the

last quarter.  If there is no immediate positive stimulus in the

pipeline, the market perception is still that in the short  term

businesses  may  not  pick up much.  I urge  the  Government  to

stimulate the economy more, even though



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1403</b></font><br><br>



some may have leakages and the effect of

stimulation cannot be 100%, but as Members have pointed out

earlier, the Government has plenty of reserves which I was made

to understand are getting good return.  My guess is that we

should have an additional $3-$5 billion a year from the return

on investment of reserves, if we can convince ourselves that for

one or two years, our return on reserves can be lower, or even

zero.  Is there anything wrong with that?  Any investment, be it

private, mutual fund, hedge fund, can have some bad years.  I

suggest that we can use some of the profits on the investment to

stimulate the economy and keep the principal untouched.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me go back to the non-wage cuts. The cuts in

these  areas will not make the Government the only loser because

the  cuts  in CPF and bonus of the civil servants plus the  much

reduced  tender prices of Government projects will have resulted

in  a  lot of savings for the Government in the first place.   I

hereby  urge  the  Government to be more aggressive  in  cutting

utilities  rates,  MRT  rates, rentals,  etc.   After  all,  the

corresponding  rates of return from Singapore Power,  MRTC,  JTC

and  HDB factories depend very much on how much the fixed assets

were  valued.  Just to give an example.  Singapore  Power  could

have  inherited  high land cost because its  incorporation  took

place  at  the  height  of  the  property  boom.   Like  private

companeis that have to make provision for losses due to  a  drop

in  land  values,  entities such as Singapore  Power  should  be

allowed to write down its land value so that even after it  cuts

its  utilities  rates,  the return on investment  would  not  be

substantially  affected.   This  is  a  logical  step  for   our

utilities company to benchmark against those in the region whose

competitiveness  has been enhanced by the drop in  currency  and

land values.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the time being, to the employers, the 15% cut in

business  cost  as suggested by the CSC come as a great  relief.

Before  this,  many were wondering how their firms will  survive

with our high cost



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1404</b></font><br><br>



structure.  This matter has been brought up in this

Chamber by many Members of this House throughout the year.  Many

firms depend on domestic demand, which is one-third of our total

demand.  Many of those who export also depend to some extent on

domestic demand as a base business.  If the CSC's

recommendations result in a reduction in domestic demand or

diminishing capabilities of the local firms, I can say that the

net result may not be desirable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC, after convincing the workers to be prepared for

the  CPF  and  wage  cut,  has called on employers  to  increase

revenue.  But, with the economies in the region in a slump, this

is  not  an easy task for most employers.  At this juncture,  we

should  perhaps re-examine our Government procurement system  to

see whether the local companies are given fair opportunities  to

conduct  business.  Particularly, in the area  of  construction,

which  is  one of the few areas that Government can  pump-prime,

the  rules  do not necessarily create a level playing field  for

the local and foreign firms to participate.  Mr Speaker, Sir,  I

hereby declare my interest in a construction company.  To draw a

pictorial  description of our tender system,  I  would  like  to

describe our Government procurement system as a convex,  tinted,

one-way  mirror.  A local firm standing in front of  the  mirror

will  find itself smaller, darker than the real one.  A  foreign

firm  standing behind can see through the system  to  gauge  the

size   of  our  companies  and  take  full  advantage  of   such

transparency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for years, foreign firms, particularly in

construction,  have  been dumping their  products  and  services

here.   They have been practising marginal pricing, transferring

costs  to  generate revenue to stimulate their own  economy  and

reducing their fixed overheads.  The local firms are just like a

lightweight   boxer  challenging  a  heavyweight  boxer.    They

probably  do  not  appear  as  solid  and  impressive   as   the

heavyweight.  But if the job requires only a lightweighter,  why

must  we  choose  a heavyweighter?  Or, can we  hire  a  foreign

trainer,  I  emphasise foreign, under our  wing  and  build  our

fighters into a world-class heavyweight?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1405</b></font><br><br>



There have been many examples where our tender

system itself excludes our own firms.  Some of the conditions

ask for track records which could not be found previously in our

republic.  In the world of construction, many countries try hard

to use their procurement power to build their own capability.

But it did not seem so here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not advocating protectionism. I am

suggesting that the competition should be fair.  Dumping  should

be strongly discouraged.  Otherwise, the local firms will always

face  an  uphill  battle  to  acquire  knowledge  and  to  build

capability.   Without the projects, the local firms cannot  have

the  chance to hire foreign talents to build up their  knowledge

and  experience  base.  This is similar to building  a  national

soccer  team.  If we import every player, including the  captain

from overseas, we do not really have a national team.  This team

can  easily  go away and we end up with no players at  all.   In

other  words,  in economic terms, our economy has hollowed  out.

But  if we have foreign talent to be part of our team, to be our

sparring partners, then our players will eventually emerge to be

as good as any foreign player.  I think CSC should find a way to

ensure  that  the playing field is level for everyone,  and  our

supporters will cheer for our home team.  The present  situation

whereby our own crowd cheers the foreign teams and boo the local

team does not have the right spirit to build our competitiveness

to  become world class companies.  I have so far cited  examples

in  construction which I know very intimately, but  the  general

public sentiment is that the same applies to other sectors.  How

are  we  going  to build world class companies  if  we  have  no

confidence  in  our own people?  May I quote  a  famous  Chinese

proverb       from       the       "Tactics       of        War:

(Sun  Zi  Ping  Fa)  -  Yi  ren  bu  yong,  yong  ren  bu  yi  [

].   It  means that we should not suspect the person we wish  to

engage and we do not engage those we suspect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leads me to the next recommendation on the building of

world  class companies.  It is a natural and good thing to  have

GLCs  to  kick  start the development of world class  companies.

This is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1406</b></font><br><br>



partly because the Government knows the GLCs'

capability and has trust in them.  But such trust should not be

extended in such a way that the GLC grows in an indiscriminate

manner and becomes a monster.  In the world of business, people

talk about core competence to excel.  The GLCs should stick to

their core business and try not to encroach on areas which the

local companies can do equally well.  The financial clout of

GLCs should be exploited to do those businesses such as

launching satellites, telecommunications, airlines, large-scale

engineering, etc, but not businesses such as restaurants, golf

courses and real estate.  Temasek Holdings, as the overall

guardian, should examine and evaluate the business plan of GLCs

carefully to ensure that they will not pose unfair competitive

advantage over local firms.  Let us be mindful that it is the

world trend to stay away from being too diversified.  There are

many case studies on this.  IT&T, the Korean chaebols, are vivid

examples of what we should avoid in building our world class

companies.  On the other hand, Nokia, Ericsson are the good

positive examples cited by CSC on how they succeed by finding a

niche market in technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my conversation with friends, colleagues and foreigners,

one  question that often pops out is the accountability  of  the

management of GLCs.  Will they be subject to the same  level  of

scrutiny  by  the public and the investors as any  other  public

company?   I  think  if  GLCs  are  to  grow  into  world  class

companies,  the  management must be  held  accountable  for  the

performance  of the company.  If they are good, they  should  be

handsomely rewarded.  If not, appropriate accountability  should

ensue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect of building GLCs into world class

companies,  as recommended by the Report, is that it  gives  the

reader  the impression that GLCs are the only likely candidates.

I beg to argue that GLCs should stick to their core business and

let  other SMEs be nurtured and built into world class companies

in  areas  that GLCs have no obvious competence.   There  is  no

guarantee that GLCs would succeed.  By



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1407</b></font><br><br>



letting some SMEs to grow is a logical way to

diversify our economy to have more breadth and depth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC Report touches on the introduction of more incentives

such  as  employees'  stock  option  plan,  tax  reduction   for

foreigners  who  work in Singapore, etc.  Yes,  I  support  this

market  oriented approach in management.  After all, one of  the

key measures of success is the amount of money one makes.  ESOP,

the employees' stock option plan, makes a lot of sense.  But, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg the Government to look beyond  implementing

just  those  few suggested measures.  Singapore has always  been

quoted  as  a "fine" country.  And that is to say, we have  used

more  sticks  than carrots.  In the earlier development  of  our

nation,  perhaps it took more sticks than carrots to  accelerate

the  climbing of the value-added ladder.  Some of the sticks are

increased  rents; increased wages; and imposition of quotas  and

levies.  But the world is quite different now, especially in the

aftermath of Asia's economic crisis.  The carrot method, such as

ESOP, will perhaps work better.  So far, similar policies,  such

as  levy  differential, construction quality score, PSB's  grant

for  R&D,  have  worked out very well.  They have achieved  good

results.   Hence,  I urge the Government to deploy  more  carrot

methods  to stimulate the growth of the economy.  And I  believe

such incentive methods will let the Government get back more, in

the  form of taxes and other benefits, than what they give  away

as incentives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area where the CSC Report is not clear is that as

the  business  facilitator,  how would  Government  act  as  the

regulator and promoter at the same time?  There is bound  to  be

some conflict of interest.  The CSC Report mentioned the receipt

of  feedback that the approval process remained opaque and hence

suggested  greater  transparency and accountability  within  the

civil  service.  Yes, this is very good.  But, quite often,  the

system  itself does not work out this way.  I want  to  give  an

example, again, in the construction industry.  When a project is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>



delayed due to changes in design or client's

requirement, the supervising officer may impose liquidated

damages on the contractor to establish a bargaining power to

negotiate for waiver of claim from the contractor.  Clearly,

this is a conflict of interest.  The very person who causes the

delay is given the discretionary power to mete out the penalty.

So in order not to jeopardise his career, the tendency will be

to take the easy way out.  Outside the construction industry, I

believe, similar examples exist.  I hence suggest that in

addition to the CSC's recommendations in the chapter on

Government as business facilitator, closer attention should be

paid to modify and improve the civil service structure so that

their efficiency will be in line with the private sector and no

wastages and losses will be passed on to the private sector

unnecessarily.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now quote another example about conflict of interest.

The Government and the construction industry have been trying to

promote  the  upgrading  of  skills and  engagement  of  skilled

workers.   So  the  levy differential policy was  perceived  and

implemented.   However, in the early stages  of  implementation,

the  industry  has fed to the Government that the policy,  which

has  stark results in promoting skills upgrading, also has  side

effects, such as giving a particular country, such as China,  an

unfair  advantage on the cost.  Most of the skilled workers  who

enjoy  a  low levy of $100 today come from China.  But it  is  a

known  fact  that Chinese workers are very difficult to  control

and  only Chinese companies can control them through their  home

connections.  Therefore, the policy actually opens the door wide

open  to the Chinese construction firms who now outbid everybody

because  of the low levies.  In other words, the policy  creates

an  uneven playing field.  If the policy is not remedied through

the  diversification  of  sources of workers,  the  construction

industry  will hollow out.  There will be no other  but  Chinese

construction companies.  Then, how will local firms compete  and

generate revenue to keep the workers, engineers, architects  and

foremen employed?  How are we going to build capability?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to sum up, the CSC Report

provides a great vision.  It is, in fact, a dream for most

nations.  But can we get there in 10 years?  You need a lot of

change in mindset, politically and socially, to change from the

current status to that vision in 10 years.  Many of our people,

our industries, our entrepreneurs, our civil servants are

perhaps not ready for the goals envisaged by the CSC whose

members constitute the most successful, forward-looking, dynamic

individuals.  The job now for the Government is to convert the

wonderful ideas of CSC into reality.  This is not an easy task.

But if our Government is able to persuade our people to take pay

cuts, I do not see why it cannot realise the vision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support the Minister's motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, most international magazines have commented on

the   regional  financial  crisis.   Nearly  all  of  them  have

concluded that Singapore with its good governance,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>



sound fundamentals and preparedness to take quick

and decisive measures will be able to weather the storm and

place herself in the best position to surge forward when the

region recovers.  I suggest that the MP for Hougang and the

NCMP, Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam, read this report.  Maybe then, they

would not be taking cheap shots so freely at the Government and

the Ministers for being not good enough to handle the recent

financial crisis.  What is comforting to know is that Singapore

can indeed be considered the oasis of the region.  Nevertheless,

the fact remains that we have felt the full impact of the

current crisis and that we have to take appropriate action to

deal with the difficult times in front of us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On hindsight, the two tasks of addressing the present

economic   crisis   and  the  question  of  competitiveness   in

Singapore,  the future Singapore, I feel that they  should  have

been  taken  up separately.  The task of addressing the  current

crisis should have been taken up earlier.  Because, as early  as

the  1998 Budget was presented, it was obvious that the economic

crisis  would  deteriorate very rapidly.  And if  we  had  taken

these  recommended measures earlier, it would bring much  relief

to  many  companies and businesses and perhaps even  lessen  the

number of workers being retrenched.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that the recommendations by the CSC Report

on   the  reduction  of  business  costs,  if  followed,   would

definitely  be  effective, although the extent of the  reduction

cannot be fully ascertained as items such as reduction or rebate

on  Government taxes or charges have not been fully  determined.

Many  Members have expressed that the Government should be  more

generous  in this area, especially in the reduction  of  foreign

worker  levy.   They  should be more  drastic  than  that  being

recommended and it should also be extended to foreign maids.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add that, in considering reducing PUB,

telecommunications  and transportation charges,  the  Government

departments and statutory boards should discard this notion that

they have to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>



revenue positive, especially some of these

statutory boards should not be bogged down by the fact that they

have been or are in the process of being privatised and

therefore they have to be profit-orientated.   It is crucial to

change the mindset for at least this critical period and take a

more long-term outlook.  Many Members in this House fear that

the reduction in business costs will invariably bring hardship

to the employees, especially to the blue collar workers.

Therefore, it is important for the Government to take

appropriate action to ensure that the cost of living should be

reduced simultaneously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is of utmost importance because it will help to cushion

the  reduction of wages and CPF.  While the CSC recommended such

costs  to  be  reduced by 15%, in the private sector especially,

this  may not be possible.  For in good times, the wage increase

in   the  private  sector  normally  goes  beyond  that  of  NWC

recommendation  and  during  this  difficult  time,  in  certain

sectors,  wages might have to go well below the NWC  recommended

level  in  order  to  avoid more severe  retrenchments.   And  a

reduction  in the cost of living is the only way to  lessen  the

pain  created  by the loss of income in the average  Singaporean

household.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also consider other charges like the town

council's conservancy charges, transportation charges, and  even

education  charges like school fees should be reduced.   By  the

logic  that all wages and other charges are reduced, these costs

would  definitely  be lower and it should be passed  on  to  the

workers.   However,  even  if we can achieve  the  objective  of

cutting  business cost and lowering the cost of living, we  will

not  be  able to address the sharp economic slowdown completely.

Our  economy must be given a boost.  I know that tampering  with

our national reserves is a very sensitive issue.  Personally,  I

am  most  reluctant to suggest touching our reserves  under  any

normal  circumstances.  Having said that, in  a  situation  like

now, it would be necessary for the Government to look



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1412</b></font><br><br>



into ways to make available a certain amount of our

reserves to stimulate the economy.  If one believes that one of

the reasons for accumulating a healthy reserve is to prepare for

a rainy day, now is the time that we need the umbrella very

badly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it would be prudent for the Government to have a well-established plan to apportion some of our reserves in order to

undertake  projects that can stimulate our economy  provided  of

course  that  we should have plans to replace such  reserves  or

have the confidence to add on to it when our economy is on track

again.   This I have no doubt that we are able to do so, because

from our track record, the Government and people have year after

year been able to achieve a surplus to add to our reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the long-term strategy, the Committee

has rightly identified the manufacturing and services sector  as

the  twin  engines  of  growth in the future,  and  that  it  is

important   to   build   world-class  companies   as   well   as

strengthening  our  base for small and medium  enterprises.   It

further  identified that the Government should continue to  play

an  active  role  in  supporting and  facilitating  the  private

sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of Singapore's success is its ability to attract MNCs

to  set up businesses in Singapore.  This not only brings in the

economic  benefit  but,  more importantly,  it  helps  Singapore

companies  to benefit from the latest technological  advancement

and  be the forerunner of our own R&D development in the region.

As we are a small economy, most of our enterprises are small and

medium  in size and the GLCs have always provided the leadership

in   establishing  the  model  for  world-class  companies,  for

example,  SIA,  Singapore Technologies, Sembcorp and  PSA,  etc.

However, in order to realise the objectives of strengthening our

own  local  enterprises and at the same time  build  world-class

companies,  GLCs and local SMEs should work in  tandem  and  not

against each other.  Therefore, the GLCs should stay focused  by

sticking to their core business as much as possible and maximise

their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>



strength in having vast resources both in finance

and talent.  If diversification is required, one should confine

to areas which can provide synergy to the core business.  They

should not be distracted by short-term gains and diversify into

unrelated small businesses in competition with our local

companies.  They have a different role to play.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand from some of the local businessmen that they are

puzzled  as  to  why some GLCs started to do business  which  is

totally unrelated to their core business and begin to compete in

the  very  limited market with the local businessmen.   Although

time  and  again,  they  have assured that  the  GLCs  would  do

business on a level playing field, they think it is a case where

the  playing  field may be level, but the distance  between  the

goal  posts  may vary because these GLCs have their own  network

and  connections, and therefore render the competition a  little

bit skewed.  It may be a perception.  It is important that if we

have  to  strengthen our base of the SMEs, we have to give  them

space  and opportunity.  We must assure them that they have  the

full  support of the Government.  I believe that the SMEs,  GLCs

and MNCs can work together with each other and benefit from each

other's strengths and weaknesses, just as we need to nurture the

talented and experienced CEOs like Walt Disney's, Michael Eisner

to  help  run multi-million dollar corporations.  We  also  need

entrepreneurs  like Bill Gates who can build a  business  empire

out  of  nothing.   While the corporate  CEOs  and  the  private

entrepreneurs are very much different in their approach and ways

of   conducting  business,  their  contributions  are  of  equal

importance and one cannot totally displace the other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the Committee has identified all the steps we have

to  take  in order to achieve the objective of making  Singapore

one  of the most competitive and vibrant business centres in the

world,  it  is  important that a detailed plan be drawn  up  for

implementation.   We  can  make  a  vision  statement  and   set

objectives,  but  if we cannot stay focused  and  have  definite

plans and programmes for the realisation of this vision, and all

participating parties



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>



do not follow certain parameters set out in the

Report, it will remain as an academic study and not an effective

and dynamic document to get us into the next millennium.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank  you for allowing me to participate in this debate on  the

motion proposed by the Minister for Trade and Industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since last year's Budget debate in July, many Members have made

numerous  calls in this House to address issues related  to  the

cost  of doing business in Singapore.  In the light of the  then

deteriorating  economic  backdrop,  Members  have   echoed   the

expectations  and the hopes of the business community  that  the

issue  of  competitiveness be addressed in the  Budget  and,  in

particular,  to  offer some relief to the high  costs  of  doing

business  in Singapore.  Regrettably, the Budget fell  short  of

addressing this main concern of preservation and enhancement  of

our   competitiveness  vis-a-vis  our  neighbours.   While   the

Government announced a $2 billion package in off-budget measures

in  June to control costs, many businesses also felt that  there

is  hardly any positive impact on them.  The perception  remains

that  the  effort to closely monitor the powers of the  business

community,  especially of the small and medium-sized businesses,

is  lacking and that the Government continues to rely on not  so

current statistics to steer the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we debate the motion on endorsing the CSC Report over

these  two  days, I believe the Government realises the  extreme

anxiousness  of our business community and the man-in-the-street

about  the current state of affairs and their expectation of  an

integrated and an action-oriented Government approach in swiftly

dealing with the issue of our competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the debate began yesterday, much has already been

said  and many suggestions made by fellow MPs in terms  of  what

more  could  be done over and above the recommendations  of  the

CSC.  Allow me to offer some of my own thoughts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I think the Government should not hesitate

to adopt a radical paradigm shift in fundamental assumptions

upon which many policies today are predicated.  I believe many

of these policies have been formulated based upon a mix of

Government controls and free market forces.  It is time that

some of the past premises employed to formulate existing

policies be critically reviewed in the context of their

relevance to the current economic conditions.  Much has changed

in recent months, let alone years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On concerns of the business community, while the SMEs are

generally   quite   happy  with  the  cost  reduction   measures

recommended, there is still concern that the Government's  share

of  $2.5 billion or so is disproportionate to the amount  to  be

shouldered  by the business community and the working  populace.

There  is room for the Government to more clearly explain  this.

It   is  understandable  that  wages  are  manifold  more   than

Government's  charges, but there is a strong  feeling  that  the

Government  could  and  need  to  do  more  in  absorbing   more

Government-related  cost components such as  reduction  of  land

costs,  property taxes, port and telecommunication  charges  and

giving  income  tax  rebates.  This  could  go  a  long  way  in

enhancing  the  much needed confidence and stimulating  spending

and  reinvestments.   Much of these have been  touched  upon  by

others who have spoken earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some SMEs continue to express disappointment with the much

beefed-up Local Enterprises Financing Scheme (LEFS).  They  felt

that  their eligibility to take advantage of the scheme is  left

entirely to the banks.  The latter decides solely whether or not

the applicants are eligible for the loan applications.  While  I

fully  subscribe to the fact that the scheme should not  support

clearly  hopeless  cases, I am concerned about borderline  cases

which  may  become  victims of the crisis if  not  appropriately

helped.   There should be an appeal channel for such  cases.   I

would  like  to suggest the formation of a Committee  comprising

members from the Singapore Productivity and Standards



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>



Board and banks to review borderline but worthy

cases in deciding financial assistance eligibility for such

cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ERP charges for business vehicles was also a hot topic when

the  GPC  for Finance and Trade and Industry, of which  I  am  a

member,  met  with various business groups.  Many strongly  felt

that ERP charges for goods vehicles (pick-up trucks, lorries and

others)  used for purely business reasons should be  temporarily

exempted  from ERP charges during the current economic downturn.

Most of such vehicles make multiple entries into the CBD and the

ERP charges certainly add up to business costs.  Suspending such

charges  will  certainly help at a time when every dollar  saved

contributes to the lowering of business costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One important sector that has long been suffering is the

retail sector.  This has seen a decline over the years and, more

recently,  hefty double digit declines.  They are suffering  not

only  as  a  result  of consumers being more cautious  in  their

spending, but also in the slowdown of the tourism industry since

last  year.   With tourist arrivals not within our control,  the

retail  sector  will have to look up more to  domestic  consumer

spending.  The wage and bonus cuts undoubtedly will have further

negative  impact  on  spending  as consumers'  purchasing  power

becomes  more  diminished.  This strongly supports the  argument

for further tax rebates to stimulate the already weak demand, as

echoed  by many MPs earlier.  A temporary suspension of  GST  on

essential goods and supplies such as clothing and food will also

go  a  long  way  in  not only enhancing demand  but  also  help

alleviate  the  burden of the people affected by  wage  and  CPF

cuts.  Such tax exemptions on the essential goods are common  in

many  states of the USA to dampen the cost of living  impact  on

the working class.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retailers are also hopeful of rental reductions relative to

the  fall in the retail sales.  They are heavily counting on the

Singapore  Tourism Board, working doubly hard to  boost  visitor

arrivals  through more active tourist promotions, especially  in

countries  not  affected  by  recession  such  as  the  European

countries, the United



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>



States, China, Taiwan and perhaps India.  They also

felt that bringing more exhibitions and conventions and staging

world-class events such as the performing arts, musical and

sports events will not only enhance Singapore's competitiveness

but also help position Singapore as the Broadway of ASEAN, if

not Asia.  We have the world-class infrastructure to support

this objective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the social concerns. Singaporeans

deserve  special  salute  for  having  shown  understanding  and

willingness  to  move ahead with the CPF  and  wage  cuts.   The

coordinated efforts by the Government and the unions to  explain

the  important need for immediate business cost reductions,  the

rationale  behind the need for CPF and wage cost  cuts  and  the

prospect  of  massive  job  losses if  these  measures  are  not

undertaken,  have  generally gone down  well  with  the  working

populace.   However, anxieties are still abound, especially  the

effect of these cost-cutting measures in the ability to continue

servicing their mortgage loans.  While the Government  has  said

that  it will help HDB dwellers, nothing appears to be in  store

for  the  lower middle income earners who, especially  over  the

last  two years, have upgraded to private properties.   Some  of

them have lost their jobs as a result of the crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an interim measure, I would like to propose that the

Government  consider the relaxation of CPF usage  to  allow  for

pooling of CPF resources among immediate family members to  help

those in trouble tide over their mortgage repayments during  the

crisis  period.   Working parents, children  or  siblings  could

assist  the  family member or members in trouble by  temporarily

allowing them usage of their CPF savings to pay for the  monthly

mortgage  payments  subject to certain  regulations.   Once  the

troubled  family member becomes gainfully employed and overcomes

his problem, the assistance should cease and the amount borrowed

should be returned back progressively to the lenders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savings in the Special Account of the CPF should also be

temporarily freed up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1418</b></font><br><br>



for such purposes and should similarly be returned

upon employment stability and recovery of the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a regulatory measure to assist troubled first-time private

property   purchasers,  the  Government,  through  perhaps   the

Monetary   Authority  of  Singapore,  could  assist  in   pacing

financial  institutions  involved  in  lending  money  for  such

purposes  to  help  them  reschedule  loan  repayments  wherever

feasible.   HDB  policy and guidelines employed  to  assist  HDB

flatowners could be used as a basis to regulate this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Manpower should also seriously consider the

temporary reduction of the domestic worker levy.  A reduction of

30-50%  will  go  a long way in helping struggling  dual  income

families affected by the CPF and wage cuts, but yet could not do

away  with  the services of a maid to look after their  children

and/or aged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For businesses that are doing well and are benefiting positively

from the cost reduction exercise, they should also shoulder some

social   responsibility  in  these  tough  economic   times   to

correspondingly lower their product prices or service charges to

help  cushion the impact of wage cuts taken by the  people.   If

the  overall intention is to bring wages down to 1994 level,  it

is  imperative  that  every constituent of  the  land,  ie,  the

Government,  the  corporate citizens and the  people,  do  their

collective part to also bring down our cost of living as well as

we   can  to  1994  standard.   Only  then  will  some  form  of

equilibrium be achieved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, allow me to applaud the CSC for their effort

and  boldness in making several important recommendations,  both

for  the  short and long term which, I believe, will  have  far-reaching  implications for Singapore when implemented.   Looking

on the horizon, it is my hope to see the Government put in place

a  regular  ongoing competitiveness monitoring and  benchmarking

mechanism  to  prevent us as far as possible  from  again  being

caught  off  guard.  While it is fair to note that the  currency

crisis leading to significant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>



depreciation of regional currencies, which is also

a major cause of the erosion of our competitiveness was hard to

predict, there were many tell tale signs pointing to the

escalating cost of doing business in Singapore, which the

Government and statutory boards have influence in moderating

without having to undermine the free market mechanism.  This

includes, as I have mentioned earlier on, land pricing and

rental regulations, a major business cost component, port,

utilities and communication charges.  Ways must also be found to

further refine our flexible wage and compensation system to

prevent the need for the CPF mechanism from being continually

relied upon in the future to adjust cost and address

competitiveness issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unusually long growth period in Asia, including here in

Singapore,  has  made  us  forgotten that  crises,  bubbles  and

crashes are an inevitable part of economic business cycles.   We

should now brace ourselves to be better prepared for future  ups

and  downs.  Sir, having an efficient competitiveness  barometer

will  go  a  long way in regularly checking where  we  stand  in

comparison  to regional as well as industrialised and  developed

countries.    Such  indicators  will  enable  prompt  regulatory

actions  to  be  taken  that  will  enable  us  to  sustain  our

competitiveness  on  a real time basis and, hopefully,  do  away

with  the need for off-Budget measures and jolting the lives  of

Singaporeans  with  CPF and wage cuts.  Such  an  approach  will

increase Singapore's and the business community's resilience  in

weathering the current and future storms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, exceptional times

require  boldness of vision and action.  It calls for  a  common

understanding and purpose by the people to collectively meet the

challenges.  These are exceptional times.  Since the release  of

the  Report by the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness  and

the reconvened National Wages Council, I had met up with my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1420</b></font><br><br>



grassroots leaders and residents.  They expressed

understanding and support of the two Reports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me make two general remarks before I comment on the measures

proposed.  In a crisis, we are pressured to find quick  answers.

Yet, in our evolving history, the present crisis will only be  a

blip.   We  must  be  careful  not  to  pursue  quick  solutions

inconsistent with sound principles, which underpin our long-term

interests  and  survival.   Short-term  solutions  must  by  its

definition  be  exceptions  that can  be  dismantled  after  the

crisis.   These  solutions cannot and should not be  allowed  to

adversely change the long-term course of the nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is one thing to accept the rationality and

relevance of the recommendations themselves, and yet another the

pains faced upon implementation.  The people want and expect the

Government and employers to convince and show openly  that  they

understand and appreciate the pains suffered and sacrifices made

by the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call upon our employers to declare that they will share fairly

the  profits  in good times as they now desire workers  to  make

sacrifices  for  the company.  When the good times  return,  the

cuts  should not only be restored but profits be shared  through

bonus and other benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the short-term specific measures to deal with

the  crisis.   The need for short-term specific measures  arises

from  our  sudden loss of competitiveness.  A major  reason  for

this loss of competitiveness is the relative appreciation of the

Singapore  dollar  to the currencies of our  competitors.   Some

hence feel that allowing the Singapore dollar to depreciate is a

less  painful answer to cutting cost.  It would be  helpful  for

the  Government to make more efforts to explain why cutting cost

is the better alternative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me look at the short-term measures from both the company's

viewpoint  and  the worker's viewpoint.  I will start  with  the

company.   The  cut  in business cost is not only  for  external

competition, but also internally to help our companies survive.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1421</b></font><br><br>



There is thus strong support for the specific

measures proposed by the Committee, particularly the following:



<br><br><i>Foreign Worker Levy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign worker levy should be reduced. This will bring

much  relief  to  those companies with high dependence  on  such

workers.   These workers do not pay CPF and a cut in the  latter

does not lighten the cost burden.  Affected sectors include  the

food  and beverage, and construction.  The amount of cut in  the

levy should provide as good a relief as the CPF cut.



<br><br><i>Cut in Land/Factory Rent</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rent of industrial land, factory and commercial

properties should be further reduced.  The proposal to return to

the  1990  rent level is much welcomed.  HDB and JTC, being  the

largest  landlords  of such properties, should  take  the  lead.

Private  owners will follow.   The short-term help  is  obvious.

There  is  also  a long-term impact as companies can  remain  in

Singapore.   Singapore will also be more attractive  to  foreign

investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB and JTC should also be more willing to rent out vacant

land  on  TOL.   I  have been told that Singaporeans  have  been

forced to go overseas to grow turf grass for import to Singapore

even  though  vacant lands are available for this purpose  here.

It  is  also difficult and expensive to obtain the use  of  such

land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also calls for the following:



<br><br><i>Training Subsidies</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage companies to train their workers, the

subsidies  given should be increased.  This will  encourage  and

make  it  easier  for  companies  to  retain  the  workers   for

retraining.  Training fees should also be kept low.  These  fees

have been escalating much too quickly.



<br><br><i>Medisave Rate for the Self-Employed</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist the self-employed, the increase in the Medisave

contribution planned for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>



next year should be deferred.  In fact, the

Government should consider reducing it during this period of

crisis.



<br><br><i>Parking Charges</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parking charges for commercial and heavy vehicles should be

reduced.



<br><br><i>Banking Charges</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various banking charges like the opening of letters of

credit should be reduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the workers. As wages form a large part

of  the  cost  to  companies, cost cutting means cutting  wages.

This  is  painful  for the people.  Hence,  at  the  same  time,

efforts must be made to provide relief to the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the reliefs that were sought include:



<br><br><i>Housing Loans Repayment</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help should be given for the repayment of housing loans. A

major  concern  with  the  CPF cut is the  worker's  ability  to

finance  the  monthly repayment of his housing  loan.   As  most

people  own  HDB  flats,  I  hope the Government  will  announce

schemes to help owners of HDB flats.  HDB has constantly assured

flat  owners that they will be assisted.  They must continue  to

reassure  the  people.  I am happy that several banks  are  also

offering  alternative  repayment schemes to  lower  the  monthly

repayment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent decline in interest rates has helped to reduce

the  monthly  instalments of housing loans  substantially.   But

interest  rates  are capricious.  We should not be  lulled  into

complacency  by  this development.  It is necessary  to  set  in

place schemes to help with the housing loan repayment.



<br><br><i>Maid Levy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The levy should be reduced. This will bring much relief to

families  who desperately need the assistance of maids  such  as

families with very young children and old parents to look  after

and both spouses are working.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1423</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Cut in Fees and Charges</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this period, every bit of cut to the cost of living

is a help to the people.  There were calls for reduction in fees

and charges and for increase in rebates:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School fees at all levels from kindergarten to university

be reduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utility charges including telephone charges be reduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport charges like bus and taxi fares be reduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service and conservancy charges by Town Councils be

reduced.    Government  should  also  give  more   service   and

conservancy rebates, especially to the lower income group.    In

this  period of crisis, the rebate should be extended to  5-room

and Executive flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government should give more income tax rebates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical charges should be reduced. The number of Class C

beds should be increased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies and hawkers should reduce prices.

Particular  concerns were expressed for the  low  income  group.

Questions were asked if this group of people could be spared the

cuts, or alternatively be provided with additional reliefs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keen interests were expressed on the restoration of the

wage  and  CPF cuts.  Residents were keen to know when the  cuts

will  be  restored.    They would like the  NWC  to  review  the

situation  regularly  so that the cuts can be  quickly  restored

when the crisis blows over.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me turn to the long-term measures to Singapore's

competitiveness.  While we seek to develop new strategies, it is

important  not  to forget, but to renew and revitalise  existing

core strengths.  Let me share the following:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1424</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have enjoyed rapid growth for over 30 years.

Parents who had gone through hard times try to make sure that

their children are never in want of anything.  This is

understandable.  But we also run the risk of our young not

understanding poverty and what it means to be resilient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to always compete with the world for our existence.

This  requires  hard  work, commitment, a  fighting  spirit  and

constantly  to  remind our young of the need to be  competitive.

If  we lack this motivation, we are doomed.  After having it  so

good  for  so long, is our mental and physical capability  still

strong?  We must stress national values and priorities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional countries have been ravaged by the economic

storm.   They are chastened.  Their systems will now be  leaner.

We must take this opportunity to learn and emerge wiser from the

crisis.  We must remind our people that they cannot take  things

for granted, that our rosy future is not preordained.  While  we

enjoy  during the good times, we must also prepare for  and  set

aside  something for bad times.  The future of Singapore  is  in

our  hands.   We decide and make the future.  If we  learn  this

lesson  and  emerge from the crisis stronger as a people  and  a

nation, the pains will not be in vain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to add a word of caution. As we plan

for  the  future, we must not give the impression to the  people

that   this   will   guarantee  us   against   future   economic

difficulties.   We must remind the people that  whatever  we  do

difficult  moments can surface.  There are too many factors  and

imponderables in the real world.  What we can do and must do  is

to  constantly anticipate and prepare for them. We must  not  be

lulled into complacency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be better motivated and committed to our work and

companies.    Several  employers  told   me   that   they   have

difficulties hiring people, or if they do manage to  hire,  some

workers  do not stay on long, even during this difficult period.

Our  workers are fussy.  If the work is demanding, they  do  not

stay long.  They



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1425</b></font><br><br>



hop from one job to another for pay increases, even

small amounts.  They do not like to go for training.  If they

accept training, they are not happy with their bonds.  Those who

are trained often do not stay long, lured away by higher salary

elsewhere, feeling no obligations to the companies which train

them.  I have personally encountered others who during this

crisis would rather stay unemployed at home than to take up a

lower paid job, or a job that is "too far" away from their home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are indeed lucky to have painstakingly cultivated

tripartism.  We had shared both the bounty in good times and the

privation during bad times.  This has built trust, consensus and

understanding  among  the Government, employers  and  employees.

Many foreigners have expressed disbelief that our workers agreed

to  have  their  salaries  cut.  In  some  countries,  the  very

suggestion  itself will already cause an uproar.  For  this,  we

must  indeed be proud as a nation.  This is an element  of  long

term   strength  and  competitiveness.   We  must  ensure   that

tripartism endures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the present cost cutting proposals cut down the value

of the resources, the actual resources used do not decrease.  In

view of the scarcity of many resources, we should make an effort

to  use  less  of  them.  We should call  upon  our  people  and

companies  to  cut  down waste by using  these  resources   more

efficiently.  They must be constantly aware of the importance of

conserving   resources.   If  necessary,  we   should   consider

campaigns  to  remind  and encourage people  to  use  water  and

electricity more carefully, to be more productive in  our  work,

to help keep our environment clean, to protect our facilities so

that  less maintenance and repair expenses are needed.  This  is

an element of enduring competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, I call upon our people to stand united during

this  time of crisis, to make painful sacrifices for the nation.

We  must support the cost cutting measures to help our companies

and  hence  ourselves to ride out the storm.   This  is  in  the

interest of the nation and for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1426</b></font><br><br>



collective good.  Meanwhile, the Government and

employers must show understanding of the pains incurred and

provide unstinting help to alleviate them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a longer term, we must remember that vicissitudes are

part  and  parcel  of the economic life of a  nation.   We  must

remember this when the good times return. We must never take the

good  times for granted.  We must always prepare for lean  times

in times of plenty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our existing strategy has done us proud as we have braced

the  current  crisis much better than our neighbours.   We  must

forge  an  even more robust strategy and a national cohesiveness

that will anchor the country against future uncertainties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

in  full  support of the motion by the Minister  for  Trade  and

Industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is wide consensus that the Committee on

Singapore's  Competitiveness  has carried  out  a  comprehensive

analysis and made well constructed recommendations.  Many of  my

colleagues have dwelt at length on the strategic issues.   So  I

will confine my comments to the short term measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback by the various industry groups that the GPC spoke

to highlighted two observations.  Firstly, there is a sense that

many  of  the recommended interim measures are weighted  towards

manufacturing  and  construction.   Secondly,  sectors  such  as

retail  and  food  and beverage are worried  that  the  proposed

reduction in wages will dampen consumption, which will more than

overwhelm the benefits from a reduction in operating costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, companies, especially the smaller operators in

trading and services, are seeking help as they face a cash  flow

crunch  in  the  short term and would like  to  better  position

themselves after the downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like now to propose specific recommendations

to achieve the following two objectives:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to help improve the cashflow for

companies and, secondly, to mitigate against the inevitable

dampening effect on consumption.



<br><br><i>Improve cashflow for companies</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, in the interim, in order to provide maximum

impact,  as  well  as send a strong message  to  private  sector

landlords,  can  the proposed reduction in rentals  be  extended

beyond  the JTC and HDB to all statutory boards and wholly-owned

Government-linked companies?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, various statistics have pointed to much lower

commercial  property  values.  For property  tax  purposes,  can

these benefits be felt in a more timely fashion by reducing  the

lag in pegging valuation levels?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, although various assistance schemes such as LEFS

have   been  widened  to  benefit  more  companies,  many   non-manufacturing concerns, such as trading companies, still do  not

qualify.  They seek the availability of some form of Government-assisted  trade  financing scheme to help offset reduced  credit

lines by banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, whilst many applaud the emphasis on training and

upgrading,  companies would like existing  schemes  to  be  more

generously   applied  to  executive,  managerial   and   general

training.   This  will  allow  for  smoother  progression   into

managerial roles within the same organisation or industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, most companies realise the importance of

technology  and  are  willing to invest in  spite  of  the  high

capital costs.  However, they usually find maintenance to  be  a

very  heavy  burden to bear, especially during  this  period  of

slowing,  if  not contracting, revenues.  Can the  Minister  for

Finance consider allowing deductions for maintenance costs,  for

tax purposes?



<br><br><i>Mitigate against dampening effect on consumption</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of my colleagues have commented on the dampening

effect on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1428</b></font><br><br>



consumption of wage reduction.  There is

recognition by retailers that consumption is closely linked to

disposable income, confidence and consumer psychology.  As much

as we can wish that the media would not be overly negative or

pessimistic, I would like to suggest the following as well:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, can some temporary relief be provided for

individuals, for example, as has been raised by several Members,

by  reducing the foreign maid levy by, say, $100 per  month,  in

response  to  the impending reduction in household  income,  but

with   the  Ministry  of  Manpower  still  maintaining   control

administratively?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, can the Minister for Finance consider granting a

bigger personal tax rebate?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, can Electronic Road Pricing, especially into the

Central Business District, be temporarily suspended on Saturdays

to give the retail sector a boost?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been a lot of debate over how much

Government should bear, whether it should be an equal burden  or

in  equitable proportions.  Unlike other countries, we at  least

have  the luxury of such a debate.  It is a luxury that did  not

happen  by  accident,  but  one that has  resulted  from  strong

fundamentals  and good Government.  Although both arguments  are

equally  compelling, I think we should refrain  from  distorting

the  cost  structure  too  much in  order  to  gain  more  moral

authority.  We all understand that wage and CPF cuts are hard to

stomach, but we all recognise that unless companies can survive,

jobs cannot be preserved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I would like to urge the Government to

consider  the additional recommendations outlined above  and  to

implement the CSC proposals as soon as possible.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Report  of  the  Committee  on  Singapore's  Competitiveness  is

comprehensive.  If only we had the benefit of the  findings  and

recommendations  two years ago.  For a long  time  now  we  have

heard grumbling about the high cost of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>



operating in Singapore.  I have often heard

disbelief expressed over the BERI's Report.  For a long time now

employers have grumbled about rapidly rising labour costs

unmatched by an increase in productivity, disloyalty of labour,

poor attitudes of new entries to the labour market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this current economic downturn, some employers have expressed

their  hope  that people's expectations will be moderated,  more

realistic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has done an excellent job of identifying the issue

and  I  am generally in agreement with its recommendations.   My

concern  is  with  the  details,  the  implementation   of   the

recommendations that, if mishandled, can cause much pain without

providing  the  cure.  I share many of the areas brought  up  by

earlier speakers and I shall not repeat them.  I shall focus  on

a couple of areas that I feel have not been raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must realign our wage structure to be competitive. The

question has been raised as to whether the targeted 15%  cut  in

wage  cost is enough.  Concern has been raised on the impact  of

such  a cut on the lower paid wage earners and there has been  a

call  to  make a bigger cut for higher wages to help  the  lower

paid  workers.  I would like to caution that higher paid workers

may  not necessarily have such a large advantage over the  lower

paid  workers.  Many do not benefit from large housing subsidies

or  other subsidies.  Many are heavily mortgaged on their  home.

These  people  will  not  have a benevolent  Town  Council  with

patience  over  late payments of conservancy  charges.   I  fear

that,  without care, suspicion may arise that one party  or  the

other  is  not bearing a fair share of the pain, and  this  will

have an impact on social cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our enterprises will have to carry on the best they can. There

will  always be a need to supplement our workforce with  skilled

foreign workers.  There is an urgent need to reduce the levy for

skilled foreign workers substantially.   I do, however, question

the  appropriateness of reducing the levy on  unskilled  foreign

workers.  We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1430</b></font><br><br>



should not encourage the import of unskilled

foreign workers.  Jobs, usually filled by such workers, should

be kept for Singaporean workers who, due to the lack of

appropriate skills, have to be retrained and are temporarily

requiring a job, any job, to survive. As for the foreign

workers, we should require employers to hire from among the pool

of retrenched foreign workers, instead of forcing them to be

repatriated.  Many of these foreign workers cannot and do not

want to return home because of the heavy debt that they incur in

getting to Singapore.  It would be a humanitarian policy which

will also help see the continuing need for foreign workers

without resulting in an increase in their numbers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help our enterprises seek new markets and establish offices

overseas, we should set up Singapore Trade Centres in the cities

where  business opportunities exist.  These centres should offer

a  one-stop business support service where Singapore businessmen

can rent temporary office facilities at low cost and obtain help

to transcend language and cultural barriers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I support the recommendations made by the

Committee  on Singapore's Competitiveness.  It is now  essential

to  ensure proper implementation of the recommendations  and  to

continue monitoring our competitiveness and fine-tune the system

as  Singapore  regains its footing and get  back  on  track  for

continuing economic growth.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I applaud the

Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness (CSC) for its calls  to

cut  wages,  electricity  and  telecommunication  charges,  port

service  charges,  extend property tax and income  tax  rebates,

reduce income and road taxes, offer infrastructural support  for

working   mothers   who  need  child  care  facilities,   adjust

industrial  land prices to international benchmarks, and  adjust

downwards  the cost of owning cars through reducing customs  and

petrol duties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many "goodies" in the package for businesses, but

I want to highlight the plight of the consumer and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1431</b></font><br><br>



the help that we too sorely need.  I ask the

Government, in accepting the CSC's Report, to spare a thought

for the consumers, please.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, I have a few proposals, but I would not repeat the

proposals  like  the maid levy and GST cut which  my  colleagues

have raised in this House and which I fully support.

First,  I  want  to  speak against the CSC's  recommendation  to

reduce  the $200 GST exemption for day trippers who have shopped

overseas.   Much  as I wish Singaporeans would  have  a  greater

sense  of  dignity  and solidarity in the face  of  abusive  and

hostile  treatment from those they buy from, I realise that  the

savings  are significant and there are some who need the savings

badly  enough to face shoddy treatment.  If Singapore  retailers

want  to increase their customer base, they must really work  to

bring  back  the  customers  and not  take  the  path  of  least

resistance  by  preventing Singaporeans from shopping  overseas.

They must take heart from the experiences of good retailers like

Borders, Robinsons and NTUC Fairprice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned too that once the call to reduce or remove GST

exemption is heeded, we would open the floodgates for more calls

to  prevent "GST leakage".  Such a call will have an  impact  on

the  numerous small transactions that will be made by  consumers

on  the  Internet.  Are we going to say that GST is being leaked

there  too  and  so  retailers should be protected  through  the

diligent collection of GST from such individuals?  If so, I fear

efforts  in  promoting e-commerce will be greatly hampered.   If

retailers  are  hurting from competition,  whether  from  Johor,

Batam or cyberspace - surely the answer is in themselves.

I  urge Government to further consider easing the burden of  the

average  consumer  by, for example, making sure  that  not  only

those  who  earn below $1,200 be spared the wage  cut,  but,  in

addition, Government should continue to give rebates for service

and conservancy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1432</b></font><br><br>



charges in respect of 1- to 3-room flat dwellers

and town councils.  As my colleague, Mr Gerard Ee, has

mentioned, we should have the compassion to allow for those who

have financial difficulties to pay their charges in instalments

in easy payment schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB also provides a benchmark for property prices, in that

the  price  ceiling  of the HDB market is a convenient  base  on

which to prop up the floor of the private property market.  With

the distance between top end HDB flats and low end private flats

as  little  as  they  are  at present (and  almost  non-existent

between  the  Executive  Condominiums and  entry  level  private

condominiums)  - surely the HDB could lower their  sale  prices.

If  this means a larger subsidy from the Government, is this not

the right time to do it?  Similarly, HDB mortgage rates could be

lowered to provide flat owners some relief.  If necessary,  such

a  measure  could just be limited to the owners of 1- to  4-room

flats, so as to free the disposable income currently frozen into

the property market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to businesses. Landlords, especially the GLCs, HDB

and JTC, must reduce their rental; retailers must cut the prices

of  at  least the basic necessities, as NTUC Fairprice has done;

insurance companies must ease up on their collection of premiums

or  provide easy payment schemes, as NTUC Income has  done;  and

professionals such as doctors and pharmacists must charge  lower

fees  so healthcare becomes more affordable.  Restaurant  owners

must take their heads out of the sand and work at charging less,

and  accept  that  they must not insist on a  flat  10%  service

charge in all circumstances.  If they could reduce their service

charge  to  only 5%, I suspect the rise in clientele would  more

than make up for the loss!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I call on the Government to be easy on the SMEs

who  scramble  to  pay the Government charges,  levies  and  CPF

contributions  on time - but fail.  A little more  understanding

on  the  part  of  civil servants could go a  long  way  towards

putting  a  human face on the efficient bureaucratic machine  we

have.  Otherwise,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>



the added burden of heavy penalties will drive the

SMEs under and more people will lose their jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spirit of tripartism, cost cutting is not just for

workers  and Government.  The employers who are business  owners

must  also  contribute their share.  In all this, the Consumers'

Association of Singapore (CASE) too has a part.  CASE's  mission

is  to  inform, educate and protect consumers.  We have embarked

on  a campaign to identify cheap places and inform consumers  on

businesses  which will give them value for money - whether  they

be  hawker centres, shops, supermarkets, restaurants,  or  other

businesses.   We  will  be  conducting  seminars  and   printing

booklets  to educate and help consumers to stretch their  dollar

and  to  understand their rights when, for example,  their  hire

purchase  companies  foreclose in  on  them.   We  will  protect

consumers and campaign to expose profiteers, opportunists, those

identified  with  the  help  of our "eyes  and  ears"  all  over

Singapore  - our 600,000 members, union members and  members  of

the  public.   We  also call on consumers not to patronise  food

establishments  which  impose  a mandatory  10%  service  charge

(especially if this is on top of a compulsory pickle  or  peanut

charge)  without giving real service in return.  We will publish

the  names of these institutions that do not charge the way that

we  advocate and we will channel more customers to those who are

easy on the customers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope, of course, that the Government will show its concern

for consumers and give us a grant to work on this project.  CASE

calls on all consumers to work with us to make our dollars go  a

long way through this dark storm ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Bukit Timah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness has recently

made  two  sets of recommendations.  One is on how to deal  with

the  current  economic crisis, while the  other  is  on  how  to

prepare our economy to face the future challenges.

In  the  short-term, our workers and the trade  unions  have  to

accept pay cuts to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>



help the companies regain competitiveness and, in

the process, to save our jobs.  In the long term, we have to

equip ourselves with new skills to operate in a knowledge-based

economic environment. We, in the labour movement, support both

sets of recommendations because we are convinced that they are

in the best interests of our workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During our debate in Parliament yesterday, I was surprised to

hear  one  MP  saying that the 15% wage cut is not  enough.   He

suggested  a  30%  cut.  The question is: during  the  last  few

months  when  we  were  debating on these issues,  why  did  the

employers and companies not put forward the reasons for the  30%

wage  cut?   They  should  list out the cost  structure  in  the

various sectors in the business community to present their case.

In  fact,  over the last few months, they have remained  silent.

So,  after we have explained to our workers why we should  agree

to  take a 15% wage cut,  they accepted it.   Now, the employers

are saying that it is not enough.  Furthermore, the said MP is a

member of the National Wages Council (NWC) which recommended the

15%  wage cut.   Why is he now questioning the 15% cut?    Since

he sat in the NWC, he should be in the best position to know why

the reduction should be 15%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From yesterday's debate, we can sense how difficult it is for

us   in  the  trade  unions  to  explain  to  our  workers  such

complicated economic matters.  Here, I would like to  thank  our

workers  for  being  so understanding and  for  supporting  this

recommendation to reduce 15% of their employers' wage cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, with the economic downturn, grassroots leaders and

unionists have asked whether we have the means to help those  in

financial hardship as a result of wage cuts and job losses.   Do

we  have  a social security net to meet their needs?   When  our

workers are retrenched or have suffered a wage cut, do we have a

social security net to help them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some developed countries, the jobless can look to

unemployment benefits.  So some people are questioning why we do

not have social security in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>



Singapore.  Does it mean that because we do not

have unemployment benefits, we do not really have social

security?  Are they correct in their accusation?  I do not think

so.  I do not think we should look at the issue so narrowly - that just because we do not provide unemployment benefits, there

is no social security in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, what are the basic needs of the people? First, jobs;

second,  housing;  third, medical care; fourth,  education.   In

fact,  all of these have been provided for in our social  system

but very often we take them for granted, and we forget that they

are part of our social security system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take jobs, for example. We have made job creation our top

priority.   Over  the  years, we have brought  in  many  foreign

investments  to  Singapore.  Many jobs have been  created.   Our

preference is on quality investments because they are  the  ones

that  can  afford to pay higher wages.  Over the past 10  years,

our  real wages have gone up by an average of 5% per year.  This

is  better  than  what has been secured even in  many  developed

industrialised countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our philosophy is to train people for life-long employability.

This  is like teaching people to fish rather than merely  giving

them fish to eat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in this economic downturn, our top priority must be to find

new jobs for the retrenched workers.  A job with a steady income

is  anytime  better than any form of unemployment benefit.   The

NTUC has joined hands with the Ministry of Manpower and the SNEF

to  develop  a  job  bank to match those who are  retrenched  or

unemployed  with the vacancies available.   At the moment,  when

we  accept  this 15% reduction in our total wage  cost,  we  are

appealing to the companies to retain the workers in this  period

of crisis, and retrench only as a last resort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, housing is not a problem. We must thank HDB and

its "Home Ownership" scheme.  Since as many as 90% of our people

own their own homes,  even in this time of economic crisis,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>



they do not have to worry that they may be thrown

out of their homes by unscrupulous landlords when they default

in paying their rents.  But in many other countries, like Korea,

for example, the workers live in quarters provided by their

employers.  The moment they lose their jobs, they lose their

shelters over their heads too.  In fact, in most developed

countries, home ownership is about 60% (40% of them are living

in rented properties).  Once they lose their jobs, they will be

thrown out of their house.  So to them, unemployment benefit is

of paramount importance.  Despite that, in many of these so-called  welfare states, many people are sleeping in the streets.

In Singapore, our situation is different.  We have different

schemes to help our people.  Therefore, I feel that our model is

a better one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another social security is medical benefits. We all know that

our  workers  in Singapore are adequately provided with  medical

benefits.   They  have  the  Medisave  accounts  and  they  have

MediShield.  For those who genuinely cannot afford to pay  their

medical  fees,  there  is  Medifund to  stake  them  out.  Prime

Minister Goh Chok Tong has stated on more than one occasion that

no  one  in Singapore will be deprived of medical benefits  just

because he has no money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another social security is education. In Singapore, there are

places  for  all  school-going children.   The  quality  of  our

education  is  good.  Government has set up an Edusave  Fund  to

help  meet  the educational needs of every child aged between  6

and  16.   Workers can use their CPF to pay for  their  own  and

their  children's tertiary education.  For university  students,

if  they are in difficulty, they can apply for loans.  About 25%

of our students receive some form of bursary or scholarship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other countries, if workers lose their jobs, their children

have  to  stop  going to school because they cannot  afford  the

fees.   There  is a report in the newspapers that  half  of  the

Indonesian children have stopped going to school.  Such a report

may  be  exaggerated  but it is true that many  parents  can  no

longer  afford  to  send their children to  school.   This  will

result in a loss in one generation, with very serious



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>



consequences.  In Singapore, every effort is made

to help children from families in financial hardship to remain

in school and to receive education, and bursaries are offered by

NTUC,  the grassroots organisations and various organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a comprehensive system of in-employment training. The

Skills Development Fund subsidises the training cost.  The NTUC-initiated  Skills Redevelopment Programme is aimed at  upgrading

the  skills  of  workers, especially the older and less-educated

ones.  In  the SRP and CREST alone, the Government has committed

$240 million.  This is the best welfare because it helps workers

to acquire the necessary skills to stay employed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the training programme for workers, we would like to

request the Government to set up a task force to study the needs

of  older and the less educated workers.  This task force should

provide  the workers with information on vacancies and types  of

skills  required in the market and educate them to change  their

attitudes  so  that they will be prepared to accept  jobs  which

they  were  previously rejecting.  At the same  time,  the  task

force   can  educate  the  employers  so  that  they  will   not

discriminate against the employment of older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people may ask: "Since Singapore is not a welfare state,

where   can   the   retrenched  workers  turn  to?"    Although,

Singapore  is not a welfare state, we have all sorts of  schemes

which  are  even better than the welfare state system   to  help

those who really need help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are in difficulties, they often seek help from

their  MPs.   Some  of  them  say that  they  cannot  pay  their

utilities  bills, S&C charges, rentals, etc.  As  MPs,  we  know

where  to  turn  to  for  assistance  to  these  people.    Many

grassroots organisations like the CDCs and self-help groups  are

ready  to extend a helping hand.  In extreme cases, there is  of

course  the public assistance scheme, the bridging loan  scheme,

Small   Families  Improvement  Scheme,  Rental   and   Utilities

Assistance   Scheme,   Edufund  and   the   assistance   schemes

established by the various community self-help groups.  So



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>



long as they accept our recommendations, they will

be looked after under any of  these schemes that are relevant to

their needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those workers who were retrenched, and are unionized, the

unions  will  negotiate with the employers.  Many  are  paid  an

average  of two weeks' wages for every year of service rendered,

and some get as much as 12 to 24 months of salaries in terms  of

retrenchment benefits.  Not too long ago, I had the  opportunity

to  find out from an officer from a developed country that there

is  a  cap of 12 months' salaries as unemployment benefits.   So

actually  our retrenchment benefits compare favourably with  the

welfare states.  As for those who are not unionized and are  not

in  a position to negotiate with their employers, I urge them to

quickly organise themselves and register as  members of the NTUC

so that we can help them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our social security network is good, there is

still room for improvement.  For example, we need to look at how

we  can  simply  find  procedures for applications  for  various

schemes  to help workers in distress.  Perhaps, we can also  see

how we can improve on the level of support, especially for those

who remain unemployed for a long time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also urge the Government to set up a one-stop agency

which  could coordinate the various financial schemes.  In fact,

the  CDC  is well placed to be the focal point of all assistance

schemes.   In other words, if an unemployed person goes  to  the

CDC, he can seek not only financial assistance but also help  in

finding  an  alternative job through the  Internet  network   or

through  other means which can be  coordinated by the  CDC.   In

this  way,  the CDC will be able to help the unemployed  persons

get  all  the  relevant  assistance under  one  roof,  including

matching  up  of  training courses and job vacancies  available.

In  addition,  counselling can also  be  provided  to  help  the

worried  unemployed persons cope with stress and  learn  how  to

manage family expenses and job expectations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1439</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a necessity for us to

enlighten the people in Singapore on  our social network and to

let them know how to seek assistance from these schemes, if

necessary.  We, in the NTUC, firmly believe that if we go along

with the recommendations of the CSC, and  if we are in one heart

and one mind as a nation, we will get out of this crisis,

emerging stronger.  So long as we stay united, we are confident

that we can have the power to face and conquer whatever

challenges that we may encounter in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  Singapore is facing its gravest challenge  since

independence. As the regional crisis has deepened and spread, we

have  been drawn in.  Our economy does not have the problems  of

the other countries in difficulty.  Our banking system is sound.

Our  companies  have not borrowed excessively,  especially  from

abroad.  Neither  has  the Government. Government  finances  are

strong, with adequate reserves built up over many years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the collapse of regional demand, and the change in

the  business  climate has caused our economy to  slow  sharply,

from  6.2%  in the 1st Quarter 1998 to -0.7% in the 3rd  Quarter

1998.  We  have  now  had two quarters of  negative  quarter-on-quarter growth, and are technically in recession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government implemented a $2 billion package of cost

reduction  measures  in June.  These were not  intended  as  the

final  package.  We could not take drastic measures, such  as  a

CPF  cut,  lightly.  We needed time to assess how  events  would

develop  and we used the time to develop the consensus necessary

for stronger measures.



<br><br><i>Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness (CSC), the

Government  has over the last 18 months tapped a wide  range  of

private sector views on ways to strengthen the economy.  The CSC

has  recommended  both  long-term  and  short-term  measures  to

improve Singapore's competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long term measures are a comprehensive strategy for

Singapore to invest in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>



its human resources and infrastructure, to build up

manufacturing and services, and to continue to grow and develop.

The emphasis is on building new capabilities and new areas of

business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short term measures focus on reducing business costs, to

help companies to survive the crisis, and to preserve jobs.  The

proposal is to reduce wage costs significantly, through a cut in

the  employer's  CPF contribution rate and in  flexi-wages,  and

also to reduce non-wage costs to make an overall package of  $10

billion, or 7% of GDP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepts the CSC Report and the thrust of the CSC

recommendations.  They will not only help Singapore to  overcome

the present problems, but also lay the foundations for sustained

growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC has made some 300 specific proposals. We will study

them  individually to decide how to implement each one.  In some

cases   we   have   already  acted,  for   example,   with   the

recommendations  to  further  develop  the  financial   services

sector, and the June package of off-budget measures.

We   will   implement  the  long  term  measures  progressively.

However,  the  short term recommendations call for an  immediate

response.   The  Government has worked out  a  substantial  cost

reduction  package covering the key elements of business  costs,

as proposed by the CSC.



<br><br><i>Wage Costs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin with wages. Labour cost is a key component of

business  costs.   The  CSC has proposed that  Singapore  reduce

overall wage costs by 15% from the 1997 level.  This will  bring

our  relative unit labour cost back to the position in 1994, and

will  substantially  improve our international  competitiveness.

The CSC has recommended that part of this 15% should be achieved

through  a  10%  point reduction in employer's CPF  contribution

rate,  from  20% to 10%.  This represents some 8%  reduction  in

overall wage costs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1442</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Wages Council (NWC) has endorsed the CSC proposal,

and recommended that wages be reduced by 5% to 8% from 1997

levels.  Together with the 10% point CPF cut, this will be

sufficient to achieve the target of 15% reduction in overall

wage costs.  The wage reduction should be implemented through

the flexible wage system, ie, by cutting variable components of

wages such as bonuses. The NWC urged employers to moderate the

wage cut for lower income employees by implementing a

proportionately deeper cut for the higher income executives.



<br><br><i>CPF Reduction</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepts the CSC's recommendation to reduce the

employer's CPF contributions by 10% points.  Of this, 6%  points

will  come  from the Ordinary Account, and 4% points  will  come

from  the  Special  Account.  In effect,  contributions  to  the

Special Account will be suspended for the time being.

For  older  workers whose CPF contribution rates are  less  than

40%,  and for pensionable civil servants receiving partial  CPF,

the reduction in their employer's CPF contributions will be pro-rated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF cut will take effect from 1st January 1999. It will

remain  in  place for 2 years.  Thereafter, the Government  will

review  the situation.  The Government agrees with the NWC  that

the  rate of employer's contribution should be adjusted  upwards

when the economy recovers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF cut will reduce costs by about $3.9 billion per year.



<br><br><i>Government Accepts NWC Recommendations</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepts all of the NWC's recommendations,

including  the recommendation to reduce wages by 5%  to  8%.  We

urge  companies  to  follow  the NWC guidelines  in  their  wage

negotiations   and  decisions  on  bonuses.    Companies   which

completed their wage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>



negotiations earlier should review their plans if

their previous assumptions about the economic environment are no

longer valid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 5% to 8% reduction in wages is estimated to cut costs by

about $3.6 billion per year.



<br><br><i>NWC Award for Civil Servants</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a major employer, the Government will take the lead in

implementing  the NWC's revised wage recommendations  for  civil

servants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Government will reduce the Annual Variable Component

(AVC)  to  be  paid  in  December.  Last  year,  civil  servants

received two months of AVC: 3/4 month in July and 1 1/4 month  in

December.  This year in July, the Government paid 1/2  month,  a

reduction  of 1/4 month.  In December, the Government  will  pay

1/4  month's AVC, which is one month less than last year.   This

means  a  total reduction of 1 1/4 months in AVC payment for  the

year.   However, the usual Annual Wage Supplement or 13th  month

payment will be paid in full.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For next year, the Government will decide on civil service

annual  variable  payments  after  the  NWC  has  published  its

proposals for 1999, which it usually does in May.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Government will reduce the variable component of

monthly salaries of officers in Division II and above.  The  cut

will  be in the Non-Pensionable Variable Payment (NPVP) that  is

paid  monthly, and will be graduated.  It will be 1% of  monthly

salaries  for Division II officers, 2% for Division I  timescale

officers,  3%  for Superscale officers, and 5% for  Staff  Grade

officers.  There will be no cut for junior staff at the Division

III  and  IV  levels and daily-rated employees.  This  reduction

will take effect from 1st January 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These cuts in NPVP will be for one year, and will be reviewed at

the end of 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Government will suspend the normal annual adjustments

to salaries of Ministers and top civil servants for a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>



second year in 1999.  The Government had followed

the private sector down in 1997 when the benchmark of private

sector salaries had declined by 8%, but it did not follow back

up this year when the benchmark rose by 13%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For next year, the benchmark for Staff Grade I has increased by

19%,  and  that for Superscale G by 12%. I do not believe  these

large  increases  reflect  current  conditions  in  the  private

sector.  The mismatch arises because of the long time  lag:  the

1999  benchmark  is  based on private sector earnings  in  1997,

before  Singapore felt the impact of the regional  crisis.   The

Government will study ways to reduce this time lag, in order  to

make public sector salaries reflect private sector conditions in

a more timely and responsive manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these measures will apply to both civil servants and

political appointment holders.  They will reduce the total civil

service wage bill by $176 million, or 6.2%. The combined  effect

of  reductions in monthly and annual variable salary  components

will result in higher level officers accepting steeper wage cuts

than   more   junior   officers,  in   line   with   the   NWC's

recommendation.  In terms of annual pay, the cuts range from  5%

for  Division  III  and  IV officers, to  10%  for  Staff  Grade

officers, including Ministers and this is separate from the  CPF

cuts, which naturally also apply to civil servants.



<br><br><i>Assistance Schemes For Mortgages</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wage and CPF reductions will affect many Singaporeans who

have  committed  to mortgages, especially those who  planned  to

repay  their  mortgages  out of their  CPF  contributions.   The

Ministry of Manpower and the Housing and Development Board  have

studied the problem.  After the CPF cut, 18% of CPF members will

have  insufficient monthly CPF contributions to  their  Ordinary

Account to pay for their housing instalments.  But despite this,

HDB  has  found that most HDB borrowers have been  prudent,  and

have  not  over-extended themselves.  They  should  have  little

problem continuing to service their loans as long as they remain

employed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent falls in interest rates will help to cushion the

impact of the CPF cut on borrowers.  Singapore banks have also

stated their willingness to help customers who face problems

repaying their mortgage loans, for example, by rescheduling

their loan repayments.  Nevertheless, the Government will

implement supporting measures to help Singaporeans cope with

these difficulties, as we did in 1986.



<br><br><i>Use of CPF Special Account</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For CPF members whose reduced Ordinary Account contributions

will  now be insufficient to pay their mortgages, the Government

will allow them to use the balances in their Special Accounts to

meet the shortfall in repayment caused by the CPF cut.



<br><br><i>Bridging Loan Scheme</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will also introduce a Bridging Loan Scheme for

members who have depleted the savings in both their Ordinary and

Special Accounts for their monthly repayments.  The loan will be

at a concessionary rate of the CPF interest rate plus 0.1%.  The

scheme will apply to private property mortgages, as well as  HDB

flat  owners  paying HDB market interest rates, ie, Credit  POSB

housing loan interest rates, for their mortgages.



<br><br><i>HDB Schemes</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most HDB lessees are already paying the concessionary interest

rate  of  the CPF rate plus 0.1% for their mortgages.   The  HDB

will take several measures to help them.  For example, they  may

include more working family members as joint owners, in order to

draw  upon  their  CPF  monies.  They can reduce  their  monthly

instalments, lengthen the term of their mortgage loan, or  defer

mortgage payments. Those in arrears may pay the outstanding  sum

by   instalments.   HDB  will  also  assist  applicants   taking

possession of new flats who are affected.



<br><br><i>Taxes</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will give substantial tax rebates as part of this

package. Unlike in the previous recession in 1985, we are giving

rebates rather than reducing the tax



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>



rates.  This is because we have progressively and

significantly reduced our major tax rates since 1985.  For

example, the corporate tax rate was 40% in 1985, but is now only

26%, close to our long-term target of 25%.  The property tax

rate was 23%, but is now only 12%.  Our tax rates are now

generally competitive internationally. No major changes are

immediately necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will go as far as possible to help businesses

during  this difficult period.  However, any tax concessions  to

meet  the present problem should be broadly consistent with  our

long   term   taxation  policies,  and  should  not  erode   the

Government's tax base after the crisis has passed.



<br><br><i>Rebate on Corporate Tax</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To signal our commitment to help businesses, a corporate tax

rebate  of  10%  will  apply to corporate  income  for  Year  of

Assessment 1999, excluding Singapore dividends.  This will  cost

$450 million.



<br><br><i>Extension of Property Tax Rebate and Stamp Duty Exemption</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The June off-Budget measures included a 55% property tax rebate

on  commercial and industrial properties for the year commencing

1st July 1998.  This 55% rebate will be extended by another year

to  30th  June  2000.  HDB and JTC will pass the rebates  on  to

their tenants and lessees.  Landlords in the private sector  are

also urged to pass on the rebates. The exemption of property tax

for  land  under development, which was announced  in  the  FY98

Budget Statement, will also continue.  These measures will  cost

the Government $680 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suspension of stamp duty on contract notes for share

transactions, which started on 30th June 1998, will be  extended

for another year.  This will cost the Government $70 million.



<br><br><i>GST</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs have asked for the GST rate to be reduced from 3%.

However, this would be the wrong approach.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1447</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, a reduction of the GST rate to 2% or 1% would cost the

Government a large amount of revenue.  The GST was introduced in

order to achieve a better balance between direct taxes like the

corporate tax, and indirect taxes like GST.  When GST was

introduced, both corporate and personal income taxes were cut

substantially.  The overall package was revenue neutral; in

fact, in the short term, revenue negative.  The GST is therefore

an integral part of our revenue structure, and not something

optional which we can lightly give up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, from the economic point of view, the GST is a "good"

tax.  I know from the taxpayers' point of view, there is no such

thing,  but, economically, this is a good tax.  It is a  tax  on

consumption,  not  income.  Its incidence is widely  and  evenly

distributed across all types of economic activity.  So  for  the

same  amount of revenue collected, the burden of the GST is felt

less heavily than other taxes.  It is better to give rebates  on

other taxes, such as property tax, which levy a higher rate on a

narrower range of activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there is a comprehensive package of rebates for lower

income  households to offset the impact of the  GST,  which  are

still in effect.  If our concern is the impact of the crisis  on

lower  income  households,  then it  is  far  more  precise  and

effective to extend the GST offsets package, than to change  the

GST rate itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSC did not recommend changing the GST rate. However, it

did propose one minor refinement to our GST scheme.  It observed

that the current exemption limits on Goods and Services tax  for

Singaporeans  returning from abroad are  rather  generous.   For

travellers  who are out of the country for more than  48  hours,

the  exemption  limit is $400 for adults and $200  for  children

below 18 years old.  For travel less than 48 hours, the limit is

$200  for adults and $100 for children.  This has resulted in  a

significant   leakage   of  retail  business   to   neighbouring

countries,  as  Singaporean day-trippers shop abroad.   The  CSC

recommended tightening the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1448</b></font><br><br>



exemption limits in order to help the domestic

retail trade, which is facing a protracted downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government accepts this recommendation. The new limits will

be as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For travellers away for more than 48 hours, $300 for adults and

$100 for children;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For travellers away between 24 and 48 hours, $150 for adults and

$50 for children;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For travellers away for less than 24 hours, $50 for adults with

no exemption for children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These will take effect tomorrow, 25th November 1998. You can

have a final fling tonight.



<br><br><i>Foreign Worker Levy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many companies depend heavily on foreign workers, especially

manufacturing companies.  While the Government uses the  Foreign

Worker Levy (FWL) to regulate demand for foreign workers, to the

companies the FWL is a significant cost burden.

The  reduction in CPF contributions for citizens  allows  us  to

reduce  the  foreign worker levy while maintaining the  relative

wage   costs  between  Singaporean  and  foreign  workers,   and

therefore without creating an incentive for companies to  employ

foreign workers and displace Singaporean workers.

The  Government  will reduce the foreign worker  levy  for  both

skilled and unskilled foreign workers.

a.  The levy for skilled workers in all sectors will be reduced

from $100 to $30 across the board.  This is the second round  of

reductions  this  year, as we had reduced the levy  for  skilled

workers in April from $200 to $100.

b.  The levy for unskilled foreign workers will be reduced  by

$90  for  companies  in the manufacturing, marine  and  services

sectors.    These   sectors  are  more  prone  to   competition,

regionally and internationally.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1449</b></font><br><br>



c.  The levy for unskilled construction workers

will remain unchanged, as we need to continue to upgrade the

construction industry to use more skilled labour and improve

productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The levy for domestic maids will also remain unchanged, as it is

not a cost burden on businesses, and working mothers are already

allowed  to claim double tax deduction on the cost of  the  maid

levy from their income tax assessments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know this will disappoint many MPs including Mr Chiam who

asked for it, but then he asked for everything.  So I have asked

my  colleague,  Dr Lee Boon Yang, to give him a  fuller  and,  I

hope, a more satisfying explanation tomorrow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reductions will take effect from 1st January 1999. They

will yield cost savings of about $204 million per year.



<br><br><i>Foreign Talent</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand that at such difficult times, some Singaporeans

feel  that  we  should do the opposite, ie.  raise  the  foreign

worker  levy  and  exclude foreign workers,  in  an  attempt  to

preserve  jobs  for  Singaporeans.  But this would  be  counter-productive.   Compelling  companies to recruit  Singaporeans  at

higher cost than foreign workers or professionals can only  work

in  the  short  term.  But in the longer-term the companies  may

relocate elsewhere, or simply close down if this makes them  not

viable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to preserve jobs for Singaporeans is to allow firms

the  flexibility to employ some foreign workers, and at the same

time  to  upgrade and retrain Singaporean workers to  make  them

productive and employable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the longer term, it is vital for us to continue attracting

talent, because international competition will be based  on  the

knowledge,  expertise,  creativity and entrepreneurship  of  our

people.   The Government has formed a multi-Ministry  committee,

called  the  Singapore Talent and Recruitment (STAR)  Committee,

with  BG  George Yeo as Chairman and Dr Lee Boon Yang as  Deputy

Chairman, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>



oversee this strategic effort.  Its mandate covers

all aspects of international talent attraction and retention, in

order to make Singapore a hub for international talent, while

retaining our social cohesiveness and national resilience.



<br><br><i>Industrial Land</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our high land cost is conspicuous to investors and is a major

handicap  in  investment  promotion.   The  industrial  property

market  has softened considerably.  It has fallen by  about  30%

since last year.  And recent URA tenders of industrial land have

confirmed this.



<br><br><i>JTC</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) will reduce its posted

land  rentals  to  reflect  current market  conditions.   Posted

rentals for industrial land will come down by an average of  24%

for  outlying  areas  and  40% for  urban  and  suburban  areas,

depending  on  locations.   Rentals  for  flatted  and  standard

factories will come down by 20 - 30%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower rates will take effect on 1st January 1999. These

will  be  permanent reductions, and not temporary rebates.   The

revised  posted  rents  will form a lower  base  for  subsequent

rental adjustments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, for lessees paying rentals at posted rates, there

will  be  no rental escalation for two years, in 1999 and  2000.

Thereafter,  their rentals will be subject to a  maximum  annual

increase  of  5.5%, reduced from the present cap of  7.6%.  This

does  not mean that JTC will automatically raise rents  by  5.5%

every  year. The actual adjustment will vary from year to  year,

depending on business conditions.  Nevertheless, for lessees who

prefer certainty, JTC will offer the alternative of a fixed rate

of  increase  of  4%  per annum throughout the  lease  duration,

regardless of market conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing JTC lessees and tenants who are paying rentals above

the revised rate will have their contractual rent reduced to the

revised rates.  Those paying below the revised posted rates will

continue to enjoy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1451</b></font><br><br>



their current rebates up to end-1999.  JTC's rental

reductions are estimated to yield savings in business costs of

$230 million.



<br><br><i>HDB</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will make similar adjustments. HDB will reduce rentals for

industrial  land lessees, and rents of commercial and industrial

tenancies which exceed the new posted rates, through contractual

rent  revision  or rent rebates.  For commercial and  industrial

tenants  paying above posted rates, the rebates will be  subject

to  an  overall rebate cap of 20%.  For land lessees and tenants

of industrial factories, workshops and commercial properties who

are  paying below the new posted rates, HDB will continue  their

existing rebates until December 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB's reductions will contribute savings of $76 million.



<br><br><i>Transport and Communications</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport and communications are a vital sector of our economy,

and  form  an  important component of business costs.   We  will

reduce a broad range of costs in this sector, spanning air, land

and  sea transport as well as telecommunications, in support  of

the   efforts  to  bring  down  overall  business  costs.    The

reductions will amount to $790 million.



<br><br><i>Land Transport</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's measures to restrain ownership of vehicles have

been   effective  in  controlling  congestion.   But   ownership

measures  have been a blunt instrument, which cannot distinguish

between those who add to congestion and those that do not.   The

high ownership charges that are necessary have added to business

costs.  With Electronic Road Pricing (ERP), we are able to shift

emphasis  from ownership to usage management measures. And  this

should  enable  us  to  achieve the  same  effect  in  terms  of

controlling congestion, but using lower taxes and charges.

Therefore   the  Government  will  not  be  slowing   down   the

implementation of the ERP system, or giving any rebates on ERP



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1452</b></font><br><br>



charges.  It will press on to expand the ERP system

to better manage traffic flow.  This will allow us to reduce

ownership charges and thus the overall cost of operating

vehicles.  However, reduction of ownership charges, especially

upfront costs such as the customs duty and ARF, cannot be done

too suddenly, as this would affect the asset value of existing

vehicles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now, the Government will reduce the customs duty on cars

from  41% of OMV to 31% of OMV.  The customs duty for new  taxis

will  similarly be reduced from 17% to 7% OMV.  This  will  take

effect tomorrow, 25th November 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first phase of ERP, the Government gave a rebate on road

tax  of $200 per PCU.  For the second year, the Government plans

to  grant  a larger road tax rebate of $250 per PCU.  This  will

take  effect  from  1st  September  1999,  in  tandem  with  the

expansion of the Electronic Road Pricing system under Phase 2.

Excise  duties on petrol and diesel are revenue items, but  they

are  also  a traffic management tool, albeit a blunt  one,  that

helps to discourage excessive use of cars and to promote greater

use of public transport. Excise duty on high-speed diesel is 7.4

cents  per  litre. Petrol excise duty is currently 46%  of  pump

price,  subject  to  floor rates which vary  for  the  different

grades of petrol.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the ERP, we will completely remove the excise duty on high-speed diesel. We will also reduce petrol excise duties rate from

46%  to 40%, and cut the floor rates by 7 cents per litre. Since

at  present  petrol prices at the floor rates are effective  for

most  grades  of  petrol, the overall result is to  reduce  pump

prices by at least 7 cents per litre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will take effect from tomorrow, 25th November 1998. The

Government  expects  the oil companies to pass  on  the  savings

arising from the reduction of excise duty fully and promptly  to

motorists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These reductions in land transport costs should yield savings of

$320 million per year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Sea and Air Transport</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maritime and Port Authority will extend a 20% port dues

concession  for  container ships, and give a similar  concession

for  harbour craft, with effect from 1st January 1999.  PSA, now

a  corporatised entity, has also agreed to give a one  time  10%

rebate on lift-on/lift-off charges, local container store rents,

Keppel  Distripark  rents, office properties  rents,  commercial

warehouses  rents, wharf handling and local store rents  at  the

Multi-Purpose  Terminal, all with effect from 1st January  1999.

These are estimated to yield business savings of $32 million per

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will be giving

a  10% rebate on landing fees for airlines with effect from  1st

January 1999.  It will also extend rebates currently enjoyed  by

airport retailers for another 12 months beyond June 1999.  These

are  estimated to yield business savings of some $57 million per

year.



<br><br><i>Telecommunications</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telecommunications form a significant component of business

costs,  especially  for  information-intensive  activities  like

finance and banking. Telecommunication tariffs have been falling

steadily  in Singapore, as in many other countries, as a  result

of  rapid  technological advances, more liberal  regulation  and

greater  competition. However, there is still scope for them  to

decline further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAS will reduce the licence fee for mobile radio-communications

stations  with  effect from 1st January 1999.   This  will  mean

business savings of $2 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Telecom has informed the Government that it will be

implementing  a  tariff  reduction  package  of  $340   million,

starting  1st  January  1999.  This  comprises  two  components:

first, rate reductions amounting to $90 million under the  price

control framework administered by TAS.  Second, additional  rate

reductions,  new  calling  plans,  volume  discounts  and  other

schemes  amounting to $250 million.  These are part of SingTel's

continued



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1454</b></font><br><br>



improvements in its tariff scheme in view of

intensifying competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SingTel is a publicly-listed for-profit entity. It is making

these  changes  in  order  to respond to  the  current  economic

conditions  and  impending competition,  and  to  contribute  to

Singapore's  overall competitiveness which will in turn  benefit

SingTel's business.



<br><br><i>Utilities - Electricity</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional currency realignments have made our electricity

tariffs  less competitive.  The June off-budget package included

a  rebate  of  0.3 cts/kWh or a 2.6% reduction  in  the  average

electricity   tariff.   With  effect  from  1st  January   1999,

Singapore Power will increase the rebate on electricity  tariffs

from  0.3 cts/kWh to an average of 1.3 cts/kWh, for a period  of

two  years.   However,  part of this  rebate  will  be  used  to

compensate the higher fuel costs incurred by Singapore Power, so

the  net  rebate  to consumers will average 0.9  cts/kWh,  or  a

reduction of 7.7% in electricity tariffs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The net rebate will vary somewhat between different consumers,

because PowerGrid will be unbundling the charges for the use  of

the  electricity grid, to reflect actual costs incurred  by  the

different categories - Extra High Tension, High Tension, and Low

Tension.  Singapore Power will announce the details later.

Government  will  also remove the 2% Government  tax  levied  on

household utilities bills with effect from 1st January 1999. The

electricity tariff rebate and the removal of the Government  tax

will yield cost savings of $372 million per year.



<br><br><i>Other rates and fees</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government levies a multitude of rates and fees. We will

not freeze or reduce them across the board. Each of these levies

has  its  own  rationale  and purpose. To  freeze  all  of  them

regardless  of  their  merits will hinder  the  Government  from

making adjustments that become necessary from time to time.   It

will  create  rigidities and distortions which will  impair  the

efficiency of our public services.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1455</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the Government will review critically all its

rates and fees, and lower those where there is justification. It

has identified $8 million of other fees and charges to be

reduced in this package. These include rental concessions by

various ministries to tenants, generally in the form of 10%

rebates for one year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of these is the concession to hawkers paying market rents.

Environment will extend the current one year rental rebate given

to  these  hawkers  in  July 1998 for a further  six  months  to

December  1999.   If  despite  this rebate  their  rental  still

exceeds  the  January 1999 market rates, Environment  will  give

them  an  additional  rebate of up to 10%  for  12  months  from

January 1999.  In effect, many hawkers paying market rents  will

get up to 20% off what they were paying before July 1998.



<br><br><i>Other short-term measures</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as we cut costs, we must also encourage

businesses  to  expand.  The economic agencies  will  work  with

companies to support their promotion and marketing efforts.

To spur more investments in both manufacturing and services, the

Government will reintroduce the Liberalised Investment Allowance

Scheme,  which  it  used  in  the  1985  recession.   Investment

allowance  of  30% will be liberally granted for investments  in

productive  equipment  used  for qualifying  activities.   These

activities  include  manufacturing,  engineering  and   computer

related  services,  as well as a wide range of  other  specified

services.     For   investments  which   meet   more   stringent

requirements  like  contribution  to  value  added,   a   higher

allowance of 50% will be considered.



<br><br><i>Rebates for individuals and households</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reductions in CPF and bonuses will cause a drop in the

standard  of living that Singaporeans have become used to.  This

cannot be avoided, because it is through this sacrifice that  we

will reduce our costs and strengthen our competitiveness.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1456</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be painful to Singaporeans, as we have grown

accustomed to many years of steady growth and wage increases.

But because inflation is zero and even negative, actual

standards of living have fallen by less than earnings.

Retrenchments and unemployment have risen, but jobs are still

available, provided workers are willing to be flexible. Flights

out of Singapore over the Deepavali long weekend and during the

December school holidays were and are fully booked. Many

Singaporeans are still going overseas for holidays, maybe

bringing their maids along, though perhaps to nearer

destinations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, not everybody goes on overseas holidays. MPs have

all  noticed  an  increase  in cases  at  their  meet-the-people

sessions of people asking for help to find a new job, or wanting

to  change  their  HDB  booking to  a  smaller  flat  type.  The

Government  can  and will assist lower income  Singaporeans,  to

help them avoid undue hardship as a result of the package.   For

this purpose, it will take the following measures.



<br><br><i>GST Offsets</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further assist lower income groups, we will extend the

package of rebates for HDB rentals and town council service  and

conservancy charges, introduced in 1994, to offset the impact of

GST.  These rebates were transitional measures meant to help 1-,

2-,  and 3-room HDB households, and were due to expire by  March

1999.   The  Government will now extend them for a  further  two

years. This will cost the Government $22 million per year.



<br><br><i>Utilities</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997 and 1998, the Government gave a set of utilities and

service  and  conservancy rebates to HDB 1-4 room households  to

offset  the  increase in electricity and  water  tariffs.    The

utilities rebates are $100 for 1-, 2-, and 3-room HDB flats  and

$50  for  4-room  HDB flats.  There are also monthly  grants  in

service  and conservancy charges to these 1-, 2-, 3- and  4-room

HDB  flats.  The Government will now extend these rebates for  a

further two years. This will cost $72 million per year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1457</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Public transport</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area of public concern is the cost of basic necessities,

especially   public   transport  fees  and   hospital   charges.

Grassroots and union leaders have fed back to the Government the

hope that transport companies and hospitals will pass on to  the

public their savings from the wage cuts, since wage costs form a

substantial  part  of the business costs for  both.   These  are

reasonable requests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has discussed this with the public transport

companies.  They  have  agreed  to  pass  on  their  savings  to

commuters.   With effect from 1st January 1999, a 50 cents  fare

rebate  will  be  given and added for every $10 topped  up  into

farecards.  Concession card holders will be given a 5%  discount

on the value of their monthly concession stamps.  The concession

will be for 12 months. The total cost to SBS, TIBS and SMRT will

be  $40  million  over a year.  Transitlink  will  announce  the

details in a few days.



<br><br><i>Hospital charges</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government and restructured hospitals will review their charges

to  pass  on  the cost reductions to Singaporeans. However,  the

actual  reduction in hospital charges will depend on  individual

hospitals and the class of ward. Different classes of wards have

different cost recovery targets. Some hospitals have been under-recovering  their  costs,  particularly  for  class  A  and   B1

patients. Our newer hospitals are in deficit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospitals will be working out the impact of the cost

reduction measures on their own business costs.  They will  give

emphasis  to  reducing charges for class B2 and C patients,  who

can  expect  on average reductions in hospital bills  of  5-10%.

The reductions will be implemented in January 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We already have an effective medical safety net in place with

our   system  of  different  ward  classes,  plus  Medisave  and

Medifund.   Patients should choose the class of ward which  they

can   afford.   Those  using  Medisave  should  not   have   any

difficulties, because we have deliberately not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1458</b></font><br><br>



reduced the Medisave component of CPF

contributions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the bill size in class C is already very low. Those

who still cannot afford to pay their Class C bills can apply for

help from Medifund.  The Ministry of Health has advised Hospital

Medifund  Committees to be more sympathetic  towards  those  who

have been adversely affected by the economic downturn.



<br><br><i>General relief measures</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will also implement general relief measures for

Singaporeans, such as personal tax rebates, rebates  on  service

and  conservancy charges and rentals for HDB dwellers.  However,

I shall not announce these today.  These are being worked out as

part  of the Budget proposals for the next Financial Year.  They

will be tabled in the  Budget Speech next February.



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>



<br><br><i>Companies Must Also Cut Non-Wage Costs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, can I ask the Clerk to distribute a table

(Cols.  1479  -  1482) of the total package of the  cost-cutting

measures which summarises the position and shows that the  total

package  adds up to $10.5 billion over one year, more than  what

the  CSC  recommended?   [Copies of table  distributed  to  hon.

Members.]     This    will    substantially    strengthen    our

competitiveness.  It will help workers to keep their  jobs,  and

companies to stay viable.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1998/19981124/19981124-HA-0691479.htm">table (Cols. 1479 - 1482)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, companies must not depend on cuts in wage costs and

Government   charges  alone  to  solve  their  problems.   Their

managements should also take the initiative to look for  savings

from  their  non-wage costs. Most of these are internal  to  the

companies.  For  example, they should study  how  they  can  use

capital  more efficiently, improve sales, streamline  processes,

or  reduce inventories. However efficiently a company may  think

it  is  run, there is always room to do better. Companies  which

succeed  in  trimming  their non-wage  costs  get  to  keep  the

savings. Every dollar saved this way is a dollar added to  their

bottom  line,  just as much as a dollar saved from paying  lower

CPF  or  smaller  bonuses. This will give companies  more  scope

either to increase



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>



their earnings and avoid making a loss, or to

reduce prices and increase sales, especially exports.



<br><br><i>Balance of cost cuts</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three quarters of this cost saving package - $7.5 billion worth

-  comprises wage costs, through the CPF reduction and  the  NWC

recommendations  to reduce wages.  In the public  discussion  of

the  CSC  Report  and  also here over the  last  two  days,  the

question  has  often been asked whether wages  are  bearing  too

large  a share of the burden, and whether the Government can  do

more.   Some have even suggested that the Government  match  the

reduction in wage costs dollar for dollar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not possible. To understand why, we need to examine the

composition of our GDP.  We can think of GDP as the sum  of  all

the  incomes generated for the domestic production of goods  and

services.   You  add  up  all the money earned  from  productive

effort  and  that is our output for the year.  If you  use  this

"income  approach" to GDP, then you can divide  GDP  into  three

components:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Wages (including salaries and CPF) which make up 43% of

GDP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Indirect taxes (e.g. GST, ARF of cars) making up 10%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The remaining 47% of the GDP is gross operating surplus,

ie.  earnings  of  companies  and  statutory  boards,  including

depreciation.

So  wages,  43%;  indirect taxes 10%;  and  the  balance,  gross

operating surplus, 47%.  So any cost reduction package will have

to  come  out  of  either wages, indirect taxes, or  essentially

company   earnings   (companies  meaning,  including   statutory

boards).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic crisis is already squeezing company earnings. Our

aim  is  to help companies improve their bottom lines.   Getting

companies  to  bear a large share of this cost  reduction  would

defeat this objective.  So most of the cost reduction must  come

from the other two components of GDP, ie, wage costs and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1460</b></font><br><br>



Government levies.  Since total wage costs are much

larger than Government charges, wages must inevitably account

for a large part of the total cost reduction package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course companies doing well may pass on their cost savings to

consumers,  or  invest  them  in business  expansion  or  worker

training.   This  includes,  of  course,  statutory  boards  and

Government-linked companies, such as JTC and Singapore  Telecom.

However,  statutory boards and GLCs cannot simply run a  deficit

in  order to give money away.  Santa Claus has not come to town.

They must operate as efficiently as possible so as to keep costs

to  a  minimum.   They  also  have a responsibility  to  operate

commercially, just like any other company.  Even hospitals  must

run  efficiently and break even, given the cost recovery targets

for the different classes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we deviate from this cardinal principle, and our statutory

boards and GLCs ignore their bottom lines to operate contrary to

commercial  and  economic logic, they will lose discipline,  and

become  bloated  and  inefficient.   Service  will  deteriorate.

Eventually they must either go bankrupt and close down, or  else

the  Government must bail them out, and raise taxes to  pay  for

their deficits . This is exactly what has happened in many other

countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $3 billion reduction in Government taxes and charges in this

package  is  substantial, especially coming on  top  of  the  $2

billion  announced in June, which was completely  borne  by  the

Government and which, judging by the debate over these last  two

days,  has been largely forgotten.  We already expect  a  budget

deficit  of 1% of GDP this year.  Ministry of Finance  estimates

the  deficit to grow to 3% to 4% of GDP next year.   This  is  a

sharp contrast from our usual surplus budgets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in a position to run this temporary deficit, only because

we have been prudently maintaining budget surpluses and building

up  our  reserves for many years.  MPs and others have suggested

that  we  should dip more deeply into the reserves, in order  to

minimise the hardship to Singaporeans.  Some have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>



even calculated how just a few percent of our

reserves would mean many billions of dollars to spend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My reservation is not with the arithmetic, but the psychology.

It  is like high-living heirs who cannot wait to divide up their

wealthy  grandfather's estate.  If we did this, we would  change

from being a nation of savers accumulating wealth to a nation of

spenders depleting it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poh Say Teck ( ) wrote a piece in the

Lianhe Zaobao today, and as he said, this would send out all the

wrong  signals.  First, that our situation is so grave  that  we

have no choice but to use the reserves, and second, that we have

a low threshold of pain, and cannot bear austerity and hardship.

It  is  an excellent piece.  It shows he understands, and  there

are  Singaporeans who understand, and I commend it to you.   His

title    is    Zhen   yao   dong   yong   lao    ben    ma?    [

], loosely translated: "Do we really want to eat our seed corn?"

So  I asked Dr Ow Chin Hock, what does lao ben mean?  He says it

is  very difficult to translate.  It really means the money  you

keep  for  your  old age.  Some people call it guan  cai  ben  [

].  It is something you keep for a last resort, not spend at the

first opportunity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This crisis is far from over. We must husband our reserves,

because  we cannot tell what the future may bring.  We must  not

spend  them  at the first sign of trouble, to generate  a  false

sense  of  prosperity and well-being.  If we did,  the  reserves

would  soon  be  gone.   And the next time  we  run  into  rough

weather,  which will happen sooner or later, we  would  have  no

more  safety  net, no more rabbits to pull out of the  hat.   We

must therefore get back to prudent, balanced budgets as soon  as

possible.



<br><br><i>Confidence</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are worried about what is happening. They have

followed  events in the countries around us, and seen how  these

have  affected us.  They know retrenchments are higher,  bonuses

are  smaller, and prospects are highly uncertain.  They want  to

know what we can do to help ourselves.  But to judge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1462</b></font><br><br>



by the recent TCS survey, they also know that we

must cut business costs to stay competitive (83% thought so).

They think that the Government has been effective in responding

to the crisis (82% thought so), and they believe that Singapore

will be the first country in Asia to recover (76% thought so).

These are substantial majorities, almost enough to cause the

Opposition to lose their deposits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have reason for confidence. Since the crisis began last

year,  Singapore has shown that it is different from  the  other

countries.   Not  only  is  our economy  sounder,  but  the  way

Singaporeans  have responded to this crisis has  shown  that  we

understand this problem, we know where our interests lie, and we

are  quietly  working  together to tackle this  challenge.   Few

other  countries are in a position to implement a  package  like

this,  or  to  persuade  the workers to support  such  austerity

measures as being in their own long term interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign investors and analysts have noted this, as have ratings

agencies.  Standard & Poor's has just reaffirmed Singapore's AAA

rating.  Fitch IBCA has rated us AA+, just one notch below  AAA,

and  equal  to their rating for Japan.  As Fitch IBCA  commented

when  they  made  this assessment: "Singapore  stands  head  and

shoulders  above most of its East Asian neighbours.   It  has  a

well-diversified,  open  economy; a  strong  external  financial

position;  and a sound, well-regulated financial system.   Deep-rooted economic fundamentals, matched by sound economic policies

have limited the fall of the Singapore dollar and should enhance

Singapore's position as a leading regional financial centre, vis-a-vis Hong Kong and Japan."



<br><br><i>Outlook</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This package will help to make Singapore companies, and the

economy  as  a  whole, more competitive, to reduce retrenchments

and  unemployment, to attract new investments and business,  and

to lay the basis for long term prosperity.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we cannot be certain that as a result of this package,

the economy will recover quickly.  That depends on developments

in the region and the broader international economy that we can

neither predict nor control.  At present the prospects are that

Indonesia will take an extended period to stabilise and recover,

while the situation in Malaysia following their imposition of

exchange controls and the dismissal of former Deputy Prime

Minister Anwar Ibrahim has not yet clarified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is safest to assume that we will have at least one more year

of difficult conditions.  MTI has forecast growth of between -1%

and +1% for 1999.  With this package, we hope growth will be  at

the upper end of the range.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This crisis is not just an economic challenge. It is a

challenge to our social cohesion and national resilience.  Tough

times  put  our mettle to the test.  The tougher the times,  the

more   we  must  bond  together,  strengthened  by  our   shared

experience   of   adversity  and  struggle.   Whatever   happens

externally  over the next few years, we have the resources,  and

the  resilience,  to  weather the storm.  Let  us  maintain  our

cohesion  and sense of common purpose, and then we will preserve

our  high  international  standing, and  emerge  stronger,  more

competitive, and set to thrive for many more years.  [Applause.]

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Some Members may want to seek clarification

on  the  points  raised by the DPM.  Although  Members  are  not

allowed to make a speech a second time, if there is any point to

clarify, DPM is happy to take the questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I compliment the DPM

for   the   cost  reduction  package.   I  want  to   seek   one

clarification.  It appears from the Table, that  has  just  been

circulated,  that Government will incur a saving of  about  $7.5

billion  in  wage cost, and Government will forgo a  revenue  of

about  $3  billion.   If  my interpretation  of  this  Table  is

correct,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1464</b></font><br><br>



there is a net saving of $4 billion to the

Government.  There is a net saving of $7.5 billion in labour

costs to the Government.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, not all the savings

in  labour  costs accrue to the Government.  Many employers  are

not  the Government, contrary to popular perception.  And  I  do

not  think  that they are going to pay the Government what  they

save.   So  most  of  the  $7.5  billion  accrues  not  to   the

Government.  The Government will be substantially out of  pocket

as  a  result  of  this.  And I have said, we  are  expecting  a

deficit of 3% to 4% of GDP next year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> My question to the Government is that

figures  notwithstanding,  whether  the  Government  will   also

consider pump priming the economy at the moment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I would also

like to join my colleague to thank the Deputy Prime Minister for

the  excellent speech covering many points.  But I just like  to

ask  one  question.  Can he explain why is it  that  it  is  not

necessary for the Government to actually look into measures like

income tax rebate for the personal level at this point in  time,

but leave it only to the Budget debate later in March next year?

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may

I  ask  the DPM what is the rationale for not allowing reduction

of the maid levy?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, we do consider

pump-priming measures.  Our June package did include some  pump-priming measures.  They are still in effect and we will consider

whether  we need to do some more next year.  I think we have  to

consider  this carefully because pump-priming measures  are  not

the  same  as  cost-cutting measures.  They stimulate  different

parts of the economy.  We need to help the manufacturing sector,

the export services sector, maybe even the financial and banking

sector,  telecommunications, transport.  These will not directly

be  helped by pump priming.  Because if we pump prime,  most  of

the  money will go into infrastructure, that means construction,

and we cannot have the rest of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1465</b></font><br><br>



economy minus 5% and construction plus 50%, and

claim that we have a balanced economy.  We will be out of

kilter.  So we will pump prime but the projects have to be

justified.  We cannot build white elephant monuments.  We will

identify worthwhile projects which make sense for the long term.

If we have some more, they will be done in next year's budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income tax rebate, why not now? The answer is that you are

not paying tax now.  You have already paid tax for last year  in

Year  of Assessment 1998 and the tax for Year of Assessment 1999

is  not yet due.  We will announce the income tax rebate in good

time  for that purpose during the Budget because it is really  a

Budget item.  And again, it is not a cost item.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the maid levy, as Mr Rai has asked, we have promised a

full and satisfying explanation tomorrow.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> May I ask the DPM why he has

not  been generous, in terms of rebates, for the 1-, 2-  and  3-room families?  The other issue is on the prolonged unemployment

for  older workers.  Are there any contingency measures to  deal

with  the problem, particularly, those aged between 48 and below

55 years?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are rebates for

1- to 3-room families.  Firstly, because of the GST offsets, and

secondly, because of the utilities offsets.  And on the  service

and  conservancy charges and rental rebates, which  I  think  Dr

Vasoo  is specifically asking for, there is already a set, which

was announced in the last Budget, which is still running.  And I

think the next Budget will be a good time to announce an updated

set  for  next  year.   But you can be sure  that  we  have  not

neglected them because our focus should be on padding the impact

on the lower income groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should we do about prolonged unemployment, particularly,

for  the older workers?  I think NTUC has been working very hard

at  this  -  retraining them, reskilling them, also  encouraging

them  to  be  more  flexible  in their  expectations  and  their

approach, what sort of job they are looking for, where  the  job

is, what they are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1466</b></font><br><br>



expecting to be paid for it.  NTUC's experience is,

if they are willing to be flexible, the jobs are available.  The

difficulty arises when they have very specific desires and we

are unable to accommodate them.  I think that as long as there

are jobs available in the economy, we should be very slow to

think of touching the CPF or other structural measures which,

once done, cannot be undone and will change us into a different

kind of society, one heavily dependent on safety nets rather

than self-reliance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> I would like to ask

the  DPM,  with  the  reduction in the allowances  for  shopping

overseas,  how much GST does he hope to recover?   And  does  he

expect the Causeway jams to increase as a result?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I would like to seek the following

clarification  from  the  DPM.   Firstly,  I  quoted  DPM  Lee's

Parliamentary speech yesterday in my speech and I would like him

to  clarify what has happened to his assessment made in February

1998 and why, despite his assessment, he now says we need such a

deep cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second clarification is why is there a need for the

Government  to mandate the cut in wages.  I believe in  response

to  the economic situation, the workers are already taking a cut

and  every  individual company has a different profit  and  loss

situation.   Why  do  we want to set a percentage  of  reduction

across  the  board?   Why  cannot  we  leave  it  to  individual

companies to decide?  I believe they know what to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I am not very convinced about the explanation on the

percentage on the component of wages, the profit of companies as

well  as  the  Government charges, vis-a-vis GDP.   BG  Lee  has

explained  that wages are a major component.  But based  on  the

cost  of  a  company, and this was published by  the  Trade  and

Development  Board,  about 51% of the  business  cost  comprises

service  costs  as  well as indirect Government  tax.   Can  the

Government  not  help  the companies to reduce  costs  by  first

cutting the part on non-wages costs?  And then we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>



assess the situation again to see whether there is

a need for a wage cut because I think it is quite a painful

decision.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> I wish to ask the Deputy Prime

Minister  whether  he  will  consider giving  greater  financial

assistance  or rebate for workers who may take this  opportunity

to  go for further training and to improve their skills in order

to prepare them for the next upturn in the economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S.C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> I would like to ask

the  Deputy Prime Minister to clarify his point about  statutory

boards.   I  can understand why GLCs must try to make a  profit.

But  I  am  not  sure why statutory boards must be  inclined  to

generate  surpluses.   Surely, you can benchmark  them  to  best

practices rather than most profits.  Secondly, I would  like  to

ask  the Deputy Prime Minister about the performance of GLCs and

their reductions, especially those which are monopolies or quasi-monopolies, especially as regards telecommunications, water  and

electricity.  Can the Deputy Prime Minister reassure us that the

cuts  they  are agreeing to are the deepest they can cut,  given

that monopolies tend to extract excessive profits?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Lew Syn Pau asked

how much GST we will be collecting from the tighter limits.   My

answer  is,  I  really do not know.  It depends  how  much  less

frequently he shops overseas.  But I imagine it will  be  a  few

million  dollars  a year.  Will it cause a reappearance  of  the

Causeway  jam?   I hope not, because our Customs will  be  doing

their best in order to clear the cases efficiently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang has asked several very pertinent

questions.  First, what has changed since February when  I  said

our costs were in line and we did not need a wage cut, unlike in

1985.   I think the answer is, the world has changed.  The whole

situation  has  changed.  In February, we did not  see  so  many

clouds  on  the horizon.  Since February, Indonesia  has  had  a

revolution and there is still a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1468</b></font><br><br>



political transition in process and riots from time

to time, and no signs of being completed yet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Malaysia, in February, the news was that the banking system

was  sound, the companies were sound, a few needed marginal top-ups  in  capital  really as a voluntary, discretionary  gesture.

But  there  was no basic problem and the whole system  had  been

stress-tested and it was all right.  But, today, in Malaysia, it

is   in   a   different  situation.   They  have  Danamodal   to

recapitalise  the banks.  They have Danaharta to take  over  the

bad loans and they are looking for large amounts of money to  be

raised  overseas.   They  have imposed exchange  controls.   The

Deputy  Prime Minister, who was also Finance Minister, has  been

dismissed  and arrested, and the situation is quite a  lot  more

complicated than it used to be.  We did not foresee all this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a broader landscape what used to be an Asian problem and

was  still  an  Asian  problem in February, became  an  emerging

markets  problem.  In August, Russia defaulted and a chill  went

through financial markets.  Dow Jones dropped drastically.  Then

people  focused  attention  on Brazil  and  countries  have  now

scrambled  and cobbled together a $41 billion package to  rescue

Brazil.   Brazil  has  promised on  oath  to  adhere  to  fiscal

austerity and not to spend money which they have not earned  and

to  bring  their budget in balance.  Even then, people  are  not

sure  whether  this  is  going to solve the  Brazilian  problem.

Because  if the Brazilian problem does not get solved, then  the

impact on Europe and America will be very substantial.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In America, and around the world, as a result of this,

there  has been a tremendous shrinking back of investors.   They

call  it flight to quality, that means they only want to  invest

their  money in the very safest and most liquid assets  like  US

treasury  bills  and  even then, the most  current  US  treasury

bills,  and away from emerging markets.  So the emerging markets

spread  has  gone up.  If a developing country wants  to  borrow

money,  it  is T+.  At one stage, it was T+15%.  "T"  means  the

treasury bills interest rate, plus



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1469</b></font><br><br>



15 percentage points.  That means it may cost you

20% to borrow.  It is even more than sepuluh dua.  So now, it is

T+9.  But there is a tremendous shrinking back of willingness to

venture for funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole landscape has changed. We are an emerging market

trying  to  persuade investors that we are different from  other

emerging markets, and that is why we must have one package,  not

little  items, non-wage components first, let us give it a  try,

does  not work, another little bit of component.  We have  taken

some time to sit together, assemble our ammunition and one bang.

And  now we will have to see how the medicine works.  You cannot

do  these things by little trickles here and there, and hope  by

fine-tuning  to  avoid hard decisions, that is disastrous.   The

Japanese  have  tried that.  Little bangs every now  and  again.

They  have had seven or eight fiscal stimulation packages.  They

just  had another big one, and the Nikkei dropped because people

have  lost confidence in the Japanese government.  The  Japanese

people have lost confidence in their own government.  So  if  we

are  going to have a decisive measure, let us decide what  needs

to be done, and do it.  And that is what we have done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why the Government needs to mandate the cut in wages, that

is  also  a good question from Mr Low.  For many years  now,  we

have  moved away from that in the NWC recommendations and  given

qualitative  recommendations.  In other words, we just  make  an

assessment of the situation, give a sense of how tight or  slack

the  market is, but leave maximum room for companies to  discuss

and  to  settle on their own without constraining  them  with  a

guideline.  But this is the first time the NWC has to  come  out

with the recommendation to tighten wages rather than to increase

wages.   We  are  working this because of our flexi-wage  scheme

which we have operated since the last recession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you sure that if we left it to companies and unions to say,

"Please  do your best and if need be, cut wages." they  will  be

able  to resolve the matter quickly and expeditiously?  I doubt.

Because every union leader will feel under pressure from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1470</b></font><br><br>



his members to do the best he can for them at the

negotiating table.  If we have this NWC guideline, it does not

constrain the company to have to go between 5% and 8%.  But it

sets expectations and therefore I think makes it easier for the

two sides to converge on a solution which would take into

account the conditions in the company.  Some will be making

money and want to have bigger bonuses.  Some already have got

formulas by which bonuses go up and down with business and they

should stick to those formulas.  Some may be making greater

losses than this and may need to make even deeper cuts.  Those

flexibilities, we allow.  But I think it is useful to set a

clear signal nationally that this is a general direction, and

around that thrust, we allow some freedom of manoeuvre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann asked about rebates for worker training. I

think there is a recommendation in the CSC Report for Skillsave.

It  is one of the recommendations which we will be studying.  It

is  an  area  which we are sympathetic to.  The problem  is  not

finding  the money really.  The problem is making sure that  the

projects  are  viable and effective.  And we have already  given

$100  million this year for the Skills Redevelopment  Programme.

If that is not sufficient, we will look for more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked about statutory boards and whether they need

to  make  profits.  The answer is, it depends on which statutory

boards.   A statutory board fulfilling an economic function  has

to  function on economic principles.  JTC cannot give  its  land

away for free because there is a value to the land and it has to

price  the  land properly, not just to protect the reserves  and

satisfy  the Elected President, but because if you misprice  the

land, you will have misallocation of resources and all sorts  of

industries built here which should not be here.  Other statutory

boards  like  EDB  and NPB, of course you will have  to  develop

other  measures.  Because if EDB decides to make money, we  will

get no investments.  It is a cost centre.  NPB should break even

because  we  want to know that the training skills and  projects

they are doing are viable, and there is a demand for it.  It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>



varies from company to company and statutory board

to statutory board.  But I think where there is an economic

function, then we must take that into account.  It is not just

an arbitrary matter of dividing numbers by two.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for monopoly of GLCs, he mentioned telecommunications,

water and electricity.  Are we sure that it has gone far enough?

We  have  to separate them into different categories.  Water  is

not  a  matter of reducing prices in order to match  costs.   In

fact, we are raising water rates.  We did this year, and we will

do  it again next year.  It is for strategic reasons, and we are

not   going   to  change  that  because  we  have  to  encourage

Singaporeans to conserve water and to realise that the  cost  of

that  incremental drop of water is not just collecting  it  from

the  sky.  We have already collected all we can.  But distilling

it that is very expensive.  Water is a different matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for electricity, it is not yet a competitive market but

it  will be a competitive market with Tuas Power coming on-line.

But,  already, even within Singapore Power, there is competition

between  Seraya and Senoko because we set up two companies  with

non-overlapping  boards  and  independent  directors,  and  they

compete against each other.  If you look at electricity tariffs,

the  cost  of  electricity now varies by about a factor  of  two

between the day time and night time.  For some of that,  we  are

going  to  reflect  to  consumers in this package  so  that  the

consumers  will  have  the  right  incentives  to  operate,  for

example, three shifts, do more at night, and pay electricity  at

a lower price.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for telecommunications, it is still a monopoly, but the

monopoly is running out because we have decided that come  April

2000,  a  second  operator is going to provide  basic  telephony

services,  fixed  line  including  IDD,  and  that  prospect  of

competition is a strong reason why Telecom is now bringing their

prices  down.  There is some further distance to go compared  to

what   prices   will   prevail  in  a   completely   competitive

telecommunications market.  We have to respect



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1472</b></font><br><br>



Telecom's monopoly until April 2000 because this

was the undertaking we gave when we corportised and privatised

the company and we have to honour and live up to our bargain

with the Telecom shareholders, which include people other than

the Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Further clarification, Sir. I now

understand that the Government has failed to foresee  the  rapid

development  in  this economic crisis.  But  I  understand  that

recently,   there   were   some   favourable   assessments    by

international agencies that economic conditions may  improve  in

1999.   I  do not know whether the Government has foreseen  this

happening   before   deciding  on  the  package   presented   in

Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second clarification is that with the current package, are

we  confident  that we will garner the necessary foreign  direct

investment  (FDI)  into  Singapore as targeted.   The  DPM  also

mentioned why we cannot leave the companies alone to do the cost-cutting  measures and wage reduction.  I thought  we  wanted  to

project our workforce to the world as well as to investors.   If

our  workforce  is rational, they will respond  to  our  current

economic situation and be prepared for the wage cuts proposed by

companies which are not making money or in the red, rather  than

losing  their  jobs.  I thought NTUC has been very  powerful  in

garnering the support of the workers to respond to the  economic

environment. So I am quite surprised that DPM says that  it  may

be  difficult to do if we leave it to the companies to negotiate

the wage cuts.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we failed to foresee

what  happened in the last six months.  I fear that Mr Low  Thia

Khiang probably also failed to foresee that.  Nobody expected it

to  happen and in fact it is impossible to know, not because you

cannot  make the calculations, but because they depend on  human

decisions of leaders, investors, populations, and that cannot be

computed.   Similarly, they ask me whether  next  year  will  be

better.   Some  analysts think so.  Maybe  if  we  just  project

economic  charts it looks like that.  But can you tell  how  the

political situation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>



will develop?  What new turns of the kaleidoscope

may happen?  What totally new landscapes may emerge?  Nobody can

tell.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were reluctant to move earlier because the situation had not

yet  worsened  and I think if we had made such a package  before

the  situation had worsened, it might have shaken confidence and

been  not very well accepted by the public.  Because they  would

have  said, "Why?"  I am sure that Mr Low would be the first  to

stand  up to say, "Why?  The situation is not so grave.   We  do

not  need to do this yet.  Keep it till later on."  We  have  to

make  a judgment.  We made this move.  If next year, things turn

favourable,  well,  that  is good.  We  can  adjust  our  policy

thereafter.  But if we do not make this adjustment and next year

things do not turn out good, then it may be too late for  us  to

take the steps by next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we confident of getting the FDI? I think the numbers

will  go down this year.  But if this package gets clear support

from the population and from political leaders and MPs, then  it

will be a very strong selling point when EDB knocks on doors and

tell people, "Look, I am able to do this.  Other people cannot."

We  can encourage workers to accept a wage reduction.  Can other

countries  do that?  Even in the freest economies in the  world,

economists  will tell you that wages are sticky  downwards,  ie,

when  things are good, they go up and when things are bad,  they

are  very slow to come down.  That is the way human beings  are.

We  have  to accept that and we have to find a way to  encourage

Singaporeans,  to nudge them into a direction  which  they  will

eventually do on their own, but which may take longer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On their own, yes, they will take wage cuts if the company

is  about  to go bust. But what we are trying to achieve  is  an

across-the-board  general shift in their wage level,  not  every

company, but a general shift, and even companies which  are  not

yet  on the verge of disaster, we are saying, "Better  make this

adjustment now.  I am already cutting CPF for everybody.  And  I

think  it  is  wise,  if  you  are not performing  exceptionally

brilliantly, to be cautious and also to make some adjustment  on

your bonuses.  After all,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1474</b></font><br><br>



that is what they were built up for."  If next

year, things are better, well, good for you.  Certainly, if

there is no need for companies to cut bonuses, there is no need

to touch reserves.  But the same Member has been asking us why

do we not touch reserves earlier.  I think he may want to re-examine his position.

<br><br><!-- Encik Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Harun bin A. Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> I would appreciate it

very  much if DPM could include the reduction of education  fees

especially  for higher learning institutes.  So far, the  Report

does not mention it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> From the package of

measures  that  DPM has announced, it is not so obvious  whether

all  the Government charges, levies and taxes that we have  been

talking   about,   including  rentals,  telecommunications   and

utilities, have they all come down to the 1994 levels, as we are

targeting  the  wages to come down.  Secondly, on property  tax,

the 55% tax rebate is of course welcomed.  But is anything going

to  be  done  to  speed up the re-assessment of property  values

because the net effect of that 55% and the failure to assess the

recent  property values, which have gone down  by  40%  to  50%,

negate the impact of that 55% rebate. Thirdly,  I would like  to

ask  whether  for  tenants of JTC and HDB industrial  land,  for

those  who are paying rentals slightly below the posted  values,

would they also see some reduction in rentals?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The question on whether the rates are

back  at the 1994 levels, the answer is that it varies.  In  the

case of industrial land, which is probably the most important of

them,   they   will   be   back   there.    In   the   case   of

telecommunications charges, it is not only at  1994  levels  but

considerably below that because in the last few years, in  fact,

telecommunications charges have been coming down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reassessment of property tax is in progress and I know

people have been receiving property tax reassessment notices and

for once, the figures have become smaller rather than larger.  I

am  not sure whether this is good news, generally, but those who

have received them have welcomed them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For JTC and HDB tenants who are paying below the posted prices,

as  I  said, they will have certain rebates given to them  which

will hold until December 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Harun Ghani asked about higher learning institutions. I will

have  to ask the Minister for Education to look into this.  What

he told me is that generally he thinks that the fees do not need

adjustment, except for one or two specific areas where there are

problems.  But he will look into the matter.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Further clarification, Sir. In view

of  the  current  situation where there are  more  people  being

retrenched, what is the view of DPM Lee on the need to set up  a

fund  to help those who are sole breadwinners of the family  who

have  been  retrenched.   Secondly,  he  has  announced  certain

percentage  cut  on  the salaries of top civil  servants.   What

would  be  the estimated percentage cut that would be applicable

to Ministers and MPs?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> As I have explained, the way to help

the retrenched people is to help them find a new job and if,  in

fact,  despite  all their efforts, they have not  been  able  to

find  new jobs, there are a variety of people they can  turn  to

for  help, including the CDCs, unions, and the MPs who would put

them in touch with the right agencies.  If MPs have any specific

problems,  they  should  get  in  touch  with  the  Ministry  of

Community  Development  or the Ministry of  Manpower,  and  they

would be able to assist.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the cut of Ministers and MPs? As I have explained,

they will follow the same as the civil servants.  For Ministers,

their  cut is 10% per year in the annual wage bill and for  MPs,

probably something less than that.  For the rank and file  civil

servants  (Divisions III, IV and DREs) it is 5% of total  annual

wages.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Does DPM Lee think it is sufficient to

project political leadership by just taking a 10% cut?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1476</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, nothing

will be sufficient to persuade Mr Low Thia Khiang that it is

sufficient.  So from that starting point, we have to judge what

is the right number which makes sense and allows us to fulfill

the principle of the NWC, which is, the higher levels, will have

a deeper cut than the working rank and file, and also to

maintain the principle that we really pay people for their job.

And we have set Ministers' salaries and civil servants' salaries

at levels which we think are sensible and justifiable and are

right to get the sort of people we want for the jobs which we

are looking to fill.  And especially at times like this, I think

we would be looking for good Ministers rather than cheap

Ministers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, it is quite strange that Mr Low

Thia  Khiang  has  made the accusation that the  Government  has

failed  to foresee these economic difficulties.  I am  not  sure

whether  he  heard his Secretary-General, Mr Jeyaretnam,  a  few

hours  ago in this House relating a story about a banker  friend

of  his who told him that way back in 1996, he already knew that

we  would  face  this problem.  Had Mr Low been informed  by  Mr

Jeyaretnam about that story he heard from his banker friend  and

raised  it  in  this  House,  then  today  he  would  have  been

proclaimed  a  prophet.   Unfortunately, his  Secretary-General,

when  he  first stepped into this House in 1997,  also  did  not

raise  this  subject of his conversation with his banker  friend

and  thereby  depriving  him  of the  opportunity  of  making  a

political  point against this Government for failing to  foresee

this serious crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think Members, having heard 13 MPs who have spoken today

and  the  statement  by the DPM and all the clarifications  that

have  been  asked this evening, would think that  it  is  enough

already for the day.  So we will call it a day.
